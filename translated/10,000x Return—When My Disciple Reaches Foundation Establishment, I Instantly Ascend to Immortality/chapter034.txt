Chapter 34: Accidentally Killed a Passerby

She looked.

Sure enough, a blush crept across Leng Ning's face.

Seeing Qingniao lean in to look, Leng Ning glared at her coyly and scolded, "How dare you tease your senior sister! I'll beat you, you little brat!"

"Oh come on, how is that teasing!" Qingniao said, exasperated. "Your face was clearly red just now. If you like him, just admit it. What's there to deny? Besides, Senior Zhong Qing is so exceptional."

"Yes, Senior Zhong Qing is truly exceptional..." Leng Ning suddenly sighed.

"So even if I did like him, what use would it be? Our status might be respectable in Myriad Dao Mountain, and even in the Eastern Region, others might call us geniuses. But in Senior's eyes, even Myriad Dao Mountain barely registers."

"In the end, we're simply not from the same world!"

With that, Leng Ning shook her head, melancholy in her eyes.

Qingniao pouted and, unusually, didn't argue back. She clearly felt the same way.

Just then, Leng Ning looked at the mountain range ahead and said, "Junior Sister, there might be quite a few demon beasts lurking in those mountains. Just to be safe, let's find a place to rest for a bit and recover before continuing."

"Alright."

Qingniao nodded.

The two women descended onto a mountain peak and sat down cross-legged.

Looking at the vast mountain range in the distance, the scenery was breathtaking.

The two women first took recovery pills, and after briefly meditating to restore themselves, Qingniao couldn't help but take out her wooden figurine and examine it.

"Sister, you have to admit, the craftsmanship on the figurine Senior Zhong gave us is quite good. It looks so lifelike."

"Indeed. The features are distinct, and the proportions are perfect."

Leng Ning also couldn't resist taking out her figurine for a closer look. She even tied a red string around its leg so she could hang it from her waist.

However.

Just as the two women were examining their figurines during their brief rest.

Not far away in mid-air, a pair of crimson eyes watched them with amusement.

"Myriad Dao Mountain attire."

"I never expected to encounter Myriad Dao Mountain people in such a remote backwater."

"It seems even heaven is helping me take revenge on that accursed Myriad Dao Mountain. I developed the Blood Sacrifice Formation that could have dominated the world for them, and instead of gratitude, they actually dared to hunt me down and made me suffer a fate worse than death in that damned Sea of Degradation."

"Originally, I was going to directly attack Myriad Dao Mountain in seven days and slaughter everyone there. But since I've run into these two first, I might as well take care of them."

"And judging by these two women's cultivation, their status probably isn't low. They're likely some elders' precious disciples. Killing them might make those damned old fools suffer a bit more."

With that, the ghastly pale, somewhat demonic face revealed a sinister expression. He licked his lips and descended from the sky, reaching toward the two women.

Against this level of sudden attack.

The two women detected nothing at all. They were still playing with their figurines.

However.

At that moment, the figurine in Qingniao's hand suddenly burst with dazzling light, like a small brilliant sun atop the mountain peak.

"Ah! What's happening?"

Qingniao was suddenly startled by the figurine in her hand.

Leng Ning beside her was equally stunned. Her figurine had also flickered briefly, but the light faded when Qingniao's figurine lit up.

Could these figurines be more than ordinary figurines?

While the two women were puzzled, the brilliantly glowing figurine in Qingniao's hand suddenly released a dazzling light wave from its body, shooting toward the mid-air not far away.

In mid-air.

The attacking Heavenly Calamity naturally noticed the brilliant light erupting from beside the two women, so bright it made him squint.

"What kind of treasure is this?"

"Have they detected me?"

"But no matter. Before absolute strength, all other tricks are just flashy nonsense."

Heavenly Calamity sneered disdainfully.

Until that light wave struck him—then his expression changed dramatically.

Because the light wave was too fast. Too fast for him to dodge.

When he looked down, he discovered his chest had been pierced through, leaving a bowl-sized hole.

Intense pain spread through his body. Heavenly Calamity reflexively screamed in agony.

"Ahhh!"

The scream echoed through the forest. Heavenly Calamity's eyes bulged in disbelief as he fell from mid-air like a bird with broken wings, crashing into the forest below.

The two women were still staring blankly at the transformed figurine when they heard a scream from the sky not far away.

"Oops, I accidentally killed someone."

Qingniao immediately panicked. For a moment, she held the figurine, not knowing what to do.

The figurine had returned to its original state after releasing that shockwave, though if you looked closely, its texture wasn't quite as refined as before.

"Quick, let's go see."

Leng Ning also frowned and led Qingniao toward where the person had fallen.

Soon, the two found the victim.

At that moment, several low-level demon wolves were gathered around the body, sniffing with their noses, apparently about to enjoy this heaven-sent meal.

"Get lost."

Leng Ning shouted, scattering the wolves, then approached the body to check for signs of life.

"He's gone." Leng Ning said, frowning.

"What do we do now, Sister?"

Qingniao stood frozen in place, utterly lost. Her face was full of remorse as she said, "Sister, I really didn't mean to! I don't know what I touched, but the figurine just started glowing and attacked the sky."

"I know you didn't mean to." Leng Ning took a deep breath.

She naturally realized that what Zhong Qing had given them wasn't just ordinary figurines—they were super treasures capable of releasing incredibly powerful attacks.

They just didn't quite know how to use them yet.

And had accidentally killed a passerby.

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Brother, I really didn't mean it. Please don't die with your eyes open. I really didn't mean it."

Seeing the corpse's eyes still staring, Qingniao stood nearby with her hands pressed together, constantly apologizing, hopping anxiously from foot to foot.

"Sister, what do we do?" Qingniao looked at Leng Ning, speaking urgently.

Leng Ning pressed her hand to her forehead.

She was honestly speechless.

In her view, this guy's luck was truly awful. This bizarre death was even more outrageous than an ordinary person walking down the street and being killed by a falling meteorite.

Actually, the two women could have simply destroyed the body and left.

After all, no one had seen them in this forest.

But the two women were still young and inexperienced, and their consciences wouldn't allow it.

Moreover, according to the cultivation path of Myriad Dao Mountain, such matters carried karmic implications.

After pondering for a long while, Leng Ning finally said, "What's done is done. We can't bring him back to life. But perhaps we can identify who he is, find his family, and apologize and compensate them in person."

"But how do we identify him?" Qingniao asked. "The clothes he's wearing aren't from any sect—there's no identifying marks."

Hearing this, Leng Ning hesitated briefly before saying, "Then we'll have to bring his body back to Myriad Dao Mountain first. Afterward, we can use Myriad Dao Mountain's resources to investigate his identity."
