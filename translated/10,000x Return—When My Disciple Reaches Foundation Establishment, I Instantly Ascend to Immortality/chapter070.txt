Chapter 70: What? Got a Problem?

In an instant, the Grand Elder—who had just been arrogant and overbearing—went pale.

His face flushed red with alarm.

"Your strength...?"

He never could have imagined.

That Zhong Qing's strength would be so terrifying.

Just as his momentum had peaked, Zhong Qing struck instantly. Before he could even react, he was already subdued.

"Bold villain! How dare you threaten the Grand Elder—you're seeking death!"

The sudden turn of events had happened so fast.

By the time they reacted, the Grand Elder had already been captured by Zhong Qing.

A group of high-ranking members attacked simultaneously.

Zhong Qing's gaze shifted to Flying Saber Sect's Sect Master.

He saw the man's expression was displeased, yet he didn't intervene.

With a cold laugh in his heart, Zhong Qing now had a clear understanding of what Flying Saber Sect truly was.

How noble his words had sounded at first.

Claiming that if the fault lay with Flying Saber Sect, he would give a satisfactory answer.

But what was the result?

When it involved the sect's Grand Elder, he played deaf and mute, as if everything he'd said before was nothing but hot air.

Indeed, strength was the foundation of everything.

These people in power—their hearts were all rotten.

Expecting them to keep their word was less realistic than expecting pigs to climb trees.

Fortunately, Zhong Qing never placed his hopes in others.

He preferred to seek justice in his own way.

"Boom, rumble..."

Thunder roared through the void.

Boundless killing intent descended.

At least a dozen Flying Saber Sect elders attacked together.

They held nothing back, using full force.

The terrifying might shook the void.

With so many experts striking together, they were confident they could shatter even a mountain.

Yet Zhong Qing pressed down with one hand!

Like the hand of a god, it instantly nullified all those attacks.

Sent over a dozen figures flying.

"Pfft..."

Sprays of fresh blood spurted out, staining the sky red—shocking and gruesome to behold.

"How... is this possible!"

In an instant, countless scalps went numb. Their understanding of Zhong Qing's power reached a new level.

They had known Zhong Qing was extraordinary.

To bypass Flying Saber Sect's formation and stride directly into the main hall.

Yet they never imagined he would be this extraordinary.

With just one move—one move to defeat over a dozen Flying Saber Sect elders.

These people were either high elders or Peak Masters.

Any single one of them, taken elsewhere, was an existence who could dominate an entire region.

Yet before Zhong Qing, they had been defeated so cleanly.

Without even a chance to fight back.

The Grand Elder's brow throbbed, his heart seized as if by an invisible giant hand.

His entire body had gone rigid.

Zhong Qing held the Grand Elder by the neck with one hand, his gaze sweeping across the assembly.

"Now I'm going to seek justice for my disciple."

"Who agrees? Who objects!"

One sentence. The voice wasn't loud, yet it boomed like thunder in everyone's hearts.

The elders were furious and aggrieved beyond measure.

The Grand Elder might have a thousand wrongs, ten thousand mistakes, but he was still their Flying Saber Sect elder.

He was the face of their Flying Saber Sect.

Yet Zhong Qing's posture now.

Was undoubtedly slapping the entire sect's face with a resounding smack.

When had Flying Saber Sect ever suffered such humiliation?

Yet despite this, no one dared step forward to object.

The strength Zhong Qing had displayed was enough to crush all dissent.

For a moment, the scene fell into an eerie silence.

Just then.

Zhong Qing's gaze locked onto a certain point in the void.

"You've been hiding long enough. Aren't you going to come out and meet?"

The next moment, the void trembled, and a figure stepped out.

This person was none other than Flying Saber Sect's founding ancestor—Baili Changkong!

Speaking of Baili Changkong, this was absolutely a legendary figure.

He had risen from obscurity, establishing a power from nothing.

Under his leadership, Flying Saber Sect had rapidly grown and strengthened.

From a bottom-tier sect, it had upgraded repeatedly to enter the first-rate ranks!

He had created numerous legends and left behind many tales.

Several hundred years ago, his strength had already reached the peak of Moon Profound.

Then he had entered a life-or-death seclusion.

Vowing not to emerge until he reached Sun Profound.

Now that the Old Ancestor had appeared—didn't that mean their Old Ancestor had successfully become a Sun Profound powerhouse!

Sun Profound—even in the entire Eastern Region, this was considered a top-tier powerhouse.

The Sect Masters of the Holy Lands, said to be the Eastern Region's supreme powers, were merely at peak Sun Profound.

If their Old Ancestor had become a Sun Profound powerhouse, didn't that mean...

The Grand Elder was saved!

The humiliation of Flying Saber Sect being invaded could be cleansed!

"Old Ancestor!"

The high-ranking members bowed deeply to Baili Changkong.

The tension in their hearts eased somewhat.

The Grand Elder especially was wild with joy.

The Old Ancestor had come—he was saved.

"Old Ancestor, this person is arrogant and overbearing. He trespassed into our Flying Saber Sect at night, violently wounded our elders, and now threatens the Grand Elder."

"We beseech the Old Ancestor to act, suppress this villain, and restore our Flying Saber Sect's might!"

As one elder spoke up.

The Flying Saber Sect elders all pleaded for Baili Changkong to intervene.

"Silence!"

Yet Baili Changkong's attitude completely exceeded their expectations.

He addressed Zhong Qing respectfully: "Senior, as they say, spare others when you can. Might you give this old man some face and let this matter rest? Spare the Grand Elder this once."

Zhong Qing laughed!

"What kind of thing are you?"

"You think you deserve face from me?"

These words made Baili Changkong's expression turn ugly instantly.

What was his status?

As Flying Saber Sect's Old Ancestor, his position was lofty. Wherever he went, he was respected by all, revered by tens of thousands.

Now, to be humiliated like this.

At this moment, Zhong Qing released his pressure.

Terrifying might like heavenly wrath, like divine fury.

It pressed down on Flying Saber Sect's Old Ancestor until his face changed dramatically, his scalp going numb.

"What? Got a problem?"

Zhong Qing spoke.

Flying Saber Sect's Old Ancestor's lips moved, but he didn't dare say anything more!

This scene left all the Flying Saber Sect elders present collectively speechless.

Baili Changkong was their sect's pillar, their anchor.

Yet now, even such an existence didn't dare go head-to-head with Zhong Qing—didn't even dare make a move.

Just how terrifyingly formidable had this person reached?

What they could figure out, the Grand Elder as the person involved naturally could too.

The Old Ancestor's attitude plunged him into an icy abyss.

Immense terror rose in his heart.
