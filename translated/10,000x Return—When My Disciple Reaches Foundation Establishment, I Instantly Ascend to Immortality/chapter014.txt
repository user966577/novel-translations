Chapter 14: The Second Disciple

Su Wenjiu left Mufu Peak.

She flew back toward Dawn Mist Valley.

Soaring through the sky, watching Xianjiang Sect grow smaller below her, her heart refused to settle.

Who could have imagined that such a tiny sect harbored such a supreme being?

She'd grown up surrounded by accolades, rather full of herself.

But this journey had finally taught her what it meant to face someone beyond her—that there was always a higher mountain. Her small achievements meant nothing before a truly powerful being.

Setting aside Zhong Qing himself, Lin Feng's cultivation speed alone was something she could never hope to match.

When she returned, she would definitely warn her sect: no one from Xianjiang Sect must ever be offended!

Days passed into nights.

In barely half a month, the earth began to warm. Temperatures rose.

Sunlight bathed the land as grass pushed through the soil. The season of renewal would soon arrive.

Zhong Qing lay on his lounger in white robes, sensing his own cultivation.

「Host: Zhong Qing」

「Cultivation: Moon Profound Realm」

「Disciple: Lin Feng. Peak Xiantian cultivation. 100x bonus active.」

「Active Bonds: Trash Bond 1/2」

「Physiques Obtained: None」

「Special Abilities: Low-Profile Aura, Heavenly Eye」

Ever since taking Lin Feng and activating the 1,000x feedback, just one month had been enough for Zhong Qing to break through from Star Profound to Moon Profound Realm.

If word of this speed got out, countless people would die of envy.

Take Su Wenjiu, for example. Yes, she'd also reached Moon Profound, but she'd been building her foundation since she could barely walk, with Dawn Mist Valley pouring resources into her cultivation for years.

Compared to that, Zhong Qing's advancement was effortless.

Lin Feng had also reached peak Xiantian, just one step away from Dawn Profound Realm. Once he crossed that threshold, he'd truly enter the ranks of experts.

"The speed is fast, but I still need to find a second trash disciple as soon as possible."

Zhong Qing murmured to himself.

After all, the difference between Trash Bond 1/2 and 2/2 was the difference between 1,000x and 10,000x returns!

But Zhong Qing had done his research recently.

The system's requirements for "trash" were extremely strict.

It had to be someone whose body couldn't even absorb spiritual energy.

In a world of cultivation, finding such a person was arguably harder than finding a purple talent.

Because even ordinary mortals who sat cross-legged and pretended to absorb spiritual energy would eventually take in some trace amounts, at least enough to strengthen their bodies.

Otherwise, Zhong Qing would have already grabbed some random person off the street to fill the quota.

But perhaps the system had heard his plea.

The long-silent voice finally spoke.

「Ding. Disciple candidate detected. Host should proceed to recruit immediately.」

"Oh?"

Zhong Qing's eyes lit up as he sat upright.

「Please proceed immediately to Tianyue City. The candidate is currently within.」

As the system spoke, it provided him with a sense of direction.

"Tianyue City, then."

Zhong Qing packed quickly and set off, eager for the 10,000x feedback from a second disciple.

At Moon Profound cultivation, he could travel thousands of miles in a single day.

Tianyue City was only about 250 miles from Xianjiang Sect. Before long, he arrived.

The city bustled with activity, crowds flowing through the streets—a picture of prosperity.

Though it was a mortal city, several nearby sects sourced their supplies here, Xianjiang Sect included. Cultivators could be spotted everywhere.

Following the system's guidance, Zhong Qing headed toward Tianyue Plaza at the city's center.

When he arrived, he found it already packed with people.

At the center sat several elderly figures, with disciples in matching sect uniforms standing behind them.

Below them stood talent-testing stones, with many people queuing up to be tested.

The scene was nearly identical to Xianjiang Sect's recruitment ceremony.

From the crowd's chatter, Zhong Qing pieced together the situation. The Flying Dagger Sect needed to replenish their outer disciples and was holding an open recruitment here in Tianyue Plaza.

Flying Dagger Sect was considered a first-rate sect in the Eastern Region—even Xianjiang Sect couldn't compare.

For ordinary people, this was a rare opportunity.

But the event was already winding down.

"Congratulations to all disciples who tested white talent or above. You may board the Flying Dagger Sect's flying vessel and officially become outer disciples."

An elder's resonant voice carried from the platform.

Those who'd passed beamed with joy.

Far more hung their heads in disappointment.

None of this interested Zhong Qing. He scanned the dense crowd, searching for his precious future disciple.

Just then, from among the rejected candidates, a filthy little boy approached the platform and bowed to the elder.

"What's a reject doing up here?" A Flying Dagger disciple moved to chase him away.

Seeing this, the boy quickly produced a token from his ragged clothes.

"Senior, I have a Flying Dagger Token. Can this allow me to become a Flying Dagger Sect disciple?"

"A Flying Dagger Token?"

The elder on the platform looked surprised.

The Flying Dagger Sect did indeed have such tokens. Possessing one guaranteed unconditional admission.

After examining the token and confirming its authenticity, the elder looked down at the boy. "Where did you get this?"

"Reporting to the Elder: five years ago, a Flying Dagger Sect elder was being hunted and badly wounded. He gave this token to my parents in exchange for them saving his life, promising that it would guarantee admission to the sect."

"However, to prevent his location from being exposed, my parents were killed by his pursuers. Before my father died, he gave me this token."

The boy spoke earnestly. When he mentioned his parents' deaths, tears welled in his eyes.

The elder had already determined the story was true.

Five years ago, something like that had indeed happened. Their Grand Elder had been hunted by enemies and, badly wounded, had lost most of his cultivation. A mortal family had saved him.

But his face remained expressionless.

Looking at the filthy little boy, there was even a hint of disdain.

After a long pause, he crushed the token to dust, then waved dismissively. "You can be a menial laborer. After joining, you'll work the mines."

"A menial laborer..."

"Well, at least I'll be able to eat my fill."

The boy showed contentment, then quickly bowed. "Thank you, Elder."

"This..."

Zhong Qing had finally located his future disciple—none other than this little boy.

He hadn't expected that before he could make a move, the boy had already joined Flying Dagger Sect.

He also hadn't expected his future disciple to have such a tragic backstory.

And Flying Dagger Sect's treatment disgusted him.

True, the boy had no talent. But that elder had been a core member of the sect. The boy's parents had sacrificed their lives to save him. Even if the sect couldn't give the boy premium treatment, they didn't have to send him to the mines.

An idle position that kept the child fed would have cost Flying Dagger Sect virtually nothing.

But fortunately, the boy was about to become his disciple.
