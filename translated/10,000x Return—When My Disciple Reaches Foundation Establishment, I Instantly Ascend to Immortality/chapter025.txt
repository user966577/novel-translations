Chapter 25: The Lin Family's Pride

In that moment.

These family heads lowered their stances as much as humanly possible, each wearing an eager, ingratiating smile.

"This..."

Lin Hanyi looked at this group of people in disbelief. They were really lowering themselves this much.

"Father, don't worry about them." At this point, Lin Feng spoke up.

The perceptive Lin Hanyi seemed to sense something. He asked quietly, "Feng'er, do you know what's going on with them? Why did they suddenly come to apologize and fawn over us like this?"

"If I'm not mistaken, it should be because Uncle Heibai released his aura earlier."

Lin Feng smiled.

He then recounted everything that had happened at the tavern to Lin Hanyi.

Lin Hanyi and the Lin family elders were so shocked they rose from their seats.

Their voices became stuttering.

"M-Moon Profound... This Sir Heibai is at Moon Profound!!!"

In an instant, everyone in the Lin family turned their gazes toward Heibai.

They had never imagined that this servant who followed behind Zhong Qing without saying a word, looking utterly ordinary, was actually at Moon Profound.

And if even the servant was at Moon Profound, what level was Lin Feng's master at?!

The Lin family members could hardly believe it. They felt as though they'd been enveloped by an enormous, heaven-sent blessing.

Their Lin family's young man—the one everyone said had no talent—had actually found such a powerful master. Before, they wouldn't have dared dream of such a thing.

At the same time.

Lin Hanyi and the others finally understood why families like the Gu and Fang had suddenly done a complete 180.

With Lin Feng apprenticing himself to such a senior master, the Lin family would naturally benefit. These families naturally wouldn't dare offend them anymore.

"Senior Zhong, we apologize for any neglect."

Lin Hanyi hurriedly led everyone in another bow to Zhong Qing, their expressions full of panic. Having such a great master visit their Lin family made them feel incredibly honored, yet fearful of giving offense.

"Father, you don't need to be so nervous just because you learned of Master's strength. My master is very easygoing." Lin Feng quickly said with a smile.

"Indeed, please make yourselves comfortable."

From the seat of honor, Zhong Qing sipped the tea a servant had brought him and smiled warmly.

"Of course, of course. That Senior could see fit to take our foolish son as a disciple is a blessing my son earned in a past life." Lin Hanyi said excitedly, his eyes reddening as he spoke.

His son had endured so much hardship in his life.

Now fortune had finally smiled upon him.

Soon, the Lin family held a grand banquet for Zhong Qing. Everyone of any importance in the family was summoned.

At the banquet, Zhong Qing was naturally seated in the place of highest honor.

Anyone who was qualified came forward under Lin Hanyi's lead to toast Zhong Qing with the utmost respect.

It had been decades.

Lin Hanyi hadn't been this excited in decades.

Before long, he'd had a bit too much to drink. He couldn't help but sidle over to his son and whisper, "Son, after you took a master, Senior Zhong must have fixed your talent problem, right?"

"Of course." Lin Feng smiled.

Hearing the confirmation, Lin Hanyi's pupils contracted. He grabbed Lin Feng and exclaimed, "You mean you can cultivate now?"

Lin Hanyi's exclamation drew the attention of the rest of the Lin family, who all turned their expectant gazes toward them.

"With my master's guidance, I can do more than just cultivate." Lin Feng smiled proudly, and with a thought, released his Dawn Profound cultivation.

"What?"

"Dawn Profound?!!"

This sight.

Shocked the entire room. Everyone stared at Lin Feng with wide, disbelieving eyes.

"Heaven blesses our Lin family!"

Soon.

Lin Feng was surrounded by the Lin family members. Every face wore an adoring smile, and words of praise showered upon Lin Feng without restraint. They were so proud of him.

After all, Lin Feng was only sixteen.

A sixteen-year-old at Dawn Profound would be considered a peerless genius anywhere.

"To hell with the Murong family! So they have a daughter, big deal. Your daughter's impressive? My son is even more impressive!"

Lin Hanyi let out a great curse, then burst into hearty laughter on the spot.

"Really, it's all thanks to my master's guidance."

Amid the crowd, Lin Feng scratched his head, smiling bashfully. But being able to become someone the Lin family was proud of made him very excited.

From the seat of honor, Zhong Qing drank alone.

Watching Lin Feng surrounded by the Lin family, that proud smile on his face, Zhong Qing smiled too.

In this moment.

He was also proud of Lin Feng.

Over the following days, Zhong Qing stayed at the Lin family home.

He wasn't in any hurry to leave, nor did he rush Lin Feng.

This child had been away for so long. Now that he'd finally come home, letting him spend more time with his family was only right.

During this time, many in Fengtian City wanted to pay their respects to Zhong Qing, but Lin Hanyi turned them all away at the door.

Then, one day.

The City Lord of Fengtian City came calling.

"Greetings, City Lord."

Toward this City Lord, Lin Hanyi was quite courteous.

"Family Head Lin, how have you been?" City Lord Bai Chen smiled slightly. "Your Lin family is certainly flourishing these days."

"Please don't tease me, City Lord." Lin Hanyi laughed. "May I ask what brings the City Lord here today?"

At this.

Bai Chen's expression clearly grew serious.

After a pause, he finally said, "Family Head Lin, I've indeed come today to ask for help."

"Please speak."

Lin Hanyi also became serious.

"Half a year ago, a vicious demon beast appeared outside our Fengtian City. Since its appearance, it has killed countless people. The City Lord's mansion has organized several hunting parties with our best fighters, but we've failed every time, suffering heavy casualties. Just yesterday, another hundred people died at the beast's maw. So today I've come..."

At this point, Bai Chen rose and cupped his fists, bowing deeply. "I know the Senior Zhong staying with your family has countless affairs to attend to, and I shouldn't disturb him. But I truly have no other options. So I beg Family Head Lin to speak on my behalf and see if Senior Zhong might be willing to slay this beast."

Hearing this.

Lin Hanyi's brow furrowed.

If it were anyone else, he would have refused outright.

But this matter was clearly different, and he knew about the demon beast outside the city. His own Lin family had lost clansmen to it.

"I don't presume to speak for Senior Zhong in this matter. At most, I can ask on your behalf. Whether he agrees or not, I can't say." After careful consideration, Lin Hanyi finally replied.

Hearing this, Bai Chen's face lit up with joy.

"Thank you, Family Head Lin. If the Senior is unwilling, I will not press the matter and will find another solution!"

"Very well."

Only then did Lin Hanyi rise and head toward the rear courtyard where Zhong Qing was staying.

"I pay my respects to Senior Zhong." Still outside the courtyard, Lin Hanyi bowed respectfully.

"Family Head Lin, there's no need for such formality." Zhong Qing was currently strolling with a bird. Seeing Lin Hanyi, he smiled slightly. "What brings you here?"

"There is indeed something I'd like to ask Senior Zhong's help with."

Approaching Zhong Qing, Lin Hanyi got straight to the point and explained everything Bai Chen had requested.

"Oh, a demon beast."

Zhong Qing was considering whether to agree.

Just then, the system suddenly spoke up.

「Random Quest Issued: Please eliminate the demon beast outside Fengtian City. A mysterious reward awaits.」
