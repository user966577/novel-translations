Chapter 15: Absolute Suppression

However.

Just as Zhong Qing was considering how to approach Flying Saber Sect and secure his new disciple, a figure descended from the sky.

The man had crimson hair, blood-red pupils, and faint black mist emanating from his body.

"Who goes there?"

Seeing the newcomer, the Flying Dagger elder's brow furrowed. He slammed his table and rose, fixing a grim stare on the man.

"Please remain calm, Elder. I am Xue Kuang."

The man's eerie pupils flickered as he landed and offered a courteous bow.

"Xue Kuang?"

"Red-Haired Ghost's disciple?" The elder exclaimed.

"The Elder is indeed well-informed, recognizing me at a glance." Xue Kuang smiled lazily.

"Naturally."

Having confirmed his identity, the elder's tone immediately became more cordial.

Red-Haired Ghost was a notorious rogue cultivator within a radius of ten thousand miles.

Though his cultivation methods leaned demonic, no one could deny his formidable Moon Profound strength. Even Flying Saber Sect's own patriarch might not be able to handle him.

"What brings Young Master Xue Kuang here?" The elder smiled.

"Just a small request."

Xue Kuang's gaze turned cold as he looked at the little boy. "This child was exposed to a certain toxin from a young age. Though not lethal, having been poisoned for so long, it's now fused with his blood and qi."

"The technique my master passed down to me requires blood and a heart infused with this specific toxin as a catalyst."

"While I could cultivate such a constitution artificially, that would take considerable time. Now that one exists right before me, I've come to ask the Elder to hand him over."

"This..."

The Flying Dagger elder hesitated.

"Elder, this kid is just trash. One more or one less makes no difference to your sect. Grant me this favor, and you'll always have my gratitude."

Xue Kuang pressed his case with both logic and emotion.

The elder still wavered.

He didn't care about the boy's life. He cared about Flying Saber Sect's reputation.

Bad enough that Xue Kuang was a demonic cultivator—he'd said all this publicly. If Flying Saber Sect agreed, wouldn't that mark them as colluding with demonic cultivators?

But Xue Kuang's words did make sense.

Just one piece of trash. Truly neither here nor there.

More importantly, he'd gain a favor.

Red-Haired Ghost had only this one disciple. Xue Kuang's favor was essentially Red-Haired Ghost's favor.

So he made his decision, smiling lightly. "Since Young Master Xue Kuang asks, how could I refuse?"

"No, please don't!"

Nearby, the little boy cried out in despair, his entire body trembling with fury.

He'd never imagined his life could take such a cruel turn.

"Elder, I beg you, don't do this!"

"I'm a Flying Saber Sect disciple now! My parents saved a Flying Dagger elder's life!"

The boy was nearly begging.

Hearing this, the Flying Dagger elder hesitated briefly.

The boy's parents had indeed saved the Grand Elder. If the Grand Elder took issue with this later...

With that thought, he pulled out a jade slip to contact the Grand Elder.

"Hmph, just a mortal. You're bothering me with this? The token was given to his parents, not him. His parents are dead, so the token is void."

The Grand Elder's cold, impatient voice came through.

These words made the little boy collapse to the ground.

His parents had risked everything to save that man precisely because of the token, hoping it would give their son a better life—a chance to escape ordinary hardship and become someone.

They never imagined the person they'd saved with their lives would be this kind of man.

If he'd known, he never should have come today.

Having heard the Grand Elder's position, the Flying Dagger elder issued his order, voice hard: "Regardless of whether the token counts, you've already become a Flying Dagger disciple. Disciples obey sect commands. When sect interests are at stake, disciples should willingly sacrifice themselves!"

Though the crowd found Flying Saber Sect's behavior despicable, not one person spoke up for the boy.

Such was the cultivation world.

The strong devoured the weak.

Flying Saber Sect's cold cruelty thoroughly chilled the boy's heart.

Red-eyed, he branded their actions and this hatred deep into his memory, then bolted through the crowd to escape.

Seeing him flee, Xue Kuang smirked, in no hurry.

He let the boy run for a bit before leisurely raising his palm. A burst of qi shot toward the fleeing child.

Watching the attack close in, despair filled the boy's face, along with bitter unwillingness.

Then—

At the critical moment, a white-robed figure appeared before him, shielding him.

With a casual wave, the incoming attack dissipated.

This sudden development drew everyone's attention to the white-robed figure.

"Who are you?"

Xue Kuang glared at the newcomer, killing intent radiating from him.

But Zhong Qing ignored him entirely.

Instead, he crouched down to wipe the tears from the boy's face and asked gently, "What's your name?"

Looking at Zhong Qing, the boy was overwhelmed with emotion. No one else in the entire crowd had spoken up for him—only this man had appeared to shield him.

"My name is Su Ye. Thank you for saving my life."

Overcome with gratitude, he dropped to his knees before Zhong Qing.

"Su Ye. A good name." Zhong Qing smiled softly. "Su Ye, will you become my disciple?"

Hearing that Zhong Qing wanted to take him as a disciple, the boy's young face filled with disbelief.

For him, even becoming a menial laborer at Flying Saber Sect had been enough. He'd never dared dream that someone would actually want him as a disciple.

Let alone someone like Zhong Qing, who could dispel Xue Kuang's attack with a casual wave.

He didn't hesitate for even a moment before kowtowing. "Su Ye is willing. Greetings, Master."

"Hahaha, excellent."

Zhong Qing smiled broadly as he helped Su Ye to his feet.

At that same moment, the system's voice sounded in his mind.

「Congratulations, Host. Successful recruitment.」

「Trash Bond 2/2 activated.」

「Trash Bond 2/2: Disciple cultivation speed can be boosted 100x. Host receives 10,000x cultivation feedback.」

As the system finished speaking, Zhong Qing distinctly felt the cultivation he'd been gaining moment by moment from Lin Feng's practice suddenly increase tenfold.

It felt like riding a rocket—exhilarating beyond words.

But the system wasn't done.

「Congratulations, Host. First activation of Trash Bond 2/2. Reward: Absolute Suppression ability.」

「Absolute Suppression: Against any cultivator at the same level or below, Host may reduce them to dust with any attack motion.」

「Host: Zhong Qing」

「Cultivation: Moon Profound Realm」

「Disciple: Lin Feng. Xiantian cultivation. 100x bonus active.」

「Disciple: Su Ye. No cultivation. 100x bonus pending activation.」

「Active Bonds: Trash Bond 2/2. More bonds awaiting development.」

「Physiques Obtained: None」

「Special Abilities: Low-Profile Aura, Heavenly Eye, Absolute Suppression」

"Absolute Suppression, huh?"

"Might seem situational, but it does save a lot of trouble."

A slow smile spread across Zhong Qing's face.

"Did you go deaf?! I asked you a question!"

Xue Kuang, ignored for so long, was losing his mind.

His demonic cultivation had brought him to peak Dawn Profound, crushing his generation and rivaling second-rate sect elders. And his master's name alone let him swagger anywhere within ten thousand miles.

Yet this Zhong Qing had ruined his plans and dared to ignore him.

In that moment, Xue Kuang had already sentenced Zhong Qing to death.
