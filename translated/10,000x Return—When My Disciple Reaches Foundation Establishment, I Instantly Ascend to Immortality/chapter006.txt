Chapter 6: Imperial-Grade Cultivation Methods... By the Sackful?

A ring-bound grandpa.

It seemed his new disciple might even be a child of destiny.

"Find a place to stay first. Once you're settled, come back here." Zhong Qing gave his instructions casually.

"Yes, Master."

Lin Feng bowed respectfully and departed.

After Lin Feng left, Zhong Qing grabbed a burlap sack and headed into the storage room.

Shortly after, Lin Feng—following Sword Elder's guidance—found an excellent cultivation cave positioned directly over a formation core. Cultivating there would yield twice the results with half the effort.

"Overall, this Mufu Peak isn't bad. No one to disturb us, convenient for our plans. The formations are crude, but something is better than nothing. Once we retrieve the strange fire and you can cultivate, following my teachings will let you surpass everyone—including that so-called purple talent."

Inside the room, Sword Elder manifested as a translucent figure—white-haired, immortal in bearing, hands clasped behind his back.

"Thank you, Sword Elder."

Lin Feng's expression brightened with gratitude.

"Alright, go see your convenient master."

Sword Elder continued, "Though he won't be of real help to you, he did get you into Mufu Peak. You'll be here a long time, living under the same roof. Best to maintain good relations."

"Yes, Sword Elder."

After settling in briefly, Lin Feng headed to Zhong Qing's courtyard.

Snow lay thick across the yard.

Inside the hall, Zhong Qing reclined on a lounging chair beside the warm furnace.

Having reached Star Profound Realm, the cold no longer affected him.

But on days like this, not having a fire burning somehow felt wrong.

"Master."

Lin Feng stood before Zhong Qing with perfect respect.

"Mm."

Zhong Qing opened his drowsy eyes and sat up. "Since you've become my disciple, I should give you something as your master."

"I've stored some cultivation methods here. Pick a few you like for your training."

"Well..."

Lin Feng hesitated.

Secretly, he consulted Sword Elder.

After all, Sword Elder had promised to give him a cultivation method once he'd absorbed the strange fire. He didn't actually need anything from Zhong Qing.

"What's there to hesitate about? It's useless, sure, but it's the thought that counts. Just don't cultivate them. Keep up appearances."

Sword Elder's voice was exasperated.

"Yes."

Lin Feng nodded internally, then looked at Zhong Qing. "Thank you, Master."

"They're in that sack over there. Help yourself."

Zhong Qing gestured toward a nearby burlap sack.

A sack?

Lin Feng blinked.

True, he didn't really need what Zhong Qing offered.

But his master was at Star Profound Realm—surely whatever he gave wouldn't be too shabby.

Lin Feng had been somewhat curious.

Yet storing cultivation methods in a burlap sack? That was... unexpected.

What kind of decent method came in a burlap sack?

Even Sword Elder couldn't help but roll his eyes inside the Desolate Ring.

"Whatever. You don't need them anyway. Just grab one and be done with it."

Lin Feng nodded and crouched by the sack, casually opening it.

The moment he did—

Ancient, profound, and terrifying auras rushed at his face.

Simultaneously, golden light, crimson light, and brilliant radiance nearly blinded him.

Lin Feng's expression transformed into pure shock.

Sword Elder, who'd been about to enter a brief rest, jolted fully alert. "Holy shit."

"V-V-V-Venerable-grade cultivation methods!!"

Sword Elder's tongue practically tied itself in knots. His eyes bulged as he stammered in disbelief.

Before that exclamation finished, another shriek tore from his throat.

"Saint-grade! Damn, there's Saint-grade too!"

"No wait—that's Imperial... Imperial-grade..."

"Mother of—am I dreaming?!"

Lin Feng heard the continuous exclamations in his mind and finally processed what he was seeing.

Though he couldn't cultivate yet, Sword Elder had long educated him on such matters.

He understood exactly what these cultivation methods represented.

The method Sword Elder had planned to give him was only King-grade.

A King-grade method alone could spark wars. Even selling all of Xianjiang Sect couldn't buy one.

Yet King-grade was nothing compared to Venerable-grade.

Let alone the Saint and Imperial grades above that.

Lin Feng's hands trembled. Every muscle in his body went taut. He slapped his own face, fearing this was all a dream.

The sting told him it wasn't.

This was real.

Venerable, Saint, and Imperial-grade cultivation methods—stuffed into a burlap sack, sitting right in front of him!

"Quick, kid! Pick one! Pick one now!!"

Inside the ring, Sword Elder had completely lost his composure. He wished he could jump out and choose himself.

"That one—the Imperial-grade Great Desolation Scripture! No wait, the Imperial-grade Fire Emperor Scripture instead!"

"And that one—the Great Heaven-Earth Body Scripture suits you perfectly!"

"Hold on, the Great Zhou Bone-Tempering Art is also good..."

Sword Elder's perception followed Lin Feng's vision, growing more dazzled by the second. Each method seemed better than the last, and he couldn't bear to pass up any of them.

Following Sword Elder's exclamations, Lin Feng picked up one method only to set it down for another, then spotted yet another he wanted.

Zhong Qing seemed to read Lin Feng's thoughts.

A small smile played on his lips.

"Since you like them all, just take them all."

"R-really? I can?"

Lin Feng stared at Zhong Qing, barely containing his excitement.

Zhong Qing nodded.

With that permission, Lin Feng—guided by Sword Elder—selected five Imperial-grade methods most suited to his path without any false modesty.

"This is too exciting! Too exciting!"

"AHHHHH!"

"Five Imperial-grade cultivation methods!!"

Inside the Desolate Ring, Sword Elder was practically dancing, as thrilled as if the methods were meant for him.

At the same time, he solemnly reminded Lin Feng: "Listen carefully, boy. The fact that you possess five Imperial-grade methods must stay between you and your master. Tell no one else."

"If word gets out, the people who come to steal them could destroy this entire region with their farts alone!"

Lin Feng nodded gravely.

Young as he was, he wasn't stupid.

Zhong Qing, following his usual habit, set a copper kettle filled with cold water atop the furnace. "Have you finished choosing?"

"Yes, Master."

"Mm."

Zhong Qing reached into the sack, grabbed a handful of cultivation methods, and tossed them into the furnace.

The flames roared to life.

Soon, steam began rising from the kettle.

"No! The waste! The absolute waste!"

Witnessing this, Sword Elder nearly lost his mind inside the ring. He screamed in anguish.
