Chapter 73: Where Did This Old Coot Come From?

Infinity Sect's power was quite formidable!

Its influence spanned across all corners, encompassing most of the Eastern Region.

As Infinity Sect's Eighth Elder, combined with his supremely transcendent status as an alchemist.

The authority Shi Xiaotian could mobilize within the sect was quite high.

Under his orders, information about Zhong Qing was soon presented before him!

There were many people in the world named Zhong Qing.

But one named Zhong Qing who also had a disciple named Su Ye—there was only one at Immortal River Sect.

In the great hall!

Shi Xiaotian looked at the information showing Zhong Qing was from Immortal River Sect.

He sneered: "A mere Peak Master of a second-rate sect dares to snatch this old man's fortune."

"He doesn't know what's good for him!"

Because investigation time was limited.

The information on Zhong Qing only showed his background, his acceptance of Su Ye as a disciple, and his killing of the Blood Maniac with one finger.

"Eighth Elder, according to our investigation, this person is somewhat extraordinary."

"Many of his deeds haven't been fully uncovered!"

"Should we continue investigating?"

Below Shi Xiaotian, a man shrouded entirely in black robes asked.

This was the leader of Infinity Sect's Shadow Guard.

Responsible for gathering information and intelligence.

"No need!"

Shi Xiaotian waved his hand grandly.

"He's just a Peak Master of a small Immortal River Sect. Just identify him."

"Even if he's somewhat extraordinary, how extraordinary can he be?"

"You're dismissed!"

"Yes, Eighth Elder!"

The Shadow Guard leader had a vague feeling that Zhong Qing wasn't simple.

He wanted to remind the Eighth Elder.

But seeing his utterly unconcerned attitude, the words he was about to say were swallowed back down.

He bowed and withdrew.

After the Shadow Guard leader left, Shi Xiaotian set out from Infinity Sect once more.

This time, his target was clear.

Straight for Immortal River Sect's Command Hall Peak.

In his thinking, a Peak Master of a second-rate sect—with his status, whether to flatten or round, wasn't it all at his whim?

Command Hall Peak!

"Boom, rumble..."

With a thunderous roar.

Above the inner courtyard, clouds of black smoke rose.

"Cough, cough..."

Zhong Qing waved his hand, dispersing the choking smoke.

Meanwhile feeling depressed.

"I clearly followed the process exactly. Why did the furnace explode?"

One could see that in the corner, a pile of discarded pill furnaces was stacked.

The alchemy furnace in the center of the courtyard had also been blown half apart.

Others burned through spirit materials when refining pills!

Zhong Qing burned through both spirit materials and furnaces.

"Could it be the furnace quality isn't good enough?"

While pondering, Zhong Qing called to Lin Feng outside: "Disciple, go to Pill Peak and exchange for a higher-quality furnace for your master!"

Zhong Qing recorded the reasons for failure in his notebook.

At the same time constantly summarizing and analyzing the causes.

Outside, Lin Feng, who had been cultivating, heard this and helplessly got up.

"Master, please wait!"

He responded, then headed straight for Immortal River Sect's Pill Peak.

Before long, he arrived at a palace.

This was the palace of Pill Peak's Master, Ge Changqing.

"Ah, Lin Feng is here!"

"Please come in!"

Ge Changqing saw who it was, his face full of warmth, piling on smiles.

"I just purchased a batch of tea leaves recently. Come taste them."

"If you think they're good, take some back for your master to try."

"Peak Master Ge!"

Lin Feng bowed respectfully.

"Today, your disciple hasn't come for tea, but to exchange for a high-quality pill furnace on behalf of my master."

"May I ask if the Peak Master could accommodate this?"

"Of course!"

"What's inconvenient about that!"

"We're all from the same sect. Helping others is helping yourself."

Ge Changqing casually summoned a junior disciple.

"Fetch my Violet-Azure Spirit Furnace for Junior Brother Lin to take back."

That disciple was clearly startled.

"Ma... Master, that Violet-Azure Spirit Furnace is your most prized possession, the peak-protecting treasure of Pill Peak. Are you sure you want to get it?"

"What's with all the nonsense? If I say get it, get it."

"No matter how valuable a treasure is, it's just a dead object."

"How can it compare to the camaraderie between fellow sect members, the bond of brotherhood with Command Hall Peak's Master?"

As he spoke, he turned to Lin Feng: "Family doesn't speak two languages."

"If your master wants a furnace, just let me know."

"No need for exchanges—that's too formal."

Before long, two disciples carried over a furnace half a person tall, weighing over ten thousand pounds, violet-azure in color throughout.

Ge Changqing pointed to the furnace: "Consider this my congratulatory gift to Command Hall Peak for accepting you and Su Ye as disciples."

This attitude left the Pill Peak disciples stunned.

And Pill Peak Master's enthusiasm also made Lin Feng quite uncomfortable.

Not only were treasures given freely, but there were even hints of matchmaking and arranging relationships.

He was being praised as if he were one of a kind under heaven.

But Lin Feng understood why.

Being able to become Zhong Qing's disciple truly meant he had reached the pinnacle of life.

After Lin Feng left, the disciples looked at Ge Changqing, equally baffled.

"Peak Master, that's our Pill Peak's peak-protecting treasure. Giving it away like this—isn't it too hasty?"

"Hmm?"

"Do I need you to teach me how to do things?"

"We wouldn't dare!"

The disciples all lowered their heads, looking awkward.

Ge Changqing didn't care what they thought.

His expression was somewhat excited.

Ordinary disciples didn't know Zhong Qing's identity.

But as a Peak Master, how could he not know?

That was a reincarnated Immortal Emperor.

A figure standing in the clouds.

Now, while his reputation wasn't yet established, sending over a peak-protecting treasure to leave a good impression.

When he rose to prominence in the future, if he remembered this small favor and let something slip through his fingers, wouldn't that be a hundred-fold return?

By then, many would want to send rare treasures and wouldn't even find the door.

Ge Changqing felt rather pleased with himself.

In this move, the disciples were at the bottom level, while he was at least at the third level—two levels ahead of them.

He hadn't become Peak Master for nothing.

Different vision, different strategic outlook, different levels of thinking.

On the other side!

When Lin Feng brought the Violet-Azure Spirit Furnace to Command Hall Peak, Zhong Qing was quite pleased.

He had taken a liking to this furnace at first glance.

Luxurious, grand, and classy!

Ancient, beautiful, with depth.

"Alright, go cultivate! Your master is going to refine pills."

Zhong Qing could hardly wait to start a brand new alchemy journey with his new equipment!

"Yes, Master!"

Lin Feng respectfully withdrew.

He stood up and left.

Zhong Qing placed the Violet-Azure Furnace over the fire.

Skillfully lighting the fire, raising the temperature, sorting the spirit herbs.

Perhaps it was luck, perhaps the new equipment was powerful.

This time, the furnace didn't explode.

The pills were successfully refined.

But when Zhong Qing fished out the finished product from the Violet-Azure Spirit Furnace.

He began to doubt life.

"This is a pill?"

He hadn't seen a pig run, but hadn't he eaten pork?

He'd heard that pills refined by many alchemists were fragrant and enticing, smooth and round in color, bursting with spiritual energy, making one want to swallow them at first sight.

And the pills he'd refined?

Spotted and blotchy, lumpy and irregular.

The color was a dull yellow. Forget about pill fragrance—they even smelled burnt.

Zhong Qing stared for quite a while, wanting to just toss them in the garbage as waste.

But then he felt reluctant.

After all, these were things he'd painstakingly refined.

Not even knowing their efficacy and just throwing them away would be quite wasteful.

Perhaps his alchemy method was fundamentally different from the mainstream.

Maybe he was pioneering an entirely new path of alchemy.

Thinking this, Zhong Qing carefully put them away.

And based on their appearance, he gave them a rather innovative, highly fitting name—Lump Pills!

But having refined pills without knowing their effects.

Made Zhong Qing rather curious.

Just then!

In the clouds above!

A streak of light flew over.

Its momentum was like a rainbow.

The aura unique to a Sun Profound powerhouse spilled out, shaking the winds and clouds.

The light was extremely fast, arriving above the small courtyard in an instant.

It transformed into a human figure.

This person was none other than Shi Xiaotian.

His gaze swept the small courtyard, finally settling on Zhong Qing.

"You're Command Hall Peak's Master—Zhong Qing!"

He stood with hands behind his back, posture haughty.

Like a god from the ninth heaven looking down upon mortal ants.

That gaze made Zhong Qing extremely uncomfortable.

"Who are you?"

He raised his head to look directly at Shi Xiaotian, brow slightly furrowed.

"I'm asking you—are you Command Hall Peak's Master Zhong Qing!"

Shi Xiaotian's tone grew three degrees heavier.

His voice was like thunder.

Exploding in the small courtyard.

Zhong Qing's face darkened.

"Coming in here all high and mighty!"

"Where did this old coot come from?"

Zhong Qing was puzzled. His Command Hall Peak was peaceful and quiet—where had this nuisance popped up from?

"Impudent! I am a Holy Land elder. How dare you speak to me like this?"

"Seeking death?"

"If you know what's good for you, hand over the Heaven Spirit Grass immediately."

"Perhaps this old man won't hold it against you."

"Otherwise, I'll show you what Holy Land might and a powerhouse's wrath truly are!"

As he spoke, his aura surged.

Clearly trying to overwhelm with pressure.

To make Zhong Qing completely kneel at his feet.

This attitude thoroughly enraged Zhong Qing.

He said nothing, simply struck out with one palm.

Before Shi Xiaotian could react, he was knocked unconscious.

Before losing consciousness, he vaguely heard a muttering: "I was just worrying about where to find a test subject for my pill effects, and here you come delivering yourself..."
