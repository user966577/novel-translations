Chapter 35: Heavenly Calamity's Threat

"Alright, I suppose that's all we can do."

Qingniao said.

The two women found a small mortal town about fifty miles away and located a coffin shop.

After purchasing a fine coffin, they returned to the forest.

They then moved Heavenly Calamity's body into the coffin and placed the coffin, along with everything, into a storage ring.

With that done, the two women didn't dare linger and continued toward Myriad Dao Mountain.

When they reached Myriad Dao Mountain's territory, an elder was indeed there to escort them.

But the escorting elder's face was grave. Upon seeing them, he said nothing and immediately headed toward Myriad Dao Mountain at maximum speed.

The two women didn't dare say anything either. They could clearly sense the heavy atmosphere.

Finally.

The two women returned to Myriad Dao Mountain.

Myriad Dao Mountain was established amid a cluster of peaks.

But the surrounding mountains encircled it, and a great river flowed past about five miles from the entrance—clearly a feng shui treasure spot that collected wind and gathered qi.

Myriad Dao Mountain's scenery was also extremely beautiful. Every building cluster and every sculptural decoration seemed to carry deeper meaning.

Within its bounds, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was several times denser than elsewhere.

Clearly, Myriad Dao Mountain's mastery of such matters was indeed profound.

But the current atmosphere at Myriad Dao Mountain was heavy. The main gates were sealed, many formations were activated, and the disciples passing by all wore worried expressions.

"Greetings, Master."

After returning, the two women first paid respects to their own master.

"You two are finally back. As long as you're safe. Come with me quickly—the Sect Master has called an emergency meeting."

An old man in Daoist robes with an air of immortal elegance saw that the two women had returned safely and relaxed slightly. But there was no time for pleasantries—he needed to bring them to the sect meeting.

"Yes, Master."

The two women didn't dare delay or rest.

They had originally wanted to share with their master how they'd exceeded expectations on this mission, bringing back six mid Moon Profound demon beast eyeballs and even encountering a mysterious expert like Zhong Qing.

But given the gravity of the situation, they could only set these matters aside in the face of the sect's crisis.

They followed their master into the sect's great hall.

At this moment, all of Myriad Dao Mountain's elders, protectors, and direct disciples were present.

The atmosphere was thick with tension.

At the head of the hall, Myriad Dao Mountain's Sect Master, Zhuge Qing, sat with authority. He surveyed those below, then slowly spoke.

"Everyone, since we're all here, I'll get straight to the point."

"Since Heavenly Calamity's reappearance, over a hundred of our disciples and members who were traveling or on missions outside have been brutally murdered by Heavenly Calamity."

"But that's not the gravest concern. At worst, we could have all our members stay inside temporarily and restore their freedom after eliminating Heavenly Calamity. What I never expected was that yesterday, Heavenly Calamity made a bold declaration: he will attack Myriad Dao Mountain to avenge the siege three hundred years ago."

"Everyone, if it were anyone else making such a threat, I would just laugh it off. Even if a Holy Land threatened to attack us, I wouldn't be this grave, because what Myriad Dao Mountain excels at is formations."

"Against the countless formations we've arranged here, I'm confident we could make even a Holy Land suffer mutual destruction."

"But don't forget—Heavenly Calamity came from our Myriad Dao Mountain. And his formation mastery is the highest in our sect's history. In other words, his understanding of formations may surpass everyone here."

"This means our formations, which we're so proud of, may be completely ineffective against him."

When Zhuge Qing finished, everyone's brows furrowed deeply.

The mood was heavy.

Qingniao and Leng Ning, who had just returned, finally understood why the sect seemed to be facing an imminent threat.

Then Zhuge Qing dropped another bombshell.

"Furthermore, according to the latest intelligence, Heavenly Calamity's cultivation has reached Sun Profound!!"

"With his power, if our formations can't affect him, he'll be unstoppable once he enters Myriad Dao Mountain. Even if our ancestor emerges, at best he could only fight Heavenly Calamity to a draw—a stalemate at most. If Heavenly Calamity chooses not to fight the ancestor and instead attacks others, no one will be able to block his attacks."

"In other words, he could kill everyone below Sun Profound and still leave unscathed!"

When he finished.

Everyone's brows nearly knitted together.

The gap between major realms was like a chasm—an unbridgeable gulf.

No matter how many Moon Profound cultivators you had, they couldn't defeat a single Sun Profound expert.

So even if Heavenly Calamity just casually struck a few blows inside Myriad Dao Mountain, the losses would be unbearable.

And while Myriad Dao Mountain did have Sun Profound guardians, their members weren't skilled at combat. At the same level, they likely couldn't defeat Heavenly Calamity, who had become a demonic cultivator.

"What should we do? Everyone, share your thoughts."

Zhuge Qing spoke gravely.

"I believe we should still rely on formations."

One elder spoke up first. "After all, Heavenly Calamity hasn't been at Myriad Dao Mountain for three hundred years. During that time, we've developed many new formations. Heavenly Calamity can't possibly break them all."

"Indeed, I agree." Another elder said. "Our specialty is formations. Are you telling me that the combined research of all of us can't match Heavenly Calamity alone?"

"While using formations, I suggest we evacuate some disciples first, dispersing them into small groups. Just in case." Yet another elder added.

"Good."

Hearing everyone's suggestions, Zhuge Qing's tightly furrowed brows relaxed slightly.

"By my order, secretly evacuate some disciples first. Once the crisis passes, bring them back."

"Second, activate all of Myriad Dao Mountain's formations. In these final days, set up additional new formations. So, esteemed elders, in the face of this crisis, don't hold anything back—bring out all your hidden techniques."

"Elder Yidao, can the Five Malice Formation you've been developing be deployed?"

At this, Zhuge Qing looked toward an elderly man with an immortal air. This elder was Qingniao and Leng Ning's master.

Elder Yidao stood and sighed. "The formation is still missing some materials."

"Oh? What materials?" Zhuge Qing asked quickly.

"It still needs demon beast eyeballs to activate the spirit." Elder Yidao said. "And to be effective against someone of Heavenly Calamity's level, ordinary eyeballs won't do. They need to be at least Moon Profound."

"Moon Profound demon beast eyeballs..."

Zhuge Qing frowned.

For ordinary demon beasts, with Myriad Dao Mountain's resources and connections, they could certainly obtain them.

But Moon Profound level? That was indeed difficult.

After all, creatures of that realm were regional overlords among demon beasts. Their eyeballs weren't so easy to harvest.

"Although I sent my two disciples out to hunt demons a while ago, hoping they'd gain some experience, they've only been gone about ten days. And with their strength, they couldn't possibly obtain Moon Profound demon beast eyeballs. So deploying the Five Malice Formation before Heavenly Calamity arrives is probably unrealistic." Elder Yidao sighed.

But just as his words fell, Qingniao's voice suddenly rang out from the crowd.

"Master."
