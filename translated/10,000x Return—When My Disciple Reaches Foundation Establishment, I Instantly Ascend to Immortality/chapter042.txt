Chapter 42: Didn't You Say Your Fists Were Bigger?

Seeing Zhong Qing agree, Wu Yun on the high platform allowed himself a cold smile.

In his eyes, this master and disciple pair were already dead.

But he had genuinely worried that Zhong Qing wouldn't agree.

Because his intention was for Lin Feng to die at Murong Xue's hands, letting her personally deal with this emotional burden.

This way, Murong Xue's path forward would be smooth sailing, free of inner demons.

"Disciple, accept the challenge."

Wu Yun called out leisurely.

As his voice fell, Murong Xue, dressed entirely in black today, stepped through the air and landed steadily on the Life and Death Stage.

She didn't spare a single glance at Lin Feng, her childhood sweetheart. There was only piercing coldness in her eyes.

"Look, Senior Sister Murong has appeared!"

By now, countless disciples had gathered below the Life and Death Stage. Seeing Murong Xue appear, many of them cheered.

In their eyes, Murong Xue was their undisputed idol.

"Senior Sister Murong, kill him with one sword!"

"Yeah, Senior Sister Murong, one sword to kill him! How dare he covet Senior Sister Murong, how dare he be engaged to her!"

"Exactly, he should take a piss and look at his own reflection first!"

Countless voices of support rang out.

But to Murong Xue's ears, they were unbearably grating.

Being compared to Lin Feng was an insult—an affront to her current status.

She just wanted Lin Feng's name to disappear from this world as quickly as possible. From then on, no one would ever know that she, Murong Xue, had once been engaged to such a man.

Under the watchful eyes of the entire crowd, Lin Feng, empty-handed, slowly walked onto the Life and Death Stage.

"Remember, only one may live. No matter what happens, no one may interfere." Wu Yun glanced at Zhong Qing and spoke leisurely.

"No problem."

Zhong Qing nodded again.

"Good. I hereby declare—let the battle begin."

With Wu Yun's shout, the duel between the two officially began.

For a battle with such an obvious outcome, Wu Yun had no interest in watching closely. The final result would simply be his disciple eliminating this thorn in her heart.

After his announcement, he sat down in the head position.

However, the moment he sat down, his eyes bulged and he shot to his feet.

He stared fixedly at the Life and Death Stage.

The instant he had announced the start, Murong Xue had launched her attack.

She didn't want to waste even a moment on Lin Feng—she just wanted to finish him quickly and leave.

But what no one expected was that Lin Feng easily blocked Murong Xue's attack, then counterattacked with lightning speed, forcing Murong Xue into a desperate defense.

"How... how is this possible?"

Wu Yun's eyes were wide with disbelief.

They had personally trained Murong Xue. They knew exactly how strong her talent was—fighting above her level was child's play for her. Yet here she was, being pushed back by Lin Feng.

Wasn't this Lin Feng supposed to be a waste who couldn't cultivate?

Even if he had solved his problem and could now cultivate, how could he have improved so fast?

But the most shocked of all was Murong Xue herself.

Facing Lin Feng's relentless assault, her eyes went wide.

"No, impossible! Why is this happening??"

She stared at Lin Feng before her, her face twisted with disbelief. This wasn't the Lin Feng she knew.

He was supposed to be trash.

He couldn't possibly, shouldn't possibly have this kind of strength.

"Die!"

"Azure Sky Sword Art!"

Lin Feng's sudden explosion of power threw Murong Xue into a panic.

She couldn't allow herself, the great Saintess, to be beaten back by a piece of trash.

With a hysterical roar, she unleashed the King-grade sword technique she had just learned.

This King-grade sword art was Heavenly Cloud Sect's sect-protecting treasure.

Among the younger generation, only she had the qualifications to learn it, and only she had successfully mastered it.

As the sword art was unleashed, heaven and earth changed color.

Countless brilliant sword lights filled the air, pressing toward Zhong Qing.

"She's already using the Azure Sky Sword Art?"

Above, seeing this scene, Wu Yun finally relaxed.

Good.

End the battle quickly before anything unexpected happens.

Under the Azure Sky Sword Art, that little brat Lin Feng would have absolutely no chance to fight back.

Because once this sword art was deployed, Murong Xue could even hold her own against a Star Profound cultivator.

Let alone Lin Feng.

But the next moment, he realized he had celebrated too soon.

His whole body shuddered with shock.

He watched as Lin Feng, facing Murong Xue's Azure Sky Sword Art, simply raised his fist in an almost casual gesture.

"Heaven Dipper Fist."

As his voice fell, a massive golden phantom materialized behind Lin Feng. The fist-shaped phantom struck out, and the countless sword lights instantly shattered like dried weeds.

And Murong Xue herself, under this single punch, flew backward like a kite with its string cut.

"What? That's also a King-grade profound technique!"

"Why does this kid also have a King-grade profound technique?"

Wu Yun and the others on the platform were filled with disbelief.

They knew that their Heavenly Cloud Sect had taken so many years of development to obtain a single King-grade sword art, and it was only thanks to Murong Xue's extraordinary talent that she could successfully cultivate it.

Yet Lin Feng.

A mere young scion of a small family from Heaven's Mandate City—how could he also unleash a King-grade profound technique?

The spectating disciples were thrown into chaos by the sudden turn of events on stage, their faces full of disbelief.

They had just watched their idol, Senior Sister Murong, get beaten.

Throughout the arena, only Zhong Qing still stood with his hands behind his back, calm and composed as always.

Meanwhile, Lin Feng, having sent Murong Xue flying, showed no mercy.

Memories of past humiliations flooded his mind.

His grandfather, driven to death by rage.

The Lin family's decline.

All the grievances he had suffered—in this moment, they all erupted in his heart, condensing into one final punch aimed at Murong Xue.

Looking at this incoming fist, Murong Xue's eyes went blank.

Panic filled her entire being.

Her expression even turned somewhat deranged.

"Why? Why?"

"Why does this trash have such strength?"

"Why does he also know King-grade profound techniques?!!"

But no matter how many questions filled her mind, there was no time to think. All she knew was that the fist was getting closer and closer, and the threat of death was growing heavier and heavier.

She had to admit—she had been defeated by Lin Feng, this piece of trash.

And she might even die at his hands.

In that moment, all the pride that being Saintess had given her shattered completely. All she could think of was how to survive. She screamed hysterically, "Master, save me!"

Wu Yun naturally saw this too.

His eyes blazed with killing intent.

This little bastard actually dared to try killing his disciple right in front of him?

"Little bastard, stop right there!"

With a furious roar, Wu Yun shot into the air and sent a palm strike directly at Lin Feng.

Seeing this, Zhong Qing's expression darkened. He teleported instantly to Lin Feng's side and blocked the attack.

Wu Yun used this opening to grab Murong Xue and retreat to the high platform. Only after checking that she was unharmed did the fire in his eyes calm somewhat.

"What a shameless Heavenly Cloud Sect."

Shielding Lin Feng behind him, Zhong Qing stared at Wu Yun above, his voice heavy. "Before the battle started, you yourself said that once on the arena, it's life or death, and no matter what happens, no one else may interfere. As a Sect Master, is your word worthless?"

"Hmph, so what?"

Facing Zhong Qing's questioning, Wu Yun showed no embarrassment, his voice cold. "Rules have always been made by whoever has the bigger fist."

"Hahahaha."

"What a great 'whoever has the bigger fist makes the rules.'"

Wu Yun's words made Zhong Qing laugh with rage. "Then I'd like to see just how big Heavenly Cloud Sect's fists really are."

"Boy, quite the big talk." Wu Yun glared at Zhong Qing with murderous intent, his voice icy. "You dare come to my Heavenly Cloud Sect and cause trouble, even killing our steward in public? Do you think you can escape?"

"Third Elder, Fourth Elder, Fifth Elder."

"Present."

"Kill this master and disciple pair."

"Yes."

As Wu Yun's command fell, three elderly figures shot out from behind him, heading straight for Zhong Qing.

All three radiated powerful cultivation auras.

Three Sun Profound cultivators!

"Boy, you dared cause trouble at my Heavenly Cloud Sect. Prepare to repent."

The Third Elder roared, and a towering palm print pressed down toward Zhong Qing.

The Fourth and Fifth Elders were equally fierce, their overwhelming attacks coming at Zhong Qing from two other directions.

The three combined assault completely sealed off Zhong Qing's retreat.

Yet facing the siege of three Sun Profound cultivators, Zhong Qing showed no fear. Instead, a cold smile appeared on his face.

His right hand reached out gently into the void.

He effortlessly shattered the Third Elder's attack, then grabbed him directly.

"Is this what you call big fists?"

"Nothing but ants."

A cold smile played on Zhong Qing's face. His hand in the void squeezed lightly, and the Third Elder in mid-air exploded.

"What?"

Seeing this, both Wu Yun and the Fourth and Fifth Elders were stunned into bug-eyed disbelief.

The mighty Third Elder, a Sun Profound cultivator, had been instantly killed by Zhong Qing!!!

"Get back, quick! You're no match for him!"

Wu Yun shouted.

Hearing him, the Fourth and Fifth Elders abandoned their attacks despite the backlash, stepping through the air to flee.

"Didn't you say your fists were bigger?"

"Why are you running?"

"Get back here."

Zhong Qing moved his hand again, and that phantom hand in the void shot after the Fourth Elder.
