Chapter 78: Calling for Backup

Time flew by, days passing like water!

In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.

This period, for Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian, was the darkest time of their lives!

Heaven have mercy!

Two distinguished alchemy masters, tormented half to death by a few pills!

The pills Zhong Qing refined all used the same materials.

Yet each batch came out with different properties.

If it wasn't diarrhea and vomiting today, it was oozing sores and pustules tomorrow.

And each time, Zhong Qing refined with great seriousness, wanting to create a truly good healing pill.

Here's the thing—you could say he had no talent, yet he could still form the pills, and the side effects were as potent as deadly poison, able to knock out Sun Profound powerhouses.

You could say he had talent, yet each batch came out bizarre and unique, emphasizing nothing but being different.

"I wonder what pills that harbinger will refine today?"

Under the blazing sun, in the quiet courtyard, Wu Yue spoke with lingering fear.

"I hope it's not one with the vomiting and diarrhea effect!"

Shi Xiaotian's face was full of suffering.

A dignified Holy Land elder, a Sun Profound powerhouse. To have that stuff in his pants.

At several hundred years old, if word got out, his reputation would be ruined!

Just as the two were anxious, Zhong Qing was nowhere to be seen.

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian exchanged glances.

Since the two had arrived at Command Hall Peak, every day without fail, the other would forcibly administer several quality "poison pills."

Had the sun risen in the west today?

Or had the other had a change of heart?

The Zhong Qing they were thinking about was currently in the inner courtyard reading a book.

It was the Myriad Origins Pill Scripture rewarded by the system.

This was an Emperor Scripture.

Its contents were all-encompassing and profound, expounding on the fundamental principles of the Dao of Pills.

It recorded formulas for numerous divine pills and secret medicines, as well as various alchemy methods and pill-forming techniques.

His self-created Myriad Spirit Pill clearly had no chance of success in the short term.

Rather than going down this dead end, he might as well change his approach.

And through this research, he had discovered a heaven-defying formula.

"Using the five elements as fire, drawing the power of sun, moon, and stars as fuel, gathering the mountains and rivers from all directions as the furnace, using the Heaven-Stealing Earth-Mending Secret Art to seize heaven's essence and earth's liquid, one can create a Perfect Foundation Pill!"

"Those under sixteen who take this pill can forge a perfect foundation."

"Once the perfect foundation is formed, cultivation speed advances by leaps and bounds, able to rival the ancient Sacred Physiques!"

This formula set Zhong Qing's heart ablaze.

Currently, his two disciples had gained a hundredfold cultivation boost, with ten-thousand-fold returns to him.

Their cultivation speed couldn't be called slow.

But if on top of that, both disciples' cultivation speed jumped another major level, then he would essentially be making a spatial leap on top of his already meteoric rise!

Cultivation speed—naturally, the faster the better.

No one would complain that their cultivation was advancing too quickly.

One could only wish for fast upon fast.

"But it seems I don't have much time left!"

Zhong Qing's gaze was distant as he murmured.

The formula showed it had to be taken before age sixteen to create a perfect foundation.

Otherwise, the effects would be greatly diminished.

And Lin Feng, if he remembered correctly, that kid was almost sixteen!

"Time waits for no one!"

Zhong Qing casually tossed the Myriad Origins Pill Scripture aside, his mind racing to figure out how to refine the pill before Lin Feng turned sixteen.

Then he realized that with his abilities alone, there was no way to produce the pill in time.

Nothing else—just the Heaven-Stealing Earth-Mending Secret Art alone required a vast store of alchemy knowledge.

Without considerable mastery of alchemy, understanding this technique in such a short time would be impossible.

Though Zhong Qing had recently shown great passion for alchemy.

At the end of the day, in alchemy, he was still a novice.

Matters concerning his disciple's future couldn't be treated carelessly.

"Looks like I'll need to call for backup!"

His gaze turned toward the window. Seeing Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian, he paused slightly.

"Aren't these ready-made candidates?"

He immediately rose and headed outside.

In the inner courtyard, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian were trussed up and tied to the jujube tree.

Seeing Zhong Qing's figure, both their faces fell.

"Today, there's no escaping this disaster after all?"

"Forget it, whether you stretch your neck or shrink it, the blade still falls. Might as well show some backbone."

The two unconsciously puffed out their chests, like soldiers heading to battle.

Simply waiting for the cruel battlefield to descend.

By now, Zhong Qing had arrived before them.

He got straight to the point: "I recall you two are alchemists?"

Both were confused.

Not knowing what tricks Zhong Qing was up to now.

Was watching alchemists struggle and wail under his poison pills more satisfying?

Their faces showed some fear, as if imagining some perverted scenario.

Zhong Qing naturally didn't know what they were thinking. He continued: "Could you help me refine two pills?"

"If you succeed, I'll release you, and we'll let bygones be bygones."

"Think it over and give me your answer!"

As soon as Zhong Qing finished, the two spoke in unison.

"No need to think—we agree!"

Heavens above!

Earth below!

They had finally gotten the treatment alchemists deserved.

With their status, wherever they went, weren't they the center of attention, the target of countless people's flattery?

How many people cried and begged for them to help refine a batch of pills, only to be refused?

Yet here, Zhong Qing had captured them and instead of giving them special treatment for their status, had used them as pill-testing subjects.

Now, finally, was the time to show their skills.

They were also prepared to show Zhong Qing.

What true alchemy looked like.

Seeing them agree so readily, Zhong Qing felt uneasy.

After all, this concerned his disciple's future path.

"Are you sure you can do it? Want to look at the formula first?"

If anyone else had said this, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian would have given them a big slap right there.

What a joke.

Throughout the entire Eastern Region, the two of them were among the foremost in alchemy.

If even the two of them working together couldn't refine something, then no one in the entire Eastern Region could claim to be able to.

This was the confidence and pride of being the Eastern Region's top alchemists.

Of course, with Zhong Qing, that was a different matter.

After all, their lives were currently in his hands.

So though displeased inside, Wu Yue still kept his temper and said: "Rest assured!"

"Let us see the formula."

"We'll show you the style of the Eastern Region's top alchemists!"

At this moment, they seemed to have returned to their home turf.

Finding the glory that belonged to alchemists.

The two had made up their minds.

They would give Zhong Qing a good lesson.

Let him know what true alchemy was, and what garbage he'd been refining before.
