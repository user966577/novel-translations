Chapter 92: Old Ancestor, If You Had This Trump Card, Why Not Use It Earlier?

The appearance of the wooden figurine naturally also caught the demon ape's attention.

But like the old beggar, it didn't take it seriously.

"Old man, are you trying to use a toy to make me laugh to death?"

The demon ape cackled.

Its killing move didn't falter.

In an instant, it had arrived.

But the next moment!

The wooden figurine erupted in brilliant light.

Before their eyes, it transformed as if gaining life, becoming a real person.

And threw a punch at the demon ape!

"BOOM..."

This punch shattered the void itself.

The terrifying fist was like an apocalyptic disaster.

From the first move, it displayed the might of a Sky Profound powerhouse.

"How... is this... possible!"

The demon ape's eyes nearly bulged out of its head.

A tiny wooden figurine could unleash the combat power of a Sky Profound cultivator?

If half-step Sky Profound was enough to crush an Earth Profound powerhouse—

Then true Sky Profound versus half-step Sky Profound was no different.

Half a step's difference was the difference between heaven and earth.

"BANG!"

With a thunderous explosion, the unstoppable, arrogant demon ape that had been about to massacre all of Fuyun Sect was blown apart.

After delivering its killing blow, the wooden figurine returned to its original form.

It fell straight to the ground.

As if nothing had happened.

Heaven and earth fell into dead silence.

Everyone was stunned by what they'd witnessed.

Especially the old beggar.

He never imagined that what he'd dismissed as an art piece could unleash such terrifying power.

That was a half-step Sky Profound demon!

Obliterated in one strike!

He swallowed hard.

His mind replayed every scene of his interactions with Zhong Qing.

Only now did he realize that the person he'd always called "young friend" was actually a supreme powerhouse hidden within the mortal world.

"So all this time, the clown was me."

Thinking back to how he'd given away his jade pendant, believing it could protect Zhong Qing and serve as his trump card, the old beggar's face flushed with embarrassment.

Someone who could casually give him a figurine capable of unleashing Sky Profound power—did such a person need his protection?

The old beggar picked up the fallen figurine.

Shaking his head, he chuckled bitterly: "Young friend, oh young friend. I thought I was hiding deep enough."

"Turns out you're even deeper!"

Initially, he hadn't even wanted to accept this figurine.

Zhong Qing had practically forced it on him.

He didn't know whether this was unintentional or deliberate.

If it was deliberate—if Zhong Qing had foreseen the danger he was about to face—then his strength was almost too terrifying to contemplate.

While the old beggar's thoughts churned, everyone else's eyes were wide as saucers.

Their entire bodies seemed frozen in place, their fleeing forms all halted at once.

Led by Meng Xiao, everyone's scalps had gone numb with shock.

They'd all thought their Old Ancestor was surely doomed.

Their hearts had filled with unspeakable grief, overlaid with endless desolation.

Several elders and senior leaders had even started crying.

And then...

Their Old Ancestor was perfectly fine, and the demon ape had been obliterated.

Some elders' faces showed a mixture of shock, joy, and lingering fear.

After confirming the crisis was truly over, one elder finally complained: "Old Ancestor, if you had this trump card, why not use it earlier?"

"Putting on this dramatic farewell—you've wrung the Grand Elder's tears completely dry!"

The Grand Elder: "..."

He hastily denied: "I didn't! Stop talking nonsense!"

His flustered appearance drew roaring laughter.

In an instant, the originally grim and sorrowful atmosphere took on a note of levity.

The elders and leaders who had been weeping earlier became targets of teasing.

Their resentful gazes toward the old beggar grew ever more aggrieved.

The old beggar opened his mouth, embarrassed: "Actually, I didn't know this figurine had such power either."

His words left the already resentful elders speechless.

Though they said nothing, their expressions said everything.

The meaning was clear: Old Ancestor, doesn't your conscience hurt saying that?

They knew their Old Ancestor's ways all too well.

Despite his age, seniority, and strength—

His behavior didn't match his years at all.

He was basically an old child, and everyone in the sect had fallen victim to his pranks at some point.

Clearly, they saw this as yet another of the Old Ancestor's pranks.

Just this time, it was a bit extreme.

He'd thoroughly pranked the entire sect leadership in one go.

The old beggar, with his vast experience, could easily read their thoughts.

But since a few words of explanation weren't getting through, he didn't bother explaining further!

He simply focused his attention on the wooden figurine in his hands.

This time, Zhong Qing had essentially saved all of Fuyun Sect.

He would remember this debt of gratitude.

But thinking about how casually the other party had produced a figurine capable of unleashing Sky Profound power—

The debt would be hard to repay!

For a moment, the old beggar felt lost.

He feared nothing in his life except owing favors.

Meanwhile!

The entire Fuyun Sect leadership had shifted their attention to the wooden figurine.

One by one, they studied it with burning eyes, speculating wildly about its origins.

But seeing their Old Ancestor's inscrutable expression, no one dared ask.

Yet while they didn't know, the Left and Right Protectors—Iron Tower and Mountain Guard—did.

They had witnessed with their own eyes: this figurine was a gift from the Peak Master of Command Hall Peak in Immortal River Sect.

Originally, they'd thought when their Old Ancestor gave his personal jade pendant to the other party, it was Zhong Qing's incredible fortune.

His ancestors' graves must have been smoking with good luck to receive such an honor.

Now they realized—

They were the ones who'd been shortsighted.

The one who'd truly been lucky was their Old Ancestor.

The whole affair was quite surreal.

Even fiction wouldn't dare fabricate such a scenario.

This day was a sleepless night for all of Fuyun Sect.

When the demon ape emerged, its terrifying might had shocked countless leaders.

When everyone thought Fuyun Sect was doomed, a simple wooden figurine had easily resolved everything.

This called for at least three days of grand celebration.

While Fuyun Sect celebrated joyously in harmonious spirits, another Holy Land was shrouded in thick gloom.

That Holy Land was Infinity Sect!

The Old Ancestor of Infinity Sect, named Yuwen Jun, had disappeared from sight a hundred years ago.

Word was he'd gone traveling the world.

But recently, he had returned to the sect.

Normally, an Old Ancestor's return would be greeted by the entire sect, uplifting news that would boost morale.

After all, a sect's Old Ancestor was like a pillar holding up the sky.

But after Yuwen Jun returned and gave a few brief instructions, he collapsed unconscious with extremely severe injuries.

This had the Infinity Sect elders and leadership worried sick!
