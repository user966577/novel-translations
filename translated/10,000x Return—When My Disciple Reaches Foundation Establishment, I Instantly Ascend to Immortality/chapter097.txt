Chapter 97: The Sky-Class Private Room

This day, Zhong Qing arrived at the auction house early!

When he produced the VIP card Du Yanling had given him, the auction house steward was genuinely taken aback.

Though Du Yanling was merely a manager at a subordinate branch, this unique VIP card was something she could only gift once in her lifetime.

Unless it was someone special, why would she give it away?

Moreover, they'd heard rumors that someone at Du Yanling's branch had recently offered what appeared to be a King-grade treasure in trade. Most likely, it was this very person—almost certainly.

Instantly, the gazes of the tall, elegant attendants assigned to reception shifted as they looked at Zhong Qing.

Regarding Zhong Qing's arrival, the steward quickly consulted with the higher-ups.

Moments later, word came down.

"Escort him to Sky-Class Private Room Number One!"

"Sky-Class Number One?"

The steward was surprised but didn't dare question. He promptly led Zhong Qing upstairs and into the Sky-Class private room.

The entire auction venue had four exclusive private rooms.

They were designated Sky, Earth, Profound, and Yellow.

Sky was the most prestigious, Earth second!

Only the most important guests could enter.

Throughout all of Peng City, those qualified for the four private rooms were exceedingly few.

From within, one could overlook the entire auction floor.

Zhong Qing was quite satisfied with the arrangement.

He settled into the private room, sipping tea, eyes half-closed, quietly awaiting the auction's official start.

As time passed, more and more people arrived.

The appearance of a young man in brocade robes drew numerous gazes.

His figure was tall and slender, dressed in magnificent attire!

His expression was somewhat dark and melancholic.

"Young Master Sun, you've arrived!"

"Your seat has been prepared—please, this way!"

A steward fawned beside him.

This scene drew curious looks.

"Who is this? Even the auction steward is flattering him?"

"You don't know him? Must be from out of town!"

"This is the only son of the Haohan Sect Master—Sun Yu."

"You know Haohan Sect, right? That's a first-tier sect. The entire Peng City falls under their jurisdiction."

"Hiss, what a background—truly reaching the heavens!"

Someone was dumbfounded.

A first-tier sect might not carry much weight before Zhong Qing.

Even Holy Lands were just ordinary to him.

But across the entire Eastern Region, the five great Holy Lands stood transcendent.

Below them, the various first-tier sects were already colossal entities that dominated regions and ruled territories.

As people murmured, Sun Yu was escorted to Earth-Class Private Room Number Two!

This made his brow furrow deeply.

Previously, whenever he came to the auction, Sky-Class Number One had always been his exclusive seat.

This time, being led to Room Number Two—what was the meaning of this?

But then he reconsidered.

In the past, aside from him having the qualifications to sit in the four private rooms, they were basically empty anyway.

Occasionally sitting in a different room was no big deal.

He decided not to fuss over such a small matter!

Shortly after Sun Yu took his seat—

Following the auctioneer's passionate opening introduction, the auction officially began.

First up was a fifth-grade pill!

Backed by the Eastern Region's most powerful alchemists, pills were practically the auction house's specialty.

A fifth-grade pill was already a supremely rare treasure that lower-level cultivators could only dream of.

Immediately, quite a few people began bidding.

After the competition, the pill was finally won by a rogue cultivator who bet everything he had!

With the first item successfully sold, various rare treasures followed onto the auction block.

Under the auctioneer's introduction and promotion, the crowd below shouted themselves hoarse with bids.

The atmosphere was intensely lively.

Transaction prices climbed steadily.

"The next item up for auction is a top-grade spiritual treasure—the Thunder Spirit Fruit!"

"The Thunder Spirit Fruit grows in the Thunder Mountain Range!"

"It contains the power of lightning. If consumed directly, it can strengthen the constitution, improve the foundation, and even has a certain probability of enhancing aptitude."

"Beyond that, it can also be used in pill refinement—it's a main ingredient for many advanced pills."

"Starting price: 100,000 mid-grade spirit stones, with minimum increments of 10,000!"

As the auctioneer's words fell, an uproar and gasps of amazement filled the floor below.

Not just because of its heaven-defying functions, but also because of its steep price.

Cultivation aptitude was determined at birth.

Improving it even slightly was harder than ascending to heaven.

Just the fact that the Thunder Spirit Fruit might enhance aptitude was enough to make countless people green with envy.

Yet that exorbitant price made most people shrink back.

100,000 mid-grade spirit stones—what kind of concept was that?

In this world, spirit stones were the standard currency among cultivators.

One high-grade spirit stone equaled 100 mid-grade stones; one mid-grade stone equaled 100 low-grade stones.

100,000 mid-grade spirit stones was a sum that many third-tier sects couldn't produce even if they sold everything.

Only second-tier sects, with their combined resources, could possibly afford such an amount.

The treasure was excellent!

But ninety-nine percent of people could only watch and pant.

Beyond envy, jealousy, and covetousness, there was nothing they could do.

In Earth-Class Private Room Number Two—

Sun Yu's face was animated with excitement.

"Finally, after all this waiting, something worth looking at!"

He'd recently hit a bottleneck in his cultivation.

If he could enhance his aptitude, breaking through would be a simple matter.

He was determined to have that Thunder Spirit Fruit.

"This young master wants the Thunder Spirit Fruit—200,000 mid-grade spirit stones."

As this price was announced—

The entire venue erupted.

"Who is that?"

"Opening bid doubling the price—that's quite bold!"

"Sounds like it came from Earth-Class Private Room Number Two."

200,000 mid-grade spirit stones had the crowd buzzing while they speculated about who the bidder was.

"Hmph."

"Obviously you don't come to Peng City auctions often."

At this point, someone couldn't help but speak up: "In this Peng City, Haohan Sect is number one—no one dares claim second place. There's no one who can even stand as their equal. The entire top floor has four private rooms, but the only one who's ever used them is someone from Haohan Sect."

"So that voice can only belong to the Haohan Sect Young Master—who else could it be?"

But even as he spoke—

He was privately puzzled.

Normally, Sun Yu always sat in Sky-Class Number One. Why was he suddenly in the Earth-Class room?

Of course, his explanation helped the astonished onlookers gain clarity and understanding.

A first-tier sect was indeed a first-tier sect!

Just as Sun Yu thought the Thunder Spirit Fruit was already in his grasp—

"250,000 mid-grade spirit stones!"

A single sentence instantly drew the attention of the entire venue!

"Who?"

"That seemed to come from Sky-Class Private Room Number One?"

Someone said uncertainly.
