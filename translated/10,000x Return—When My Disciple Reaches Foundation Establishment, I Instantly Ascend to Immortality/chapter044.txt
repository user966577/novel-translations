Chapter 44: Belated Repentance Is Cheaper Than Grass

They were clearly all inanimate objects.

Yet in this moment, they all opened their eyes in unison. Their limbs began to move, looking extremely eerie.

Then light emanated from their bodies, and within that light, their forms suddenly enlarged.

Moments later, the wooden figurines had transformed into beings indistinguishable from real humans.

As if responding to some summons.

The instant they took human form, they all transformed into streaks of light and flew toward the distant spatial gate.

Then.

The Heavenly Cloud Sect people saw figures bursting out of the spatial gate before Zhong Qing.

One.

Two...

Seven.

Eight...

Thirty.

Forty...

Two hundred.

Three hundred...

The numbers kept climbing...

Dense as locusts.

They swarmed out of the spatial gate in numbers that made one's scalp tingle.

But.

That wasn't even the most terrifying part.

What truly terrified them was that these mysterious figures emerging from the spatial gate were, without exception, all Sun Profound cultivators.

"How... how... is this possible?"

This scene rendered Wu Yun incoherent.

He knew that his Heavenly Cloud Sect could only muster fifty-plus Sun Profound cultivators because they used secret arts to preserve the intact corpses of deceased elders throughout their history. Through certain specific means, they could make these corpses fight at roughly eighty percent of their living strength during critical moments.

But now.

The mysterious figures densely surrounding Zhong Qing were all Sun Profound cultivators.

A rough count put the number at over a thousand.

Over a thousand Sun Profound cultivators.

What kind of concept was that?!

Wu Yun simply couldn't believe it.

He watched as these suddenly appeared mysterious figures, each one throwing a punch toward the sky. Wu Yun's combined attack shattered instantly like scattered birds.

Simultaneously, the powerful residual force swept back toward Wu Yun and his forces.

Fortunately, Wu Yun and the others saw things going wrong and retreated desperately at the first opportunity.

But even so.

Over a dozen of Wu Yun's fifty-plus people had their bodies blown apart on the spot.

Another dozen or so were critically wounded, losing eighty percent of their combat ability.

The rest, though better off, were all visibly damaged.

As for Wu Yun himself, who had been at the forefront, he had lost an arm in that exchange. That was only because he was powerful enough—otherwise, he would have died right there.

Wu Yun quickly swallowed a pill and looked at the people around him, blood vessels bursting in his eyes.

He panted heavily as he stared at Zhong Qing, his gaze filled with both terror and hatred.

"You... what exactly are you?"

"What power do you come from?"

Zhong Qing looked at him with disdain and replied coldly with a question of his own. "Do you think asking me this now has any meaning?"

"Fine, fine, fine. I, Heavenly Cloud Sect, admit defeat this time. And I acknowledge that your fists are bigger." Wu Yun forced through the searing pain of his lost arm, his voice heavy. "So please leave Heavenly Cloud Sect now. I guarantee that Heavenly Cloud Sect will treat today as if it never happened. From now on, we'll stay out of each other's way. How about it?"

"???"

Zhong Qing stared at him with a face full of question marks, feeling somewhat bewildered.

And a bit like laughing.

"Are you trying to forgive me?"

"Acting like today never happened—do you still not understand the situation?"

"Still living in your delusions of grandeur?"

"What do you want?"

Wu Yun's face was ugly as he spoke. Only now did he finally realize that his Heavenly Cloud Sect had kicked an iron plate.

"I originally didn't want anything. I just wanted to bring my disciple here to honor a challenge agreement. But from the moment we entered your gates, your Heavenly Cloud Sect started being disgusting."

"But that would have been fine—I never wanted to escalate things."

"Even just moments ago, I gave you two chances. But unfortunately, it seems you didn't cherish them."

"You should know the old saying: 'Miss this village, and there's no next inn.'"

"And another saying: 'There's no medicine for regret.'"

"Since things have come to this point, there's no outcome but death."

"So now, all I can say is sorry—because from now on, I'm going to kill every single cockroach in your Heavenly Cloud Sect."

"Because I don't want someone popping up one day claiming to avenge Heavenly Cloud Sect."

"Not that I'm afraid, but I find it troublesome."

"Killing so many lives at once, I actually feel quite guilty. But the one they should really blame is you—it's you, this foolish Sect Master, who killed them."

Zhong Qing's calm voice drifted out.

While speaking, he simultaneously retrieved a table and chairs from his small world, set them up, sat down, and began brewing tea.

A few brief sentences had pronounced Heavenly Cloud Sect's death sentence.

Though he hadn't been in this world long, he was deeply familiar with its laws.

If he hadn't been strong today, if he hadn't had enough trump cards.

He and his disciple would have died without knowing how.

Not a single person in all of Heavenly Cloud Sect would have spoken a word for them—they would only have applauded.

Even if some among them were innocent.

So what?

From the moment you stepped onto the path of cultivation and joined a sect, you must be prepared to face all consequences.

Furthermore.

He couldn't afford to gamble.

Who knew if some heaven-blessed genius or child of destiny might emerge from among them, seeking revenge in the future?

He wasn't afraid.

But he had disciples, and might have family in the future.

The tea was good.

Zhong Qing shook his head and sipped.

When the cup in his hand touched down, over a thousand Sun Profound experts moved collectively!

This movement.

Was like the apocalypse for all of Heavenly Cloud Sect.

With a thunderous boom.

The connected buildings representing countless years of Heavenly Cloud Sect's effort collapsed.

The several elders beside Wu Yun instantly found themselves surrounded by a dozen Sun Profound experts each.

The more capable elders could struggle for a few moments.

But the weaker ones were turned into bloody rain within just a few exchanges.

"You... won't you accept my apology?"

Wu Yun's eyes were red, his whole body trembling.

In this moment, he was truly afraid, genuinely terrified.

Because if this continued, all of Heavenly Cloud Sect would be completely destroyed in his hands.

He also understood clearly that Zhong Qing was an existence he simply couldn't afford to offend.

He screamed hysterically at Zhong Qing, "You wanted me to kneel before your disciple and apologize! I'm willing! Is that enough?"

But Zhong Qing seemed not to hear his words, continuing to drink his tea.

Belated repentance was cheaper than grass.

What were you doing earlier?

Seeing Zhong Qing unmoved, Wu Yun was frantic with anxiety. Watching expert after expert being killed within the sect, building after building being destroyed, he was at a complete loss.

Suddenly.

He spotted Murong Xue fleeing through the chaos. Hatred filled his heart even as he grasped at this straw.

He stepped through the air and slapped Murong Xue to the ground.

"Slut! It's all you, you slut who brought this disaster upon us! Hurry over there and make him stop!"

"No, no, please no." By now, Murong Xue had completely lost her mind, acting as if she'd gone mad. When Wu Yun said this, she immediately fell to her knees, begging for mercy.

She couldn't understand how things had come to this.

Why did that trash she once spurned have such a being backing him?

Why had Zhong Qing chosen Lin Feng and not her? She had golden talent!

But Wu Yun ignored Murong Xue's pleas. He grabbed her and flung her through the air, landing her directly at Zhong Qing and Lin Feng's feet.
