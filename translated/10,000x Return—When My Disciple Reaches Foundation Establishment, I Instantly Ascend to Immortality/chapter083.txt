Chapter 83: Calm and Composed, Leading by Example

Tong Youwei's expression froze.

His eyes held too many emotions that couldn't be clearly named.

There was the excitement and shock of seeing his idols.

And utter incomprehension of their behavior.

In that moment, he even wondered if his eyes and ears were failing him—if he'd seen and heard wrong.

He rubbed his eyes repeatedly.

Finally confirming—he hadn't seen wrong.

These really were his former idols, Holy Land elders, existences standing at the very pinnacle of the Eastern Region's alchemy world.

After a long while, he finally suppressed his shock.

With an expression of utter disbelief, he asked:

"Could the two Seniors repeat what you just said? I didn't hear clearly."

He had expected them to fly into a rage.

After all, who were they?

And who was he?

Plus, this Shi Xiaotian was famously bad-tempered.

Mercurial and volatile.

Tong Youwei had even prepared himself to weather a storm of fury.

Yet Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian were remarkably cordial.

"Elder, I am Wu Yue, seven hundred forty-three years old. We have officially joined Command Hall Peak as outer sect disciples. We'd appreciate it if you could register us."

"Elder, I am Shi Xiaotian, seven hundred twenty-one years old. We have officially joined Command Hall Peak as outer sect disciples. We'd appreciate it if you could register us."

The two spoke in unison.

Receiving confirmation again, Tong Youwei was utterly dumbfounded.

He hadn't misheard.

Their appearances matched, their names matched.

But how could grand Holy Land elders, towering giants of the alchemy world...

Actually come to Immortal River Sect and sign up as outer sect disciples?

Why?

Along with his shock came a million questions.

Moreover, these two's attitudes weren't at all like the rumored volatile temperaments—they were actually quite pleasant.

"P-please wait a moment!"

This was too absurd, like something out of a fantasy.

Tong Youwei felt that personages of this caliber were simply beyond his capacity to receive.

He had to report this immediately.

And report it all the way to the Sect Master.

"Please take your time, Elder."

Tong Youwei had been very polite.

But Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian were even more so.

On one side, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian waited patiently in the Registration Hall.

On the other side, Tong Youwei shot off at what was surely the fastest speed of his entire life, trailing sparks and lightning all the way to Immortal River Hall!

His usually hunched posture and slight limp were gone. Now his back was straight, his legs strong.

Throughout the sect grounds!

Several disciples who had been cultivating suddenly felt something whoosh past them.

"What was that?"

The speed was so fast it left afterimages.

Between those afterimages, there were even sparks and embers.

That was from the extreme speed creating intense friction with the void.

This left the disciples gaping.

"Seemed like... a person?"

"Which master of our sect possesses such world-shaking speed?"

"And what heaven-defying technique is this?"

The disciples chattered amongst themselves.

"If I saw right, that looked like Elder Tong Youwei of Pill Peak?"

Someone said in amazement.

"Impossible, absolutely impossible!"

The moment these words came out, a chorus of denials erupted.

They knew Elder Tong Youwei had a chronic leg condition—his speed was anything but fast.

Someone with a leg ailment—how could they possibly possess such terrifying speed?

The crowd's reaction made the disciple who'd recognized Tong Youwei doubt himself.

"Maybe... I saw wrong?"

"What do you mean 'maybe'? You definitely saw wrong!"

While denying it, everyone speculated about which sect master or powerhouse it could have been.

But guess as they might, they couldn't figure out who.

They could only suppress their curiosity, planning to ask their own masters later.

Before long, a bizarre scene played out across Immortal River Sect.

In multiple locations simultaneously: "Master, does our sect have a movement technique so fast it creates sparks?"

This left their masters collectively baffled.

How come I don't know our sect has such an incredible technique?

This was merely a small episode in the daily cultivation of Immortal River Sect's disciples.

At this moment, in Immortal River Hall!

Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong and the sect's upper echelon were in session.

The topic of discussion was the upcoming Seven Peaks Competition.

Just as everyone was deep in heated debate...

Tong Youwei's figure burst directly into Immortal River Hall.

"Sect... Sect Master!"

"Elder Tong, what's got you in such a rush?"

"I'm not trying to criticize you."

"You're a peak elder, with considerable authority."

"Even if the sky falls, you should stay calm and composed, leading by example."

"Barging in like this—what kind of behavior is that?"

Xuanyuan Hong frowned in rebuke.

"Sect Master, two great elders from Infinity Sect—the towering giants of the Eastern Region's alchemy world, Lord Wu Yue and Lord Shi Xiaotian—want to become outer sect disciples at Command Hall Peak. They're waiting at the Registration Hall right now. Could you please go receive them personally?"

"Holy f—"

Xuanyuan Hong's eyes went wide instantly, and he shot up from his seat.

The previously noisy hall fell instantly silent—you could hear a pin drop.

Collective stunned silence.

One by one, they dug at their ears, wondering if they'd heard wrong.

"What... what did you say?"

"Could you repeat that?"

Someone asked with trembling hands and quivering voice.

Tong Youwei understood their reaction completely.

Because when he'd first heard it, he'd reacted the same way.

He repeated himself once more.

This time, the hall filled with the sound of sharp intakes of breath.

By now, Xuanyuan Hong had realized how he'd lost his composure.

He straightened his robes.

Then pointed at the assembled leadership, scolding them like they were a disappointment:

"Look at yourselves!"

"Look at that sorry state!"

"It's just two Holy Land elders!"

"If they're willing to join Command Hall Peak, that shows they have good taste."

"What's there to make such a fuss about?"

These words had everyone rolling their eyes.

Good lord.

Who was it that yelled "holy f—" first?

So you get to be shocked, but we're not allowed a moment of surprise?

Isn't this...

You know what they say—the magistrate can set fires, but the common folk can't even light a lamp?

The assembled leadership mentally condemned and scorned Xuanyuan Hong's behavior.

At this point, Xuanyuan Hong addressed Tong Youwei: "You're saying those two are currently waiting at the Registration Hall?"

Tong Youwei nodded woodenly.

"Then what are we waiting for? Come with me to receive them!"

Xuanyuan Hong was frantic. As he spoke, he was already striding out, rushing off at full speed.

Behind him, the rest of the leadership followed close behind.

As for Tong Youwei, he was left standing there, frozen in place.

For a man over a hundred and fifty years old, he looked rather adorably dazed.

What he was thinking about was Xuanyuan Hong's earlier rebuke.

As a leader, you must mind your image.

Barging in recklessly—what kind of behavior is that?

Calm and composed, leading by example...

So this was the Sect Master's version of leading by example?

He felt there wasn't really any difference from himself.
