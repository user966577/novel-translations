Chapter 94: Just the Two of You?

Command Hall Peak!

With the return of the disciples, this place once again gained a touch of human warmth.

Zhong Qing continued his relentless assault on the Soul-Tempering Pill!

Unfortunately, the results remained unsatisfactory.

After yet another explosion—he'd lost count how many—he turned his gaze to the two outer sect disciples waiting nearby.

"You two, come help me out."

In the end, he chose to ask Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian for assistance.

"Right away!"

At these words, both became excited.

Though their Peak Master's alchemy talent was, well, hard to describe—

Helping out was something they loved doing.

After all, this was one of the few opportunities to legitimately observe their Peak Master's pill formulas.

They busied themselves, front and back.

In their spare moments, they made sure to memorize every detail of the formula.

"Truly worthy of an ancient miraculous pill!"

"Using only the simplest ingredients to refine a supreme divine pill of extraordinary quality."

"If this formula were to spread, it would drive the entire Pill Cauldron Pavilion mad with desire!"

Wu Yue's expression was animated as he watched and commented.

Shi Xiaotian agreed: "Indeed!"

"Such a miraculous formula, with its ingenious design and extraordinary function, surpasses the common formulas on the market by a hundred times—no, a thousand times!"

Of course, their flattery didn't interfere with their actual work.

Under their guidance and assistance, Zhong Qing's refinement went much more smoothly this time.

Though "smoothly" referred only to the process—actually producing a pill was still a long way off.

As noon approached—

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian's expressions suddenly froze.

In their perception, a familiar aura had appeared not far from Command Hall Peak.

"Why is he here?"

The two exchanged glances.

Both recognized the identity of the newcomer from that familiar aura.

It was Infinity Sect's Sect Master—Ouyang Hao!

"Could he be here for us?"

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian communicated with their eyes.

Speculating about Ouyang Hao's purpose.

But regardless, they couldn't let him disturb Zhong Qing.

If they upset that lord, they'd really be in big trouble.

With this in mind—

Wu Yue quietly said to Zhong Qing: "Peak Master, an old acquaintance has come to visit. Might we step out to receive them?"

"Go ahead!"

Zhong Qing said dismissively.

With Zhong Qing's permission, the two rose and left Command Hall Peak.

Shortly after leaving, they spotted Ouyang Hao descending from the sky.

The two sides met, the atmosphere somewhat cold.

Ouyang Hao landed, his gaze on them filled with complexity.

Originally, he'd been telling himself throughout the journey that saving the Old Ancestor came first; other trivial matters could wait.

But now that the moment had arrived—

He couldn't hold back.

In the end, a thousand words condensed into a single question.

"Why?"

This soul-searching question made Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian somewhat uncomfortable.

After all, they had been the first to act inappropriately.

But if given another chance, they would still choose to leave Infinity Sect and join Immortal River Sect.

After a long silence, Wu Yue stepped forward and said slowly:

"Sect Master, it's a long story."

"Let's not discuss it now."

"You came looking for us—surely not just to hold us accountable?"

These words left Ouyang Hao momentarily speechless.

Indeed!

He'd come not to hold them accountable, but to ask for their help.

This was... quite frustrating.

But thinking of the Old Ancestor's critical condition, he pushed everything else aside.

He quickly explained the Old Ancestor's current situation—that only by combining all of Pill Peak's alchemists would they have any chance of refining a soul-healing pill.

The two didn't refuse.

"Please wait, Sect Master. For this trip, we need to request our Peak Master's permission."

Wu Yue's attitude left Ouyang Hao feeling somewhat melancholy.

After all, even when these two were in Infinity Sect, they'd never been this respectful to him.

He found it incredible.

Both were leaders.

He was a Holy Land's Sect Master.

One could say he stood above ten thousand.

Zhong Qing was merely a peak master of a second-tier sect.

How had he earned their unwavering loyalty? What charisma made them so devoted that even a simple outing required reporting?

As Wu Yue went in to explain the situation to Zhong Qing—

Shi Xiaotian seemed to read Ouyang Hao's confusion.

He said: "Sect Master, the situation is complicated."

"Why we're willing to serve as outer sect disciples here—once you return with us, you'll understand!"

Before long, Wu Yue emerged from the small courtyard.

Regarding their plan to return to Infinity Sect to refine pills and save someone, Zhong Qing had naturally given his permission.

"Sect Master, saving lives brooks no delay. Let's hurry!"

The two still held deep feelings for Infinity Sect.

And they understood that the Old Ancestor's life hung by a thread.

Without any delay, they departed from Command Hall Peak.

After a day of urgent travel, they finally reached Infinity Sect.

Infinity Hall!

With Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian's arrival, the leadership waiting in the hall felt a surge of hope.

With these two here, the Old Ancestor had a chance.

At this point, the Sixth Elder stepped forward: "Old White, Old Black, I'm sure the Sect Master has explained the situation."

"Time is short, the task heavy. I hope you'll both give your utmost."

"But don't feel too pressured. This is a collective effort by Pill Peak—you two just need to assist and perform normally."

Wu Yue pondered briefly, saying nothing.

As Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian took their positions—

Ouyang Hao waved his hand, and everyone from Pill Peak was assembled in Infinity Hall.

Simultaneously, various spiritual medicines and materials were prepared, piled high like mountains!

Among them, every single herb was of extraordinary value.

Including high-grade and top-grade spiritual medicines.

Even a few Medicine Kings were mixed in.

At this moment, the full depth of a Holy Land's resources was on full display.

The bustling hall—

Infinity Sect's alchemists were arguing endlessly.

This was a collective refinement effort.

Some felt that whoever had the strongest fire control should lead.

Others thought that whoever possessed the most abundant spiritual energy should take charge.

But despite lengthy debate, no consensus emerged.

After all, the matter was too significant—it concerned their Old Ancestor's life and death.

If the Old Ancestor fell, Infinity Sect might well drop from Holy Land status.

No one could bear that responsibility.

Seeing the endless argument—

Shi Xiaotian and Wu Yue exchanged glances, as if reaching some decision.

Then Shi Xiaotian spoke up: "Everyone, why don't we two handle this refinement?"

At these words, the entire hall went silent in shock.

"You two?"

Ouyang Hao looked at Shi Xiaotian.

His expression full of doubt.

It wasn't that he was suppressing them because they'd left Infinity Sect.

He genuinely didn't believe Shi Xiaotian and Wu Yue could lead this effort. While their alchemy skills were indeed strong, compared to all of Pill Peak, they didn't even rank.
