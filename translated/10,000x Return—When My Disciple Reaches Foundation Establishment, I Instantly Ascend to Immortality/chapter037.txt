Chapter 37: Why Does This Person Look So Familiar?

Yet even with all these preparations, everyone's faces were etched with tension.

The slightest disturbance set their nerves on edge.

Because the threat posed by a Sun Profound cultivator was simply too great—especially when their prized formations might be useless against this particular person.

In this anxious wait at Myriad Dao Mountain.

The sun climbed high.

Zhuge Qing patrolled everywhere, guarding against any problems.

The other elders also watched their surroundings intently, alert for Heavenly Calamity's sudden attack.

Soon.

It was noon.

"Although Heavenly Calamity hasn't appeared yet, he may have already reached Myriad Dao Mountain's vicinity. Everyone, stay vigilant." Zhuge Qing reminded everyone.

Yet as they waited.

Another afternoon passed.

The sun set, casting crimson hues across Myriad Dao Mountain.

"Is Heavenly Calamity planning a night attack?"

"Quite possible. We've waited for him all day without him showing. By nightfall, we'll naturally assume he's not coming and lower our guard. That's when he might suddenly appear and catch us off guard."

"We absolutely cannot let our guard down."

Several elders conversed secretly in hushed tones.

In this tense wait, even with their high cultivation, the mental strain was immense.

Each of them took a Spirit-Nourishing Pill and continued standing ready.

Night in the mountains.

Growing darker and darker.

Aside from the brightly lit area within Myriad Dao Mountain's bounds, everywhere else was pitch black—you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.

No one knew what lurked in that darkness.

Until...

"Cock-a-doodle-doo..."

A rooster crowed from somewhere in the forest.

Everyone looked up and realized they'd unknowingly waited through the entire night. A second sun was rising in the east.

"Heavenly Calamity didn't come yesterday. Did we get the day wrong?"

Zhuge Qing gathered with several senior elders.

"Impossible. It was definitely yesterday."

"Do you think Heavenly Calamity deliberately spread false information to wear down our morale? Once we're mentally exhausted, he'll suddenly strike?"

"Indeed. I agree with the Grand Elder. Someone like Heavenly Calamity has no integrity to speak of."

"Quite possible..."

Zhuge Qing nodded gravely, then ordered, "Pass the word: all formations remain active. No one is to relax."

"Yes."

The order went out.

All of Myriad Dao Mountain remained on high alert.

But time flew.

Another seven days passed.

Let alone Heavenly Calamity attacking, they hadn't seen hide nor hair of him.

The various scouts Myriad Dao Mountain had sent out also had no news of Heavenly Calamity. It was as if he had simply evaporated from the world.

Zhuge Qing and the assembled elders sat in the great hall, completely bewildered.

The script was all wrong.

This wasn't Heavenly Calamity's style at all.

Given the situation, Myriad Dao Mountain tentatively resumed partial sect operations. Nothing happened.

That day.

By a waterfall.

Near Leng Ning and Qingniao's cave dwelling.

The two women stood in a pavilion. Before them sat a coffin.

Inside the coffin, an eerie-looking young man lay quietly.

Since cultivators' bodies didn't decay easily, even after many days, the corpse looked much the same as when he'd just died.

"Sister, when will the Heavenly Calamity threat finally be over?"

Looking at the body before them, Qingniao rubbed her temples. "This fellow in the coffin is like a thorn in my heart. Until I remove it, I feel terrible. I really want to figure out who he is and let him rest in peace."

"But with Heavenly Calamity's threat still looming, we can't leave to investigate his identity. Ugh."

"Just wait a bit longer." Leng Ning also frowned, consoling her. "Heavenly Calamity's threat is too great. Until he's dead, the risk of leaving the sect is too high."

"Alright."

Qingniao could only nod helplessly.

"What are you two girls doing here?" Just then, the immortal-looking Elder Yidao walked over from nearby.

"Greetings, Master."

The two women quickly bowed, then said, "Master, we were just discussing what to do about this person."

Elder Yidao also noticed the coffin and couldn't help but approach for a look.

"The one killed by the figurine is this fellow?"

"Such a fine young man, just dead like that. What a pity."

"Such is fate..."

Elder Yidao sighed with feeling.

"Master, what brings you to visit us?" Qingniao couldn't help asking.

"These past few days have been mentally exhausting. I just finished meditating to recover, and since there's nothing happening at the moment, I thought I'd check on you two." Elder Yidao said.

Just as he finished speaking.

The Myriad Dao Bell suddenly rang.

Elder Yidao raised an eyebrow and looked toward the distance.

"The bell again. The Sect Master has called another elder meeting. You two chat—I need to go."

Elder Yidao said helplessly, then stepped into the air and flew toward the great hall.

By the time Elder Yidao arrived, most of the sect's leadership had already assembled.

"Everyone, I've gathered you again because of the Heavenly Calamity matter."

"Heavenly Calamity hasn't come yet, but that doesn't mean he won't."

"And given Heavenly Calamity's eccentric methods, we can't rule out that he's already arrived at Myriad Dao Mountain—perhaps hiding somewhere, watching us."

"He might even have disguised himself as a disciple and infiltrated our ranks."

"Though this possibility is small, we can't afford not to guard against it."

Zhuge Qing spoke from the head of the hall.

The assembled leaders nodded gravely.

They agreed with Zhuge Qing's words.

Given Heavenly Calamity's twisted and peculiar personality, there was nothing he wouldn't do.

"Since some elders weren't yet members three hundred years ago, or for various reasons never saw Heavenly Calamity and don't recognize him, I've found a recording captured on a Myriad Dao Stone from back then."

"This recording shows Heavenly Calamity setting up a formation while he was still at our Myriad Dao Mountain."

"By watching this, everyone can familiarize themselves with Heavenly Calamity, observe his aura, mannerisms, and movements."

"After watching, when you patrol Myriad Dao Mountain, pay close attention. If you encounter anyone with similar behavior and movements, report immediately."

The assembled leaders nodded.

There was nothing wrong with Zhuge Qing being this cautious. It was better to be prepared.

As Zhuge Qing's voice fell, he waved his hand.

Above everyone's heads, an image appeared in mid-air.

In the image.

A young man in black sat cross-legged, hands forming seals.

His features were quite distinctive—triangular eyes, hooked nose, cheekbones devoid of flesh, skin pale to an unhealthy, almost sickly degree.

In his seat.

Elder Yidao also studied the image overhead carefully.

Although he'd been an elder at Myriad Dao Mountain three hundred years ago, he'd been in seclusion at the time, researching an advanced formation. Heavenly Calamity had joined Myriad Dao Mountain during his seclusion.

By the time he emerged, Myriad Dao Mountain had already expelled Heavenly Calamity and organized the siege.

So from beginning to end, he'd never seen Heavenly Calamity.

Only now was he truly seeing what this legendary Heavenly Calamity looked like.

But why.

Did this person look so familiar?
