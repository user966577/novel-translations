Chapter 24: Shameless Flattery Taken to the Extreme

What was going on?

Had the world gone mad, or had their ears malfunctioned?

Everyone exchanged bewildered glances, filled with disbelief.

Carrying heavy confusion, Lin Hanyi and the others hurried to the guest hall.

Sure enough.

The guest hall was packed with people—all the heads of prominent families in Fengtian City.

Besides these people, the entrance to the guest hall was piled high with packages of all sizes—gold, silver, and jewels stacked into a small mountain.

When they saw Lin Hanyi emerge with the family's leadership, those who had been waiting rushed forward to greet them.

"Ah, Brother Lin, it's been too long."

The Fang family head was the first to step forward, acting like a friend of several decades. He gripped Lin Hanyi's hands tightly, his face all smiles. "Brother Lin, do you remember eighty years ago, outside Fengtian City, when we dug for loaches together? Thinking back on it now, what wonderful memories!"

"Of course, today I've come not just to reminisce. I also heard that some worthless scoundrel in my Fang family had his eye on your shops, causing some unpleasantness between our two families."

"Alas, I was in closed-door seclusion before. I only learned of this today when I emerged. Such a terrible mistake!"

"But rest assured—as soon as I came out of seclusion, I severely punished that scoundrel and completely stripped him of his position. And I came here immediately with gifts to apologize."

"So I hope Brother Lin won't hold it against our Fang family!"

"Come, bring forward the gifts."

With that, the Fang family presented several storage rings, each containing valuables worth a fortune.

However.

Before the Fang family head could finish, the Gu family head pushed forward with a single step.

"Brother Hanyi, I've wronged you so!"

The Gu family head wailed, shaking his head and sighing. "My clan members told me they'd discovered an unclaimed mine outside the city, so I brought people to develop it. But who could have known—who could have known it actually belonged to someone? It was yours, Brother Hanyi!"

"When I found out, the guilt I felt... We had clearly taken someone else's property. I didn't investigate properly and just went ahead mining, causing such a huge misunderstanding between our Lin and Gu families."

"I... I'm not even human. I've wronged your Lin family."

As he spoke, the Gu family head even slapped himself twice, a look of utter remorse on his face. "Brother Hanyi, I've come today mainly to clear up the misunderstanding between our families, so please don't take offense."

"Of course, to make up for my Gu family's mistake, I plan to compensate you with two of our finest mines outside the city."

"My people have already completely withdrawn. Brother Hanyi, you can send people to take over at any time!"

For a while.

Inside the Lin family guest hall, the various family heads began putting on all manner of clumsy performances.

To curry favor with the Lin family, they would stop at nothing.

Some came to propose marriage.

Some wanted to become sworn brothers with Lin Hanyi.

Some wanted to invite the entire Lin family to dinner.

One family head, truly at a loss for how to ingratiate himself—despite being half a year older than Lin Hanyi—actually knelt on the ground and asked Lin Hanyi to adopt him as a godson.

The whole scene was utterly embarrassing.

Yet also extremely realistic.

Throughout history, across different eras and places, it had always been this way.

A true reflection of reality.

Lin Hanyi and the others stared wide-eyed, completely bewildered.

Looking at these fawning people before them felt like a dream.

One moment they'd been clamoring to attack the Lin family; the next, they were at the door apologizing. The sheer audacity of their about-face was staggering.

"You all..."

Lin Hanyi looked at everyone in confusion.

Just then, a servant came to report from outside. "Family Head! Family Head! The Young Master has returned!"

"What? Feng'er has returned?"

Hearing this, Lin Hanyi and the others abandoned the crowd of family heads and hurried toward the entrance.

"Is it Lin Feng?"

"Quick, quick, let's follow."

Those family heads, hearing this, also followed behind Lin Hanyi and the others.

At the entrance, Lin Feng was just stepping through the gate, carrying large and small packages, with Zhong Qing and his puppet following behind.

"Feng'er."

"You're back safe and sound—that's wonderful."

Seeing Lin Feng, Lin Hanyi immediately teared up and pulled him into a tight embrace.

Ever since the Murong family had broken off the engagement, the devastated Lin Feng had left Fengtian City without a trace.

Many had said Lin Feng had already died out there somewhere.

Now, seeing Lin Feng return safely, how could Lin Hanyi, as his father, not be overjoyed?

"You're back, that's what matters. You're back, that's what matters."

The other Lin family elders also crowded around Lin Feng, fussing over him, checking him over. Seeing him safe and sound, their faces were full of excitement.

"Father, esteemed elders, these are gifts I brought for you."

Lin Feng held up his various packages, distributing them to everyone.

"You silly boy. It's enough that you're safe. You even thought to bring us gifts."

Lin Hanyi and the elders beamed, unable to stop smiling. Though the gifts weren't particularly valuable, receiving them still made them immensely happy.

"By the way, who are these two?"

Only then did Lin Hanyi notice Zhong Qing and the black-clothed man behind Lin Feng.

"Oh yes, Father, esteemed elders, let me introduce you. This is my master, Zhong Qing. As for the other gentleman, I don't know his name yet."

"What? Feng'er has actually taken a master?"

Hearing this, Lin Hanyi and the others couldn't have been more thrilled. Someone had finally accepted Lin Feng as a disciple, regardless of his talent.

"We greet Feng'er's master and this other gentleman."

Lin Hanyi and the others bowed in unison.

"Please, there's no need for such formality."

Zhong Qing smiled warmly. "The one behind me is my attendant. You may call him Heibai."

As he spoke, Zhong Qing also transmitted a message to the black-clothed puppet behind him. "From now on, your name is Heibai."

"Yes."

The black-clothed puppet lowered his head.

"So this is Sir Heibai. Everyone, let's not stand around here. Please, please, come inside."

Meanwhile, the crowd of family heads had retreated to the sides, their eyes full of awe and reverence as they looked at Zhong Qing and Heibai, whispering among themselves.

"That black-clothed man is the one who revealed his Moon Profound aura at the tavern."

"And judging by his demeanor and what was just said, he's definitely the white-robed man's servant. And that white-robed man is Lin Feng's master."

"Indeed, it seems the rumors were true. The Lin family has stumbled into incredible fortune."

"Good thing we were clever and showed our allegiance quickly."

Meanwhile, Lin Hanyi finally remembered that a crowd of family heads was still waiting outside.

So after seating Zhong Qing in the place of honor, he said, "Lord Zhong, please wait a moment. There are some trivial matters I need to handle. I'll be right back."

"Esteemed elders, please take good care of Lord Zhong."

With that, Lin Hanyi walked back toward the family heads.

But hearing Lin Hanyi's words, the family heads quickly waved their hands and called out, "Family Head Lin, there's no need! Don't worry about us! Just attend to the Immortal. We'll just squat here, that's fine."

"Yes, yes, we'll just squat here. Don't mind us."
