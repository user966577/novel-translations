Chapter 26: Nothing Is Harder Than Being an Ordinary Person

"Oh?"

"A mysterious reward."

Curiosity had always been his strong suit.

This mysterious reward immediately piqued his interest.

The key was that lately, this damn system seemed to be getting more and more reliable.

"Family Head Lin, this demon beast has harmed countless people. Now that I've encountered it, I naturally must rid the people of this menace." Zhong Qing looked at Lin Hanyi with a smile. "Tomorrow morning, I'll make a trip there."

"Thank you, Senior Zhong."

Lin Hanyi was overjoyed.

After excusing himself from Zhong Qing, he quickly brought the good news to Bai Chen.

"Senior Zhong is willing to act? That's wonderful!"

Bai Chen looked excited, finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. "Then I'll go back and make preparations first. I'll come to welcome Senior Zhong early tomorrow morning."

After bidding farewell to Lin Hanyi, Bai Chen returned to the City Lord's mansion to make arrangements.

Early the next morning.

Under Bai Chen's leadership, the City Lord's mansion brought a large retinue to the Lin family bright and early.

Meanwhile, as the City Lord's mansion made arrangements, news that Zhong Qing was going out today to slay the demon also spread throughout Fengtian City.

So when Bai Chen arrived at the Lin family gates, all manner of people from every walk of life in Fengtian City had also gathered there.

"I heard the great master staying with the Lin family is going out to slay the demon today."

"Yes, yes. Before, it was only servants at the tavern who felt the aura his attendant released, but none of us have actually seen him in action."

"That's right. Whether he's a dragon or a worm remains to be seen."

"We'll find out soon enough."

When Zhong Qing came to the Lin family's main gate as agreed, he was also taken aback by the spectacle.

The street was packed with spectators, completely blocking the road.

Among these crowds, there were quite a few ordinary mortals.

Just then, an old woman carrying a basket stepped forward and knelt directly before Zhong Qing.

"Immortal, Immortal, please help us rid Fengtian City of this menace and avenge my son."

The old woman knelt on the ground, sobbing uncontrollably.

"Yes, Immortal, please help us eliminate this scourge!"

"My daughter was also brutally killed by that beast."

"Please, Immortal, you must help us."

After the old woman, more ordinary people knelt in unison, their attitudes reverent as they pleaded.

As they knelt and begged, these ordinary folk offered up what they had in their hands.

Some presented rough cloth bundles containing bits of silver and copper coins, odds and ends.

Some brought baskets of eggs.

Some offered embroidered shoe insoles that elderly hands had sewn one stitch at a time.

All manner of miscellaneous items.

Looking at this group of ordinary, common people, and then at the humble gifts they offered—objects that couldn't be more ordinary—Zhong Qing, who had long since immersed himself in this world of cultivation, found himself momentarily dazed.

To him, this was just accompanying his disciple down the mountain, wanting to obtain a system reward, and casually slaying a demon.

But to these ordinary folk, it might mean vengeance for their grievances, or simply peace and security.

Indeed!

In this world, nothing was harder than being an ordinary person!

"I shall not fail you."

Zhong Qing lifted his hand, and a gentle force raised these ordinary people to their feet.

"Thank you, Immortal."

Seeing Zhong Qing agree, everyone's expressions filled with excitement. They passionately tried to press their gifts upon him.

"Everyone, please keep your gifts. Take them back." Zhong Qing declined.

"Immortal, please accept them."

"Yes, yes. If you don't take them, we won't feel at ease."

Looking at the insistent crowd, Zhong Qing smiled wryly. He reached into the basket of the old woman who had first stepped forward and took out a plain steamed bun.

"This bun is enough."

Zhong Qing took a gentle bite, then laughed heartily. Bidding farewell to the common folk, he walked toward Bai Chen.

"I am Bai Chen, City Lord of Fengtian City. I greet Senior Zhong."

Bai Chen hurried forward and bowed respectfully.

"City Lord Bai, too kind." Zhong Qing smiled faintly.

"That Senior is willing to rid our Fengtian City of demons—this is only proper." Bai Chen lowered his head and said, "Please board the carriage, Senior."

With that, Bai Chen indicated the direction.

When Zhong Qing saw the carriage, he was mildly surprised.

It turned out Bai Chen had prepared eight horned dragon-horses for his reception. These dragon-horses were all at the Xiantian realm. Arranged in neat rows, they pulled an extremely luxurious palanquin.

At the center of the palanquin was an embroidered silk couch. Before the couch was spread a feast of delicacies and fruits.

Around the couch were beauties playing the zither, and others playing the flute.

Behind the palanquin stood city guards in black armor, holding long spears, arranged in two long lines—a full two hundred of them.

Originally, Zhong Qing hadn't wanted to be so conspicuous.

He'd planned to just go there directly and kill the demon beast. But seeing the nervous look in Bai Chen's eyes, he decided not to reject the kind gesture.

With a faint smile, he agreed, "Very well."

With Zhong Qing's consent, the grand procession set off toward the city outskirts.

Before long, the large group arrived about fifty li outside the city.

At this point, Bai Chen, also clad in armor, approached Zhong Qing and cupped his fists respectfully. "Senior, the demon beast has been spotted in this general area."

"Mm."

Zhong Qing nodded and lightly leaped down from the carriage.

Since entering this area, he'd felt the environment change.

Gnarled trees, strange rocks.

The air was filled with a violent aura.

"Do you know what realm this demon beast is at?" Zhong Qing asked.

"That... I'm sorry..."

Bai Chen said with embarrassment, "Everyone who has actually seen the beast's true form has died. I've only caught a distant glimpse of it myself. I couldn't discern its aura at all."

"I see."

Zhong Qing nodded. It seemed he would have to investigate personally.

Just as he was about to tell everyone to wait here while he went in alone, a thunderous roar suddenly erupted from the nearby forest.

Everyone instinctively looked up.

A three-headed demon wolf, dozens of meters long, burst into the sky and collided with two brilliant sword lights.

Instantly, the forest rumbled.

Sound after sound boomed as if an earthquake had struck.

"What terrifying commotion."

"Someone is already fighting the demon beast?"

Bai Chen asked in shock.

Zhong Qing nodded, his expression calm as he looked up at the distant battle.

"Boom boom boom boom boom..."

The rumbling continued...

But those two sword lights, despite their brilliance, seemed to have little effect on the three-headed demon wolf. Under the wolf's savage attacks, they were being pushed back.

Finally, after another series of collisions, the owners of the two sword lights were sent flying in streaks of light, crashing into the forest like cannonballs.
