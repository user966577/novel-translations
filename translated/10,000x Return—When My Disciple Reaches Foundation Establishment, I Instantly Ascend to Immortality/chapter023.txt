Chapter 23: Check-In Reward—Moon Profound Puppet

In the tavern.

Everyone gossiped amongst themselves.

Clearly, Lin Feng was something of a minor celebrity in Heaven's Mandate City.

The old Lin Feng might have felt burning shame at such discussions, but after following Zhong Qing, his horizons and mindset had long since changed.

He knew that as long as he displayed formidable strength, this idle chatter would silence itself.

However, when he heard someone speaking ill of his master, he still couldn't sit still.

He slapped the table and was about to teach that person a lesson.

But Zhong Qing patted his shoulder, indicating that such characters weren't worth the trouble. Stooping to their level would only ruin his appetite.

"Remember, your future opponents are the stars and the sea."

"Not the small fish and shrimp in little ponds." Zhong Qing smiled softly.

"Yes, Master."

Lin Feng obediently sat back down.

Master and disciple sat by the window and began drinking together.

After a couple of cups, Zhong Qing couldn't help but turn his gaze toward the distant horizon.

At the edge of the horizon, a figure was flying toward them.

His system allowed daily check-ins. Even though the check-ins had long since stopped surprising him, it had become a habit.

And today's check-in reward was precisely this approaching figure.

"A Moon Profound puppet. Not bad at all."

Zhong Qing's lips curved upward.

With this puppet, the next time he had to deal with someone like Red-Haired Ghost, he could just send the puppet out.

Moments later, the black-clothed figure flew directly toward the tavern.

The powerful aura it carried instantly pressed down on everyone present, making them unable to catch their breath. One by one, they lowered their heads, not daring to make a sound.

"How could such a powerful expert appear in our Heaven's Mandate City!"

"Who knows which great master this is, and what they're doing in our Heaven's Mandate City."

"Everyone speak quietly. Whatever you do, don't offend them."

However.

What no one expected was that this mysterious expert who had flown in from the horizon suddenly knelt on one knee before Zhong Qing.

"This humble one greets the Master!"

This single statement.

Immediately set off a massive uproar throughout the tavern.

Heavens.

What had they just heard?

An expert with such terrifying cultivation was kneeling on the ground calling someone else Master?

And it was that person sitting with Lin Feng—the same one they'd been gossiping about earlier!

What kind of terrifying identity did that white-robed young man sitting with Lin Feng possess?

How had Lin Feng gotten connected to such a person?

For a moment, everyone who had been gossiping earlier wished they could stick their heads under the tables, terrified that Zhong Qing had heard their earlier remarks and would make trouble for them.

However.

Zhong Qing clearly had no interest in them.

"First retract your cultivation aura, then follow behind me." Zhong Qing looked the puppet up and down. It was virtually indistinguishable from a real person, complete with lifelike energy and aura, and it could follow his commands completely.

He had to admit, he was quite satisfied with this puppet.

"Yes, Master."

The black-clothed man nodded respectfully, then fell silent and took position behind Zhong Qing.

"Master, who is this?"

Lin Feng, seeing this black-clothed man, was clearly quite shocked as well.

"A subordinate I took in previously."

Zhong Qing couldn't very well say the black-clothed man was obtained from a system check-in, so he made up an excuse.

"A subordinate? Master is truly impressive."

Lin Feng was amazed. Such an unfathomably powerful expert was calling his master "Master."

"Stay calm, stay calm."

Inside the Desolate Ring, Sword Elder was relatively composed, speaking leisurely. "Given how terrifying your master is, having a Moon Profound servant is perfectly normal, isn't it?"

"Moon Profound!!!"

Lin Feng was even more shocked. He had never imagined the black-clothed man before him was at Moon Profound.

Even now, Moon Profound cultivation remained an unreachably lofty existence in his eyes.

And so.

After the trio of one master, one disciple, and one servant had eaten and drunk their fill, they finally walked out of the small tavern.

"Master, I need to stop by the Lin family home. The clan members have always treated me very well. I've saved up some money, so I'd like to go to Treasure Pavilion first and buy some gifts to bring them." After leaving the tavern, Lin Feng spoke respectfully.

"Good. Master will accompany you. Buy whatever you want—if you don't have enough money, I have more." Zhong Qing smiled.

"Alright, thank you, Master."

Zhong Qing and the others headed toward Treasure Pavilion.

As they left, the entire tavern erupted into commotion.

"Did you hear that? Lin Feng was actually calling that white-robed man Master!"

"Yeah, how did Lin Feng stumble into such good fortune? How did he end up with such a powerful master? Isn't he supposed to be trash?"

"Regardless of how it happened, with the Lin family latching onto this powerful backer, they're bound to rise!"

"This is incredible, incredible."

While everyone gossiped, someone quickly spread the news.

In a luxurious private room nearby, a young noble who had witnessed the entire scene swallowed hard. He abandoned the women he'd worked so hard to invite out, leaving them standing there, and hurried home with his attendants.

The guests in several other private rooms did the same.

Heaven's Mandate City, south side.

The Lin Family.

Among the many families in Heaven's Mandate City, the Lin family was considered second-tier.

At this moment, in the Lin family's main hall, the family head, elders, and various high-ranking members were all present.

Deep worry flickered in their expressions.

"Family Head, the Fang family from the east side of the city is bullying us. They've already swallowed up more than half of our Lin family's shops. If we don't think of something soon, our family's businesses will be completely devoured!"

The Grand Elder spoke with a grave expression.

"Indeed, Family Head. It's not just the Fang family. The Gu family from the west side is also eyeing us hungrily. They've set their sights on the mine we've been developing outside the city. They've even threatened that if we don't hand over the mine ourselves, they'll attack our Lin family before long."

Another elder spoke with hatred in his voice.

For a moment.

The entire hall was filled with sighs of despair.

Family Head Lin Hanyi, seated at the head of the hall, furrowed his brows so tightly they nearly touched.

It really was a case of when it rained, it poured. Ever since the incident with the Murong family, every other family in Heaven's Mandate City had been targeting the Lin family.

However.

Just as the atmosphere grew heavy, a family disciple suddenly came to report from outside.

"Report! Family Head, the head of the Fang family from the east side requests an audience." The disciple announced.

"The Fang family head? What does he want?"

Hearing it was the Fang family, Lin Hanyi's expression darkened. He said coldly, "Having swallowed up our Lin family's shops, is he now coming to make trouble in person?"

"No, Family Head. The Fang family head seems to be here to apologize." The disciple hurriedly explained.

"Apologize?"

The Lin family members were immediately confused.

But while they were still bewildered, another family disciple came rushing in to report. "Reporting to the Family Head, the Gu family from the west side has arrived at our gates with ten carriages full of gold, silver, and jewels. They say they're here to clear up a misunderstanding."

Hearing this, the Lin family members were even more baffled.

But the reports didn't stop. Several more disciples came running in.

"Report! The Zhao family requests an audience, saying they're here to deliver gifts."

"Report! The Guo family has sent an invitation, asking the entire Lin family to dine with them at Fengtian's Premier Restaurant."

"Report! The Feng family requests an audience, saying they're here to propose a marriage..."

In an instant, the Lin family hall became extremely lively with an endless stream of announcements.

But the Lin family's leadership was completely dumbfounded.
