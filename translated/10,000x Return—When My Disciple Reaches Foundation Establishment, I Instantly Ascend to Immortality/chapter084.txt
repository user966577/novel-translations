Chapter 84: I'll Just Send a Couple Outer Disciples to Compete

What a day it was for Immortal River Sect—quite the excitement.

Many disciples watched Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong lead the entire upper echelon to the Registration Hall, where they stayed for quite a while. Everyone wondered what on earth had happened.

"Has Immortal River Sect recruited some heaven-defying talent? Is that why the sect's leadership is making such a big fuss?"

Someone wondered aloud.

Then someone with inside information replied mysteriously:

"Just two outer sect disciples!"

"But these two disciples are a bit... special."

This only piqued everyone's curiosity further.

"What's so special about them?"

"These two disciples are a bit old, with rather deep credentials!"

"Uh..."

Someone was immediately rendered speechless.

Since when had being old with deep credentials become recruitment criteria for the sect?

And somehow this had shocked the entire sect leadership?

Under the puzzled or curious gazes of the crowd...

The well-informed person didn't keep them in suspense, but revealed a bombshell:

"These two are Holy Land elders—the legendary towering giants of the Eastern Region's alchemy world."

"Boom..."

What do they call a stone that creates a thousand ripples?

This news was like a thunderbolt, leaving all the disciples numb and fried inside.

"You... you're not mistaken, are you?"

"Grand Holy Land elders, coming to our Immortal River Sect to be outer disciples?"

"When did our sect become so impressive?"

Someone stammered, face full of disbelief.

"Any idea which peak they joined?"

After the shock, some disciples grew excited.

If they were in the same peak, couldn't they address each other as fellow disciples from now on?

With that connection, they felt like their cultivation path would straighten out considerably.

"Command Hall Peak!"

The answer left everyone's jaws on the floor once again.

Most disciples still thought of Command Hall Peak as declining, withered—a peak that could be replaced and absorbed at any moment.

"Why'd they have to join Command Hall Peak?"

Many were baffled, faces full of question marks.

Everything happening today was just too bizarre, seriously challenging their worldview.

Suffice to say, the news of Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian joining the sect had detonated all of Immortal River Sect.

And set quite a few records.

The oldest two outer sect disciples in Immortal River Sect's history.

The strongest two outer sect disciples since Immortal River Sect's founding.

The most distinguished two outer sect disciples in all of Immortal River Sect's past.

These became the trending topics and hot discussion points of this alternate-world version of social media.

The excitement belonged to everyone else—it didn't affect Command Hall Peak much.

Zhong Qing went about eating and drinking as usual, occasionally refining pills, sometimes having outdoor cookouts. Life was wonderfully carefree.

As for Lin Feng and Su Ye, ever since taking the Perfect Foundation Pills, they had become completely absorbed in their rapidly advancing cultivation—either cultivating or on their way to cultivate.

The buzz around Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian lasted several days.

Soon, the entire sect's attention was captured by something else.

The Seven Peaks Competition was about to begin.

Inter-peak competitions weren't unusual among sects.

Those who distinguished themselves in the competition, performing excellently, would receive focused cultivation from the sect and priority resource allocation.

The legendary journeys of some extraordinary figures had begun with sect competitions.

This kind of competition was a grand event for the entire sect.

And this competition was different from usual.

Those who achieved good results would represent the sect at the Immortal Dao Conference being held across the entire Eastern Region not long after.

The Immortal Dao Conference—now that was the true stage for the strong, the paradise for prodigies.

A gathering place for countless legendary figures.

It was a carnival celebration for the entire Eastern Region.

One day.

A disciple came to invite Zhong Qing to attend a leadership meeting in Immortal River Hall.

Zhong Qing had never been particularly interested in such meetings.

But Command Hall Peak was still part of Immortal River Sect, and he didn't want to be too independent or demand special treatment.

So after only a moment's hesitation, he answered the call and went.

At this moment, Immortal River Hall was quite lively.

Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong occupied the seat of honor.

Below him, the various elders and peak masters had all gathered.

"Peak Master Zhong has arrived!"

As Zhong Qing arrived, the already bustling atmosphere was pushed to a new peak.

Everyone greeted him warmly.

Their enthusiasm was almost overwhelming.

Making Zhong Qing feel rather uncomfortable all over.

At this point, Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong turned his gaze to Zhong Qing.

With a beaming smile, he said: "The Seven Peaks Competition is about to begin."

"May I ask, who will Command Hall Peak be sending to compete?"

Zhong Qing pondered for a moment before saying: "Sect Master, as you know, Command Hall Peak has few people."

"There's really no one available to send, so I'll just send a couple outer sect disciples to participate."

"It's about the participation, after all."

The moment these words came out, countless Immortal River Sect leaders rolled their eyes, lips twitching.

Good lord, "just send a couple outer sect disciples."

You call those normal outer sect disciples?

And "it's about the participation."

The ones participating for participation's sake are probably us other peaks!

"Surely the Sect Master won't agree to such an outrageous request?"

Someone looked toward Xuanyuan Hong.

Privately thinking that those two should be banned from competing.

That would be fair to the other disciples.

Unexpectedly, Xuanyuan Hong agreed without even thinking.

"It's wonderful that Command Hall Peak can send people."

"I plan to hold the competition three days from now."

"Be sure to attend on time!"

For the rest of the meeting, Zhong Qing lost interest.

Whether in his previous life or this one, what he hated most was meetings.

Fortunately, he found a corner and visited the Duke of Zhou in dreams.

He slept straight through until the meeting ended.

By the time he returned to Command Hall Peak from Immortal River Hall, it was already dusk.

As for this competition, Zhong Qing didn't really care much.

It was just going through the motions, nothing more.

After a long while, he finally summoned Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian.

"Peak Master!"

In the small courtyard.

The two bowed respectfully to Zhong Qing.

"No need for formalities!"

Zhong Qing waved his hand and said: "You're both disciples of my Command Hall Peak now."

"Three days from now, the sect will be holding a Seven Peaks Competition."

"Would you two be willing to compete on behalf of Command Hall Peak?"

These words excited both men.

They had just been looking for something to do to please Zhong Qing.

Didn't expect a pillow would arrive just as drowsiness hit.

This was their chance to perform.

"Sect Master, we will give our all!"

The two cracked their knuckles, eager to begin.

This was the first task Zhong Qing had given them, and they could barely wait to show what they could do.

They would definitely showcase Command Hall Peak's glory.
