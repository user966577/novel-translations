Chapter 21: A Pair of Show-Offs

However.

Just as Xuanyuan Hong finished his excited spiel, spittle flying, he noticed that Zhong Qing wasn't nearly as thrilled as expected.

If anything, he looked a bit annoyed.

This left Xuanyuan Hong utterly confused.

"What, you're not excited about this gift?" Xuanyuan Hong couldn't help but ask.

"Uh..."

Zhong Qing rubbed his nose.

For a moment, he was at a loss for words.

This old man had been building up suspense for ages, laying on the mystery so thick that Zhong Qing had genuinely been looking forward to something impressive.

Turns out it was just a King-grade cultivation method. All that anticipation for nothing.

Though to be fair, a King-grade method was indeed valuable—it's just that he'd checked in today and gotten eight of them, so he really couldn't muster any excitement.

"What's wrong with you, kid?" Seeing Zhong Qing's lack of enthusiasm, Xuanyuan Hong couldn't help but lecture him. "This is a King-grade cultivation method! Don't tell me you're looking down on it?"

"Brat, don't let your newfound strength go to your head. Strength is all well and good, but paired with a proper method, you can achieve twice the results with half the effort."

"Fine, fine."

Zhong Qing had no choice but to accept the talisman.

"But since you're insisting on giving me this method, let me give you a few in return."

As he spoke, Zhong Qing was already activating his storage ring.

"Hm, you're going to give me some methods too?"

Xuanyuan Hong looked confused, then waved his hand dismissively. "That's not necessary. It's not like we're doing some formal gift exchange, and besides, our sect's Scripture Pavilion has plenty of—"

But then.

Before he could finish, his voice caught in his throat, coming out like the honk of a strangled duck. He stared fixedly at Zhong Qing.

He watched as Zhong Qing pulled eight King-grade cultivation methods from his storage ring—the same eight he'd obtained from today's check-in that he hadn't had time to store in his warehouse yet.

"You, you you you you..."

Seeing these eight King-grade methods, Xuanyuan Hong was so shocked he could barely speak.

"Don't want them?" Zhong Qing asked.

"I want them!"

Almost instantly, he snatched the eight methods from Zhong Qing's hands and began examining them one by one.

When he confirmed that all eight King-grade cultivation methods were genuine, his breathing grew rapid.

In that moment.

He finally understood why Zhong Qing had been so unenthusiastic about a King-grade method.

The man could casually produce eight of them. Of course he wasn't excited.

Thinking back to his own mysterious act earlier, he'd been like a complete fool. And... sending coal in snowy weather?

"Eight of them—this is eight King-grade cultivation methods! Kid, how on earth did you get your hands on these?" Xuanyuan Hong couldn't calm his excitement and had to ask.

"If I want them, I have them."

Zhong Qing shrugged, his expression calm.

Was that even a human response?

Was that something a person would say?

Xuanyuan Hong's face was covered in question marks.

"Alright, alright, Sect Master, don't worry about where these eight methods came from. Just take them."

Zhong Qing hastily coaxed Xuanyuan Hong back into his seat. "As for this talisman of yours, I appreciate the sect's kind intentions, but I really don't need it. Please take it back as well."

"Alright."

At this point.

Xuanyuan Hong truly had nothing to say.

The man could produce eight methods at will. His own King-grade offering really was useless to him.

Seeing that Xuanyuan Hong had nothing more to say, Zhong Qing finally relaxed and resumed making tea.

Actually, given their relationship, giving Xuanyuan Hong a few Imperial-grade methods wouldn't have been a big deal.

But after some thought, Zhong Qing decided against it.

A man is innocent, but possessing jade makes him guilty.

If word of this leaked, Xianjiang Sect would face catastrophe.

So giving the sect a few King-grade methods was just right.

"Tell me the truth, kid—the method you're cultivating yourself is more than just King-grade, isn't it?" After sitting back down and putting away the eight King-grade methods, Xuanyuan Hong couldn't help but ask.

Zhong Qing poured tea while nodding. "That's right. The method I cultivate is a tiny bit higher than King-grade."

"A tiny bit—is it Venerable-grade?"

"Imperial-grade."

"Holy—"

Xuanyuan Hong, who had just taken a sip of tea, spat it out directly and let out an expletive. He shot to his feet and cursed, "You call that a tiny bit higher?!"

Zhong Qing wiped the tea from his face with an annoyed expression. "Sect Master, you're a sect leader after all. Can't you stay calm when things happen?"

"Calm my ass! You tell me, can I stay calm? How am I supposed to stay calm?"

Zhong Qing could only continue soothing him in a gentle voice. It took quite a while before Xuanyuan Hong finally settled back down.

"Here, have some tea. Don't overthink things."

Zhong Qing smiled softly, shook the copper kettle, and found there wasn't enough water inside. So he instructed Lin Feng, who had been standing to the side the whole time, "Disciple, go to the mountain across the way and fetch another kettle of spring water. Be quick about it."

"Yes, Master."

Lin Feng respectfully took the copper kettle and rose into the air.

In just a few breaths, he'd made a round trip to the cloud-covered peak opposite, returning with a full kettle.

"Master, here's the water you requested."

Lin Feng spoke respectfully.

"Mm, set it aside to boil." Zhong Qing instructed softly.

"Yes, Master." Lin Feng replied.

"The spring water from that peak is rich in spiritual energy. It's smooth and refreshing, with a subtle sweetness when you savor it slowly—perfect for brewing tea."

"The Sect Master is so busy with sect affairs. Now that you've finally made it here, drink a few more cups of tea, relax properly. In a way, it's good for cultivation too."

"Hm?"

"Sect Master, why aren't you saying anything?"

Zhong Qing had been rambling on, but noticed that Xuanyuan Hong had been staring at Lin Feng behind him the whole time, looking as if he'd seen a ghost.

Finally, after a long, long moment, Xuanyuan Hong pointed at Lin Feng and asked, "Don't tell me this disciple is the white-quality disciple you took in at the main peak last time?"

"Yes, is there a problem?" Zhong Qing blinked and asked.

"You're asking me if there's a problem?" Xuanyuan Hong said loudly. "Just over a month ago, he wasn't even at Body Refining, and now he can fly through the air and make a round trip to that peak in such a short time?"

"Tell me, what's his cultivation now?"

Lin Feng heard this and quickly cupped his hands, stepping forward. "Reporting to the Sect Master, this disciple is unworthy. I've only just broken through to Dawn Profound."

"Holy—"

Another expletive burst from Xuanyuan Hong's mouth.

He nearly spat out a mouthful of blood.

Unworthy.

Unworthy my ass.

Just over a month, going from zero to Dawn Profound, and he dares say he's unworthy???

One had to know that the Peak Masters and elders of Xianjiang Sect had cultivated for most of their lives and were only at Dawn Profound themselves.

Damn.

This master and disciple were a pair of show-offs!
