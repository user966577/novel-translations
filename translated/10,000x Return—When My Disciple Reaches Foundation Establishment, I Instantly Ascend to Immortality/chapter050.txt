Chapter 50: Zhong Qing Has Elevated Us to Heights We Never Belonged To

"I..."

For some reason, at this moment, Bai Ling felt like she was going mad.

She had no idea how to make Zhong Qing believe what she was saying.

Nor did she know how to prove that what she said was true.

"Miss Bai, what's done is done. Why not rest and focus on recovering? I have some matters to attend to—I need to step out for a bit."

Zhong Qing gently reassured her.

"Alright... fine."

Realizing that Zhong Qing seemed completely unconvinced, and that he didn't seem to grasp the seriousness of the situation, she knew saying more was pointless. She could only return with a face full of worry.

Watching Bai Ling leave.

Zhong Qing smiled and shook his head.

How could he not know what Bai Ling was thinking? But since he had already brought her to Command Hall Peak, worrying about it was useless.

As for the great trouble behind her—well, they'd deal with it when it came.

After sipping some tea, he slipped into his small world.

Though Qingniao and Leng Ning had completed the major work on the small world, there were still many details he needed to sort out.

Especially all the things the system had given him through check-ins over the years—with so many different types, he needed to organize and store them properly.

All these things would be useful in the future.

The reason he moved everything into the small world was twofold: first, the small world traveled with him, making storage and retrieval convenient.

Second, the small world was the safest place for Zhong Qing.

Any one of these items, if leaked, could cause major problems. Storing them in the small world was the best choice.

Meanwhile.

In the great hall of Immortal River Sect.

Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong sat at the head, with several elders and Peak Masters gathered together.

"Sect Master, we just received the latest news. Our Command Hall Peak Master killed another mid-Moon Profound beast in Heaven's Mandate City. And killing that beast seemed even easier than killing the Red-Haired Ghost." One elder reported.

"And that's not all. It seems he also visited Heavenly Cloud Sect because of his disciple Lin Feng."

Another elder added.

"Afterward, there seems to have been an earth-shaking battle within Heavenly Cloud Sect. It was likely caused by our Command Hall Peak Master. Though we don't know the final outcome, our Peak Master returned safely to Command Hall Peak a few days ago."

As these two pieces of news spread.

Sharp intakes of breath could be heard throughout the hall.

After all, to them, Heavenly Cloud Sect was an absolute behemoth—an existence approaching the Holy Lands.

If the battle inside Heavenly Cloud Sect really was connected to Zhong Qing, didn't that mean Zhong Qing could fight within Heavenly Cloud Sect and escape unscathed?

That kind of strength...

"It seems Zhong Qing is even more terrifying than we imagined!"

Xuanyuan Hong couldn't help but sigh, feeling both shock and joy.

"However, Sect Master, setting aside Zhong Qing's strength for now—if he really did clash with Heavenly Cloud Sect, even if he escaped unharmed, we Immortal River Sect need to be on guard."

At this point, an elder spoke with a grave voice.

Hearing this.

Xuanyuan Hong's brow furrowed as well.

Because this elder's concern was valid.

If Zhong Qing had really made enemies with Heavenly Cloud Sect, it wasn't just a conflict between Zhong Qing and them—it was a conflict between Immortal River Sect and Heavenly Cloud Sect.

And if Heavenly Cloud Sect couldn't immediately deal with Zhong Qing, who knew what they might do to Immortal River Sect?

"Pass down my order: immediately recall all Immortal River Sect disciples scattered outside."

"Second: immediately dispatch scouts to closely monitor Heavenly Cloud Sect's every move."

In mere moments, Xuanyuan Hong made his decision with a clap of his hands.

In this treacherous world, being prepared was essential.

Otherwise, you wouldn't even know how you died.

After issuing these orders, Xuanyuan Hong continued, "Everyone, you should have noticed recently that our Command Hall Peak Master has gradually elevated us to heights we never belonged to. So our future opponents may no longer be at the levels we're used to."

"We're moving to higher levels."

"But if we want to develop, if we want to rise, these experiences are necessary."

"So everyone must not sit idle. Those who need to improve their strength, improve. Those who need to cultivate, cultivate."

The elders and Peak Masters nodded gravely, agreeing with Xuanyuan Hong's words.

"By the way, Sect Master, besides various improvements, our sect's facilities also need significant upgrades."

At this point, the Third Elder spoke. "For example, our mountain-protecting formation is practically useless—it couldn't even stop a single Red-Haired Ghost. Now that our opponents have risen to the level of Heavenly Cloud Sect, the mountain-protecting formation really should be reinforced."

"I agree with you on this point."

Xuanyuan Hong said, "But no one in our sect is skilled in this. If we're to seek outside help, Myriad Dao Mountain is the only option."

"But what kind of existence is Myriad Dao Mountain? They're constantly busy with requests from the Holy Lands. Why would they bother with a minor second-rate sect like us?"

At these words.

Everyone in the hall furrowed their brows.

Xuanyuan Hong's point was valid.

Even if they wanted to hire Myriad Dao Mountain, they would need to pay a considerable price.

And the only thing Immortal River Sect had that might interest Myriad Dao Mountain was probably the King-grade cultivation method Zhong Qing had given them.

But there was no way they could give that up.

Just as everyone was wracking their brains, a disciple suddenly came to report.

"Report! Sect Master, the Sect Master of Myriad Dao Mountain requests an audience!"

"What?"

Hearing this report, Xuanyuan Hong was stunned.

The other elders exchanged bewildered glances.

It was like speaking of Cao Cao and having Cao Cao arrive.

But why would Myriad Dao Mountain suddenly visit Immortal River Sect?

"Quick, let's go welcome them."

Xuanyuan Hong wasted no time and led his senior officials to receive the guests.

After all, in their eyes, Myriad Dao Mountain was a true titan.

At this moment.

Zhuge Qing was waiting at Immortal River Sect's mountain gate with several elders.

They had always wanted to repay Zhong Qing for saving Myriad Dao Mountain. Originally, they had planned to thank Zhong Qing in person, but after learning about the Heavenly Cloud Sect affair, they abandoned that idea.

Judging from how effortlessly Zhong Qing could destroy Heavenly Cloud Sect, eliminating a single Heavenly Calamity was probably nothing to him.

He probably didn't even think twice about it, let alone need their gratitude.

If they rashly approached Zhong Qing, they would only be a nuisance.

Combined with the earlier rejection at the Lin family in Heaven's Mandate City, Zhuge Qing became even more certain of this.

Then Zhuge Qing remembered an important detail from the intelligence gathered in Heaven's Mandate City.

Zhong Qing was the Peak Master of Command Hall Peak at Immortal River Sect.

Though Zhuge Qing didn't know why such a powerful figure would humble himself at a minor sect like Immortal River Sect, he realized that building good relations with Immortal River Sect had become essential.

He wasn't qualified to approach Zhong Qing directly, but approaching Immortal River Sect was just right.

Building good relations with Immortal River Sect was equivalent to building good relations with Zhong Qing.

And if he could do something for Immortal River Sect, it would be like repaying Zhong Qing for saving Myriad Dao Mountain.

So after making his decision.

Zhuge Qing brought his senior officials to Immortal River Sect without delay to establish diplomatic relations.
