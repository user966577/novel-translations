Chapter 7: We Were Too Disrespectful Before—Quick, Kneel!

True, these were the methods Lin Feng hadn't chosen. That didn't make them worthless.

Quite the opposite—each one could shake the world if revealed.

Yet here they were, burning in a furnace.

If that wasn't criminal waste, what was?

Lin Feng's heart ached just as much.

"Master, why would you burn such precious methods?"

"I have plenty of these. Burning them saves storage space."

Zhong Qing spoke as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Lin Feng: ???

Sword Elder: ???

Listen to this.

Was this something a normal person would say?!

Zhong Qing remained unbothered, continuing to feed the flames with more methods.

He knew they were valuable, sure. But when you had too many, they stopped feeling precious.

He couldn't exactly hand them out everywhere—that would only invite trouble before his strength fully developed.

Besides, his broken check-in system kept producing more every single day.

Before long, the kettle began whistling.

Zhong Qing lifted it and brewed himself a pot of tea.

Cup in hand, he rose leisurely and headed toward another room. "Follow me."

"Yes!"

Lin Feng answered respectfully and followed Zhong Qing into a side chamber.

The room was filled with weapons of every description.

"Pick one that suits you."

Zhong Qing's tone remained casual.

Lin Feng and Sword Elder surveyed the dazzling array. At first glance, nothing seemed special. But as they drew closer, the truth became clear.

Every single weapon possessed a spirit.

Each contained energies so terrifying that prolonged observation alone made one's heart seize with fear.

Sword Elder's breathing, which had just begun to calm, grew ragged once more.

Clearly, these weapons matched the cultivation methods in grade—Venerable, Saint, and Imperial-grade divine weapons filled the room.

"Quick, pick! Pick one now!"

Sword Elder's urgency was palpable.

Today had made him feel like a country bumpkin entering a grand city for the first time. Every cultivation method, every divine weapon struck at his very soul.

Lin Feng was equally shaken. With Sword Elder's guidance, the two finally settled on a weapon after much agonizing.

A pitch-black saber, dark as ink.

The Ink Saber.

Lin Feng caressed the weapon, unable to put it down. His heart refused to calm.

Today's gains were simply too immense.

So immense that even if he'd traveled his originally planned path without any setbacks, reaching its peak might not have granted him what he now possessed.

"Boy, we were far too hasty before."

"I thought your master was trash, yet he revealed Star Profound cultivation. I thought he was just Star Profound, but now I realize he's far beyond that. In my prime, I'd have been nothing but dirt before him!"

"We were too disrespectful. Quick—kneel! Prostrate yourself and call him Master with proper reverence!"

Inside the ring, Sword Elder's voice was deadly serious.

By now, he knew he'd completely misjudged the situation.

This person's background had to be extraordinary beyond imagination.

Otherwise, who could casually burn Venerable and Imperial-grade cultivation methods just to boil water for tea?

Lin Feng heard the instruction and dropped to his knees without hesitation.

He'd been grateful to Zhong Qing from the start for getting him into Mufu Peak. Though he hadn't initially believed Zhong Qing could teach him anything, he'd still considered him his master in his heart.

Now, Zhong Qing had won Lin Feng's complete devotion.

"Disciple thanks Master for these generous gifts."

Lin Feng knelt on the ground, bowing with utmost sincerity.

"Rise."

Zhong Qing waved his hand. A gentle force lifted Lin Feng to his feet.

Then he spoke softly: "From now on, just stay at Mufu Peak and cultivate diligently. I guarantee you'll become a supreme expert."

He wasn't exaggerating.

With the Trash Bond activated, Lin Feng would cultivate at 100x speed.

Combined with Imperial-grade methods and other advantages, that speed would be beyond even the most gifted genius.

"Thank you, Master." Lin Feng's gratitude was evident.

"However..."

Zhong Qing paused, his gaze shifting to Lin Feng's storage ring. "That ring of yours..."

The moment those words landed, Lin Feng's expression flickered with unease.

Inside the Desolate Ring, Sword Elder felt as if thunder had struck his mind.

Cold sweat poured down.

He's noticed me.

This great one is pointing me out!!

Only now did Sword Elder realize that Zhong Qing had likely known about him all along. His pathetic concealment techniques meant nothing before such a being!

Sword Elder nearly had a heart attack.

Remembering all the dismissive things he'd said, all the ways he'd underestimated Zhong Qing—

His legs went weak.

"Senior, I was wrong. I'm guilty."

"I was too hasty before. I shouldn't have spoken so disrespectfully about you."

Within the Desolate Ring's space, Sword Elder's soul-form bent at the waist in deep, reverent apology.

In truth, Zhong Qing had no idea Sword Elder was putting on such a dramatic show.

He'd mentioned the ring grandpa with an ulterior motive.

If his guess was correct, this ring grandpa and Lin Feng shared intertwined fates—bound together for better or worse.

So he'd begun to consider simply delegating all teaching responsibilities.

Though he had countless treasures and his strength would rise quickly, his actual ability to instruct? Probably not as good as this ring grandpa.

And the faster Lin Feng cultivated, the faster he'd receive returns.

In other words, this ring grandpa could become his ultimate employee!

Why would he let such a perfect worker go unused?

"Here's a soul-nourishing elixir. Take it."

Zhong Qing pulled a medicine packet from his storage ring and handed it to Lin Feng. Like everything else, it was an old check-in reward—he had plenty of such miscellaneous items.

"By the heavens!!"

Seeing the elixir, Sword Elder's eyes went wide.

Then came overwhelming gratitude.

He never expected that not only would Zhong Qing not hold grudges, he'd actually gift a soul-nourishing elixir—and one of such precious quality!

Given Sword Elder's deteriorated state, even if Lin Feng successfully followed the original plan to the very end, Sword Elder would have only a 10% chance of resurrection. And cultivation paths were rarely smooth—whether Lin Feng could even reach that end was uncertain.

Meaning Sword Elder would most likely never see the light of day again.

But with this elixir, though immediate revival wasn't possible, it was now infinitely closer.

His chances of resurrection had become 100%—merely a matter of time!

This was equivalent to Zhong Qing giving him a new life!

Such grace—the grace of rebirth—made Sword Elder's soul-form drop to the ground inside the Desolate Ring, kowtowing heavily several times.

Lin Feng accepted the elixir with trembling hands and also fell to his knees.

He understood what this elixir meant to Sword Elder.

Lin Feng's life had been one hardship after another. Born to a minor family with zero cultivation talent. Engagement broken. Humiliated at every turn.

He'd been ready to end it all by leaping from a cliff when Sword Elder appeared and gave him hope again.

To Lin Feng, Sword Elder was like a father.

"Master, please accept another bow from Lin Feng. I swear to cultivate diligently and never disappoint you. Should Master ever need anything, Lin Feng will walk through fire, brave any danger, even fall into eternal damnation without complaint."

Lin Feng knelt and bowed, raising his palm as he made his earnest vow.

In his heart, he knew: Zhong Qing had given both him and Sword Elder new lives!
