Chapter 16: Never Let Anyone Who's Hurt You Get Away

After speaking with Su Ye, Zhong Qing finally turned his attention to Xue Kuang.

"Immortal River Sect. Command Hall Peak Master. Zhong Qing."

Zhong Qing held Su Ye's hand, his expression flat.

"Command Hall Peak? Zhong Qing?"

Xue Kuang's eyes flickered with recognition, as did the Flying Dagger elder on the platform and the watching crowd.

Clearly, everyone was curious about his identity.

After a moment, someone placed him.

"He's that trash Peak Master from Immortal River Sect—the waste that Daoist Nai picked up from somewhere." Someone pointed at Zhong Qing.

With that reminder, everyone remembered.

After all, they were all in the Eastern Region and knew something about each other's sects.

"Heh, so it's you, trash."

Xue Kuang's lips curled into a sneer. "Though you don't seem quite as useless as the rumors say. You actually blocked one-tenth of my power."

"But even your Sect Master would have to be polite to me. What gives a tiny Peak Master like you the guts to meddle in my business?"

Xue Kuang's voice thundered with menace.

He'd assumed Zhong Qing was some formidable figure. Turns out it was just this?

Up on the platform, the Flying Dagger elder also wore an amused expression.

His Flying Saber Sect had to show Red-Haired Ghost face by giving Xue Kuang this favor. What could tiny Immortal River Sect possibly do?

Zhong Qing narrowed his eyes. "I suggest you go back where you came from before I change my mind."

"You've got some nerve."

Xue Kuang nearly laughed in disbelief.

The crowd burst into laughter too, especially the Flying Dagger elder, as if he'd heard the joke of the century.

"A tiny Command Hall Peak Master—where does he get the courage to say that to Xue Kuang?"

"Does he think blocking one-tenth of Xue Kuang's attack means he can actually fight him? In a real battle, even I might not match up evenly."

Everyone looked at Zhong Qing with ridicule.

"Kid, I'll give you one chance."

Xue Kuang's voice turned icy. "Hand over my catalyst, then crawl between my legs and cut off one of your arms. Do that, and I'll spare your life."

"Otherwise, believe me when I say I'll kill you right here, and your Immortal River Sect won't dare make a peep. They'll have to come apologize to me with gifts."

"Noisy."

Zhong Qing looked utterly unimpressed, regarding Xue Kuang like a clown.

Seeing Zhong Qing continue to ignore him, Xue Kuang's fury reached its peak.

"Fine, fine, fine. Refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit."

As he spoke, he flipped his palm. Dense black mist gathered and surged toward Zhong Qing, closing in instantly.

"That kid is dead."

"He deserves it too. Of all people to provoke, he picked Xue Kuang."

Everyone assumed Zhong Qing was finished.

Yet facing this attack, Zhong Qing's expression didn't waver. His robes fluttered in the rushing qi as he slowly raised one hand.

And extended a single finger.

Like squashing an ant, he pressed it toward Xue Kuang.

With this one gesture—

Heaven and earth seemed to shift.

Xue Kuang's attack shattered like rotten wood, and in an instant, the pressure crushed down upon his head.

"What?!"

"No!!"

The overwhelming power behind this single strike shattered Xue Kuang's mental defenses. His face contorted as he screamed.

"Stop!"

"My master is Red-Haired Ghost! If you kill me, he won't let you go! He'll make your entire clan and all of Immortal River Sect pay..."

But his threats left Zhong Qing completely unmoved.

The finger fell.

Under the horrified gazes of everyone present, Xue Kuang simply vaporized. Not even a scrap of flesh remained.

Only his dying scream still echoed across the plaza.

Xue Kuang had vanished entirely.

In that moment, the entire scene fell deathly silent.

Everyone stared at Zhong Qing like they'd seen a ghost, their hearts in turmoil.

This...

This was really the trash Peak Master from the rumors?

Xue Kuang had been at peak Dawn Profound. Combined with his demonic techniques, he was nearly invincible within his realm and might even escape from a Star Profound cultivator.

Yet Zhong Qing had squashed him with a single finger, as effortlessly as killing an ant.

In that instant, everyone who'd mocked and jeered fell silent, heads shrinking into shoulders, unable to meet Zhong Qing's eyes.

But Zhong Qing wasn't about to let them off.

Most were merely Houtian or Xiantian. Zhong Qing didn't even bother raising his hand—a few glances were enough. One by one, they exploded where they stood, bursting into clouds of blood mist.

Such was the power of Absolute Suppression. Killing those at his level or below took minimal effort—even a single glance sufficed.

The sight sent terror through the remaining crowd, and they scrambled backward.

Who could have imagined that Command Hall Peak's universally mocked trash was actually such a terrifying death god?

At the same time, they silently thanked their own good fortune for not having joined in the mockery.

"Disciple, this is your first lesson."

Zhong Qing turned to Su Ye. "We don't go out of our way to harm the innocent. But anyone who's hurt us? Never let them get away."

Su Ye had already been stunned speechless by Zhong Qing's effortless killing of Xue Kuang.

And he felt an inexplicable sense of satisfaction.

Tears streamed down his face. For the first time in his life, he understood what it felt like to have someone in his corner.

In this moment, everything Zhong Qing said became absolute truth to him.

"Yes, Master. I understand."

Su Ye clenched his jaw, nodding firmly.

Zhong Qing patted his head, then turned his gaze toward the Flying Dagger elder on the platform.

Sensing Zhong Qing's attention, the elder nearly jumped out of his skin and stumbled back two steps.

As a bottom-tier elder of Flying Saber Sect, his cultivation was only peak Dawn Profound—roughly equal to Xue Kuang's.

If Zhong Qing could squash Xue Kuang with one finger, he had no doubt Zhong Qing could do the same to him.

Seeing Zhong Qing approach, he retreated further, eyes wide with terror, stammering: "I-I didn't interfere in your business with Xue Kuang! I only said a few words! But I'm a Flying Saber Sect elder!"

"If you do anything to me—if you harm me—that's declaring war on Flying Saber Sect..."

"What are you doing? Stop... stop right there..."

As his words tumbled out, the elder grew so frightened that he lost control of his bladder and dropped to his knees before Zhong Qing.

The elder who'd been sitting so high and mighty moments ago—now reduced to this. The crowd was stunned.

Zhong Qing hadn't expected such cowardice either.

His face filled with contempt.

This was the textbook definition of a bully.

He couldn't really blame the man for being so terrified. Zhong Qing's methods had simply been too brutal.

Xue Kuang, reduced to nothing with one finger. Everyone who'd mocked him, eliminated without exception.

If Zhong Qing truly wanted to kill him, the elder didn't believe his status would give Zhong Qing any pause. After all, he'd already killed Xue Kuang and shown no fear of Red-Haired Ghost. Why would he care about adding Flying Saber Sect to the list?
