Chapter 8: Don't Think About Anything—Just Open the Method and Cultivate!

"Alright, rise."

Zhong Qing smiled warmly and helped Lin Feng up. "Now, let me teach you how to cultivate."

"But Master, I..."

Lin Feng lowered his head, shame coloring his voice. "The truth is, I have no cultivation talent whatsoever. I'm not even white talent."

"I'm sorry, Master. I deceived you."

Lin Feng's guilt was palpable.

Zhong Qing smiled faintly.

"I've known about your talent situation all along."

Lin Feng's face burned. He wished he could sink through the floor.

Of course.

Before this mysterious master, his lack of talent had already been seen through.

"Then Master... why did you still take me as your disciple?"

"Maybe because I liked the look of you."

Zhong Qing chuckled. He couldn't exactly reveal the real reason. "As for your talent problem—to others, it might seem insurmountable. To me, it's nothing."

Lin Feng's eyes lit up. His breathing quickened.

"Just do as I say."

Zhong Qing spoke softly while his mind raced.

He hadn't immediately activated the disciple's 100x bonus because he needed the right moment.

Without a proper trigger, suddenly activating the bonus would raise questions. His disciple might become less convinced of his master's abilities.

And if Lin Feng asked how it worked, explaining would be awkward.

Under Lin Feng's expectant gaze, Zhong Qing smiled. "First, choose one of the cultivation methods I gave you as your primary practice. Then I'll teach you a heaven-defying mantra. You need only recite it in your heart while cultivating."

He leaned close and transmitted the secret instruction.

Lin Feng listened intently. When Zhong Qing finished, his entire worldview felt shattered.

"Master... it's that simple? Will it really work?"

"Of course. Just do as I say." Zhong Qing's tone was solemn. "Remember—this mantra is for your knowledge only. Tell anyone else and it loses its power."

"Now go to the next room and try it."

Zhong Qing settled back into his lounging chair with a lazy smile.

Lin Feng scratched his head.

Just reciting "Don't think about jack shit—just open the method and cultivate" would actually work?

Skeptical but willing, Lin Feng sat cross-legged in the adjacent room.

"I've given it some thought, boy. The Great Earth-Wood Scripture suits you best. Master it, and you'll be able to control all earth and wood in existence. That's what you should cultivate."

Inside the ring, Sword Elder offered his recommendation.

He was eager to see whether Zhong Qing's mantra could truly enable a complete waste to cultivate.

Of course, he tactfully refrained from asking about the mantra's actual contents.

"Understood!"

Lin Feng acknowledged the advice, opened the Great Earth-Wood Scripture, and began attempting to cultivate according to its instructions.

Simultaneously, he silently recited the mantra Zhong Qing had taught him.

Don't think about jack shit—just open the method and cultivate!

In the main hall, Zhong Qing extended his perception toward Lin Feng. Satisfied with what he sensed, he mentally commanded the system to activate the 100x bonus.

As for the mantra itself—

Zhong Qing hadn't wanted to be so crude about it.

He'd have preferred something elegant, powerful, or at least heaven-defying sounding.

Failing that, something that rhymed. Maybe some classic poetry.

But after five years in this world, most of his past-life knowledge had faded.

He'd had no choice but to improvise something on the spot.

At least the mantra was just a trigger. It wouldn't affect the actual results.

The moment Zhong Qing activated the 100x bonus, Lin Feng's cultivation showed immediate effects.

Heaven and earth spiritual energy began converging toward him, flooding into his body.

In an instant, Lin Feng—who had never been touched by spiritual energy before—felt it filling his limbs, his bones, his very core.

Like a parched riverbed suddenly flooded with fresh spring water.

The 100x bonus combined with an Imperial-grade cultivation method meant Lin Feng's cultivation speed was beyond anything so-called geniuses could imagine.

The next moment, he began breaking through.

Body Refining Stage One.

Body Refining Stage Two.

Body Refining Stage Three.

Before long, his cultivation crashed through into the Houtian realm.

"Master! It worked! It actually worked!"

Feeling the power within him, Lin Feng burst from his meditation and rushed to Zhong Qing, unable to contain his excitement. Tears streamed down his face.

He'd waited for this moment longer than he could say.

Inside the Desolate Ring, Sword Elder was equally moved.

Lin Feng was like a son to him, just as Sword Elder was like a father to Lin Feng.

Though Sword Elder had mapped out an alternative path using strange fire—one that could let Lin Feng bypass his talentless body and begin cultivating—that path was fraught with danger. The fire itself was hard to find, and the method was a desperate gamble with nine-in-ten odds of death.

Nothing like this—effortlessly beginning cultivation.

And reaching Houtian realm in mere moments at that.

"What kind of heaven-defying mantra is this? Not only does it bypass the waste constitution, but the cultivation speed is absolutely monstrous!"

Sword Elder trembled with awe.

Zhong Qing continued to shatter every expectation he'd ever had.

Such methods, such power—even in Sword Elder's prime, he'd never heard of anything like it.

"Told you I wasn't lying."

Zhong Qing looked at his tear-streaked disciple and patted his head gently. "From now on, work even harder. Don't disappoint me."

"Yes, Master! This disciple will never disappoint you!"

Lin Feng's voice rang with determination.

After speaking, he hurried off to his cultivation cave, barely containing his excitement.

The cave's formation would accelerate his progress even further.

Watching him go, Zhong Qing was equally pleased.

As Lin Feng's cultivation rose, he could clearly feel his own power increasing in tandem.

The 1,000x feedback was truly terrifying!

Time passed slowly.

As Lin Feng cultivated diligently, Zhong Qing felt his own cultivation climbing every moment. Within just a few days, he'd advanced a minor stage within Star Profound Realm.

At this rate, he'd soon break through to the Moon Profound Realm that countless cultivators could only dream of.

One day, following Sword Elder's instructions, Lin Feng ventured to a mountain range about 50 miles from Command Hall Peak.

A single punch felled a demonic beast over 20 feet long.

"Hah!"

Lin Feng surveyed his kill with satisfaction.

Just days ago, he'd been a waste who couldn't cultivate. Now he could one-shot beasts like this with his bare hands.

"If I used the Ink Saber, I could kill beasts two levels higher just as easily."

"Remember, boy—when your master is nearby, you can do as you please. But when he's not around, and before your strength matures, don't use the Ink Saber unless absolutely necessary."

Sword Elder's cautionary voice echoed in his mind.

"Yes, Sword Elder. I understand."

Lin Feng nodded humbly.

"Good. After that battle, your foundation from the rapid breakthroughs has stabilized. Continue cultivating using the method and your master's mantra. After a few more breakthroughs, find another beast to fight."

"Yes."

Lin Feng sat cross-legged on the spot.

Running the Great Earth-Wood Scripture while silently chanting Don't think about jack shit—just open the method and cultivate, he quickly entered a meditative state.

Mere moments after sitting down, he broke through again.

Houtian Stage Seven.

Two hours later: Houtian Stage Eight.

Half a day later: Houtian Stage Nine.

Another day after that: Lin Feng stepped into the Xiantian realm.

Inside the ring, Sword Elder had long since gone numb.

If not for propriety, he'd have demanded to know what that cultivation mantra was—how could it possibly produce such terrifying effects?

Imperial-grade methods alone couldn't explain this speed.

The real reason for Lin Feng's monstrous progress had to be that mantra.

At that same moment, deep in the mountains where Lin Feng cultivated, a white-robed woman opened her eyes beneath a scenic waterfall.

"Such rapid cultivation... a prodigy unlike any I've ever seen."

"I must have him as my disciple!"
