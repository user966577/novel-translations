Chapter 80: Breaking Through Again

From this day on, Command Hall Peak was constantly abuzz with activity.

Every night, either starlight cascaded from the sky, or the sounds of mountains shaking and earth trembling could be heard.

Faintly visible were great flashes of light, divine radiance flickering, spiritual energy erupting from deep underground.

To refine the Perfect Foundation Pill, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian truly gave their all, using every ounce of strength they had.

This commotion naturally alarmed the members of Immortal River Sect.

Yet Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong issued a strange order.

That all sect disciples were forbidden from approaching Command Hall Peak.

For a time, Command Hall Peak took on an air of infinite mystery.

Gained a touch of transcendence.

Time flew by in a flash!

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

One could see four pills slowly solidifying and taking form in the void.

These four pills were the size of soybeans, perfectly round and lustrous, radiating brilliant spiritual light. Their pill fragrance spread, pervading the air—their quality was extraordinary!

After a long while, when all the phenomena dispersed, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian used jade boxes they had prepared to carefully store the four pills.

For a moment, the two felt somewhat emotional and moved, along with an inexplicable excitement and thrill. These were absolutely the highest-quality pills they had ever refined in their lives.

The crowning achievement of their careers.

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian didn't delay, immediately seeking out Zhong Qing.

"Senior, mission accomplished. The pills have been successfully refined."

In the small courtyard!

The two each held a jade box, their attitudes respectful, presenting the pills.

Zhong Qing, who had been resting in the courtyard, was quite pleased to hear this.

"Very good!"

He took one of the jade boxes.

Carefully examining the two pills inside.

He had to admit, the two did have some skill.

Just the radiance and quality of these pills was streets ahead of anything he'd refined.

But to be safe, he had the other two pills taken by the pair themselves.

To verify the pill's properties.

Hearing this, the two swallowed the pills without hesitation.

Compared to the terrifying pills with all their horrific side effects that Zhong Qing had refined, they had complete confidence in pills of their own making.

The pills dissolved the moment they entered their mouths, carrying a surge of energy that merged with every part of their bodies.

Although this pill's effects were greatly diminished for those over sixteen, even so, in this moment, both felt their constitutions undergoing some kind of strange transformation.

"What... what terrifying pills!"

"I feel my cultivation speed has increased by more than double."

Wu Yue murmured, carefully experiencing the wondrous effects of the pills.

Shi Xiaotian felt the same.

As for the improvement in cultivation speed, that naturally pleased them.

But the pills had come from their own hands—this sense of achievement was even more exhilarating.

After a long while, when the two had fully absorbed the medicinal effects.

They rose together and thanked Zhong Qing: "Thank you, Senior, for gifting us these pills!"

Regardless of Zhong Qing's motives.

They had genuinely received an immense opportunity and fortune.

This thanks was spoken with complete sincerity.

"What are you thanking me for!"

"It was just to have you test the pills, to make sure they weren't poisonous."

Zhong Qing watched the two show no adverse reactions after taking the pills.

He waved his hand: "You can leave now."

"Remember, don't come looking for trouble with me again in the future."

Leaving Command Hall Peak had once been something Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian dreamed of constantly.

Yet when Zhong Qing was truly willing to let them go, the two hesitated.

"Senior, could we... not leave?"

The two spoke in unison, reluctant to part.

Zhong Qing laughed: "What, you've gotten addicted to being test subjects?"

"You're not people of my Command Hall Peak. What's the point of staying here?"

"Get lost!"

Just like that, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian were cursed out and expelled by Zhong Qing.

Before leaving, the two looked back three times with every step.

Their eyes showed deep reluctance.

As if bidding farewell to their dearest loved ones.

This attitude left Zhong Qing speechless.

He paid it no mind.

Instead, he summoned his two disciples.

"Master, what are your instructions?"

Lin Feng and little Su Ye respectfully bowed to Zhong Qing.

"Nothing major. I had someone refine a pill for each of you."

Zhong Qing flicked his finger.

Sending one Perfect Foundation Pill each into their hands.

"This pill can enhance your aptitude."

"Hurry up and refine it!"

Lin Feng and little Su Ye looked at the Perfect Foundation Pills in their hands.

The rich pill fragrance made them unconsciously swallow.

These were clearly top-grade pills.

"Thank you, Master, for the pills!"

Both were moved.

Someone who would constantly think of them, besides their parents, was only this master before them.

"Alright, go find a place to refine them!"

Lin Feng and little Su Ye saw their master yawning, clearly sleepy.

Not wanting to disturb him further, they bowed respectfully, then withdrew from the small courtyard and each found a quiet place to begin refining the Perfect Foundation Pill.

These pills only had miraculous effects for those under sixteen.

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian were old men of several hundred years, yet they could still improve their cultivation speed by more than double.

When Lin Feng and little Su Ye took them, they immediately demonstrated the pill's true heaven-defying nature.

Cultivation speed increased by at least tenfold!

Lin Feng had already reached late Dawn Profound.

After several days of cultivation, he directly reached the Great Perfection of Dawn Profound.

He was only one step away from breaking through to Star Profound.

Clearly, it wouldn't be long before he became a Star Profound powerhouse.

Little Su Ye was equally impressive.

Directly breaking through from early Dawn Profound to mid Dawn Profound.

If their cultivation speed were to spread, it would absolutely shock a great many people.

And the greatest beneficiary of their improved cultivation speed was naturally Zhong Qing.

Originally, their cultivation, after ten-thousand-fold returns to Zhong Qing, was already exaggerated enough.

Now, on top of the ten-thousand-fold, it had increased another tenfold.

Zhong Qing, who had originally needed some time to break through, immediately broke through to Sky Profound.

Opening his attribute panel!

[Host: Zhong Qing]

[Cultivation: Sky Profound Realm.]

[Disciple: Lin Feng, Dawn Profound Great Perfection, 100x amplification active.]

[Disciple: Su Ye, Dawn Profound mid-stage, 100x amplification active.]

[Activated Bonds: Waste Material Bond 2/2, more bonds awaiting development.]

[Acquired Physiques: None.]

[Acquired Special Skills: Sly Fox Aura, Heavenly Eye, Same-Realm Crushing, Personal Small World.]

Sky Profound, throughout the Eastern Region, was considered a legendary figure.

Even Holy Land sect ancestors were only at Earth Profound cultivation.

One could say that at this moment, Zhong Qing finally had the qualification to be transcendent and look down upon an entire region.

The breakthrough in cultivation left Zhong Qing's spirit quite stirred.

Indeed, life with cheats needed no explanation.

Once he had opened the correct way to use his cheat, his cultivation just shot straight up.

At this rate, in just a few years, even Zhong Qing himself couldn't predict how high his achievements would reach.
