Chapter 4: He... Wasn't He Supposed to Be Trash? How Did He...

「Congratulations, Host. Successfully recruited Lin Feng. Trash Bond 1/2 activated.」

「Trash Bond 1/2 effect: Disciple gains 100x cultivation speed. Disciple's cultivation returns to Host at 1,000x multiplier. Host may manually toggle disciple's cultivation bonus on and off.」

「Congratulations, Host. First bond activation achieved. Reward: Instant breakthrough to Star Profound Realm.」

「Congratulations, Host. First Trash Bond 1/2 activation achieved. Reward: Low-Profile Aura. Effect: No one can perceive Host's cultivation level.」

「Congratulations, Host. First cultivation achieved. Reward: Heavenly Eye. Effect: See through anyone's secrets at a glance.」

Zhong Qing's excitement surged as the system's announcements flooded his mind.

The cultivation he'd dreamed of for so long had finally arrived!

As he processed this, a tremendous surge of heaven and earth energy flowed into his body unnoticed by anyone, filling his limbs and bones.

"So this is Star Profound Realm cultivation..."

Zhong Qing felt the power coursing through him and couldn't help but smile.

He'd never imagined the rewards would be this generous—jumping straight to Star Profound Realm.

This world's cultivation hierarchy ran: Body Refining, Houtian, Xiantian, Dawn Profound, Star Profound, Moon Profound, Sun Profound, Earth Profound, and Heaven Profound.

Ordinary people viewed those at Xiantian realm as godlike beings capable of flight.

Dawn Profound cultivators could become sect elders. Xianjiang's Peak Masters were merely Dawn Profound—yet here he was, an entire major realm above them.

The system hadn't lied!

The Low-Profile Aura and Heavenly Eye were excellent too. The former was perfect for staying under the radar, while the latter's ability to see through anyone's secrets spoke for itself.

Taking a deep breath, Zhong Qing examined his system panel.

「Host: Zhong Qing」

「Cultivation: Star Profound Realm」

「Disciple: Lin Feng. Cultivation: None. 100x bonus available.」

「Active Bonds: Trash Bond 1/2」

「Physiques Obtained: None」

「Special Abilities: Low-Profile Aura, Heavenly Eye」

Perfect.

As the recruitment concluded, disciples who hadn't been personally selected by Peak Masters were free to join any peak as regular disciples.

People began moving about eagerly.

Soon, every peak gained fresh blood—except Mufu Peak, which remained cold and empty.

"So many want to join Divine Sword Peak?"

Up on the platform, Duan Feng stood with hands clasped behind his back. He shot Zhong Qing a sidelong glance. "Unfortunately, we're already overflowing with disciples. Perhaps some of you should go to Mufu Peak instead?"

The applying disciples immediately protested.

"Peak Master Duan, please! Let us join Divine Sword Peak! Don't send us to Mufu Peak—we'd be ruined!"

"Exactly! The Mufu Peak Master can't even cultivate. What good would it do us to go there?"

"Even dogs wouldn't join Mufu Peak."

"Anywhere but Mufu Peak—we'd rather be servants at another peak!"

Anxious voices filled the air.

Such was the cruel reality of the cultivation world.

Without strength, you were nothing. No one would respect you.

"Since none of you want Mufu Peak, I suppose Divine Sword Peak will graciously accept your applications."

Duan Feng laughed heartily while fixing Zhong Qing with a cold stare.

A little waste dared talk back to him earlier? He had plenty of ways to humiliate and crush him.

Zhong Qing knew exactly what Duan Feng was doing. Before, lacking strength, he could only endure.

But now? He'd reached Star Profound Realm. Why should he hold back?

"You bark like a dog all day long!"

The moment those words left Zhong Qing's mouth, Duan Feng's face turned iron-green.

"You little bastard—you're courting death!"

Duan Feng's voice dripped with killing intent.

The next instant, he erupted with peak Dawn Profound cultivation and lunged at Zhong Qing, palm raised in a devastating strike.

The crowd stirred at this development.

First, no one expected a waste like Zhong Qing to dare speak to Duan Feng that way.

Second, no one anticipated Duan Feng attacking directly—Zhong Qing's status was somewhat special, after all.

It happened in a flash.

The palm strike arrived at Zhong Qing's head almost instantly.

Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong tried to intervene but couldn't react in time. He could only shout "Stop!" hoping to halt Duan Feng's attack.

But Duan Feng ignored him completely. A cold smile flickered across his face as he continued his assault.

The seven peaks of Xianjiang Sect each held special significance. Ancient formations had been laid throughout, and establishing one's dwelling at a formation's core granted massive cultivation benefits.

But each peak had limited core positions. Duan Feng had long coveted Mufu Peak, wanting to absorb it into Divine Sword Peak for his disciples' use.

With Mufu Peak's resources, Divine Sword Peak's overall strength would soar—possibly even surpassing the main peak.

Zhong Qing's existence had blocked this plan. Duan Feng had always wanted him dead.

But given Zhong Qing's identity, he needed a valid reason to act.

Now he had one.

A waste daring to insult the Divine Sword Peak Master? Reason enough!

Even if the Sect Master questioned him afterward, he had nothing to fear.

Combined with the humiliation he'd suffered at Daoist Nai's hands all those years ago...

Today, Zhong Qing had to die!

Under countless watching eyes, the palm strike closed in on Zhong Qing.

Some sighed. Some expressed regret.

Most thought Zhong Qing deserved it.

Then something happened that shocked everyone to their core.

At the critical moment, Zhong Qing raised his own hand and threw a punch.

In an instant—

Fist met palm.

A tremendous explosion erupted, accompanied by a sharp sonic boom. Residual profound energy scattered in all directions.

In that collision, Duan Feng—the one who'd struck first—was sent flying backward. His legs carved deep furrows in the ground before he finally stopped.

Zhong Qing, meanwhile, stood with robes gently swaying. He lowered his fist, clasped his hands behind his back, and looked utterly unruffled.

The sight rendered the entire venue silent.

You could hear a pin drop.

From the lowest disciples to the Peak Masters and even the Sect Master—every single person stared at this impossible scene.

"He... wasn't he supposed to be trash?"

"How did he..."
