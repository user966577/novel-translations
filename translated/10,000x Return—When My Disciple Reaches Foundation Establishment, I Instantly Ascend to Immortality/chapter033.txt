Chapter 33: Heavenly Calamity

Several more days passed.

Lin Family.

Zhong Qing lounged leisurely in the courtyard.

*Ding: Host's disciple Lin Feng has broken through to mid Dawn Profound.*

*Ding: Congratulations, Host has broken through to Sun Profound.*

"Oh, Sun Profound already?"

Zhong Qing felt his breakthrough and couldn't help but smile. The efforts of his two disciples, combined with the ten-thousand-fold feedback—the speed was truly remarkable.

As realms got higher, more cultivation was needed. He'd thought breaking through to Sun Profound would take a while longer, but it happened so quickly.

*Host: Zhong Qing*

*Cultivation: Sun Profound*

*Disciple: Lin Feng, mid Dawn Profound, hundred-fold amplification active*

*Disciple: Su Ye, Innate realm, hundred-fold amplification active*

*Activated Bonds: Trash Bond 2/2, more bonds awaiting development*

*Acquired Physiques: None*

*Acquired Special Skills: Low-Profile Aura, Heavenly Eye, Absolute Suppression, Personal Small World*

"Very nice."

The content Zhong Qing rose from his lounger and entered his Small World.

Over the past few days, the Small World had transformed completely.

Calling it a paradise on earth wouldn't be an exaggeration.

Simply being inside lifted one's spirits.

And since the Small World was no different from the outside world, it naturally contained spiritual energy.

But thanks to the layout, the spiritual energy inside was even denser than outside.

Before long, Zhong Qing arrived at the waterside pavilion the two women had custom-built for him.

Standing in the pavilion, the lake before him and the waterfall in the distance were all in view. A gentle lake breeze swept in, extremely comfortable.

In his previous life, wouldn't you need to be a billionaire to live in such conditions?

"Greetings, Senior."

At that moment, the two women flew over from the distance, dust-covered and weary, to pay their respects.

"You've truly worked hard these past days, and your design has greatly pleased me."

Zhong Qing didn't hold back his praise, and he'd seen their efforts firsthand—they hadn't rested for a moment since starting the renovation.

"It's only right that we serve Senior."

The two women wiped the sweat from their foreheads, smiling. "But Senior, the major work is mostly done now. The remaining details will need to be refined by Senior over time."

"Good. Thank you both so much." Zhong Qing said gratefully.

The two women inspected the Small World once more, and after confirming there were no issues, they followed Zhong Qing out.

"Senior, since there's nothing else, we'll take our leave." The two women said.

"Why not rest at the Lin family for a couple more days before heading back?" Zhong Qing smiled. "Heaven's Mandate City has plenty of good food. Since there's nothing pressing, I could take you two around and sample some delicacies."

The two women were deeply moved.

This incredible being was willing to take them sightseeing and food-tasting? For them, this was an immense honor.

Their faces showed hesitation and inner conflict. Though they wanted to go, remembering their sect's instructions, they felt they didn't have that fortune.

"Senior, we would love to accompany you to taste delicacies, but yesterday we received word from the sect that something major has happened. Regardless of whether we've completed our mission, we must return immediately. We cannot disobey our master's orders, so..."

"If that's the case, then I won't keep you." Zhong Qing smiled. "But considering how hard you've worked these days, let me give you each a small gift."

With that, Zhong Qing pulled two small wooden figurines from his storage ring and gave one to each woman.

He'd invited these two girls with no ulterior motive—he'd simply seen how hard they'd worked and wanted to treat them to something nice.

Since that wouldn't work out, he'd give them each a figurine for protection.

After all, he had plenty of these. Today's check-in alone had given him over a hundred more.

Zhong Qing had two types of figurines. One type was single-use: once activated and humanized according to the owner's command, they'd last half a day before losing effect and crumbling.

The other type didn't humanize at all. As long as you carried it, it would automatically protect its owner, and it wasn't single-use—it would only break when its internal energy was completely depleted.

The latter was more like a protective treasure.

The difference was that ordinary protective treasures could only passively defend, while his figurines could actively attack.

What Zhong Qing gave the two women was this second type—and he'd given them two relatively high-grade ones at that.

The two women accepted the figurines, finding them cute but not noticing anything special. They assumed they were just ordinary figurines, keepsakes from Zhong Qing.

But they showed no disdain. On the contrary, they were delighted. After all, receiving a gift from such an existence was satisfying no matter what it was.

"Remember, keep them with you at all times. Don't lose them." Zhong Qing reminded them gently.

"We wouldn't dare. Since Senior gave them to us, we'll definitely wear them every day." Qingniao, the more lively one, said with her little tiger teeth showing.

With that, the two women cupped their hands in farewell.

"Then, Senior, we'll take our leave."

They leaped into the air and departed.

For them, this trip had been quite rewarding.

Not only had they obtained six Moon Profound demon beast eyeballs, but more importantly, they'd built a good relationship with someone of Zhong Qing's caliber.

The two flew toward Myriad Dao Mountain.

In mid-air, Qingniao couldn't help but ask, "Sister, what exactly happened at the sect that made them so urgent for us to return?"

Hearing this, Leng Ning's expression grew solemn. "Junior Sister, have you heard of the legend of Heavenly Calamity?"

"Heavenly Calamity?"

"Are you talking about the prodigy from our Myriad Dao Mountain three hundred years ago?"

"Yes, that's him."

Leng Ning nodded. "He was the most talented disciple in Myriad Dao Mountain's history. His mastery of formations, feng shui, and various auxiliary arts was extremely high. But he ultimately strayed from the righteous path. He developed the Blood Sacrifice Formation technique and gradually fell into the demonic path. Not only did he ignore the sect's attempts to stop him, he grew increasingly crazed."

"In the end, he blood-sacrificed an entire village's population for his experiments. The sect had no choice but to send out experts to cleanse the sect of him."

"That battle cost our Myriad Dao Mountain dearly. Heavenly Calamity was cast into the Sea of Degradation."

"As you know, the Sea of Degradation is extremely dangerous. Those who enter die without exception."

"Everyone thought Heavenly Calamity was dead. But no one expected that three hundred years later, he would reappear."

"During the time we were away on our mission, over a hundred of our Myriad Dao Mountain disciples had their life tokens shatter—all killed by Heavenly Calamity. That's why the sect ordered us to return quickly and not linger outside."

Leng Ning explained solemnly.

Qingniao listened with disbelief on her face.

"Heavenly Calamity—Heavenly Calamity is still alive!"

"What do we do if we run into him?"

Qingniao glanced around, suddenly feeling uneasy.

"There's no need to worry about that."

Leng Ning reassured her. "We're in a remote area. Heavenly Calamity won't come here. And once we get close to the sect, they'll send people to escort us."

"That's good, that's good."

Qingniao patted her chest, then added, "But Sister, if that's the case, why didn't we stay in Heaven's Mandate City a few more days? Being near that Senior would be so much safer. And from your expression, you seemed to want to stay a few more days too, didn't you?"

At this, Qingniao leaned in, trying to see Leng Ning's expression.
