Chapter 29: A Personal Small World

"Please give us your instructions, Senior. As long as it's within our ability." Leng Ning said immediately.

"If I recall correctly, the reason Myriad Dao Mountain is called Myriad Dao Mountain is because your disciples, besides cultivation, are proficient in all sorts of auxiliary arts. Every path is a way—hence the name Myriad Dao Mountain, correct?" Zhong Qing asked with a smile.

"The Senior flatters us, but that is indeed the case."

Leng Ning spoke modestly, though pride was clearly visible in her eyes when speaking of Myriad Dao Mountain.

"And your greatest specialty is formations. But beyond formations, you also dabble in feng shui, layout design, and construction, correct?" Zhong Qing asked again.

"That's correct." The two women replied.

"Then you may go collect those five eyeballs now. My condition is that you stay and help me design and build a location." Zhong Qing smiled leisurely, naturally thinking of the small world the system had just rewarded him.

If people skilled in such arts designed it, the comfort level would improve dramatically.

And design and construction were precisely what Myriad Dao Mountain disciples excelled at. Hearing that Zhong Qing's only condition was this, the two women eagerly agreed.

"Very well. Go collect them now. I'll wait here. Once you're done, come back with me." Zhong Qing instructed.

"Yes."

The two women immediately flew toward the three-headed demon wolf's corpse.

Hovering above it, they looked at the body cleaved clean in half, the shock in their eyes still not fading.

Who would have thought that just moments ago, this corpse's owner had been an invincible mid Moon Profound beast?

The two women quickly extracted the eyeballs using a special technique, their expressions filled with excitement.

When they'd left the sect, the elders had told them to seek out the highest-level demon beast eyeballs possible while ensuring their own safety—because the higher the level, the greater the success rate for awakening the formation's spirit.

Mid Moon Profound demon beast eyeballs were something they hadn't even dared dream of before.

They could only imagine the expressions on those old fogeys' faces when they brought these back to Myriad Dao Mountain.

"Senior, we collected six in total. We only need five, so the extra one is for you." Qingniao held up a crystal bottle containing the wolf demon's eyeballs and addressed Zhong Qing.

"Keep the extra one for yourselves." Zhong Qing waved dismissively.

Eyeballs really weren't his thing.

"Thank you, Senior."

The women's faces lit up with joy.

Though they only needed five this time, that extra one would have great use for a sect like Myriad Dao Mountain.

Soon.

Zhong Qing brought Leng Ning and Qingniao back to the Lin family.

The moment Zhong Qing returned, news of the demon wolf's death also spread back to the city.

The entire city celebrated.

After all, since the wolf had established itself here half a year ago, it had caused the people of Heaven's Mandate City tremendous harm.

In an instant.

Countless grateful citizens rushed to the Lin family.

Fortunately, Zhong Qing had anticipated this and hidden himself early. This left Lin Hanyi to deal with the chaos.

Wave after wave of people came bearing gifts of gratitude, many of whom couldn't be turned away—they would kneel and refuse to leave otherwise.

And so, in just one day, the Lin family's warehouses were packed with all manner of gifts.

Looking at his bedroom filled with eggs from local hens, and his courtyard overrun with clucking old hens, Lin Hanyi was utterly vexed.

However.

Also because of Zhong Qing, the Lin family became the undisputed hegemon of Heaven's Mandate City in just a few days.

The family's businesses boomed like never before.

As for the other families, none dared voice any complaints.

After witnessing Zhong Qing instantly slay the demon, those families only regretted not having brown-nosed the Lin family hard enough from the start. Soon, families began offering to become the Lin family's vassals.

Of course, they would have preferred to lick Zhong Qing's boots directly, but they knew they weren't qualified.

In short, the Lin family's total dominance of the city was imminent.

In the last quiet corner of the Lin family estate, Zhong Qing sat at a tea table, leisurely sipping tea.

Across from him, Leng Ning and Qingniao sat respectfully.

"The construction and design may require quite a few materials. Give any lists directly to Family Head Lin—I've already spoken with him about it." Zhong Qing instructed the women. "As for manpower, I'll assign someone to help you."

The instant Zhong Qing's words fell, a black-clothed figure suddenly appeared.

It was Heibai.

Seeing Heibai appear out of nowhere, Leng Ning and Qingniao were startled.

They hadn't even seen where Heibai had come from.

Moreover, though they couldn't sense Heibai's exact cultivation level, they could tell he was unfathomably powerful.

Clearly.

This was another Moon Profound expert.

"Heibai, from now on you will follow these two ladies' commands unconditionally." Zhong Qing ordered.

"Yes, Master."

Heibai replied respectfully.

But this form of address shocked the two women again.

A Moon Profound servant?

What extravagance!

"Ladies, you heard. If you need anything, just direct him." Zhong Qing then addressed the women.

"We wouldn't presume to give orders—at most, we might need this Senior's assistance later."

The women quickly rose.

Though this was Zhong Qing's servant, the man's Moon Profound strength was plain to see. They hardly had the nerve to order around a Moon Profound expert.

"You don't need to be so reserved. Just do what needs to be done." Zhong Qing smiled.

Leng Ning nodded respectfully, then asked, "However, Senior, may I ask exactly where you need us to design and build?"

"I'll take you there now." Zhong Qing smiled faintly.

The two women were about to ask where when they saw Zhong Qing wave his palm, and a mysterious force enveloped them.

"Don't resist."

Zhong Qing gave a reminder.

The instant his words fell, the scene before the women's eyes transformed.

Then they found themselves inside Zhong Qing's small world.

"This... what is this?"

The women looked around in amazement.

At this moment, the small world was completely empty—just a stretch of barren land.

"This is my personal small world. This is the place I want you to redesign." Zhong Qing appeared beside the women and spoke softly.

"What?!"

"Y-Your... personal small world?!"

The two women stared at Zhong Qing, their eyes wide with shock.

They felt as though a thunderbolt had struck their minds.
