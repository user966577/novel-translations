Chapter 72: How Dare You Snatch This Old Man's Spirit Herb!

The great sun hung high in the sky!

Ten thousand miles of clear blue stretched across heaven.

A gentle breeze blew, bending the mountain grasses.

Amidst the vast mountain ranges, a great hall rose from the ground, built against the mountains, magnificent and ancient in bearing.

This was Infinity Sect!

In this land of the Eastern Region, experts were as numerous as clouds, powers as common as rain.

But those truly worthy of being called top-tier powers were undoubtedly the five Holy Land sects.

Dawn Mist Valley was one, Infinity Sect was another.

In a courtyard!

Two elders, one in black and one in white, were discussing over tea.

These two had quite distinctive features.

The black-robed elder was named Shi Xiaotian—black hair with a white beard.

The white-robed elder was called Wu Yue—black beard with white hair.

The two were Infinity Sect's Eighth Elder and Seventh Elder respectively.

They were also honored as the Black and White Elders.

"Old White, the two of us rank among the foremost in the art of alchemy throughout the entire Eastern Region."

"I'm preparing to refine a batch of Heaven-Mending Pills!"

"To break through my limits and achieve the title of Pill King."

"Will you lend me your aid?"

Shi Xiaotian's eyes gleamed with ambition.

In the art of alchemy, Pill King was an honorific bestowed upon those who had reached a certain level of mastery.

It was an honor countless alchemists pursued their entire lives.

Looking across the entire Eastern Region, no Pill King had emerged for a thousand years.

And the most notable mark of achieving Pill King status was successfully refining a Heaven-Mending Pill.

"How would you have me help you?"

Wu Yue's eyes showed interest.

He knew his old friend was proud and ambitious, never content to fall behind others.

But the ambition to refine Heaven-Mending Pills still shocked him.

"To refine pills, one must gather ingredients!"

"I've already found eight or nine tenths of the ingredients for the Heaven-Mending Pill, but there's still one main ingredient—Heaven Spirit Grass—that I can't locate."

"You have many connections and wide contacts. Could you keep an eye out for me?"

Upon hearing this, Wu Yue's expression turned peculiar.

He took a light sip of tea and slowly replied: "If you were asking about some other rare herb in the world, I might be powerless."

"But this Heaven Spirit Grass—I actually do know something about it."

"Tell me quickly!"

Shi Xiaotian's expression shifted, his face full of excitement.

Wu Yue's gaze grew distant, as if recalling something. After a long while, he spoke: "Three hundred years ago, I once traveled to a place called Gu Family Town."

"There was a Gu family there, and supposedly they possessed a stalk of Heaven Spirit Grass—an heirloom from their ancestor."

"Unfortunately, I had urgent matters at the time and never had the chance to verify it."

"Afterward, I forgot all about it."

Shi Xiaotian pressed: "Where is this Gu Family Town?"

"Old Black, you should know that time changes all things. This Heaven Spirit Grass rumor has never been confirmed."

"Even if the Gu family truly had an heirloom spirit herb, several hundred years have passed. Whether it still exists remains unknown. Don't get your hopes too high."

Shi Xiaotian waved his hand: "This concerns my achievement of the Pill King title. Real or not, I must make the trip."

"Old White, enough with the nonsense. If we're friends, just tell me the exact location."

Seeing his impatient manner, Wu Yue shook his head, but finally told him the specific coordinates.

Having obtained the address, Shi Xiaotian truly couldn't sit still another moment.

"Old White, drink at your leisure. I'm leaving first!"

With that, he transformed into a streak of light and shot directly toward Gu Family Town!

The Gu Family Town that Wu Yue spoke of had, after three hundred years of change, long since become a city.

A metropolis with over a million people.

Within the old city was a power called the Gu Family!

The entire Gu family held extremely high status in the city, with formidable prestige.

Their patriarch was a Dawn Profound expert.

He had always been known as the city's number one master.

And this Dawn Profound expert was none other than Gu Wan, whom Zhong Qing had casually rescued!

At this moment, the Gu family estate was holding a grand feast lasting three days.

Gu Wan and his daughter had escaped death—wasn't that worth celebrating?

Just as they were drinking wine, enjoying the banquet, chatting and laughing in harmonious atmosphere.

In the sky above, a streak of light flew over.

It then transformed into a figure, suddenly stopping in the air above the Gu family's main hall.

This person was none other than Shi Xiaotian, who had rushed here from Infinity Sect.

For those from sects, their status toward mortal cities was transcendent.

Let alone a Holy Land sect's elder!

Shi Xiaotian's aura was too deep and profound for the crowd to fathom.

His appearance also silenced the previously lively atmosphere.

Shi Xiaotian maintained a lofty posture, standing in mid-air, hands behind his back, looking down at everyone below.

His gaze was distant: "I am the Eighth Elder of Infinity Sect. I've heard the Gu family possesses an heirloom spirit herb called Heaven Spirit Grass! Is this true or false?"

His voice was like a great bell, carrying through the entire venue, causing everyone's hearts to tremble.

Gu family patriarch Gu Wan suppressed his inner shock and carefully attended to him: "Senior has come from afar. Would you care to come down for a small drink, so we may fulfill our duties as hosts?"

To them, Infinity Sect was a colossal power.

And Infinity Sect's Eighth Elder had quite a reputation outside as well.

Rumor had it he was extremely domineering, with unpredictable moods.

The slightest displeasure would lead to killing.

Facing Gu Wan's invitation, Shi Xiaotian waved his hand grandly.

He declared arrogantly: "No need for drinking."

"I only want to know—does your Gu family have an heirloom spirit herb called Heaven Spirit Grass?"

Seeing his determined-to-obtain expression, Gu Wan inwardly groaned.

Suppressing his unease, he said: "Reporting to Senior, a Gu family ancestor did indeed pass down such a spirit herb."

These words made Shi Xiaotian's eyes light up.

His breathing grew rapid.

"Would you do this old man a favor and lend me the Heaven Spirit Grass?"

This attitude was shameless.

Spirit herbs—could they be "lent"?

That was like throwing meat buns at dogs—gone forever.

Moreover, as a dignified Holy Land elder, just revealing a few items would be enough to benefit a small family like the Gu family immensely, letting them soar.

Yet he didn't want to trade item for item, and wasn't even willing to offer a personal favor—he merely said "do a favor."

This was worse than outright robbery.

After all, robbery was at least clearly taking something.

But this attitude was like robbing someone and then expecting them to thank you for the honor of being robbed.

Disgusting beyond words.

Unfortunately, whether in terms of strength or background, this wasn't something a small family like the Gu family could provoke.

Though Gu Wan was angry inside, he dared not show it.

Instead, he spoke with trepidation: "Senior, not long ago, this junior fell into mortal danger. Fortunately, a great master saved me. To repay his kindness, this Heaven Spirit Grass was given away."

"What?"

These words sent Shi Xiaotian into a rage.

His figure moved instantly, descending from the sky, his hand clamping around Gu Wan's throat like an iron vice.

"Such a precious thing, and you just gave it away?"

"Who did you give it to?"

His eyes were red, as if Gu Wan had given away his own possession.

This sudden turn of events made everyone present tense up.

Gu Wan's face turned blue from being choked, his eyes rolling back.

Gu Ling'er watched anxiously and angrily, but had no choice but to shout: "Senior, this Heaven Spirit Grass was given to Senior Zhong Qing!"

"Who is Zhong Qing? Where does he live? What level is he? How dare he snatch this old man's spirit herb!"

Shi Xiaotian's piercing gaze fixed on Gu Ling'er.

Under his scrutiny, Gu Ling'er felt she wasn't facing some Holy Land elder, but a terrifying great demon.

Her heart was filled with fear, but also worried about her father's safety. She could only grit her teeth and say: "I don't know Senior Zhong Qing's identity either. I only know he has a disciple named Su Ye."

"I've told you everything I know. I only hope Senior will spare my father's life."

"Hmph!"

With a cold snort, Shi Xiaotian threw Gu Wan aside like garbage.

Having obtained the information he wanted, he didn't linger. He transformed into a streak of light and flew away.

As for the Gu family, in his eyes they were mere ants—aside from the Heaven Spirit Grass, they didn't even qualify for a second glance.

What had been a lively banquet was naturally ruined after Shi Xiaotian's interruption.

As the guests dispersed, Gu Wan's condition also improved.

He looked at Gu Ling'er, his expression sorrowful: "Ling'er, that Senior Zhong Qing is our life-saving benefactor. How could you reveal his identity so completely?"

"Haven't we... haven't we become ungrateful villains?"

"Father, that Infinity Sect Eighth Elder came with fierce intent, looking like he wouldn't stop until he got what he wanted."

"If I hadn't diverted his attention, our Gu family's annihilation would have been just a thought away."

"How could I watch you be in danger and do nothing?"

Gu Wan's expression was complicated: "That reasoning is sound, but if this brings great disaster upon that Senior, then we... truly deserve death ten thousand times over."

Gu Ling'er's expression was pained.

How could she not know that her actions might bring disaster upon Zhong Qing? But she also couldn't bear to watch her father be strangled to death.

Now, she could only pray that Zhong Qing would be blessed by fortune.

If the other party came seeking retribution, she could only sacrifice herself to appease his anger.

At the same time, a small hope arose in her heart.

Given the extraordinariness Zhong Qing had displayed, he might not be without a chance of winning.
