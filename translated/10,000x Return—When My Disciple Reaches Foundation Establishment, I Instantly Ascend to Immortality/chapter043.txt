Chapter 43: So This Is the Security That Master Provides?

Seeing this, the Fourth Elder was terrified beyond measure.

"No, don't come any closer!"

But at this point, Zhong Qing had no intention of showing mercy.

That hand piercing through the void instantly caught up to the Fourth Elder and gripped him tightly.

"Little beast, let him go! Otherwise, I'll grind your bones to dust!" Wu Yun bellowed threats upon seeing his Fourth Elder captured again.

"Begging me to release someone with that attitude?"

Zhong Qing gave a cold laugh, and his hand squeezed gently once more.

The Fourth Elder's body exploded, transformed into a rain of blood with not even bones remaining.

Another Sun Profound elder had fallen.

"Run!"

Zhong Qing's ruthless methods had terrified the watching disciples, who fled in all directions. After all, even the shockwaves of Zhong Qing's attacks were more than they could withstand.

"You! You'll die a horrible death!"

Having lost two Sun Profound elders in succession, Wu Yun's eyes had gone red.

Sun Profound cultivators were absolute high-tier power even among the Holy Lands.

Losing two at once—how could he not be heartbroken?

"What's the rush, Sect Master Wu? There's still one more."

Zhong Qing spoke with a mocking smile.

His gaze locked onto the last one—the Fifth Elder.

"Sect Master, save me!"

The deaths of the Third and Fourth Elders had terrified the Fifth Elder to his core. Despite the short distance, he had actually burned his life essence to accelerate, trying to put distance between himself and Zhong Qing.

But Zhong Qing didn't let him escape. Instead, he pointed a finger.

A beam of light, scorching hot as the sun itself, shot from Zhong Qing's fingertip and pierced straight through the Fifth Elder's body.

The Fifth Elder was still in his fleeing posture when he lost all signs of life in an instant, becoming a corpse that fell to the ground.

"You!"

"You'll die a horrible death!"

Seeing the Fifth Elder fall as well, Wu Yun roared with bloodshot eyes.

"I'll die a horrible death?"

Zhong Qing laughed, his voice cold. "Weren't you the one who said whoever has the bigger fist makes the rules? I'm just comparing fists with you. Why so upset, Sect Master Wu?"

"You..."

Wu Yun was so enraged by Zhong Qing's words that he spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes burning as he glared at Zhong Qing.

"Don't look at me with those hateful eyes." Zhong Qing said calmly. "I don't want to escalate things today, so I'll give you one chance."

"Come here yourself. Kneel before my disciple. Bow your head and apologize!"

The domineering words.

Caused an uproar throughout the arena.

Arrogant!

Truly too arrogant!

Facing Heavenly Cloud Sect alone, yet demanding that their Sect Master kneel and apologize.

Only Lin Feng, standing behind Zhong Qing, felt his eyes redden with emotion.

As if with this figure before him, no one in this world could ever bully him.

This was the absolute security his white-robed master gave him!

Wu Yun's face contorted with rage at Zhong Qing's words. He stared at Zhong Qing with glacial eyes. "Little beast, I won't deny you have some skill. But do you think you alone can stand against my entire Heavenly Cloud Sect? Do you think our power rivaling the Holy Lands is for show?"

"You actually dare tell me to kneel and apologize? You're overestimating yourself."

As Wu Yun's words fell.

Killing intent filled the air.

"Boom, boom, boom, boom..."

With a series of rumbling sounds, twenty-seven black coffins burst from the ground behind Heavenly Cloud Sect. They transformed into streaks of light that shot over, hovering in the sky above Zhong Qing.

"Boom!"

"Boom!"

"Boom!"

Accompanied by more explosive sounds, the twenty-seven black coffins shattered.

Twenty-seven figures emerged from the exploding coffins.

These twenty-seven had their eyes closed, their bodies exuding an aura of death, as if they weren't even alive. Yet each one unmistakably radiated Sun Profound cultivation.

Twenty-seven Sun Profound cultivators.

Terrifying beyond measure!

But.

This still wasn't the full lineup Wu Yun had brought against Zhong Qing.

From all directions of Heavenly Cloud Sect, more than a dozen elders stepped through the air—all of them Heavenly Cloud Sect's high-ranking elders.

Including Wu Yun himself and the several people behind him, there were over fifty Sun Profound cultivators in total.

This lineup could steamroll almost everything in the Eastern Region except for those few Holy Lands.

Of course.

This wasn't Heavenly Cloud Sect's full strength either—there were countless Moon Profound and Star Profound experts as well.

But against an existence like Zhong Qing, such lower-level experts couldn't help much.

"So this is my Heavenly Cloud Sect's true strength?"

Murong Xue had retreated to the side. When she saw Zhong Qing casually slaughter three of Heavenly Cloud Sect's elders, she had truly panicked for a moment.

Why did a piece of trash like Lin Feng have such a powerful being behind him?

But when she saw Heavenly Cloud Sect's full lineup, all her panic transformed into hatred.

"Master, kill them! You must kill them!"

"You must not let them go!"

Murong Xue shouted with murderous intent.

"Rest easy, Xue'er. They won't escape today." Wu Yun's expression was icy. He then said to Murong Xue, "Xue'er, step back. This level of battle isn't something you can be near yet."

"Yes, Master. I'll wait for your good news."

With that, Murong Xue fled from the area to watch from a distance.

In the arena.

Wu Yun rose into the air, standing in formation with Heavenly Cloud Sect's forces, his cold gaze locked on Zhong Qing.

"Little beast, what do you have to say now?"

"This lineup is indeed formidable." Zhong Qing slowly raised his head to scan his surroundings, unable to help but praise. "But if you're asking what I have to say, I can only repeat myself."

"Come here yourself, kneel, and bow your head in apology to my disciple. Then we can let today's matter rest."

"Stubborn fool."

Wu Yun roared with glacial fury.

"Even if you're powerful, can you be stronger than fifty-plus Sun Profound cultivators?"

"All forces, hear my command! Attack together and slay this villain!"

At Wu Yun's order.

In the sky above.

All fifty-plus Sun Profound cultivators moved simultaneously, forming various hand seals and unleashing various techniques.

In an instant.

Attacks wove together densely in mid-air, turning the space into a vacuum.

In this moment.

Heaven and earth changed color.

Wu Yun himself took the lead, channeling his profound technique to press down on Zhong Qing.

"Little beast, mobilizing this many from my Heavenly Cloud Sect to destroy you—you can die with pride. Now die!"

However.

Facing the combined assault of over fifty Sun Profound cultivators in the sky, Zhong Qing stood in place without a trace of fear on his face.

Instead, he shook his head with a sigh.

"Sigh."

"I gave you chances, but you didn't cherish them."

"You want to compare numbers? Fine, let's see who has more people."

As Zhong Qing's voice fell, the space before him rippled. Then a spatial gate materialized out of thin air.

This gate was the entrance to Zhong Qing's small world.

And the moment the gate opened, the wooden figurines Zhong Qing had stored on shelves inside his small world—moved!
