Chapter 5: You Trash Think You're Qualified to Join My Mufu Peak?

Up on the platform, one Peak Master voiced the question burning in everyone's mind, his lips trembling.

But the others were equally bewildered, exchanging confused glances.

All eyes turned instinctively toward Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong.

Xuanyuan Hong looked just as lost. His expression clearly said: Don't ask me—I have no idea either.

Of course.

The most incredulous of all was Duan Feng himself.

Having experienced it firsthand, he knew exactly how much power that punch contained.

That wasn't strength someone of his level should possess.

What the hell was going on?!

How could this little bastard have cultivation stronger than his own?!

At that moment, Zhong Qing's gaze landed on him.

"You wanted to kill me?"

Duan Feng's face darkened. He didn't dare speak.

Then Zhong Qing moved.

In a blink, he appeared before Duan Feng. Without a word, he threw another punch.

Duan Feng felt his scalp go numb. Instinctively, he gathered every shred of defensive power he had.

But the punch shattered his defenses like they were paper, sending him crashing into the building behind him. The structure collapsed into rubble.

Yet Zhong Qing wasn't finished.

Expression mocking, he advanced on Duan Feng again.

"Save... save me! Sect Master, save me!"

From the debris, Duan Feng's broken body let out a weak cry for help.

In this moment, he was truly terrified.

He never imagined this waste had been hiding such depths.

Had he known, he would never have dared offend him.

His plea snapped the stunned onlookers back to reality. Gasps echoed through the crowd.

No one had expected today's reversal.

The "waste" Peak Master of Mufu Peak had beaten the mighty Divine Sword Peak Master until he begged for mercy.

The other Peak Masters and elders finally reacted. Duan Feng was still Divine Sword Peak's leader—his death would be no small matter.

Several moved to intervene, only to find Zhong Qing's cold gaze suddenly lock onto them.

"I'd like to see who dares take another step."

That single icy statement froze everyone in place. No one dared advance.

Even Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong studied Zhong Qing with narrowed eyes. He couldn't see through this former "waste" anymore.

To Zhong Qing, being easygoing didn't mean being a pushover.

When someone tried to take your life, why show mercy?

He looked down at Duan Feng.

"In your next life, don't make an enemy of me."

Duan Feng's face twisted with reluctance, pain, hatred, desperation—but most of all, regret.

None of it mattered. One punch from Zhong Qing reduced everything to nothing.

With Duan Feng dead, the venue fell into a silence that made scalps prickle.

No one had imagined the "trash" of Mufu Peak could display such power.

Even less had they imagined the arrogant Divine Sword Peak Master would die so unceremoniously.

Sharp-eyed observers noticed something else.

If Zhong Qing had wanted, he could have killed Duan Feng with a single punch.

Using three punches instead suggested he'd been testing how much Duan Feng could withstand—or perhaps toying with him.

In other words, Zhong Qing's true cultivation was likely far beyond what he'd just displayed.

"Well, seems I misjudged your 'trash' master."

Nearby, Lin Feng was communicating with Sword Elder inside the ring.

"Does this mean my master is actually powerful?"

"Powerful might be an overstatement. He just surprised me a little." Sword Elder's tone remained dismissive. "Judging by his cultivation, he's only at Star Profound Realm. Back in my prime, I could've killed a whole crowd of Star Profound cultivators with one palm."

"So for you, he won't be of much real help."

Meanwhile, in the square below, the disciples who'd just joined Divine Sword Peak suddenly rushed toward Zhong Qing.

"Peak Master Zhong, I wish to join Mufu Peak! Please accept me!"

"Yes, please let me join Mufu Peak!"

As these voices rang out, more and more people joined the clamor. Everyone could see the benefits now.

Setting aside the strength Zhong Qing had demonstrated, the key point was that Mufu Peak had no one!

Joining early meant access to all of Mufu Peak's resources.

Everyone wanted to be first in line.

"I also wish to join Mufu Peak!"

"Mufu Peak is Xianjiang Sect's greatest peak! I want in!"

"Get back! I called dibs first!"

The crowd before Zhong Qing surged with excitement, everyone clamoring for his attention.

Zhong Qing surveyed the eager faces.

Their earlier words echoed in his mind—"Even dogs wouldn't join Mufu Peak."

A cold smile curved his lips.

"You trash think you're qualified to join my Mufu Peak? Not a chance."

Faces turned crimson with embarrassment.

Without sparing them another glance, Zhong Qing walked to Xuanyuan Hong.

"Sect Master, I've collected my disciple. I'll be returning to Mufu Peak now." He cupped his fists in respect.

Xuanyuan Hong gazed at the young man before him.

A thousand questions burned in his mind.

But in the end, he asked none of them. Instead, he smiled warmly. "Very well."

Zhong Qing nodded and departed with Lin Feng.

Watching Lin Feng leave with Zhong Qing, the other disciples were filled with regret and envy.

A white-talent disciple now had someone of Zhong Qing's caliber as his master.

And with no one else at Mufu Peak, Lin Feng would enjoy all its resources.

If only they'd chosen Mufu Peak from the start, they might have shared in that fortune.

But there were no second chances in this world.

Before long, Zhong Qing and Lin Feng arrived at Mufu Peak.

Unlike the bustling main peak, Mufu Peak was cold and quiet. Apart from the scenery, it seemed to have nothing going for it.

Once back, Zhong Qing immediately used Heavenly Eye on Lin Feng.

The system had said activating the Trash Bond required a truly talentless disciple. Yet Lin Feng had shown white talent during testing—not truly "trash" in the strictest sense.

Zhong Qing wanted answers.

「Lin Feng」

「Age: 16」

「Cultivation: None」

「Talent: None」

「Opportunity: Wears a Desolate Ring on his left hand. The ring contains the remnant soul of a Heaven Profound expert.」

「Note: White talent appeared during testing because the remnant soul in the ring manipulated the results.」

In an instant, all of Lin Feng's information appeared in Zhong Qing's mind.

Zhong Qing's expression turned intrigued.

A ring-bound grandpa, huh?

So that's how it was...
