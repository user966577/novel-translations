Chapter 79: What Kind of Terrifyingly Powerful Formula Is This?

In the courtyard!

Seeing the two so confident.

Zhong Qing said no more.

He released their physical restraints.

Then went back inside, retrieved the Myriad Origins Pill Scripture, and handed it to them.

"First look at this Perfect Foundation Pill formula. Come find me after you've read it!"

With that, he strolled back to his room and brewed himself a cup of tea.

The tea leaves were from Dawn Mist Valley.

The flavor was truly one of a kind.

Lingering aftertaste, fragrance remaining between the teeth.

One cup a day, refreshing and invigorating.

On the other side, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian were initially quite dismissive.

After all, in their eyes, Zhong Qing's alchemy technique was too crude.

Any one of their disciples, when it came to alchemy methods, would be a thousand times better than him.

Undeniably, Zhong Qing was very powerful.

But in alchemy, they were the big shots, and he was the little brother of little brothers.

Completely different levels.

Someone like him producing a formula—and so casually at that—how valuable could it be?

Yet just one glance.

Both were stunned by its contents!

"Using the five elements as fire, drawing the power of sun, moon, and stars as fuel, gathering the mountains and rivers from all directions as the furnace, using the Heaven-Stealing Earth-Mending Secret Art to seize heaven's essence and earth's liquid, one can create a Perfect Foundation Pill!"

"This... what kind of heaven-defying formula is this?"

Just the opening summary.

Had the two deeply shaken.

This formula was unheard of, unseen.

Its innovative thinking, its grand scope—it was completely incomparable to formulas circulating in the world.

It was as if an electric current ran through their hearts.

That was excitement.

With their mastery of alchemy.

They could see that this formula was extremely heaven-defying.

It was like opening a door to an entirely new world.

The more they read, the more excited they became, barely able to contain themselves.

The brilliance of this formula lay not only in its unprecedented, terrifying medicinal properties.

But also in its unique alchemy methods and pill-forming techniques.

Many alchemists liked to use earth fire to extract the medicinal properties of spirit herbs.

This was also the most common, most widespread alchemy technique.

Temperature control was an extremely important factor in pill formation.

Besides the fire-refining method, only senior alchemists knew there was also a water-refining method.

And as Holy Land elders, they considered themselves among the most powerful handful of alchemists in the Eastern Region.

Besides mastering fire-refining and water-refining methods, they could also merge the two into one.

This was the source of their pride, the basis of their superiority over others.

And now, this formula's alchemy methods included not only fire and water refining, but also described metal, wood, and earth refinement—together called Five Elements Alchemy.

Each alchemy method was invaluable.

Each was the foundation for alchemists to reach higher levels.

Each was a treasure worthy of passing down through generations!

Regarding Five Elements Alchemy, the two had only heard of it in ancient texts.

Legend said this alchemy method had long been lost to the river of history.

Who would have thought they would now see it with their own eyes?

One could say that if this Five Elements Alchemy method spread to the world, it would certainly drive countless alchemists mad.

And this still wasn't the most precious thing in the formula.

The Heaven-Stealing Earth-Mending Secret Art and the pill-forming techniques recorded in the formula.

Those were the most precious things.

One could say that just thoroughly digesting what was recorded in this formula would elevate their alchemy achievements by more than one level.

Originally, they had thought being imprisoned by Zhong Qing, enduring daily torture, was the darkest period of their lives.

But now they realized.

What it meant for heaven to entrust a great task to a man, first it must temper his will, strain his sinews and bones, starve his body, empty his resources, and disrupt all his actions—thus stimulating his heart, toughening his nature, and enhancing his abilities.

After the storm comes the rainbow.

This was clearly a heaven-defying opportunity!

"Old White, this book is so thick. Could the content afterward all be formulas?"

Shi Xiaotian's hands trembled. Perhaps from excessive excitement, even his beard quivered.

Hearing this, Wu Yue's whole body trembled as well.

The book was about a foot thick. If everything after was formulas, just how valuable was this entire book?

A curiosity like a cat scratching his heart arose from deep within.

He looked around and saw Zhong Qing leisurely drinking tea in the courtyard, not paying attention to this side.

He quietly said: "How about... we flip through and take a peek at what's after?"

"Just a little look?"

This suggestion naturally resonated with Shi Xiaotian.

Then the two eagerly began flipping through the later sections.

"Youth-Restoring Pill!"

"Life-Creation Fortune Pill!"

"Feathered Ascension Pill!"

After flipping through just three entries, both their eyes went red.

"Huff..."

Their chests heaved, blood throughout their bodies beginning to boil.

Three entries recorded three formulas.

Each one was a long-lost ancient formula with various miraculous effects.

In terms of value, none was inferior to the Perfect Foundation Pill—some were even superior.

The two dared not flip any further.

Each formula in here was an invaluable existence.

And peeking at two or three had already crossed a line.

If they read everything, they might be silenced.

The two struggled to tear their eyes from the Myriad Origins Pill Scripture.

They exchanged a glance, having made some kind of resolution in their hearts. Together they headed toward the small courtyard.

Before long, they stood before Zhong Qing.

Zhong Qing lightly sipped his fragrant tea and asked.

"How is it? Can you refine it?"

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian took deep breaths.

By now, looking at Zhong Qing, they were filled with awe.

Not only was his strength so powerful it left them far behind.

The formulas he possessed were so exquisite they were humbling.

Such formulas—never mind the Eastern Region—throughout the entire world, they would make countless top alchemists green with envy and willing to serve.

Originally, the two had wanted to show off a bit before Zhong Qing.

To let him know what the style of the Eastern Region's top alchemists looked like.

But now they realized, the clown had been themselves all along.

"Senior, this formula is profound and deep. For the two of us, it's quite a challenge!"

"But please allow us to try!"

Wu Yue made a humble request.

For alchemists, seeing such an exceptional formula and not being able to try refining it would be extremely painful.

Their words had also lost all their earlier confidence.

Their attitude was now extremely respectful, directly addressing him as "Senior," humble and deferential.

Zhong Qing naturally noticed this before-and-after reversal.

"Tell me honestly—within ten days, can you refine this pill, and with what certainty?"

"Ten days?"

This time constraint made Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian feel tremendous pressure.

But they still gritted their teeth and gave an answer.

"Seventy percent!"

This was the result Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian had calculated repeatedly.

"Seventy percent?"

Zhong Qing's brow furrowed slightly, somewhat dissatisfied.

What he wanted was one hundred percent!

But he also knew that for alchemy, the more precious the pill, the more it depended on timing, location, and human harmony.

And he didn't know many alchemists.

Immortal River Sect had a few, but he had to admit that second-rate sect alchemists were clearly at a different level from those from a Holy Land.

With time short and the task heavy, besides these two, he really had no suitable candidates.

"Seventy percent it is!"

"If we really fail, worst case I'll find another way to improve Lin Feng's aptitude later."

Thinking this, Zhong Qing told the two: "Then I'll leave refining the Perfect Foundation Pill to you."

"Whatever you need, just ask."

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian didn't hold back with Zhong Qing, directly requesting massive resources.

Though the Perfect Foundation Pill formula didn't mention any precious spirit materials, most ingredients came from nature itself.

Sun, moon, heaven, earth, mountains, rivers, stars!

But harnessing these forces wasn't something ordinary methods could achieve.

Much preparation was needed.

Of course, though the resources required were many, they were all common items that Immortal River Sect could easily supply.

Zhong Qing sent his junior disciple to Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong.

Requesting a batch of materials.

The latter naturally approved without question.

With a grand wave of his hand, it was all granted.

And once the materials were gathered, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian began their enthusiastic alchemy journey.
