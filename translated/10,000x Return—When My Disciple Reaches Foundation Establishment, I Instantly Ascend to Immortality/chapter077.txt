Chapter 77: Regret Beyond Measure

For this rescue of Shi Xiaotian, Wu Yue had taken it quite seriously.

Deploying two Sun Profound puppets.

Yet upon seeing how young Zhong Qing was, he felt he had been overly cautious.

Old Black had also been too careless, capsizing in a ditch, falling victim to this greenhorn Zhong Qing's ambush, ending up in such a state.

Given Zhong Qing's eighteen-year-old bone age, he didn't believe that in a direct confrontation, Zhong Qing could match Old Black.

To crush him would take but a single finger.

Thus, he extended one finger, taking a lofty stance to crush Zhong Qing!

One finger from a Sun Profound powerhouse could pierce through mountains and tear apart rivers.

Extremely terrifying.

Facing this horrifying strike, Zhong Qing lightly threw out a palm.

Then the previously imposing Wu Yue, displaying all the bearing of a grandmaster, was instantly slapped to the ground.

This scene stirred boundless waves in Shi Xiaotian's heart.

"How... how can he be this strong?"

Last time, facing Zhong Qing, he hadn't even figured out what happened before being knocked unconscious.

This time, he saw everything clearly.

Both at Sun Profound, and Old White's overall strength was even greater than his own by more than a bit, yet before Zhong Qing, he had no power to resist whatsoever.

Just one move!

With overwhelming force, Old White had been taken down.

"Pfft..."

In the small courtyard, Wu Yue vomited blood profusely, looking at Zhong Qing with eyes full of terror.

He was a Sun Profound powerhouse!

Throughout the entire Eastern Region, that counted as a ranked expert.

Yet before Zhong Qing, he couldn't last even one move!

At this moment, Wu Yue's heart was filled with grief and indignation.

This grief and indignation was directed at Infinity Sect's Shadow Guard leader.

What were those people in the Shadow Guard department eating?

There was such a terrifyingly powerful expert stationed at a sect, and in their intelligence gathering, it was just classified as a second-rate sect.

This was absolutely outrageous.

Meanwhile!

The Shadow Guard leader processing intelligence at Infinity Sect suddenly shivered for no reason.

"Who's thinking about me?"

He murmured, his expression showing some confusion.

As Shadow Guard leader, his identity was destined to remain in the shadows. Combined with his extremely low-key nature, those who truly knew him could be counted on one hand.

Recently, he had only interacted with the Seventh and Eighth Elders.

"Could it be that the Seventh Elder successfully reached Immortal River Sect, completed his task, and remembering my contribution, is preparing to reward me when he returns?" The Shadow Guard leader thought it over, and the only one who could be thinking of him was the Seventh Elder.

His intuition was actually quite accurate.

Just the reality was a bit different from his imagination.

The Seventh Elder wasn't thinking of rewarding him—he was thinking of killing him.

Command Hall Peak!

Small courtyard!

One move from Zhong Qing had completely stripped Wu Yue of his combat ability.

Utterly destroyed his pride, shattered his arrogance.

Wu Yue was terrified, but he still hadn't completely given up hope of resistance.

He still had his trump cards—the two Sun Profound puppets.

By now, he had completely abandoned any thoughts of destroying Immortal River Sect or flattening Command Hall Peak.

He only hoped the two puppets could hold Zhong Qing for a moment, creating an opportunity for him and Shi Xiaotian to escape.

With a thought, he gave the two puppets the order to attack Zhong Qing. The two Sun Profound puppets moved immediately.

But before they could unleash the power befitting Sun Profound, in the next moment, Zhong Qing casually waved his hand. A gust of energy appeared, and the two puppets were instantly reduced to dust.

This situation left Wu Yue completely stunned.

These were two Sun Profound puppets!

Even slaughtering pigs would take some time!

His understanding of Zhong Qing's power rose another level.

In the evening twilight, Zhong Qing strolled before Wu Yue and picked him up like a chick.

"I was just worrying about where to find another test subject, and here you come at just the right time!"

As he spoke, he looked back at Shi Xiaotian.

"Xiaotian! Nice work! If you have other close friends, feel free to invite them over."

Upon hearing this, Wu Yue's eyes went wide.

These words made it hard not to suspect that Shi Xiaotian and Zhong Qing had set up this scheme together to lure him here.

As for Shi Xiaotian, he nearly fell apart on the spot.

So the savior he'd called for, in Zhong Qing's eyes, was just another test subject like himself.

For a moment, he didn't know what words to use to express his current feelings.

Just like that, Wu Yue became the second experimental subject for Zhong Qing's pill testing on Command Hall Peak.

To verify whether the problem was with the pills he'd refined or whether Shi Xiaotian had an allergic reaction, Zhong Qing even pulled an all-nighter that evening.

He rushed to produce a batch of pills. Without exception, this batch was still lump-shaped.

And reality was often unsatisfying.

The pills he refined weren't just effective on Shi Xiaotian—they worked equally well on Wu Yue.

This night was destined to be restless.

Where before there had been only one wailing, agonized voice, now there were two.

Sounds so miserable they were like wraiths crawling from hell.

By now, Wu Yue finally understood why Shi Xiaotian had become skin and bones in such a short time.

These pills were so toxic, their properties so fierce—he could barely stand trying them once.

That his good friend had survived until now was truly a miracle.

Near dawn, as the drug effects slightly faded.

The two lay exhausted on the ground, gasping.

Shi Xiaotian's gaze was somewhat resentful: "Old White, I was already stuck here. Couldn't you have brought more experts?"

Wu Yue: "..."

Good grief. I haven't even called you to account, and you're complaining about me first.

"This guy is this terrifying—why didn't you mention it in your message?"

He had thought himself cautious enough.

Coming to a minor second-rate sect while bringing two Sun Profound puppets.

And the result?

The other party's distress message hadn't mentioned a word about the enemy's strength.

If not for the two of them enduring that inhuman torture together last night, he'd have suspected he'd been set up.

Hearing this, Shi Xiaotian felt a bit awkward.

It wasn't that he didn't want to warn him—he genuinely didn't know how terrifying Zhong Qing was. Back then, he hadn't figured out what was happening before he passed out.

Besides, when writing the distress message, time was urgent, everything kept simple. He hadn't considered that much.

He'd only assumed that Wu Yue, knowing he was in danger, would surely take it very seriously.

Who knew he'd end up harming him instead.

Now they had to endure this inhuman torture together.

Looking at his friend's haggard face, his somewhat pale complexion.

Shi Xiaotian's heart filled with endless regret.

Regret beyond measure!

Wouldn't it have been nice to just be an elder at Infinity Sect?

Why did he have to compete for some Pill King title?

If he hadn't been blinded by fame and fortune, why would he have gone searching for some Heaven Spirit Grass, ending up in this situation?
