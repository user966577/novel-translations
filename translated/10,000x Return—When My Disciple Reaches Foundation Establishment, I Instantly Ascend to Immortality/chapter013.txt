Chapter 13: Divine Phoenix Bloodline? Sorry, You Still Don't Meet My Disciple Requirements

"Nonsense."

Before Lin Feng could finish, Su Wenjiu cut him off with a sharp cry.

"What I clearly said was that your cultivation was progressing so rapidly that I wondered where you studied, so I could seek apprenticeship with your master—not that I wanted you as my disciple."

In her panic, Su Wenjiu's face flushed crimson.

Her words left Lin Feng completely bewildered.

The young man scratched the back of his head, blinking.

"Is that really what you said? I remember it differently." Lin Feng looked puzzled. "You also said you were from an Eastern Region Holy Land and that joining the Holy Land would be better for me than staying at Mufu Peak."

"You heard wrong."

Su Wenjiu scrambled to explain. "Yes, I mentioned being from a Holy Land, but what I said was that even in my Holy Land, I've never seen a disciple progress as rapidly as you. I couldn't help wanting to join Mufu Peak myself."

"Then what about offering me an eighth-grade sword?"

"That was... that was..." She fumbled. "That was to ask for your introduction. The sword was payment for the referral."

To avoid offending Zhong Qing, Su Wenjiu was now lying through her teeth with breathtaking shamelessness.

Her survival instinct was maxed out.

Fearing Zhong Qing wouldn't believe her, she quickly bowed to him with utmost sincerity. "Senior, it's truly as I said. When I saw this young brother's remarkable cultivation speed, I knew he must have an extraordinary master."

"So in a moment of impulse, I followed him to Mufu Peak hoping to become your disciple. But before I could even meet you, I accidentally fell into the Bitter Sea."

"Regardless, I entered your peak without permission. I beg Senior's forgiveness."

With that, Su Wenjiu dropped to her knees, prostrating herself on the ground.

"Pah. Never in my life have I seen such shamelessness."

Inside the Desolate Ring, Sword Elder couldn't help but comment.

"Hmph, I knew she didn't say it that way. Sword Elder, you heard her too. How can she be so brazen?"

Lin Feng was fuming.

He was about to expose this shameless woman's true colors to Zhong Qing when Zhong Qing waved him off.

Zhong Qing wasn't an idiot. He could tell the truth without needing it spelled out.

But he wasn't particularly angry either.

Ever since the 100x bonus had been activated, Lin Feng's terrifying cultivation speed would make anyone's eyes turn green with envy. It was only natural that someone would want to take him as a disciple.

Following Lin Feng to Mufu Peak and then falling into the Bitter Sea meant this woman had already suffered plenty.

Besides, shameless as her lying was, her attitude was at least sincere.

So he couldn't be bothered pursuing the matter further.

"Miss, you should go. Don't come to Mufu Peak again."

Su Wenjiu's face burned.

She could tell from Zhong Qing's demeanor that he'd seen through her lies. Red-faced, she hastily apologized: "I'm sorry, Senior. I lied just now. I shouldn't have done that."

"I was blind and ignorant, and I offended you."

"A disciple who cultivates as rapidly as yours—I'm not qualified to take him on anyway."

"But Senior, what I said afterward was genuinely from the heart. I truly wish to become your disciple. Please grant my request."

Su Wenjiu spoke with utmost respect.

Having met Zhong Qing, she had indeed developed a genuine desire to become his disciple.

He was the first person in her entire life whose depths she couldn't fathom. Add to that the Bitter Sea she'd experienced and the terrifying display of fishing that behemoth out of it—

Apprenticing under Zhong Qing couldn't possibly be wrong.

Her words surprised Zhong Qing somewhat.

Her final honesty, while not exactly earning his goodwill, at least dispelled any lingering ill will.

But taking her as a disciple...

Zhong Qing couldn't help but examine her, and after a moment's observation, he shook his head.

"Miss, you don't meet my requirements for taking disciples. You should leave."

Just now, he'd used Heavenly Eye to examine her. Her talent and aptitude were indeed exceptional.

But she couldn't activate the bond.

To him, she was useless.

And since he couldn't actually teach, taking her on would benefit neither of them.

"I don't meet the requirements?"

Su Wenjiu was genuinely struck by this.

After all, her talent and abilities had shattered every record in Dawn Mist Valley's history.

Back then, the sect's senior elders had nearly come to blows trying to take her as their disciple, each one bringing out their most prized treasures. None had emerged victorious, and none would yield.

In the end, they'd agreed to have everyone teach her collectively, which finally settled the dispute.

Because of this, as Dawn Mist Valley's Saintess, she technically had no single master.

And she hadn't disappointed them. At barely twenty-something years old, her cultivation had already reached Moon Profound Realm.

Without exaggeration, she was Dawn Mist Valley's future.

Yet here, before Zhong Qing, she didn't even qualify to become a disciple.

But this only strengthened her resolve.

Because she understood that encountering Zhong Qing at Mufu Peak today might be a disaster—or it might be an opportunity.

She was prepared to reveal her greatest secret.

A secret known only to a handful of people in Dawn Mist Valley. If revealed before her strength matured, it could bring catastrophe upon both herself and her sect.

She believed that once she revealed this secret, Zhong Qing would change his mind and accept her.

"Senior, aside from my natural talent, I actually have a hidden secret that no one knows about..."

Su Wenjiu took a deep breath.

She was gathering the courage to speak when Zhong Qing beat her to it.

"I know. You have a trace of ancient Divine Phoenix bloodline in your body."

He said it casually.

When he'd examined her with Heavenly Eye earlier, he'd already seen it. Under that gaze, no strength, no talent, no hidden physique could remain concealed.

???

Su Wenjiu's eyes went wide, her red lips forming an O.

Her Divine Phoenix bloodline—the thing she prided herself on, the thing she'd thought so perfectly hidden that no one could detect—he'd known about it all along?

And he mentioned it so casually?

"I'm sorry, miss. Even with a Divine Phoenix bloodline, you still don't meet my requirements for taking disciples."

"Please leave."

Zhong Qing packed up his catch, satisfied that he'd fulfilled today's appetite goals, and stood to head back.

"Disciple, see our guest out."

"Yes."

Watching Zhong Qing depart, Su Wenjiu's expression turned bitter.

His words echoed in her mind.

Even with a Divine Phoenix bloodline, you still don't meet my requirements...

That single sentence had crushed what little remained of her pride.
