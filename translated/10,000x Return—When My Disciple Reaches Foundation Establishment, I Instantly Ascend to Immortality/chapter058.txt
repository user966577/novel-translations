Chapter 58: The Senior's Extraordinariness

By the time Su Wenjiu and Lu Qingxia arrived at Immortal River Sect, it was already the next day!

The two flew through the air!

The mountain terrain below was fully visible.

The mountains were verdant, the waters crystal clear—the scenery was exceptional!

"If not for the Third Ancestor's great crisis, staying here for a while, gazing at mountains and admiring scenery, would be quite nice."

Lu Qingxia thought to herself.

"Master, ahead is Senior Zhong Qing's Command Hall Peak!"

Su Wenjiu pointed the way.

Her words carried considerable excitement.

All along this journey, she knew her master's attitude.

Clearly, she didn't hold much hope that Zhong Qing could save the Third Ancestor.

But others might not know.

Didn't she know?

Zhong Qing gave her the feeling of being a hidden master, a banished immortal returned to the world.

She was confident that once her master witnessed that senior's extraordinariness, her opinion would surely change.

Half a quarter-hour later, the master and disciple had arrived above Command Hall Peak.

"Senior!"

"Su Wenjiu has come to visit!"

She kept her posture very low.

This made Lu Qingxia curious.

This disciple of hers was quite proud and arrogant.

She had never seen her be so respectful to anyone.

She very much wanted to see what was so special about this person who could make her disciple so convinced.

Before long, the courtyard door on Command Hall Peak opened.

A figure walked out from within.

He wore a blue robe.

Long hair casually draped down to his waist.

Yet it didn't look messy—rather, it had a certain unrestrained charm.

His features were refined, his expression resolute.

His entire bearing was extraordinary—composed and restrained.

The first impression he gave was: handsome!

Of course, in the cultivation world, temperament and appearance were secondary.

Strength was the foundation for establishing oneself.

Lu Qingxia repeatedly examined Zhong Qing but couldn't sense a single fluctuation of spiritual power from him.

She looked at her disciple with confusion in her eyes.

As if asking: "This is the hidden master you spoke of?"

Su Wenjiu understood her master's meaning.

She secretly transmitted: "Master, please be patient."

"The reason a master is a master is precisely because they don't reveal themselves."

"If someone could be easily seen through, how could they be called a master?"

Lu Qingxia didn't argue.

She decided to observe further.

At this moment, Zhong Qing looked at Su Wenjiu hovering in the clouds.

"What are you here for?"

In his impression, this girl was rather thick-skinned and liked to talk big.

His feelings toward her weren't particularly good!

One sentence left Su Wenjiu not knowing how to respond!

After all, she was a young lady with thin skin.

There had been some not-so-pleasant misunderstandings with him before.

She couldn't very well just say outright that she wanted to ask him for a favor!

Lu Qingxia noticed her disciple's awkward predicament.

She immediately spoke up.

"I've heard that Sir once saved my disciple's life."

"Today, we two happened to pass through your esteemed territory and wished to pay a visit to express our gratitude!"

Zhong Qing stroked his chin.

After pondering a moment, he said, "All who pass through my door are guests. Why not come down for a cup of tea?"

"Thank you, Senior!"

Zhong Qing's invitation allowed Su Wenjiu to set down a huge weight in her heart.

She had been worried he wouldn't want to see her.

If the esteemed Holy Land Sect Master and Saintess came to visit and were refused, she would truly become a laughingstock!

Fortunately, this didn't happen.

The two women descended from the sky to the ground.

Following Zhong Qing, they entered the small courtyard!

In the reception room!

Zhong Qing poured each of them a cup of tea.

Su Wenjiu solemnly introduced: "Master, this is Senior Zhong Qing, whom I've mentioned to you many times."

"Senior, this is my master—the current Dawn Mist Valley Holy Land Sect Master, Lu Qingxia!"

After the introductions.

Lu Qingxia slowly sipped her fragrant tea and said, "Sir, this place has beautiful mountains and clear waters, with excellent scenery."

"As they say, one's choice of landscape reflects one's character."

"One can see that Sir is a person of refined taste!"

Zhong Qing smiled and said, "I follow my own path. Whether refined or common, I don't care at all."

"Life in this world—what one seeks is simply peace and contentment!"

These words immediately raised him in Lu Qingxia's estimation.

Setting aside everything else, just this broad-minded temperament wasn't something just anyone could possess.

The few of them chatted and laughed, and the atmosphere was quite harmonious!

When midday arrived.

Lu Qingxia proposed: "Sir, I find the scenery of this Command Hall Peak quite excellent. Might we take a stroll around the mountain?"

She had come here to seek a hidden master.

Whether Zhong Qing was one or not, she still couldn't quite determine.

Verifying his identity would be quite simple.

She just needed to go see the Bitter Sea that Su Wenjiu had mentioned. Whether it was as mysterious as described would basically settle the matter!

"Please, feel free!"

Command Hall Peak indeed had pleasant scenery, and there was nothing secretive or forbidden.

Zhong Qing naturally had no objections.

The two women left the small courtyard.

"Master, what do you think?" Su Wenjiu asked eagerly. "Can you see the Senior's extraordinariness!"

"Just take me to see that so-called Bitter Sea!"

"Once I see it, I'll more or less be able to make a judgment!"

These words suited Su Wenjiu perfectly.

In her view, that place was the world's greatest terror.

It was also the most direct and powerful evidence proving Zhong Qing's extraordinariness.

She said immediately, "Master, please follow me!"

As she spoke, she led Lu Qingxia toward the back mountain.

But the Bitter Sea had long since been stored by Zhong Qing in his small world.

When she reached the destination, what lay before her eyes was just an ordinary small pond!

"How can it be gone?"

Su Wenjiu panicked.

"I clearly remember it was right here!"

She searched all over the mountains but found no trace of the Bitter Sea.

"Enough, Wenjiu. Let's drop this matter!"

Lu Qingxia's expression wasn't pleasant.

She shouldn't have had any expectations about this!

After all, a second-rate sect—how could it produce a master stronger than a Holy Land!

This was simply a fairy tale!

"Let's go back!"

"We'll need to plan carefully to save the Third Ancestor!"

In her heart, she had already eliminated the possibility of Zhong Qing being a hidden powerhouse.

She was prepared to return to the small courtyard, say her farewells, and leave.

But just as the two returned to the small courtyard.

At that moment!

A figure leaped through the sky.

He had a burly, imposing build and wore black robes!

His aura was majestic and deep as an abyss.

"How can it be him?"

Lu Qingxia's heart clenched.

This person was none other than Heibai.

She had experienced Heibai's power firsthand.

Before him, even she, a dignified Holy Land Sect Master, couldn't withstand a single exchange.

But what was he doing here?
