Chapter 9: You Think an Eighth-Grade Toy Can Compete With Us?

The woman had also been cultivating in these mountains.

With her level of cultivation, everything within dozens of miles fell under her perception.

She'd noticed Lin Feng the moment he killed that demonic beast.

But she'd only spared him a glance.

A mere Houtian youth wasn't worth much attention.

Yet when she sensed Lin Feng break through from Houtian Stage Seven to Xiantian in just a day or two, she could no longer remain calm.

What did that kind of speed mean?

A white-talent cultivator would never achieve it in an entire lifetime.

Blue-talent disciples—the backbone of major sects—would need ten years to reach this point.

Even someone like her, a purple-talent prodigy who advanced by leaps and bounds, would require at least a year or two to break into Xiantian.

Yet this youth was breaking through as casually as eating or drinking.

How could she stay composed?

She'd never considered taking a disciple before. In this moment, her heart stirred completely.

Without another word, she stepped through the air, covering ten feet with each stride. Moments later, she stood before Lin Feng.

Lin Feng had just reached Xiantian and was preparing—as Sword Elder instructed—to find an Xiantian-level beast to consolidate his cultivation. Then he noticed a woman standing before him.

Snow-white robes, strikingly beautiful.

But his eyes held only wariness.

Because she was staring at him with an almost feverish intensity.

"Who are you?" Lin Feng asked guardedly.

"Young one, let me introduce myself. I am Su Wenjiu of Dawn Mist Valley, a Holy Land of the Eastern Region. I've come to ask you one question: Will you become my disciple?"

The white-robed woman stood upon empty air, robes billowing, looking down at him with an air of superiority.

"Take a disciple?"

Lin Feng blinked, then quickly shook his head. "I'm sorry, Senior. I already have a master."

"Already has a master?"

Su Wenjiu's brows furrowed. Such a heaven-defying prodigy already belonged to someone?

"Then may I ask where you studied?"

"My master and I live at Immortal River Sect, about 50 miles from here."

"Immortal River Sect?"

Su Wenjiu was surprised.

She'd assumed Lin Feng's master was some extraordinary figure. Instead, he came from Immortal River Sect?

As far as she knew, Immortal River Sect was barely a second-rate power in the Eastern Region.

A tiny second-rate sect—even its Sect Master wouldn't register in her eyes. What qualified them to possess such a prodigy?

Only someone from a Holy Land like herself was worthy of such a disciple.

"Young one, Immortal River Sect is merely a second-rate sect in the Eastern Region. With your talent, you deserve better than languishing in such a backwater."

Su Wenjiu extended her offer directly. "Dawn Mist Valley is one of the Eastern Region's Holy Lands. Say the word, and I'll take you there immediately."

"I'm not interested."

Lin Feng refused without hesitation.

Su Wenjiu saw the youth remained unmoved. "Do you not understand what a Holy Land represents?"

"I do."

Sword Elder had educated him on such matters long ago.

"Then why refuse?"

Su Wenjiu frowned, pressing on. "Become my disciple, and cultivation resources, advanced methods, weapons, treasures—all will be yours to choose from."

Words alone didn't seem sufficient to convince him.

As she spoke, a crimson longsword slid from her sleeve.

She waved it through the air. Sword qi sliced outward as firelight scattered across the sky, brilliant sword-flowers dazzling to behold.

A single strike cleaved a nearby cliff in half.

Devastating power!

Sheathing the blade, Su Wenjiu caressed its edge and smiled. "This is Fire Dance—an eighth-grade divine weapon, one of the proudest creations of Dawn Mist Valley's foremost artifact refiner."

"Agree, and Fire Dance is yours."

She raised her eyes to Lin Feng.

In her imagination, he'd be mesmerized by Fire Dance, unable to look away.

Setting aside the genuine rarity of an eighth-grade weapon, Lin Feng—despite his monstrous cultivation talent—was young and weak. How refined could his tastes possibly be?

And yet.

Lin Feng's expression remained flat.

He didn't spare Fire Dance a second glance.

"Senior, I've already told you—I have a master. Please stop asking. I won't agree."

Lin Feng's refusal was absolute.

A single Holy Land of the Eastern Region? So what if it were the greatest Holy Land on the entire continent?

Could their gifts compare to what Zhong Qing had given him?

Of course not.

And even if someone could offer more valuable treasures than Zhong Qing's, Lin Feng would still refuse.

Master—he acknowledged only Zhong Qing.

Inside the Desolate Ring, Sword Elder nearly laughed out loud.

Since when did a measly eighth-grade toy dare try to compete?

In that person's eyes at Command Hall Peak, an eighth-grade sword probably wasn't even fit to be used as a fire poker.

Without exaggeration, even the scraps that fell from Zhong Qing's fingernails were worth more than this so-called Holy Land could offer.

Watching Lin Feng walk away, Su Wenjiu stood frozen, Fire Dance in hand.

Fury erupted in her chest.

This brat had actually ignored her?

But for the sake of Lin Feng's talent, she suppressed her heaving chest and swallowed her anger.

"He probably just hasn't seen the world. Doesn't understand what a Holy Land versus a second-rate sect really means."

"And judging by how he speaks, he seems rather devoted to his master."

"That's actually a good thing—decent character."

"Since I can't persuade the boy, I'll simply deal with his master directly."

In Su Wenjiu's mind, this was trivial. A mere second-rate sect—even if Lin Feng were the Sect Master's personal disciple, so what?

She'd find his master, appeal to reason and emotion, offer benefits that would seem heaven-sent to people of their caliber. Acquiring this disciple shouldn't be difficult.

If Lin Feng's master truly cared about the boy's future, he'd understand that becoming her disciple was actually in Lin Feng's best interest.

Under her guidance and Dawn Mist Valley's resources, Lin Feng would undoubtedly reach far greater heights.

Mind made up, she set aside her irritation and followed Lin Feng at a distance.

After leaving, Lin Feng found several Xiantian-level beasts and engaged them in combat.

The battles tempered his newly consolidated cultivation and provided valuable real-world experience.

His trip complete, Lin Feng wasted no time heading back to Command Hall Peak.

Fifty miles was nothing to his current self.

Soon, he arrived home.

High above Command Hall Peak, Su Wenjiu stood upon the sky, taking in the entire peak at a glance.

"So this is where that boy's master lives?"

With that, she stepped through the air.

In a flash, she landed on Command Hall Peak.
