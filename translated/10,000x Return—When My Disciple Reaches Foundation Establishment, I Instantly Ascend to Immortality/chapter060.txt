Chapter 60: I Don't Think You're a True Disciple of Any Peak

"Thank you, Senior!"

Lu Qingxia and Su Wenjiu were overjoyed upon hearing this.

They never expected Zhong Qing to agree to their request so easily, and without wanting any compensation at that.

And when he heard about the Emperor-grade cultivation method, he had treated it as if it were nothing special.

As if such a precious thing was just ordinary in his eyes.

Amid their profuse thanks, Zhong Qing didn't delay!

That very night, he set off with the two of them.

The system said that person was on his last breath.

If he dawdled and arrived to find the person already dead, that would truly be saving nothing but loneliness.

The three traveled swiftly. In just one day's time, they arrived at Dawn Mist Valley!

"Senior, you've had a tiring journey!"

"Please rest well for a day. Once we've made preparations, we'll set out tomorrow to rescue our Dawn Mist Valley's Third Ancestor."

Lu Qingxia arranged an elegant pavilion courtyard for Zhong Qing and spoke respectfully.

It wasn't that she didn't want to go immediately.

But that Abyssal Secret Realm was also quite far from Dawn Mist Valley.

Moreover, the terrain of the Abyssal Secret Realm was complex, shrouded in thick fog, making it difficult to find one's bearings.

Without professional guides, one could easily get lost within.

Taking a day to prepare and organize was quite necessary.

Zhong Qing had no objections!

And so he stayed at Dawn Mist Valley!

It had to be said, as a Holy Land of the Eastern Region, Dawn Mist Valley had its impressive qualities.

At least the bed was big enough, soft enough, and comfortable enough.

The food was quite excellent too!

Things that flew in the sky, ran on the ground, and swam in the water—they had it all.

Every dish was a rare delicacy.

Rich in spiritual energy, with superb taste!

Zhong Qing caught up on sleep and had a meal.

Then he strolled around Dawn Mist Valley, wanting to see the scenery of a Holy Land sect.

Looking at the distant mountains—like a roaring white tiger, standing with imposing momentum, grand and ancient.

Looking closer at the water—rushing and flowing, like a raging dragon.

Looking at the land—spiritual fruits formed orchards, valuable medicines visible everywhere.

One could see the whole from a glimpse. The foundation and scale of a Holy Land sect was not something the likes of Immortal River Sect could compare to.

Zhong Qing crossed over a tall mountain, leaped across several ridges.

He came to a place with a cascading waterfall!

The waterfall rushed down, splashing spray several yards high.

Forming a secluded pool.

Above the water's surface, spiritual energy was dense and hazy like smoke.

Giving one a sense of ethereal, tranquil beauty.

Zhong Qing was immediately drawn to this scenery.

He stopped to gaze.

This scene and setting made him want to compose a poem.

But after racking his brains for a while.

He could only squeeze out two words: "Awesome!"

Nine years of compulsory education, three years of exam preparation, four years of university—nearly all the knowledge had been forgotten.

"So does this mean I studied for nothing?"

Zhong Qing felt a bit vexed!

Fortunately, he stopped trying to compose poetry!

From start to finish, he had never really been a cultured person.

Just then!

From the hazy spiritual mist, a woman walked toward him.

She was around sixteen, wearing an elegant long dress, jade ornaments at her waist, holding a purple-green longsword.

Her face was beautiful, her bearing refined.

One could call her a beauty who caught the eye.

The woman's name was Lin Yuexia.

A true disciple of Dawn Mist Valley.

In this Holy Land sect, Dawn Mist Valley.

Disciple ranks were divided into outer, entry, inner, true, and saintess levels.

True disciples could be considered the cream of the crop, the future pillars and backbone of the sect.

Lin Yuexia saw Zhong Qing.

Her elegant brows furrowed!

"Whose disciple are you?"

"This Flying Immortal Pool is a sect restricted area. Only true disciples and above, or those carrying the Sect Master's token, may enter!"

"I've never seen you before. I don't think you're a true disciple of any peak."

"Do you have a token?"

Her posture was quite haughty.

Her words carried a questioning tone, along with the pride unique to a true disciple.

Zhong Qing was taken aback!

He had forgotten.

This wasn't his own territory.

There were many rules and many taboos.

"Miss, I am not from Dawn Mist Valley."

"I didn't know this place had such rules."

"My apologies for the offense!"

"I'll leave right away!"

As they say, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

On someone else's territory, it was best to follow their rules.

This wasn't about being afraid—it was the manners and upbringing a normal person should have.

But as he was about to leave.

The woman wouldn't let him go.

Upon hearing that Zhong Qing wasn't from Dawn Mist Valley.

She bristled like a porcupine, instantly going on the defensive!

"You thief! Not from Dawn Mist Valley, and you dare enter such a restricted area without a token?"

"Violating our Holy Land's dignity!"

"If you know what's good for you, bind your own hands, seal your cultivation, and come with me to the Enforcement Hall to admit your crime!"

"Otherwise, the sword in my hand won't show mercy!"

Lin Yuexia couldn't see through Zhong Qing's cultivation.

But someone this young—how high could his cultivation be?

And today, capturing a thief who had trespassed into a restricted area would be quite an achievement.

At this moment, in her eyes, Zhong Qing had become merit points!

Seeing her like this, Zhong Qing's brow furrowed.

"Miss, I am not a thief. I was invited here by your Sect Master."

But these words instantly drew mocking laughter from Lin Yuexia.

"My Sect Master—what kind of person is she?"

"Cultivation supreme, dominating the region. Status revered, above ten thousand."

"Do you even realize what class you are?"

"Shifty-eyed, nameless nobody. I can tell at a glance you're no good person!"

"Someone like you claims to be invited by my Sect Master?"

"Truly laughable beyond measure!"

These words made Zhong Qing angry!

Admittedly, he was in the wrong first.

But her aggressive manner, criticizing him from head to toe until nothing was left—that was going too far.

"Miss, leave some room in your words—we might meet again someday."

"I advise you to keep a civil tongue!"

"A mere petty thief dares to question me?"

"Seeking death!"

With a sharp cry!

Lin Yuexia drew her sword and thrust!

The gleaming sword light carried an unstoppable momentum, as if it could cleave mountains—quite impressive!

Clearly, she had gone all out from the start, with no intention of holding back.

Zhong Qing's brow furrowed slightly. Wanting to teach her a lesson, he struck out with one palm.

In an instant, the palm wind was like thunder, carrying terrifying force. The longsword was directly shattered.

Lin Yuexia herself was sent flying over a dozen yards.

Until she crashed through three towering ancient trees did she barely manage to stop.

"Pfft..."

A mouthful of fresh blood sprayed out. At this moment, Lin Yuexia had become a bloody mess.

At least three ribs were broken throughout her body.

She looked utterly wretched.

"What's going on?"

This commotion quickly alerted others in Dawn Mist Valley.

In just moments, over a dozen people had flown over.
