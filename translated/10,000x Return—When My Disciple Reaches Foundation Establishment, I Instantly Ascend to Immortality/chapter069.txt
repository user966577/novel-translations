Chapter 69: I Came Here to Kill Someone

Night fell!

A bright moon hung in the sky, stars glittered brilliantly.

Moonlight and starlight blanketed the earth, mingling with the candlelight to illuminate all of Flying Saber Sect!

As one of the Eastern Region's first-rate powers, Flying Saber Sect's strength and resources were not to be underestimated.

One could see Enforcement Hall elders leading disciples on patrol.

In the back mountain's dense forest, a Peak Master was instructing his personal disciple.

In a secret chamber, a powerhouse was in closed-door cultivation, striving to break through to greater heights.

The entire Flying Saber Sect gave off an impression of thriving prosperity and formidable strength.

Yet in the next moment, whether it was the patrolling elders, the Peak Master teaching his disciple, or the Flying Saber Sect higher-ups in seclusion...

All seemed to sense something.

One by one, they cast their gazes through the void toward Flying Saber Sect's main hall.

There, at some point, two figures had appeared—one tall, one small.

The taller one appeared to be about eighteen, wearing a blue robe.

Black hair cascaded casually to his waist, giving him a languid, carefree air.

Yet his presence was supremely transcendent.

Robes flowing, handsome and noble—like an immortal descended to the mortal world.

The smaller one's energy was restrained within, yet his body contained surging blood energy and power.

Like the cub of an ancient fierce beast—extraordinarily exceptional.

These two were none other than Zhong Qing and Su Ye.

"Whoosh..."

As sounds of breaking air approached.

Flying Saber Sect elders and Peak Masters arrived one after another.

"You two have trespassed into our Flying Saber Sect at night. What is your purpose?"

An elder's voice boomed like a great bell.

Had these been ordinary people, they wouldn't have bothered with such formalities.

They would have simply seized them!

But Flying Saber Sect was no ordinary sect.

The entire sect was protected by a defensive formation.

This formation recorded information on all Flying Saber Sect members.

Once an outsider trespassed, it would trigger the formation.

Either the intruder would be slain directly by the formation.

Or an alarm would be raised!

Yet these two had appeared silently, yet openly, in Flying Saber Sect's main hall.

Even after being surrounded by numerous high-ranking members, they remained calm and composed, utterly unperturbed.

Combined with their transcendent presence.

Anyone could see how extraordinary these two were.

Thus, they hadn't acted immediately.

Instead, they tried to ascertain the pair's purpose.

Under the moonlit night.

Zhong Qing stood with hands behind his back.

Standing in place.

Before the scrutinizing and grave gazes of the Flying Saber Sect elders, he spoke calmly: "The moon is lovely tonight. I've come to kill someone!"

"Bold!"

At these words, the Flying Saber Sect elders flew into rage.

"To be so presumptuous—do you think our Flying Saber Sect has no one capable of stopping you?"

Someone's face darkened ominously.

Their Flying Saber Sect was a colossal power in the entire Eastern Region.

Now, someone had the audacity to announce they were here to kill someone—right to their faces.

Too arrogant!

Completely disregarding their Flying Saber Sect.

If word of this spread, how would their Flying Saber Sect maintain its standing in the Eastern Region?

Some were so furious they nearly exploded on the spot.

However, at the critical moment, the current Sect Master of Flying Saber Sect, Dugu Feng, intervened.

Dugu Feng strode forward with the bearing of a dragon and tiger, coming directly before Zhong Qing.

With a stern face, he asked: "As far as I know, my sect members do not provoke trouble."

"Why don't you explain what happened? Let's see if there's been some misunderstanding."

"If it truly is my sect member's fault, I will give you a satisfactory answer."

"But if you've come here to cause trouble, our Flying Saber Sect is not to be trifled with either."

Zhong Qing looked at this man with some surprise.

He hadn't expected that in this day and age, he would actually encounter someone willing to reason.

How rare.

He had thought he would have to fight his way through.

"Fine. Since you want to reason, I'll hash it out with you!"

"Is Flying Saber Sect's Grand Elder present?"

His gaze swept across the entire assembly.

Finally, a white-haired old man stepped forward.

His expression was haughty: "I am Flying Saber Sect's Grand Elder. What guidance do you have?"

"Do you still remember this child?!"

Zhong Qing pulled Su Ye in front of him, looking down at the Grand Elder.

The Grand Elder's first glance at Su Ye felt somewhat familiar.

After thinking carefully, he understood the boy's identity.

"You're that commoner couple's wretched spawn?!"

As he spoke, he directed his gaze at Zhong Qing, his face darkening as if water could drip from it.

"So you've come here to seek justice for this ant?"

Hearing him call Su Ye "wretched spawn" one moment and "ant" the next.

Zhong Qing's killing intent instantly surged to a peak.

But he didn't strike immediately.

Instead, he laughed coldly: "What a Grand Elder."

"When you were gravely wounded and near death, it was Su Ye's parents who saved you."

"They gave you shelter and bought you time to recover."

"Then your enemies came looking."

"They refused to reveal your whereabouts and were brutally murdered for it."

"Leaving behind their only child, who brought the Flying Saber Token you had given and tried to join Flying Saber Sect."

"Yet you turned your face and refused to acknowledge him."

"Instead, you handed him over to the Blood Maniac to be killed."

"This is how you repay your saviors?"

Upon hearing this.

The Grand Elder sneered: "The place where that commoner couple lived was under our Flying Saber Sect's jurisdiction."

"They enjoyed our Flying Saber Sect's protection, so naturally they should be prepared to sacrifice themselves for our Flying Saber Sect at any time."

"Two worthless lives exchanged for my safety—that was their fortune accumulated over three lifetimes."

Zhong Qing was livid.

A person's shamelessness had limits, yet the Grand Elder's brazenness had completely shattered his worldview and moral floor.

Zhong Qing couldn't understand how anyone in this world could be so utterly shameless.

At this moment, the Grand Elder suddenly slapped his forehead.

Realization dawned on his face.

"Now I remember!"

"You're the one who appeared at our Flying Saber Sect's recruitment ceremony, stole our sect's disciple, and ruined our sect's affairs."

With this, the Grand Elder—who had shown some wariness toward Zhong Qing—suddenly became overbearing: "We hadn't even come looking for trouble, yet here you are, delivering yourself to our door. Heaven has a road you won't take, but hell has no gate and you barge right in."

"I know the red-haired old ghost you killed was quite powerful."

"Impressive, aren't you, young people these days! With a bit of strength, you dare barge into my Flying Saber Sect. Do you really think our Flying Saber Sect has no Moon Profound powerhouse?"

"Hate to break it to you, but I'm exactly that—a Moon Profound!"

"And I'm a Moon Profound even stronger than that red-haired old ghost."

As he spoke, his aura erupted violently.

The pressure unique to a Moon Profound powerhouse instantly burst forth.

Terrifying might filled heaven and earth, shaking the sky.

Yet in the next moment, a large hand shot out.

It seized the Grand Elder's throat directly.

His continuously rising momentum came to an abrupt halt.
