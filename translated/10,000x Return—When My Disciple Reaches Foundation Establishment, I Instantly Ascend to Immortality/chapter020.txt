Chapter 20: Are You Sure You're Hiding "A Little Bit" and Not "A Whole Lot"?

Zhong Qing could only deflect like this.

But hearing it, Xuanyuan Hong's expression cycled through several shades. He elbowed Zhong Qing hard, grumbling: "You call that hiding 'a little bit' of cultivation?"

"Are you sure it's 'a little bit' and not 'a whole lot'?"

Zhong Qing rubbed his nose again.

He could hardly tell them the truth—that he'd only gained this power in the past month. So he quickly changed the subject: "Anyway, Sect Master, Red-Haired Ghost is dead. You've got quite a mess to clean up here."

True enough.

Between Red-Haired Ghost's saber strike and Zhong Qing's finger, the main peak had been devastated.

There was indeed much to clean up.

So Xuanyuan Hong could only lead his people to handle the aftermath and tend to injured disciples.

After helping heal some of the wounded, Zhong Qing returned to Mufu Peak.

Half a day later.

The cleanup was complete. Xuanyuan Hong sat in the seat of honor, looking radiant.

Below him, the other elders and Peak Masters had gathered.

Without exception, every face still showed lingering excitement.

A fearsome Moon Profound master like Red-Haired Ghost, squashed with a single finger right here in Xianjiang Sect—even now, it felt like a dream.

"Hahahaha..."

Suddenly, Xuanyuan Hong burst into hearty laughter.

The others couldn't hide their smiles either.

Why had Xianjiang Sect remained only a second-rate power in the Eastern Region?

Simple: they had no Moon Profound cultivator.

But now, with Zhong Qing, becoming a first-rate power was only a matter of time.

"Everyone, I have another matter to discuss." Xuanyuan Hong spoke again. "As you all know, the previous Sect Master obtained a one-time talisman from a secret realm."

"The talisman contains a King-grade cultivation method."

"But because it can only be used once—it self-destructs upon opening—the sect decided long ago to save it for a truly exceptional disciple."

"That disciple has now appeared. I've decided to give this King-grade method to Zhong Qing immediately. Does anyone object?"

Xuanyuan Hong stood at the head of the hall, addressing the assembly.

"I support the Sect Master's decision."

"Agreed."

"Zhong Qing can kill Red-Haired Ghost with ease at such a young age. This King-grade method will only make him stronger. No one is more suited for it."

One by one, everyone voiced their approval.

Not a single objection.

"Good."

Xuanyuan Hong nodded with satisfaction. "I'll head to Mufu Peak shortly to deliver this method to Zhong Qing..."

Meanwhile, at Mufu Peak.

Joy filled the air.

"Master! Master, I've broken through to Dawn Profound!"

Lin Feng rushed to share the good news, face beaming.

Though Zhong Qing already knew, he still smiled broadly, genuinely happy for him.

Because when Lin Feng had broken through to Dawn Profound, Zhong Qing himself had advanced to mid Moon Profound.

"Excellent work, disciple. Keep it up."

Zhong Qing patted his head encouragingly.

"Yes, Master!"

"Disciple thanks Master once again for this gift of rebirth."

Lin Feng dropped to his knees, tears of joy streaming down his face.

In barely over a month, he'd gone from nothing to Dawn Profound. Even now, it felt like a dream.

Before, he wouldn't have dared dream such a dream.

Inside the Desolate Ring, Sword Elder nearly teared up himself. He was genuinely happy for Lin Feng.

If not for becoming Zhong Qing's disciple, who knew what Lin Feng's fate might have been?

On the other side, Su Ye brought good news too—he'd broken straight through to Xiantian.

Just as master and disciples were celebrating their breakthroughs together, a streak of light appeared on the distant horizon.

Zhong Qing looked up. It was Xuanyuan Hong, fresh from the sect meeting.

"Greetings, Sect Master."

Zhong Qing rose and cupped his hands from a distance.

Lin Feng bowed respectfully as well.

"It's been too long since I've visited Mufu Peak."

Xuanyuan Hong looked around in wonder. "Why is the spiritual energy here so dense? It's even richer than at the main peak."

"Perhaps because there are fewer disciples, so less gets absorbed. It's accumulated over time."

"Is that so?"

Xuanyuan Hong blinked. The density didn't seem explainable by that alone.

But remembering his real purpose, he let it go and followed Zhong Qing into the courtyard.

With spring having returned, the furnace had been stored away, replaced by bamboo tables and chairs.

"Please, have a seat, Sect Master."

"Excellent."

Xuanyuan Hong made himself comfortable, then began mysteriously fiddling with his storage ring.

"Ahem, ahem."

Clearing his throat with a broad smile, he said: "Zhong Qing, I've come bearing wonderful news."

"Oh?"

Zhong Qing paused while brewing tea, his curiosity piqued.

"Hehehe, care to guess what it might be?"

Xuanyuan Hong couldn't resist teasing.

Zhong Qing shook his head.

"Here's the thing."

Xuanyuan Hong leaned closer, lowering his voice. "A hundred years ago, the previous Sect Master led several elders into a secret realm. At great cost, they retrieved a certain item."

"Because it was single-use, the sect decided unanimously to save it for when a truly gifted disciple emerged."

"But exceptional disciples don't grow on trees. A hundred years passed with nothing."

"Now Xianjiang Sect has you, and you're the perfect candidate for this opportunity."

Xuanyuan Hong spoke with utmost gravity.

Zhong Qing's curiosity was thoroughly aroused.

"Sect Master, what exactly is this boon?"

Xuanyuan Hong smiled mysteriously, manipulated his ring, and produced an ancient-looking talisman radiating an archaic aura.

"This talisman contains a King-grade cultivation method."

"Hahaha! How about that? Exciting, isn't it? A King-grade cultivation method! Even ordinary Holy Lands in our Eastern Region might not have one."

"With your heaven-defying talent, you must be lacking a matching cultivation method. With this King-grade method, you'll be unstoppable!"

"So? Would you say my gift today is exactly what you needed?"
