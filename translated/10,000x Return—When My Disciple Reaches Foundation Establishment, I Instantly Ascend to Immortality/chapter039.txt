Chapter 39: This Senior Is Our Benefactor

How could the two women not understand the connection?

Originally, they had assumed that the guy killed by the figurine was at most someone around their level—perhaps even weaker.

But now that they knew the dead man was Heavenly Calamity, how could they not realize how valuable the gift Zhong Qing had given them truly was?

Zhuge Qing naturally understood this as well, which was why he wanted to see the figurines again.

The two women carefully produced their figurines.

Zhuge Qing and the others accepted them gingerly—nothing like the casual way they'd handled them before.

Their eyes held only solemnity.

When touching them, they were extremely careful, afraid of accidentally triggering something.

Heavenly Calamity at Sun Profound had been killed. If the figurines released an attack, they absolutely couldn't withstand it.

"Esteemed elders, upon second examination, do you notice anything unusual?" Zhuge Qing couldn't help asking.

The elders all shook their heads.

Just like last time, the figurines appeared completely ordinary.

But now everyone understood.

It wasn't that the figurines were ordinary—rather, their craftsmanship was so profound that they simply lacked the ability to discern their mysteries.

"It seems this senior is even more powerful than we imagined!"

Zhuge Qing concluded with a sigh.

"Indeed. Now that I think more carefully, there's something even more thought-provoking." Elder Yidao spoke gravely.

"What's so thought-provoking?"

Zhuge Qing and the others looked at Elder Yidao.

"I'm wondering: why did the figurine suddenly release an attack?" Elder Yidao said meaningfully. "And why did the attack happen to hit Heavenly Calamity? Don't you find this too coincidental?"

With Elder Yidao's words, Zhuge Qing suddenly came to a realization.

His eyes widened like bells, and he exclaimed, "You mean..."

"Exactly."

Elder Yidao said, "I suspect that senior may have foreseen Myriad Dao Mountain's troubles. Because Qingniao and Leng Ning had pleased him, he directly helped us eliminate Heavenly Calamity."

"When you put it that way, it does seem possible. Otherwise, how could there be such a coincidence?"

Zhuge Qing took a deep breath. The more he thought about it, the more likely it seemed. He was completely amazed.

"But Sect Master, Master—we never told that senior about Heavenly Calamity when we left." Qingniao spoke up, puzzled. "When we departed, we only said the sect had urgent matters. We didn't mention anything else."

Hearing this, Zhuge Qing couldn't help but shake his head and smile. "You two are still too young."

"At a certain level, what difference does it make whether you speak or not? Such a person can calculate the heavenly mysteries with a flick of their fingers—let alone something as trivial as Heavenly Calamity."

"Are there really such incredible people in this world?" Leng Ning couldn't help exclaiming.

"Isn't the one you encountered exactly that?" Zhuge Qing chuckled. "I truly must admire the fortune you two possess. To encounter such an existence—it's precisely because of that connection that Myriad Dao Mountain avoided a great catastrophe."

"So you two are great heroes of Myriad Dao Mountain."

"And of course, that senior is also the benefactor who saved our Myriad Dao Mountain!"

The two women became embarrassed under Zhuge Qing's praise.

But recalling that white-robed figure, their hearts couldn't calm for a long time.

So.

He was even more powerful than they had imagined!

The two women felt both awe and loss at the vast gulf between them.

At the same time, they felt profound gratitude.

They had merely helped Zhong Qing arrange his Small World. Yet Zhong Qing had not only given them six mid Moon Profound demon beast eyeballs but had also resolved the Heavenly Calamity crisis for them.

Such kindness was something they could never repay.

"Grand Elder, prepare a generous gift immediately. I'm going to pay this senior a visit." Zhuge Qing said.

"Yes, Sect Master."

The Grand Elder quickly acknowledged, then remembered something. "By the way, Sect Master—Heavenly Cloud Sect sent word asking us to help repair their formations. Should we perhaps..."

"The formation repairs at Heavenly Cloud Sect can wait a day or two—it won't matter much. Visiting the senior takes priority." Zhuge Qing said decisively.

"Yes!"

The Grand Elder acknowledged.

After the Grand Elder prepared the gifts, Zhuge Qing took him and departed that very day, heading toward Heaven's Mandate City based on the address Qingniao and Leng Ning had provided.

The next day.

They arrived at the Lin family's gate in Heaven's Mandate City.

However, as soon as they reached the Lin family's entrance, they were turned away and didn't even get to see Zhong Qing himself.

It wasn't really the Lin family's fault.

There had simply been too many people requesting audiences with Zhong Qing lately.

"I say we just announce our identities."

After being turned away, the Grand Elder was somewhat annoyed. After all, their status commanded respect throughout the entire Eastern Region.

It was no exaggeration to say that even at a Holy Land's gate, their Sect Master would be courteously received.

Because of Myriad Dao Mountain's expertise in formations, though their overall strength wasn't even top-tier in the Eastern Region, every sect needed their help with something.

Yet here at this tiny Lin family in Heaven's Mandate City, they couldn't even get through the door.

"Grand Elder, that won't do."

Zhuge Qing quickly stopped him. "The status we're so proud of probably doesn't even register as noteworthy in such a senior's eyes. Since we can't get in, it's likely that senior doesn't want to see us. We absolutely cannot be rash and offend him."

"You're right."

The Grand Elder quickly agreed, looking somewhat ashamed.

"Since we can't see him, let it go. There will be opportunities to repay him in the future. Besides, going directly to Heavenly Cloud Sect from here is closer. We'll just head there from here."

Zhuge Qing instructed, "I've heard Heavenly Cloud Sect recently has a golden-talent Saintess. That old man Wu Yun apparently wants me to teach her some formation basics for self-defense."

"While we're there repairing their formations, we can also assess this Saintess. If she's truly talented, teaching her a bit wouldn't hurt."

"Yes, Sect Master."

The Grand Elder nodded.

"Also, send someone to gather information about the Lin family's relationship with that senior, and why the senior came to Heaven's Mandate City. That will make our next visit more convenient." Zhuge Qing added.

"I'll arrange it immediately."

The Grand Elder nodded, then sent out a message through the air.

Afterward, the two headed straight for Heavenly Cloud Sect.
