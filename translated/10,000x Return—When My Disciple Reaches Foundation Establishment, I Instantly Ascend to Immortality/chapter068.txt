Chapter 68: The True Purpose Is Murder!

The Two-Headed Demon Ape stood about ten feet tall, with a massive build. Its two heads were as large as millstones, and thick black fur covered its entire body.

Its hulking frame seemed forged from iron and steel.

Its presence was sky-piercing and terrifying.

In contrast, Su Ye—having grown up in poverty, lacking food and clothing since childhood, severely malnourished.

Though he had been recuperating at Command Hall Peak for some time, he still looked small and thin, barely over four feet tall.

This size difference even made the Gu father and daughter feel that Su Ye wouldn't be enough for the Two-Headed Demon Ape to swallow in one bite.

Yet Zhong Qing was actually letting such a small child face this terrifying demon beast alone.

For a moment, both of them were sweating bullets for Su Ye.

"Roar..."

The Two-Headed Demon Ape sensed Su Ye's challenge and let out an angry roar, lunging straight at him.

Its massive body carried fierce, domineering power, as if it could shatter mountains and sever peaks.

Terrifying demonic energy spilled out, causing even the void to tremble violently.

Not only was its power ferocious, but its speed was also astonishing—swift as the wind, fast as lightning.

Facing the charging Two-Headed Demon Ape, Su Ye crouched, then shot forward like a leopard.

In an instant, the two clashed.

"Boom, rumble..."

The earth shook, towering ancient trees collapsed.

Gu Wan and Gu Ling'er were completely stunned.

They had already prepared to jump in and help at any moment.

Yet Su Ye, who appeared to be just a child, was actually a Dawn Profound cultivator.

Dawn Profound!

This was a realm many people could never reach in their entire lives.

Take Gu Wan—he had cultivated for decades and had only just reached Dawn Profound.

Gu Ling'er, at sixteen, had reached the Innate realm and was already hailed as a genius unseen in the clan for a century.

But what about Su Ye?

Judging by his bone age, he was only about ten!

A ten-year-old at Dawn Profound—what did that mean?

He could only be called a monster!

What stunned them even more was that Su Ye was at early Dawn Profound, while the Two-Headed Demon Ape was at mid Dawn Profound.

Generally speaking, demon beasts had extremely powerful physical bodies, far surpassing humans of the same level.

Yet the result before them was Su Ye utterly dominating the Two-Headed Demon Ape in a beatdown!

And it was pure physical collision at its peak.

Blood energy flowed through little Su Ye's entire body, producing sounds like a roaring river, like a blazing blood sun.

His whole being was like an ancient fierce beast's cub—overwhelmingly powerful, with shocking strength.

The Two-Headed Demon Ape could initially trade a few blows with him, but after taking several punches, many parts of its body burst open like bloody flowers.

Its aura plummeted.

In the end, it was beaten to death.

"Too brutal!"

"Too savage!"

These were the father and daughter's most honest thoughts at the moment.

They saw endless potential in Su Ye.

"Master, how did I do?"

Su Ye withdrew his fists, returning to his harmless appearance.

Even somewhat shy.

Like a child who had just turned in his test, waiting for the teacher's review.

"Not bad!"

Zhong Qing commented. He wasn't surprised by this result!

After all, Su Ye was cultivating an Imperial-level technique.

Though Imperial-level techniques held little standing in his possession, even filling sacks and gathering dust in the warehouse.

That didn't mean they weren't powerful.

If a single King-level cultivation method appearing in the world was enough to make countless people red-eyed with envy, countless factions slaughtering each other over it.

Then an Emperor Scripture appearing in the world would be enough to stir up storms across the entire continent.

One could say that an Emperor Scripture represented one path walked by an Emperor.

Cultivating while standing on a giant's shoulders, fighting against adversity, crushing opponents at the same level—that was basic.

On the other side, Su Ye's performance had left Gu Wan and Gu Ling'er in awe.

Yet Zhong Qing's comment sent them into complete despair.

Defeating a mid Dawn Profound demon beast while at early Dawn Profound—and it was "just okay"?

Then what were they?

Trash?

At this moment, the father and daughter felt thoroughly put in their place.

Especially Gu Ling'er.

At sixteen, she had reached Innate and was hailed as a once-in-a-century prodigy.

But goods compared to goods should be thrown out; people compared to people would infuriate you to death.

Compared to Su Ye, this prodigy of hers wasn't even worthy of carrying his shoes.

Yet Su Ye fully agreed with Zhong Qing's assessment, feeling he still had much room for improvement—which dealt continuous critical hits to Gu Ling'er's heart.

Of course, amid their frustration, the father and daughter couldn't help but gain more hope of getting out.

Su Ye was this extraordinary—could his master, Zhong Qing, be weak?

To teach such a disciple, Zhong Qing's status was self-evident.

This must be a terrifying powerhouse.

While their emotions churned.

Zhong Qing called the three of them to continue on their way.

Previously, Gu Wan and Gu Ling'er had walked through this area countless times, trying countless directions.

Yet they had never once successfully escaped.

This time, led by Zhong Qing, after walking barely a hundred meters, they directly broke free from the maze formation.

"We're... we're out!"

Seeing a small stream flowing in the distance, the father and daughter were overcome with emotion, their eyes filled with disbelief.

This stream was all too familiar to them.

It was exactly where they had entered the formation.

They had imagined that following Zhong Qing might lead them out, but they never expected that a formation that had trapped them for six months would be escaped so easily.

As if the formation had simply stopped working in Zhong Qing's presence.

"What kind of technique is this?"

Gu Wan and Gu Ling'er looked at Zhong Qing with awe-struck eyes.

"Thank you, Senior, for saving our lives!"

The two quickly performed a deep bow.

Earlier, not knowing Zhong Qing's level, addressing him as "friend" was understandable.

Now, knowing how extraordinary he was, they naturally had to use a respectful title.

Such things didn't matter to Zhong Qing.

"It was just a small effort. No need for such courtesy."

"What is a small effort for Senior is a life-saving grace for my daughter and me."

Gu Wan spoke respectfully: "The grace of saving our lives is beyond repayment."

"Senior, I have a stalk of Heaven Spirit Grass here. Please accept it."

Heaven Spirit Grass was something passed down through their family for generations, rumored to be an important ingredient for pill refinement. To them, it was invaluable.

It was also the most precious thing the two possessed.

But compared to the grace of saving their lives, even the most valuable item was insignificant.

As it happened, Zhong Qing had recently become fascinated with alchemy.

This Heaven Spirit Grass was extremely rare and could serve as the main ingredient for a certain pill formula.

Seeing Gu Wan insisting on giving it, he didn't refuse.

"In that case, I'll accept!"

After some pleasantries, both parties bid farewell.

To Zhong Qing, this was merely a small interlude in his journey—soon cast from his mind.

His true purpose this time was murder!
