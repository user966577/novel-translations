Chapter 54: The Scarecrow's Purpose

The long night stretched overhead!

Cang Yu hovered in the void, looking down at Zhong Qing from above.

The feeling was marvelous.

Marvelous enough to give him a long-forgotten sensation of blood boiling and surging.

What kind of status was an Immortal Emperor?

Even he had to admit.

If the other party were at full power, he would be crushed to death by a single finger.

But heaven had been kind to him.

It let him encounter an Immortal Emperor's reincarnated body.

Though he was no longer at his peak state now.

If he unleashed his secret technique, even a First-Level Three Yin Realm cultivator would die at his hands.

While this secret technique had severe side effects.

Compared to an Immortal Emperor's reincarnated body, everything else was utterly insignificant!

With Cang Yu's discerning eye, he could naturally see through Zhong Qing's bone age of just eighteen.

Eighteen—the age when life was just transitioning from naive to inexperienced.

Compared to cultivators' lifespans that easily spanned thousands or tens of thousands of years.

Eighteen years was far too brief!

So brief that Cang Yu was confident that even if an Immortal Emperor had reincarnated and started cultivating anew, he absolutely couldn't have reached his current level.

He couldn't possibly contend with him.

Now he had already sealed off the surrounding void with his aura.

Under this seal, seeking outside help was impossible.

In Cang Yu's eyes, Zhong Qing was already in his pocket.

So he was unhurried, his posture arrogant as he watched.

"Immortal Emperor, enjoy your last meal well!"

"After today, you won't have this chance again!"

His lips curled playfully.

As the saying goes, happiness makes the spirit soar.

Cang Yu felt that even the air was filled with a joyful scent.

If in his final moments, he could watch Zhong Qing kneel and beg for mercy, that would be even more wonderful!

This display only made people furious!

Especially Lin Feng.

How could he allow his master to be insulted?

He immediately shouted angrily, "What class do you think you are, to dare speak to my master this way?"

Cang Yu's gaze shifted.

Arms behind his back.

In a pose of surveying the land, he commented.

"An Immortal Emperor's disciple, is it?"

"Not bad cultivation!"

"Being under an Immortal Emperor's tutelage, you should have had a brilliant life and future."

"Unfortunately, you met me!"

"Torturing and killing geniuses has always been my favorite thing."

"Once I've stolen the Immortal Emperor's body, I'll teach you what it means to wish you were dead!"

As he spoke, he looked at Zhong Qing again. "Immortal Emperor, any last words?"

"Considering you're contributing a supreme body to me, if there are any women you're worried about, I'll definitely take good care of them—and comfort their lonely, empty hearts."

Zhong Qing: "..."

This guy just came up and kept running his mouth endlessly.

Didn't he know villains died from talking too much?

And he was eyeing not just his body, but didn't want to let his women go either.

This was absolutely intolerable!

Even though he didn't have any women right now.

"Enough!"

"Since you have nothing to say, then please—be on your way!"

Seeing Zhong Qing's expressionless face, neither panicking nor kneeling to beg for mercy.

Cang Yu just felt bored.

He could barely wait to make this body his own.

With a wave of his right hand.

Surging spiritual power transformed into a ten-foot-long giant hand.

The aura unique to a Second-Level Three Yin Realm powerhouse instantly exploded.

Terrifying pressure shook the sky.

That force was like heavenly might, like divine wrath.

Zhong Qing's brow furrowed.

He was considering whether to use some trump cards, or play it safe and temporarily retreat into his small world to avoid the immediate threat.

Because this person did have some real ability.

Most importantly, his two disciples were here.

Suddenly, a dramatic change occurred.

A sinister laugh seemed to transcend time and space, piercing through the barriers.

Echoing from layer upon layer of void.

"Who's laughing?"

Cang Yu was enraged.

His gaze was about to search for the sound's source when suddenly, he felt a chill at his neck.

A scythe had already been placed at his throat.

In an instant, his expression froze. Cold sweat poured down from his forehead.

The spiritual power giant hand he had condensed dissipated instantly.

He followed the scythe's direction with his gaze.

Three feet from him stood a scarecrow with a ferocious face.

Just one look, and Cang Yu felt as if he had witnessed the world's greatest terror.

In his eyes, that scarecrow's entire body radiated overwhelming murderous aura.

Like an ancient demon, like a primordial true devil.

A single wisp of its aura could crush heaven and earth.

"How can such a terrifying existence exist in this world?"

In an instant, Cang Yu was so frightened his soul nearly fled his body.

He asked tremblingly, "Who are you?"

"I don't seem to have any grudge with you!"

Zhong Qing was surprised.

He hadn't expected the scarecrow to come out on its own.

He had never known what purpose this thing served.

He only knew it was no ordinary object.

Now it seemed it was indeed very powerful!

This was also the first time he had seen the scarecrow capable of movement.

At this moment, the scarecrow approached Cang Yu and laughed eerily.

"Me?"

"I am the Hell Demon God!"

Its sharp laughter was like a ghost from hell.

Making all who heard it shudder involuntarily.

Then, it looked at Zhong Qing.

"Hee hee!"

"Master, this fellow—what should we do with him?"

Hearing these words, Cang Yu's scalp went numb, completely exploding.

Such a terrifying existence was actually Zhong Qing's servant.

Of course!

As an Immortal Emperor who had reincarnated and was cultivating anew, how could he not have a Dao protector?

As they say, a starving camel is still bigger than a horse.

How could he have gotten the idea to target such an existence?

Deep in his heart, a thick sense of regret arose.

In a flash, survival instinct took over.

"Immortal Emperor, my mind was clouded."

"Could you... could you give me a chance to live?"

"I'm willing to serve you like a horse or ox, as a slave and servant!"

Zhong Qing sneered. "What do you think?"

"You wanted to steal my body!"

"Torture and kill my disciples!"

"And take my women?"

Though his words were light, they struck Cang Yu like a crushing weight.

Each one of these was a path to certain death.

Yet he had somehow committed all three.

It truly confirmed the saying: When heaven is mad, there will be rain. When a man is mad, there will be disaster.

"Kill him!"

Zhong Qing waved his hand at the scarecrow.

His casual tone directly pronounced Cang Yu's death sentence.

"Hee hee, my lantern can have one more soul!"

The scarecrow licked its blood-red long tongue.

With a swing of its scythe!

As Cang Yu screamed "No!" and trembled with deep fear of death, it sliced off his head.

Then the scarecrow raised the lantern in its hand.

And directly sucked the remnant soul into the lantern.

After finishing all this, the scarecrow laughed eerily, took a few strange dancing steps, returned to its original position, and once again became a motionless scarecrow.

This left Lin Feng dumbfounded.

He had never imagined that a scarecrow could possess such terrifying power.

His master truly was a reincarnated Immortal Emperor.

As for Sword Elder in his ring.

Shock was shock.

But he also felt it made perfect sense.

This was the dignity an Immortal Emperor should possess.

"An Immortal Emperor cannot be insulted. To insult one means death!"

At this moment, his reverence for Zhong Qing rose another level.
