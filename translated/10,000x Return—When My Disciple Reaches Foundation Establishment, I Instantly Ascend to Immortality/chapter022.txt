Chapter 22: Heaven... Bless Our Xianjiang Sect!

"How on earth did you do it?"

After a long moment, Xuanyuan Hong took a deep breath and asked Zhong Qing.

"Mainly because my disciple is naturally talented and works extremely hard." Zhong Qing said with a smile.

"Works hard my ass..." Xuanyuan Hong nearly cursed again. What kind of hard work could take someone from zero to Dawn Profound in just over a month?

As for being naturally talented, that was even more absurd.

Did they not see the results of that talent assessment?

But Zhong Qing clearly didn't want to explain, so he didn't press further.

Still, this trip to Mufu Peak had left him unable to calm down for quite some time.

It had once again shattered his assessment of Zhong Qing.

And added several more layers of mystery to how he viewed the man.

"Sect Master, won't you stay for a meal?" Zhong Qing offered.

"No, no."

Xuanyuan Hong stood up to leave, firmly refusing.

Every extra minute he spent here only intensified the feeling that he'd wasted his entire life.

Xuanyuan Hong transformed into a streak of light and departed from Mufu Peak.

After returning to the main peak of Xianjiang Sect, he once again summoned the sect's Peak Masters and elders.

Everyone took their seats.

"Sect Master, did you give the King-grade cultivation method to Zhong Qing?" the Grand Elder was the first to speak.

Following his question, everyone turned their gazes toward Xuanyuan Hong.

"I did not."

Xuanyuan Hong said.

"You didn't?" The crowd exchanged glances and couldn't help but ask, "Did something unexpected happen?"

Their expressions grew tense.

They couldn't help but wonder if something had gone wrong with the talisman, causing the King-grade method to become ineffective.

Just as everyone was growing nervous, Xuanyuan Hong suddenly flashed a mysterious smile and declared loudly, "Everyone, you're all overthinking it. Let me announce that in the future, our Xianjiang Sect will surely rise and reach the level of a Holy Land."

As he spoke, he directly pulled out the eight King-grade cultivation methods and shouted, "Not only did I fail to give away the method, but that kid actually gave me eight King-grade cultivation methods in return!"

"Tell me—with these eight King-grade methods, isn't becoming a Holy Land just around the corner?!"

"What?!"

"Eight King-grade cultivation methods?"

The crowd was in an uproar.

One by one, they stood up with reddened eyes, staring at the eight King-grade methods that Xuanyuan Hong had slammed onto the table. They wanted nothing more than to dive forward and snatch them.

"Sect Master, is this true? You mustn't fool this old man." The Third Elder asked with a trembling body.

"Yes, Sect Master. This old man is getting on in years and can't take such shocks." The Grand Elder asked incoherently.

"Would this Sect Master lie to you?"

Xuanyuan Hong waved his hand grandly, pushing the eight methods forward. "Examine them yourselves."

In that moment.

The Peak Masters and elders pounced like starving wolves, swarming toward the eight King-grade cultivation methods.

"Let me see, let me see. Let me look."

"Don't snatch them."

"I'm the Grand Elder, I get to look first."

Everyone competed to verify their authenticity.

When they confirmed that all eight King-grade cultivation methods were genuine, several old men wept with joy, raising their hands to the heavens and crying out.

"Heaven... bless our Xianjiang Sect!"

"Indeed! With these eight King-grade cultivation methods, how can our Xianjiang Sect fail to prosper!"

These old men were moved to tears.

Generation after generation, they had been people of Xianjiang Sect. They themselves had been born in Xianjiang Sect, raised in Xianjiang Sect.

To see hope for Xianjiang Sect's future rise—naturally, they were overjoyed.

"Very well, elders and Peak Masters. You have all been loyal to our Xianjiang Sect. You may all have priority in cultivating these King-grade methods." Xuanyuan Hong didn't hold back, speaking directly.

"Thank you, Sect Master."

Everyone expressed their thanks, each as excited as a child. With these King-grade cultivation methods, their future potential would increase by at least one major realm.

"Don't thank me. If you want to thank someone, thank Zhong Qing." Xuanyuan Hong laughed loudly.

"Yes, we really should thank Zhong Qing properly."

Everyone nodded in agreement, though questions still lingered in their minds.

"But Sect Master, how did Zhong Qing come to possess these eight King-grade cultivation methods?"

"Exactly! This is eight King-grade cultivation methods we're talking about, not cabbages!"

"That I don't know either!" Xuanyuan Hong sighed.

In fact, because he had seen more than the elders, the questions in his heart were even greater.

In terms of talent.

At only eighteen or nineteen years of bone age, his strength could instantly kill Moon Profound cultivators.

In terms of generosity.

He casually handed out eight King-grade cultivation methods.

In terms of teaching.

In one month, he'd taken white-quality disciple Lin Feng from zero cultivation to Dawn Profound.

None of these things could be explained by common sense...

Meanwhile, back at Mufu Peak.

After Lin Feng had finished all the daily chores and even made Zhong Qing's bed, he came to find Zhong Qing.

"Master, I previously requested that once I reached Dawn Profound, I be allowed to go down the mountain. So I ask for Master's permission."

Lin Feng spoke respectfully.

"Of course."

Zhong Qing smiled.

Ever since he'd taken this little disciple in, he'd known the boy had something weighing on his heart. Now that his strength had grown, he naturally wanted to go down the mountain to deal with it. How could Zhong Qing refuse?

"Thank you, Master."

Lin Feng quickly expressed his thanks.

Just as he was about to leave, Zhong Qing called him back.

"Is there anything else Master wishes to instruct?" Lin Feng asked hurriedly.

"Since I have nothing going on lately, I'll accompany you down the mountain."

Zhong Qing thought about it and added.

In truth, Zhong Qing still wasn't comfortable letting Lin Feng go down the mountain alone.

Even though he knew Lin Feng had an old man in his ring, Lin Feng himself was only at Dawn Profound—not secure enough.

Seeing that Zhong Qing was actually going to accompany him down the mountain, Lin Feng's face showed an expression of being overwhelmed by the honor.

"Disciple, whatever you need to do on this trip, go ahead and do it boldly. Master will always have your back."

Zhong Qing patted Lin Feng's head and smiled softly.

"Thank you, Master."

Lin Feng thanked him respectfully.

The Eastern Region.

Beyond the various sects, there were also several kingdoms.

Tianlan Kingdom.

Fengtian City.

This place was several thousand miles from Xianjiang Sect.

With Zhong Qing bringing Lin Feng and flying at full speed, they quickly arrived in Fengtian City.

On the second floor of a small tavern in Fengtian City, master and disciple sat by the window. They ordered a portion of beef, a plate of peanuts, and two pots of strong wine.

"Look, isn't that Lin Feng from the Lin family?"

"Yeah. He was so devastated after the Murong family broke off his engagement that he left home. Everyone thought he'd died out there, but he's actually back."

"Sigh, he really is a pitiful child. But having no strength is the original sin!"

"Who's that sitting with him though? He seems to have quite an extraordinary bearing."

"Extraordinary bearing, so what? If he were really someone important, why would he be sitting with Lin Feng?"
