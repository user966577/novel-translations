Chapter 27: Is This Kid Reckless?

"Those two people... lost?"

Bai Chen's expression was grim.

His heart grew even more anxious.

Because from just watching the battle, the demon beast's strength seemed even more terrifying than he'd estimated.

However, those two sword lights' owners hadn't perished.

After crashing into the forest, they quickly transformed into two streaks of light and shot back into the air.

Once airborne, they seemed to deploy some treasure that caused thick smoke and mist to engulf the entire space around the three-headed demon wolf.

This smoke and mist apparently not only obscured the wolf's vision but also blocked its unique senses.

For a moment, it was disoriented, spinning in circles.

The owners of the two sword lights seized this opportunity to escape.

And the direction they fled was precisely where Zhong Qing and the others were waiting.

Now Zhong Qing could finally see the two clearly.

They were two women, one in white and one in blue-green. The white-robed woman had cold features, carrying an air of untouchable aloofness. The blue-robed woman looked younger, her pretty face showing a hint of cuteness and some youthful inexperience.

Both women were top-tier beauties.

Despite looking somewhat disheveled from the recent battle, they couldn't hide their allure. Their tattered clothing somehow added a different kind of charm.

Both women were of the highest caliber.

"Ladies, please wait."

Seeing the two, Zhong Qing couldn't help but transmit his voice.

The two women fleeing at high speed had naturally noticed Zhong Qing and the others. The white-robed woman leading the way immediately frowned. "What are you doing here?"

"To be honest, I came here to slay this demon beast. However, I had just arrived when I witnessed you two fighting it." Zhong Qing explained truthfully.

However.

Hearing Zhong Qing's words, the two women's frowns deepened.

"Sister, where did this show-off come from? He brought this rabble thinking he could slay this demon wolf?" The blue-robed woman scowled. "Posturing and showing off should be done in the right place. What's with all this flashy nonsense?"

"If he just wants to show off, that's one thing, but isn't he leading these people to their deaths?"

The white-robed woman also glanced at the entourage beside Zhong Qing.

The gaudy palanquin.

The zither players, the flute players.

And a bunch of family heads of varying quality.

The slightly more presentable city guards were actually just fragile vases who probably couldn't withstand a single swipe of the demon wolf's claw.

"You're no match for that wolf. While our Soul Mist has temporarily trapped it, you should leave quickly. Once that mist disperses in about fifteen minutes, you won't have a chance to escape."

The white-robed woman spoke expressionlessly.

"How do you know I can't defeat the wolf before we've even fought?" Zhong Qing couldn't help but smile. "Might I ask, ladies, what realm exactly is that demon wolf?"

"Good advice falls on deaf ears. You truly don't know what's good for you. You insist on leading all these people to their deaths."

Seeing that Zhong Qing wouldn't heed her warning, the white-robed woman's pretty face showed a flash of anger. She said coldly, "That demon wolf is at mid Moon Profound. Does knowing that let you rest easy?!"

"What?"

"Mid Moon Profound?!"

"Run, run now!"

Hearing the woman's words, those family heads who had tagged along for the show immediately panicked. Their bodies trembled as they prepared to flee.

This level of power was simply unimaginable to them. Just a fraction of force from its claws could probably kill them.

Bai Chen's expression had also twisted with worry.

He glanced at Zhong Qing, his face grave. "Senior Zhong, what should we do? Fight or flee?"

"If we flee, we retreat now. If we fight, I and my city guards will fully support you. We can draw the wolf's attention and create opportunities for you to attack."

Clearly, even Bai Chen, who had put so much faith in Zhong Qing, was having second thoughts now.

Although Heibai had revealed Moon Profound strength, they didn't know exactly which stage of Moon Profound. And Zhong Qing's own power remained a mystery.

Furthermore, due to demon beasts' unique constitution and bestial nature, humans of the same level were typically no match for them.

In other words, to reliably kill this mid Moon Profound demon wolf, one would need at least a late Moon Profound human expert to have any certainty.

So he wasn't looking down on Zhong Qing—it was just that this demon wolf was genuinely too powerful.

However, while he nervously awaited Zhong Qing's decision, he noticed Zhong Qing smiling and patting his shoulder, offering casual reassurance. "City Lord Bai, relax. No need to be so tense."

Because of the range limitation of Heavenly Eye, and because of the distance during the wolf's earlier battle, Zhong Qing hadn't been able to accurately determine the wolf's precise cultivation through either aura or Heavenly Eye.

Of course.

He had used Heavenly Eye on the two women.

He could tell both were at peak Star Profound.

So when he saw them, he had already roughly guessed the demon wolf was at Moon Profound.

Asking the women had simply been for confirmation.

The white-robed woman's answer was exactly as he'd expected.

At this level, it would be easy to handle—probably just one finger.

Of course, even if this demon wolf exceeded his expectations, he wasn't worried.

After all these years of checking in, he had accumulated a little bit of backup.

Of course, just a little bit.

"Thank you both, ladies."

Zhong Qing first cupped his fists toward the two women in the air, then addressed Bai Chen. "City Lord Bai, please wait here for a moment. I'll be right back."

With that.

Zhong Qing stood with hands clasped behind his back and slowly rose into the air.

He headed straight toward where the demon wolf was.

"This kid—won't listen to advice. Is he rushing to his death?"

"How reckless."

Seeing Zhong Qing stubbornly pressing forward, the blue-robed woman frowned. "The two of us together couldn't beat it, and he thinks he can solo that demon wolf? Isn't he just throwing his life away?"

The white-robed woman didn't speak.

She narrowed her eyes, watching Zhong Qing as he flew toward the demon wolf.

Zhong Qing flew all the way to the sky above the valley. Looking down at the mist that hadn't yet dispersed, he lightly waved his palm. The mist instantly scattered, and the valley became clear and bright.

The three-headed demon wolf with its six crimson eyes came into full view.

The wolf immediately locked onto Zhong Qing's presence.

"Hehe, what do you know—two human women just got away, and now a human boy delivers himself to our door. Brothers, looks like we'll feast well again."

One of the wolf's heads spoke in a sinister voice.

"That's right, brothers. And this human boy has such tender skin—looks like he'll taste delicious." Another head chimed in.

"Tell me, how did a Moon Profound demon beast like you end up in a place like this?"

Zhong Qing ignored their words and asked his own question.

Heaven's Mandate City was a backwater in the grand scheme of the Eastern Region.

Under normal circumstances, a demon beast of this level wouldn't appear here.

"Want to know? Once you're in our belly, you'll find out naturally." One of the wolf heads spoke mockingly, opening its cavernous maw to engulf Zhong Qing.

"Since you don't want to say, then never say it."

Facing the wolf's attack, Zhong Qing wasn't polite either.

But a creature this disgusting—he didn't even want to touch it. He casually plucked a leaf and flicked it toward them with a light motion.
