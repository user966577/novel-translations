Chapter 63: Obtaining the Formation-Immune Physique

This maneuver stunned everyone watching.

"Wasn't he supposed to break the formation? What's with him just walking straight into it?"

An elder was utterly baffled.

The group had studied this great formation.

Breaking it from outside was relatively easy.

But trying to break it from inside would be ten times more difficult.

"Sect Master, I can't shake the feeling that this person is somewhat unreliable. What if something goes wrong?"

"If the formation fully activates but we still can't rescue the Third Ancestor."

"I'm afraid the Third Ancestor will be in grave danger!"

An elder spoke with a bitter expression.

Lu Qingxia was equally confused.

However, she knew Zhong Qing was extremely extraordinary.

Since he dared to enter the formation alone like this, he must have some backup plan.

After all, no one would gamble with their own life.

She addressed the group: "Let's just wait patiently."

"Senior must have his reasons for acting this way."

Though she said this, everyone was anxious and uncertain.

None of them were optimistic about Zhong Qing's ability to rescue their Third Ancestor.

But at this point, all they could do was wait.

As for Zhong Qing entering the secret realm!

He immediately felt the tyrannical nature of this formation!

A dark glow enveloped the surroundings, slowly draining all life force and vitality from the secret realm.

Zhong Qing quickened his pace and began searching for Zhong Changfeng within the secret realm.

The reason he had entered the secret realm was that he had little confidence in breaking the formation from outside.

The system had said that as long as he saved Zhong Changfeng, he would obtain the Formation-Immune Physique.

This so-called "saving" didn't necessarily mean bringing Zhong Changfeng out of here.

He only needed to get him out of mortal danger!

Therefore, Zhong Qing thought he could put him in his small world, remove him from danger, then receive his reward and obtain the Formation-Immune Physique—after which he could bring him out.

The secret realm was vast!

There were mountain ranges, deep valleys, and cold pools!

One couldn't see the end at a glance.

Yet perhaps because it had existed for far too long.

The space was filled with an ancient, decaying atmosphere.

A musty smell pervaded heaven and earth.

The original magnificent pavilions and halls had all crumbled to dust, with only a few places showing traces of ruins.

Though called a secret realm, it looked more like a wasteland.

Under the erosion of time, even if the secret realm originally held any opportunities, they had likely all turned to dust!

Only this great formation was remarkable.

Still operating after countless ages.

And with formidable power!

Requiring a Sky Profound powerhouse to break through.

Zhong Qing searched along the mountain range and finally spotted a figure at the base of a tall platform.

He wore a gray robe, his hair and beard white, his complexion deathly pale, his eyes sunken, his whole body filthy.

His spirit was somewhat dazed, his body constantly trembling.

This was none other than Dawn Mist Valley's Third Ancestor, Zhong Changfeng!

Hearing movement, Zhong Changfeng laboriously lifted his head.

He strained to widen his eyes.

Upon seeing Zhong Qing clearly, he said with mild surprise: "I never thought that as I face death, someone would actually come to keep me company!"

"At least I won't be lonely on the road to the underworld."

"Are you Zhong Changfeng?!"

Zhong Qing studied him and asked.

"Indeed! Does young friend know me?"

Now Zhong Changfeng was even more surprised.

"Not exactly. The people from your Dawn Mist Valley invited me to rescue you."

Zhong Qing stepped forward to examine his condition.

Severely injured.

His life force was constantly draining, and most of his lifespan had been lost.

He could perish at any moment.

Hearing that Zhong Qing had been invited by Dawn Mist Valley, Zhong Changfeng's eyes lit up.

It was the longing and desire to live.

But quickly, that glimmer faded.

"You've already come inside yourself—how can you save me?"

He was terrified of this great formation.

In his view, once inside, getting out would be as difficult as ascending to heaven.

Zhong Qing didn't explain. He directly opened the door to his small world.

Zhong Changfeng, who had just felt all hope was lost, nearly had his eyes pop out upon seeing the small world.

He exclaimed in shock: "A small world!"

Though his cultivation talent was lacking, as the Third Ancestor of Dawn Mist Valley Holy Land, he was well-informed.

He knew exactly how significant a small world was.

Generally speaking, only top-tier powers could possibly possess a small world.

Such as hidden clans, ancient families...

A small world could serve as a power's foundation.

It was the cornerstone of an immortal force!

Now, Zhong Qing actually carried a small world with him—how could this not astonish and move him?

"This... who exactly is this person?"

While Zhong Changfeng's mind reeled, Zhong Qing had already brought him into the small world.

"Your condition is very poor. Rest and recuperate here for a while. I'll take you out shortly."

If Zhong Qing had said this before, Zhong Changfeng would never have believed him.

After all, this formation was too terrifying.

It had left the entire Dawn Mist Valley Holy Land helpless.

Yet now, Zhong Qing's status in his heart was completely different.

Someone who could carry a small world with them—how could they be ordinary?

He even had a strong intuition that this person would definitely be able to take him out of this place.

In an instant, Zhong Changfeng's heart surged with emotion.

He nearly shed tears of joy.

He had been trapped here for several years!

Every day felt like being in prison.

Every day, he had to endure endless torment.

Now, he finally saw hope of getting out.

"Thank you, benefactor!"

Zhong Changfeng was so choked up he could barely speak.

He kept thanking Zhong Qing for his noble deed.

"Alright, hurry up and recover!"

Zhong Qing offered some comfort.

He was genuinely worried the other might accidentally get too excited and die.

After all, Zhong Changfeng was currently on his last breath, tottering on the edge.

As if he might pass away the very next second.

Upon hearing this, Zhong Changfeng immediately closed his eyes and began to regulate his breathing.

As for Zhong Qing, he found a table and slowly sipped tea alone.

Before long, a smile curved at the corner of his lips.

His guess had been correct. Simply saving Zhong Changfeng was enough to complete this mission.

And now, the system reward had arrived.
