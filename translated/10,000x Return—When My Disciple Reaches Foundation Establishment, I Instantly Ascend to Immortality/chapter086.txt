Chapter 86: I Thought We Were Playing Gomoku

Inside the wine house!

The old beggar and Zhong Qing chatted about everything under the heavens.

As the saying goes, a thousand cups are too few when drinking with a kindred spirit, and half a sentence is too many when talking to someone who doesn't understand you.

Though they had just met, they found themselves remarkably compatible.

"Young friend, do you play chess?"

"How can one have wine without chess?"

"Would you care to join me somewhere else for a proper game?"

The old beggar was clearly riding high on his drinks.

One whim followed another.

Zhong Qing had heard of pairing fine wine with delicacies.

Or beauties with wine in hand.

But wine paired with chess? That was a first.

Still, seeing the old beggar's enthusiasm at full blaze, he didn't want to dampen his spirits.

Besides, it wasn't often he met someone so easy to talk to, and he had nothing pressing at the moment. He agreed on the spot.

The two left the wine house.

They passed through several alleyways before arriving at a willow-lined riverbank.

The small river rushed by, willows swaying gracefully on both shores.

A gentle breeze brought a touch of coolness to the somewhat sultry day.

"Come, come! Let this old beggar show you a treasure!"

The old beggar led Zhong Qing to a willow tree about ten feet in diameter and began digging beneath it.

Before long, he unearthed something wrapped in oilcloth.

Unwrapping the bundle, he revealed an exquisite chess board and pieces.

The old beggar placed the board lovingly on a smooth boulder beside the willow.

Then he invited Zhong Qing to sit cross-legged on the stone.

"Young friend, how's your chess skill?"

He picked up the white pieces.

And placed the first stone.

After five moves, when Zhong Qing's five pieces formed a line—

"I win!"

The old beggar began questioning his entire existence.

"How did you win?"

"Where do you see a win?"

Zhong Qing: "..."

I thought you were playing gomoku with me. Turns out you were playing Go.

As for Go, he genuinely knew nothing about it!

Zhong Qing's mind raced.

"How about this—let me teach you a different game?"

"What new game?"

The old beggar's interest was clearly piqued.

"Come, let me find some materials first!"

Zhong Qing thought of Chinese chess from his previous life.

In terms of playability, Chinese chess was much simpler and easier to pick up than Go.

Moreover, its unique movement rules often made it more captivating.

The two went to the city gate.

Zhong Qing selected some irregularly shaped stones of decent quality.

Then he pulled out a carving knife and began crafting the pieces.

The knife was a system check-in reward.

Excellent quality—cutting through gold and jade was child's play.

And with his level of cultivation, carving a few stones was naturally no challenge.

Soon, the irregular stones were transformed under his blade into uniformly shaped, smooth, round chess pieces.

Zhong Qing looked around and spotted a large stone beneath an old scholar tree.

Perfect for making a board.

He set to work on the stone.

Before long, a complete Chinese chess board was finished.

Zhong Qing explained the rules to the old beggar.

They played two trial games.

The old beggar was quickly conquered by the charm of Chinese chess.

"Young friend, this game is quite fascinating!"

He looked like he had discovered a new world.

His eyes lit up as he stared at the board.

Chinese chess represented the crystallized wisdom of ancient people from his previous world.

In terms of influence, it was no less significant than Go.

In parks and along riverbanks in his previous life, you could always find old men playing a few games.

In terms of popularity, it far surpassed Go.

The old beggar's reaction didn't surprise Zhong Qing at all.

They played many games.

All ended in Zhong Qing's complete victory.

Yet the old beggar showed no frustration, becoming more determined with each defeat.

He had the spirit of rising to challenges and never giving up.

Beneath the scholar tree, the figures of one old and one young appeared remarkably harmonious, as if blending into heaven and earth itself.

They made for quite a scenic picture.

Time always slips away unnoticed.

Before they knew it, dusk had arrived.

"Alright, let's call it a day!"

Zhong Qing checked the sky. It was time to head back.

The old beggar's face showed deep reluctance.

But he understood the principle of knowing when enough was enough.

He simply said: "Meeting you today, young friend, has been one of life's great fortunes."

"This old beggar lives nearby. When you have time, you must come find me."

"Let this old beggar have another chance to settle the score with you."

"No problem!"

Zhong Qing laughed.

"Then I'll take my leave!"

"Until we meet again!"

When Zhong Qing returned to Immortal River Sect, there was a visitor waiting at Command Hall Peak.

None other than Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong!

"Sect Master, what brings you here?"

Zhong Qing was somewhat surprised.

"You, you!"

Xuanyuan Hong smiled helplessly.

"The Seven Peaks Competition is a grand event for our Immortal River Sect."

"Command Hall Peak claimed first place—this was your moment to shine."

"Yet at the crucial moment, you were nowhere to be found."

"The Sect Master should know I've never cared for such occasions!"

Zhong Qing shrugged, spreading his hands.

Xuanyuan Hong: "I really don't know what to do with you!"

"I came to tell you something."

"Command Hall Peak won first place in the Seven Peaks Competition!"

"In seven days, you'll represent our Immortal River Sect at the Eastern Region's Immortal Dao Conference."

"Take this time to prepare."

"If you need anything, just ask. Whatever I can provide, I will."

Facing Xuanyuan Hong's earnest care, Zhong Qing smiled: "Thank you for your concern, Sect Master, but it's just a trip out. Nothing much to prepare."

Good lord!

These words made Xuanyuan Hong's brow twitch.

He thought to himself, is this what an Immortal Emperor is like?

Always holding infinite confidence in himself.

Indeed, before such an existence, what grand occasion hadn't he seen?

By comparison, the Immortal Dao Conference could only be called a small affair—naturally it wouldn't warrant his attention or concern.

It was he himself who had made too much of it.

One could say that Zhong Qing's successive performances, including taking on two Holy Land elders as disciples, had made Xuanyuan Hong absolutely certain of his Immortal Emperor identity.

Not just him—at this moment, the entire Immortal River Sect leadership.

Not a single person harbored the slightest doubt about Zhong Qing's Immortal Emperor identity.

If two Holy Land elders could be made completely subservient—

If that wasn't a technique unique to an Immortal Emperor, they wouldn't believe it no matter who told them!

As for all this, Zhong Qing remained completely unaware.

"Alright, if that's the case, I won't linger."

"Just remember—when traveling abroad, caution above all."

Xuanyuan Hong gave a few instructions, then departed into the night.

As for Zhong Qing, he never really took the Immortal Dao Conference seriously.

In his view, this trip was simply about taking his two disciples to broaden their horizons and relax.

No different from a pleasure excursion.

In the days that followed, Zhong Qing's life continued as before.

His focus returned to alchemy.

As they say, where there's a will, there's a way.

Indeed, after all this time, his skill in alchemy finally made a breakthrough.
