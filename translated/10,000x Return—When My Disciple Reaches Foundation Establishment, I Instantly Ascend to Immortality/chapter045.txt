Chapter 45: A Four-Hundred-Meter Saber—Zero Seal

"I'll hand her over to you to deal with. We can call this matter finished, how about it?"

Wu Yun looked at Zhong Qing and called out anxiously, "Whatever you want to do to her—kill her, torture her—I have no objections."

Wu Yun's questioning gaze rested on Zhong Qing.

At this point, if he could trade Murong Xue's life to save Heavenly Cloud Sect, he would do it ten thousand times over.

And Wu Yun's words cast Murong Xue into the abyss.

This was the sect she had taken such pride in.

This was the status she had been so proud of.

But her overwhelming survival instinct drove Murong Xue to kneel on the ground and crawl toward Lin Feng, grabbing his trouser leg and pleading desperately, "Lin Feng, Lin Feng, I was wrong. I was wrong."

"Actually, I've always loved you. And I've always believed you were destined for greatness."

"The way I acted before—that wasn't what I wanted at all. It was all because Heavenly Cloud Sect forced me." As she spoke, Murong Xue pointed viciously at Wu Yun. "They're the ones who forced me, saying I had some kind of Saintess body."

"Please, just acknowledge me, will you?"

"We were childhood sweethearts."

"I'm your Xue'er. Spare my life and I'll be your slave, your servant, anything you want."

However.

Facing Murong Xue's desperate pleas, Lin Feng's face showed only cold indifference.

He had long seen through this woman's true nature. How could he possibly soften at a few words from her?

Seeing that Lin Feng remained unmoved, Murong Xue suddenly began to scream.

"Who do you think you are, ignoring me?"

"You piece of trash, what right do you have to beat me?"

"I've already lowered myself to beg you, what more do you want?"

With that.

She suddenly attacked. A short blade appeared in her hand, and she lunged madly at Lin Feng.

"If you won't spare me, then die with me!"

Facing Murong Xue's sudden assault, Lin Feng dodged effortlessly and snatched the blade from her hand.

"You truly are beyond salvation."

Lin Feng looked at her coldly, his hand moved, and he lightly drew the blade across her throat.

Murong Xue collapsed.

A generation's Saintess had fallen.

"Ahhhh! You little beast! You dare kill my daughter! I'll kill you!"

Not far away, in the chaos, Murong Hai saw Murong Xue die at Lin Feng's hands. His eyes went red as he charged at Lin Feng, intent on tearing him to pieces.

But before he even got close to Lin Feng, one of the transformed figurine experts slapped him into a bloody pulp.

Zhong Qing didn't spare a single glance at the bodies of father and daughter.

Instead, he slowly raised the teacup in his hand and took a sip.

Then he turned to Lin Feng with an appreciative smile.

Just then, the long-silent system suddenly spoke.

*Ding. Congratulations, Host, for helping your disciple Lin Feng achieve growth.*

*Reward: Life-bound weapon—Zero Seal.*

*Zero Seal description: Zero Seal has no fixed grade. It grows with the Host's strength. Additionally, the Host may transform its shape at will and create any special effects desired. Note: Zero Seal's power does not vary with its effects or shape—it is tied only to the Host's strength.*

"Oh?"

"An unexpected reward too?"

Hearing the system's voice, Zhong Qing's eyes lit up.

He never expected that helping his disciple resolve an emotional burden would bring such an unexpected gain.

With a thought, a long sword emanating white light appeared in Zhong Qing's hand.

"So this is Zero Seal?"

Remembering the system's description, Zhong Qing couldn't help but examine and study it.

In the distance.

The one-sided slaughter continued.

Wu Yun was running around wild-eyed, frantic with worry.

He had tried everything, but nothing could make Zhong Qing stop. He could only watch helplessly as everything Heavenly Cloud Sect had was destroyed.

Only now did he truly taste the bitter fruit of his earlier arrogance.

"No, this can't continue."

"I need to find help."

"I need to find reinforcements somehow!"

"I can't let Heavenly Cloud Sect be destroyed in my hands."

Wu Yun's voice trembled. Looking around, he found a gap and burned his life essence to flee outward.

Just as he had barely escaped the battle zone, the depths of Heavenly Cloud Sect suddenly emitted a mysterious fluctuation.

This fluctuation was terrifying, like a primordial beast that had been sealed was now awakening.

Then.

A massive hand appeared from deep within Heavenly Cloud Sect, sweeping toward the battle zone.

This single palm.

Carried the force of heaven and earth crumbling.

More than a dozen of the transformed figurine experts perished under this strike.

"I merely slumbered for a few hundred years, and now someone dares bully my Heavenly Cloud Sect."

"Does everyone think I'm not here? That I'm dead?!"

With a voice that seemed to echo from the heavens.

A cloth-robed elder emerged from the depths of Heavenly Cloud Sect, walking through the air.

His proud bearing surveyed the entire scene.

The aura emanating from him made many struggle to breathe.

Seeing this elder appear, the Heavenly Cloud Sect survivors saw their savior.

"Old Ancestor!"

"It's actually the Old Ancestor!"

"The Old Ancestor isn't dead!"

"This is wonderful! Old Ancestor, he wants to destroy our Heavenly Cloud Sect! Please strike down the enemy!"

The Heavenly Cloud Sect survivors all knelt, paying respects to the Old Ancestor.

And in the distance.

Wu Yun, who had been trying to escape and find reinforcements, saw the elder appear and immediately shed tears of joy and excitement.

"Old Ancestor!"

"It really is the Old Ancestor! The Old Ancestor isn't dead! And from his aura, he seems to have reached the legendary Earth Profound realm!"

"Heavenly Cloud Sect is saved!!!"

Wu Yun trembled with excitement.

No one had expected.

The situation to reverse so quickly.

Heavenly Cloud Sect's Old Ancestor wasn't dead—and had broken through to Earth Profound.

Without exaggeration, Heavenly Cloud Sect now fully qualified to become one of the Eastern Region's Holy Lands. Because the basic requirement for becoming a Holy Land was having an Earth Profound cultivator.

In short.

His appearance.

Was like a ray of light to everyone in Heavenly Cloud Sect.

Dispersing all the darkness in their hearts, illuminating their future.

Before an Earth Profound cultivator, no matter how many Sun Profound cultivators there were, they were nothing.

From that single palm he had struck before even appearing—killing more than a dozen Sun Profound cultivators—one could already see how terrifying Earth Profound was.

Countless gazes fixed on the cloth-robed elder standing in the sky, their eyes burning with fervor.

As if the word "invincible" was written on his body.

And the final victory would surely belong to their Heavenly Cloud Sect.

However.

Just then, something jaw-dropping happened.

A four-hundred-meter saber appeared out of nowhere.

The blade emanated a chilling gleam. On one side, dragons flew and phoenixes danced, divine beasts coiled. On the other, ghosts wailed and wolves howled, thick with death energy.

This four-hundred-meter saber extended from the ground and came to rest directly against the cloth-robed elder's neck.

And just like that, the cloth-robed elder who had just looked so invincible—his legs went soft in mid-air, and he dropped to his knees.
