Chapter 91: How Can a Mere Wooden Figurine Block This?

Under the moonlit night, shortly after the old beggar departed, two shadow-like black figures followed closely behind.

They then transformed into two burly men.

It was the Left and Right Protectors of Fuyun Sect—Iron Tower and Mountain Guard.

"Old Ancestor, that jade pendant is a symbol of your status, a supreme treasure that can block a full-force strike from an Earth Profound powerhouse. Even if you hit it off with him immediately, was it necessary to give away something so precious?"

Mountain Guard asked, thoroughly confused.

"You wouldn't understand..."

The old beggar stood with hands behind his back, his gaze distant.

"Let's go! If we delay any longer and that monster truly breaks free, it will be a catastrophe beyond measure."

These words immediately made Iron Tower and Mountain Guard tense.

Fuyun Sect was one of the five great Holy Lands of the Eastern Region, and its Left and Right Protectors were among the top experts in the region.

Their Old Ancestor was an even more transcendent existence.

What matter could make them so grave?

The reason was that Fuyun Sect was suppressing a terrifying demonic beast.

The seal on this beast was loosening, showing signs of breaking. No one in the entire sect could repair it, which was why the old beggar had no choice but to return.

The three traveled through the sky like streaking light, like flashing lightning.

Finally, just as dawn broke, they reached Fuyun Sect.

"ROAR..."

A bestial roar shook the heavens and trembled the mountains.

The sound wave hit like a tsunami, making the earth quake.

The faces of all three changed drastically.

Without pause, they rushed straight toward the back mountain—the beast's sealing ground.

It was a valley.

Above the valley, golden light flashed and runes covered everything. An energy dome encasing the entire valley had developed countless cracks, like a piece of porcelain about to shatter.

This was the Demon-Sealing Grand Formation that suppressed the monster.

Outside the formation, Sect Master Meng Xiao and the sect's elders and leadership were desperately trying to repair the formation's cracks.

Unfortunately, their repair speed couldn't keep pace with the rate of destruction.

Just as the formation was about to completely shatter and everyone's hearts sank—

The old beggar made his move.

In a flash, he appeared before the formation's eye.

Channeling torrential spiritual power, he infused new energy into the formation, repairing the crumbling runes.

"Old Ancestor, you... you've finally returned!"

The old beggar's appearance was like a steadying pillar, filling everyone with wild joy while simultaneously lifting the weight from their hearts.

"You must not slack off! Follow my lead and suppress this monster together!"

The old beggar's voice was sharp.

His heart was heavy to the extreme.

Because within the formation, he could detect signs that the demon had infiltrated the formation's base.

"You ants think this can contain me?"

"Today, you all die!"

A furious roar, like a demon from hell itself.

The next moment, a terrifying aura erupted from the valley's depths.

Surging demonic qi swept across the sky, shaking heaven and earth.

A massive hand thrust out from the valley floor, striking the formation like a mountain.

Instantly, a tremendous boom spread in all directions.

The already overburdened formation was blasted to pieces!

"Pff..."

As the formation broke, those repairing it were flung backward by the backlash. Some collapsed on the spot, vomiting blood.

"The demon... the demon has broken free!"

Sect Master Meng Xiao clutched his cracked chest, his expression one of pure horror as he stared at the figure before them.

As the dust cleared, a black demonic ape stood proudly in the center.

It stood about ten feet tall, its fur several feet long, black as ink, rippling in the wind.

Its terrifying presence pressed down on everyone like a mountain.

Its gaze swept across the scene, then fixed on the old beggar.

"Old man, you ambushed me while I was injured, conspired with others against me, and imprisoned me for a thousand years."

"Today, it's time to settle that debt."

Its eyes were blood-red, filled with killing intent.

Its body moved, pouncing to kill!

"BOOM..."

When it moved, it was truly earth-shattering.

Its speed reached the extreme.

Carrying domineering, overwhelming force, it seemed ready to shatter the very void!

Facing this terrifying strike, the old beggar didn't dare be careless. He gave everything he had to resist.

But the gap between them was visible to the naked eye.

With just one blow, he was sent flying.

"How is this possible?"

For the Fuyun Sect members, this scene was like the sky falling and the earth sinking.

Who was their Old Ancestor?

One of the most powerful beings in the entire Eastern Region.

His Earth Profound cultivation let him stand proud across the land.

Yet now, facing the demon ape, he was sent flying with a single blow?

They knew the ape was strong, but not this strong.

The old beggar staggered to his feet, his expression one of infinite shock.

"Half... step... Sky Profound!"

These words made everyone's hearts plummet to the depths.

A Sky Profound powerhouse, to them, was the stuff of legends.

Even half-step Sky Profound was beyond their ability to resist.

"Is our Fuyun Sect truly doomed today?"

One elder asked, face pale, filled with despair.

"Hehe!"

The demon ape cackled.

"When you imprisoned me, you should have anticipated this day."

"Today, I will wash Fuyun Sect in blood to cleanse the shame of a thousand years of captivity!"

Its voice was like thunder, its overwhelming aura making it hard to breathe.

The old beggar gritted his teeth and stood before everyone.

"All of you, run! I'll hold it off!"

Against absolute power, numbers were meaningless.

Clearly, he was prepared to sacrifice himself to buy everyone time to escape.

"Old Ancestor!"

Some cried out in anguish.

"GO!"

The old beggar roared with all his might.

"As long as you survive, the Fuyun Sect I founded will not be destroyed!"

"Do you want to watch me die in vain?"

"RUN!"

Sect Master Meng Xiao bellowed.

He made the decisive call to lead everyone in retreat.

"Before me, do you think you can escape?"

The demon ape sneered!

It released the full pressure of a half-step Sky Profound powerhouse.

"I said I would wash Fuyun Sect in blood to quench my hatred."

"I'll start collecting interest from you."

Its posture was arrogant, and with a wave of its massive hand, it unleashed power several times more terrifying than before.

"Am I going to die?"

The old beggar's heart was bitter.

This palm had completely sealed off his retreat.

He had nowhere to run—he could only face it head-on.

But he knew he absolutely couldn't withstand a half-step Sky Profound powerhouse's full-force strike.

Just then—

Something in his robes grew hot.

Then a streak of light shot out.

"This is..."

The old beggar was stunned.

He never expected that at this moment, the wooden figurine Zhong Qing had given him would reveal extraordinary properties.

But even if this figurine had some power—

What could it do?

In the old beggar's mind, a half-step Sky Profound powerhouse couldn't possibly be stopped by a mere wooden figurine!
