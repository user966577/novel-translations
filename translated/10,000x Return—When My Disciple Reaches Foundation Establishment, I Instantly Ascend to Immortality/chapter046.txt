Chapter 46: The Cowardly Old Ancestor of Heavenly Cloud Sect

"I... Senior, please spare me."

"Please spare me!"

The cloth-robed elder trembled from head to toe.

His mouth kept begging for mercy.

His voice even carried a hint of sobbing.

It wasn't that he was a coward—it was that the saber at his neck was simply too terrifying in his eyes.

Four hundred meters.

A full four hundred meters.

And it was completely solid.

In all his thousands of years of life, he had never seen or even heard of such a weapon!

But that wasn't even what frightened him most.

What truly terrified him was that this four-hundred-meter saber was sealed with countless things that made his very soul tremble.

Divine demons on the left, ghosts and gods on the right.

The feeling.

Was like being a little chicken with an elephant's raised foot hovering over his head.

How could he not be afraid?

Especially having lived to his age, he knew all too well how precious life was.

He had secluded himself in Heavenly Cloud Sect's back mountain for centuries—even when everyone thought he was dead, he still hadn't emerged. All because he wanted to break through to Earth Profound before his lifespan ran out, to extend his life.

Finally.

At the last gasp, he had luckily broken through to Earth Profound. He had just obtained several more millennia of life—he certainly didn't want to be trampled to death the moment he emerged.

So, the instant the four-hundred-meter saber was placed at his neck, he made his decision.

He even thought he hadn't moved fast enough, that his attitude wasn't sincere enough.

Looking at the suddenly kneeling and begging cloth-robed elder, Zhong Qing was somewhat bewildered.

He had been studying Zero Seal according to the system's description.

Then this old man had appeared.

So he tried what the system had described.

He transformed Zero Seal into a four-hundred-meter saber, and for the special effects, he manifested some mythical beasts from his previous world.

He had thought there would be a fierce battle.

After all, his current cultivation was only Sun Profound. Even using all his trump cards, he could probably handle this old man, but it definitely wouldn't be easy.

He never expected to simply intimidate the cloth-robed elder into submission.

This saved him a lot of trouble.

However.

The Heavenly Cloud Sect survivors had completely broken down mentally.

They had expected their Old Ancestor to display divine might with an invincible stance, crushing the enemy with a single palm. Instead, before anything even started, he just... knelt?

The contrast between his appearance and his surrender was simply too great.

In this moment.

The light in their eyes died.

Their futures were gone.

Many collapsed to the ground in despair.

For them, this emotional roller coaster was simply too torturous.

"Old... Old Ancestor."

In the distance.

Wu Yun's mind had similarly collapsed. He stood frozen in place, slack-jawed.

He had been ready to cheer for his Old Ancestor, but before he could even make a sound, the Old Ancestor had surrendered?

This only further proved just how terrifying the person he had provoked this time was.

Otherwise.

How could his Earth Profound Old Ancestor kneel so readily?

And he also didn't know where to go from here. Perhaps he could temporarily escape and find reinforcements, but where would he go?

To the Eastern Region's Holy Lands?

Setting aside whether those Holy Lands would even help him.

Even if they would, so what?

Judging by the fact that even his own Old Ancestor had knelt, what difference would the Holy Lands make?

For a moment.

Wu Yun's intestines turned green with regret.

If he had known Zhong Qing was this powerful, he would never have dared provoke him, let alone push Zhong Qing to become his enemy.

But as Zhong Qing had said.

There is no medicine for regret.

At this moment, he suddenly remembered Zhuge Qing of Myriad Dao Mountain's warning from a few days ago.

Telling him that Heavenly Cloud Sect should distance itself from Murong Xue, because Murong Xue had offended someone she couldn't afford to offend, and might bring disaster upon all of Heavenly Cloud Sect.

He hadn't believed it then.

He had thought his Heavenly Cloud Sect rivaled the Holy Lands—who could they possibly be unable to offend?

Looking back now, the person Zhuge Qing had warned about was clearly Zhong Qing.

Remembering Zhuge Qing's warning, Wu Yun's regret grew even more intense.

Originally, he could have avoided today's disaster multiple times.

But he had failed to seize any of those chances.

"Yes, yes, yes—Myriad Dao Mountain! I can ask Myriad Dao Mountain for help!" Amid his regret, Wu Yun seemed to grasp at a lifeline.

"Myriad Dao Mountain's Zhuge Qing might have some connection to this person."

"Otherwise, how would Zhuge Qing have known in advance how terrifying this person was?"

"If I ask Myriad Dao Mountain for help, maybe they can persuade him to spare Heavenly Cloud Sect this once."

For Wu Yun in his current state of regret.

Any chance to salvage the situation, no matter how slim, he didn't want to give up.

He glanced at the war-torn Heavenly Cloud Sect, then without another word, rushed toward Myriad Dao Mountain.

The journey to Myriad Dao Mountain was long.

So Wu Yun used a Long-Range Teleportation Talisman without a second thought.

These Long-Range Teleportation Talismans were extremely expensive—the ultimate life-saving treasure for cultivators.

Normally, Wu Yun would never bear to use one.

But now, he used them just to travel faster, hoping to reach Myriad Dao Mountain as quickly as possible.

Along the way.

He used two Long-Range Teleportation Talismans, which broke through spatial limitations and soon brought him to Myriad Dao Mountain's gates.

Inside Myriad Dao Mountain's great hall.

Led by Zhuge Qing, numerous elders were studying the mysteries of those two wooden figurines when suddenly they heard Wu Yun's voice from the mountain gate.

"Hm?"

"Wu Yun?"

"What's he doing here?"

"Didn't he just cut all ties with my Myriad Dao Mountain?"

Zhuge Qing was puzzled.

But since the man was here, he decided to meet with him.

After Wu Yun's anxious wait, Zhuge Qing finally emerged with his elders.

When Zhuge Qing and the others saw Wu Yun's wretched state.

They were all shocked.

Ragged clothing, weak aura, and most importantly—missing an arm.

Zhuge Qing and the others drew a sharp breath.

This was the Sect Master of Heavenly Cloud Sect—what kind of person could reduce him to this state?!

"Wu Yun, what happened to you?"

Zhuge Qing couldn't help but ask.

"Please, Brother Zhuge, save my Heavenly Cloud Sect."

Seeing Zhuge Qing, Wu Yun quickly approached and, without another word, bowed deeply.

"Save your Heavenly Cloud Sect?" Zhuge Qing was even more confused. "What exactly is going on?"

Hearing this, Wu Yun smiled bitterly, his face ashen. "Brother Zhuge, it's all because I didn't listen to you. That's why... that's why..."

At these words, Zhuge Qing's expression changed.

"You mean Senior Zhong Qing is trying to destroy your Heavenly Cloud Sect?"

"Yes."

Wu Yun nodded grimly.

"But even if Senior Zhong Qing was angered because of his disciple and Murong Xue, surely it wouldn't warrant destroying your entire Heavenly Cloud Sect?"

Zhuge Qing asked, puzzled.

Though he had never met Zhong Qing, from Qingniao and Leng Ning's descriptions, Zhong Qing shouldn't be someone who killed without reason.

Zhuge Qing's question.

Made Wu Yun shake his head bitterly.

"Sigh, it's all because I acted rashly..."

Wu Yun then recounted everything that had happened since Zhong Qing arrived at the mountain, leaving nothing out.

After hearing everything.

Zhuge Qing was shocked.

He couldn't help but point at Wu Yun and scold, "You! Isn't this all your own doing? I warned you, and you not only ignored me but offended him to the death. Now that he wants to destroy your Heavenly Cloud Sect, what good does coming to my Myriad Dao Mountain do?"
