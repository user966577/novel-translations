Chapter 89: The Old Beggar's True Identity

"Sect affairs should be handled by your Sect Master. Why come looking for me?"

The old beggar's attention wasn't on them.

It remained fixed on Zhong Qing's direction.

Having finally found such a compatible young friend, he naturally wouldn't stand by if Zhong Qing was in danger.

But if he intervened to save him, his true strength would be exposed!

Their friendship had been built on equal footing.

If the other party learned certain things about him, would this pure friendship be lost?

The next moment, the old beggar's gaze suddenly turned to the two men beside him.

"Iron Tower, Mountain Guard!"

"Old Ancestor, have you decided to return to the sect with us?"

Their eyes lit up with excitement as they bowed respectfully once more.

"Return to what sect?"

"Does this Old Ancestor need you two telling him what to do?"

"We wouldn't dare!"

Both replied in fearful reverence.

"Stop talking about returning to the sect."

"I have an important task for you now."

"The young friend who just left—did you see him?"

"I want you to secretly escort him home."

"Deal with those two tails following him, but don't reveal your identities or whereabouts."

"If a single hair on my young friend's head is harmed, I'll skin you both alive."

Seeing their Old Ancestor's deadly serious expression, neither dared be careless.

Though they had a thousand questions, in the end it all condensed into a single word: "Yes!"

As they spoke, their figures moved, transforming into streaks of light that shot after Zhong Qing.

A bright moon hung high, countless stars twinkling like diamonds set in the sky.

In the mountain forest!

Zhong Qing traversed the highlands, his eyes glinting subtly.

"Quite patient, aren't they?"

He had known someone was tailing him since leaving the auction house.

Originally, he'd planned to wait for them to make their move, then casually swat them dead.

But these two seemed far more patient than he'd expected.

Zhong Qing maintained his speed without pause.

He was curious to see just how long these two could hold out.

Meanwhile!

Less than a third of a mile behind Zhong Qing, the brothers Black Wind and Cloud Fiend were conversing in secret.

Black Wind was the elder brother, Cloud Fiend the younger.

The two were notorious rogue cultivators.

Having stumbled upon an opportunity in their youth, they'd practiced demonic arts.

At Moon Profound Great Perfection cultivation, they'd built quite a reputation throughout the Eastern Region.

Cloud Fiend's eyes gleamed: "Big brother, there's no one around here. Shouldn't we make our move?"

Black Wind replied calmly: "Wait a bit longer."

"Let's see where this person is headed."

"Someone who can buy dozens of top-grade spiritual medicines without batting an eye—I don't believe that's all he's worth."

"Once we figure out his background and his full assets, we can move."

"As expected of big brother's thorough thinking!"

Black Wind smiled confidently.

"The path of cultivation is full of hardships!"

"What we rely on is quick wits, bold hearts, and steady hands."

"Master these three, and in the future, there may well be a place for us among the Eastern Region's top powerhouses."

But just as he finished speaking—

A voice came from behind them.

"You won't get that chance!"

"Who's there?"

The sudden voice made Black Wind and Cloud Fiend tense instantly.

The next moment, Iron Tower and Mountain Guard materialized before them.

Seeing the two figures that appeared out of nowhere, Black Wind and Cloud Fiend's expressions changed drastically.

They cried out in shock.

"The Left and Right Protectors of Fuyun Holy Land!"

For people like them who'd survived to their current status, they naturally knew who could and couldn't be provoked.

As formidable demonic cultivators, Black Wind and Cloud Fiend had their own code of conduct.

Third-tier sect members—kill freely!

Second-tier sect members—kill selectively!

First-tier sect members—kill carefully!

Holy Land sect members—avoid as far as possible!

Because with Holy Land sects, even a random elder or peak master was beyond their ability to handle.

"My lords, my brother and I don't seem to have offended you, nor trespassed against your Holy Land."

"May I ask why you've stopped us? Is there some misunderstanding?"

Black Wind's eyes darted as he bowed subserviently.

"No misunderstanding."

"You dared target our Old Ancestor's close friend. You deserve death!"

The next moment, Iron Tower and Mountain Guard struck simultaneously.

"N-no!"

The combat strength wasn't even in the same league.

Black Wind and Cloud Fiend were consumed by terror.

In this moment, they regretted everything.

They'd thought tonight they'd caught a fat sheep.

Who could have known the target had such a terrifying background?

Both fought desperately!

But it was all futile.

"Boom!"

With two thunderous sounds, Black Wind and Cloud Fiend plummeted from the sky like kites with broken strings.

Eyes rolled back, breath gone—they were completely dead.

Had they faced ordinary Sun Profound powerhouses, the two might not have won, but they wouldn't have died so quickly.

But the Left and Right Protectors of Fuyun Holy Land ranked among the top ten in the entire Holy Land.

Their deaths were sealed the moment the two Protectors set their sights on them.

The commotion naturally caught Zhong Qing's attention up ahead.

Without looking, through his spiritual sense alone, he perceived Black Wind and Cloud Fiend's deaths.

Those who had struck shared a connection with the old beggar—same sect, same origin.

Zhong Qing instantly understood what had happened.

Clearly, the old beggar had noticed the tails and sent people to protect him.

Though unnecessary from Zhong Qing's perspective, he accepted the gesture of goodwill.

"Perhaps I should find time to repay this favor."

He murmured to himself, maintaining his speed and direction, heading toward Command Hall Peak.

Behind him, Iron Tower and Mountain Guard followed until they saw Zhong Qing enter Immortal River Sect, land on Command Hall Peak, and enter his small courtyard. Only then did they quietly withdraw.

Along the way—

Iron Tower asked, puzzled: "Mountain Guard, why do you think someone from a mere second-tier sect deserves such attention from our Old Ancestor? He even sent us both to protect him."

"The Old Ancestor acts on whims. If I could read his mind, I'd have convinced him to return to the sect long ago."

The two chatted as they returned to the northern part of Spirit City.

They reported to their Old Ancestor: "Old Ancestor, we've successfully escorted the target to Immortal River Sect."

"Immortal River Sect?"

The old beggar's interest was piqued.

Then he said casually: "You've done well this time. When we return to the sect, the Old Ancestor will certainly reward you handsomely."

"Now, you may leave. The Old Ancestor needs to rest."

"Old Ancestor, won't you return with us?"

Iron Tower asked urgently.

But when he looked up, there was no trace of the old beggar.
