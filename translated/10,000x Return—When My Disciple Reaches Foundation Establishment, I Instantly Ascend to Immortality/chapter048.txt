Chapter 48: You Can't Protect My Safety

Wu Yun's face was full of confusion.

He couldn't help but ask, "Old Ancestor, though we narrowly survived in the end, Heavenly Cloud Sect still suffered such heavy losses. And we've become someone else's servants. Where's the blessing in that?"

"You don't understand."

Guo Shijie stood with his hands behind his back, speaking meaningfully.

Then he looked at Wu Yun and said, "Open the storage ring the Master left behind. Let's see what he left us."

"Yes."

Wu Yun quickly opened the storage ring.

And when he saw what was inside, his entire being went blank.

"Old... Old Ancestor."

Wu Yun exclaimed in shock.

"What are you making such a fuss about? You're still a Sect Master, after all..."

"Holy shit!"

Seeing the contents of the storage ring, even Guo Shijie couldn't help but curse.

Inside the storage ring were cultivation methods and profound techniques that Zhong Qing had left behind.

Two of each—cultivation methods and techniques.

And all were King-grade.

With their status and position, they could tell at a glance that these King-grade cultivation methods and techniques were no ordinary ones. They were at the ceiling of King-grade, comparable to some Emperor-grade methods.

They never imagined that Zhong Qing's generosity would extend to casually leaving several King-grade cultivation methods and techniques for two servants.

They knew that while their Heavenly Cloud Sect also had King-grade cultivation methods and techniques, those were only ordinary King-grade level—completely incomparable to what Zhong Qing had left.

And normally, those were kept as sect-protecting treasures.

"See? Now do you understand what I mean by 'blessing in disguise'? This is a blessing in disguise!!!"

Guo Shijie spoke excitedly. "Do you think I would just acknowledge anyone as master?"

"Do you know how terrifying that four-hundred-meter saber was?"

"Do you know what kind of terrifying beings were sealed within that saber?"

"At that moment, I knew this person's power had to be beyond our imagination. In fact, forget our Heavenly Cloud Sect—if he wished, any Holy Land in the Eastern Region could be crushed at any moment."

"And now, looking at how casually he left behind these cultivation methods and techniques, my guess was absolutely correct!"

Guo Shijie grew more excited as he spoke.

"Though we've become his servants, this very status may lift us to heights we could never have reached otherwise!!!"

Beside him, listening to Guo Shijie's analysis, Wu Yun couldn't help but grow excited too.

At this moment, he finally understood how ridiculous it had been to offend Zhong Qing to the death over Murong Xue.

If not for Old Ancestor Guo Shijie's "brilliant save," Heavenly Cloud Sect would probably no longer exist.

And he, Wu Yun, would probably have died eight hundred times over.

"Old Ancestor, truly the older the wiser!"

Wu Yun couldn't help but praise.

"Hmph. Do you think Heavenly Cloud Sect has survived so many tribulations and still stands today by accident?"

Guo Shijie lectured weightily.

"The martial world isn't just about fighting and killing—it's even more about navigating relationships."

"You still have a long way to go. Watch carefully, learn well, handle Heavenly Cloud Sect's aftermath properly, and serve the Master well in the future."

"Yes, Old Ancestor."

Wu Yun nodded quickly.

Looking up at the devastated Heavenly Cloud Sect, his heart was filled with mixed emotions...

Meanwhile.

Zhong Qing was traveling back toward Immortal River Sect with Lin Feng.

Leaving behind cultivation methods and techniques for those two was merely something Zhong Qing did on a whim.

First, he had plenty of such methods and techniques—a few more or less made no difference.

Second, since both had become his servants, they were now his people. Under the Heavenly Dao Oath, Zhong Qing had no fear of them having any strange thoughts. Without exaggeration, even if Zhong Qing ordered them to kill themselves, they wouldn't dare disobey.

On the return journey, Zhong Qing wasn't in any hurry.

He traveled in a leisurely manner.

Though he had plenty of trump cards, he had always lacked base cultivation for self-defense, so he had rarely ventured far from Immortal River Sect.

Now that he was out, he had to admit—the scenery of this otherworld was quite beautiful.

Nature's craftsmanship had created many sights unseen in his previous life.

However, just as master and disciple were flying along while enjoying the scenery.

Combat fluctuations suddenly came from a mountain valley ahead.

The fluctuations weren't strong—a Dawn Profound white tiger was fighting a woman.

The woman was no match. She was sent flying by a single swipe of the white tiger's paw.

Zhong Qing watched this scene impassively, with no intention of going to the rescue.

Perhaps in his previous life, he would have rushed in without hesitation. But in this treacherous cultivation world, playing hero was foolish behavior.

Who knew what kind of trouble saving someone might bring?

In short, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

However.

Just as Zhong Qing was about to leave, the system suddenly spoke up.

*It is suggested that the Host save this woman.*

*This woman will acquire a certain physique in the future. After she acquires it, the Host may take her as a disciple.*

*After taking her as a disciple, a new disciple bond may be activated for the Host.*

"Oh?"

"She'll acquire a certain physique in the future?"

Zhong Qing showed a look of surprise.

Did this mean she didn't have that physique now, but would acquire it in the future?

This system could see the future?

Involuntarily, Zhong Qing used his Heavenly Eye to observe.

The Heavenly Eye could only see the woman's current information—it couldn't predict what physique she might acquire in the future.

But her background was somewhat unexpected.

Residing within her body was a remnant soul of a demoness from the Northern Demon Abyss on the continent.

Zhong Qing didn't know what a demoness was, but he did know that the Northern Demon Abyss was a demon territory, many times more powerful than the Eastern Region.

"What physique will she acquire in the future?" Zhong Qing couldn't help but ask.

*The system can only roughly predict that this woman will acquire a certain physique in the future. The specific physique cannot be predicted. It is suggested that the Host save this woman. After she acquires her physique in the future, taking her as a disciple will activate a new bond.*

Zhong Qing nodded.

So taking her as a disciple now would be useless—he had to wait until she acquired some physique in the future.

Saving her now would at most build familiarity and goodwill.

For a moment.

Zhong Qing hesitated about whether to save her.

After a moment's hesitation, Zhong Qing decided to act.

After all, having experienced the Trash Bond, Zhong Qing knew exactly how much a bond could boost him.

And a new bond—this woman seemed to be his only lead at the moment.

By now, the woman had been cornered by the Dawn Profound white tiger.

Her exquisite face, carrying a hint of allure, was now shrouded in deep worry.

"I never thought that I, Bai Ling, a great demoness, would barely survive a catastrophe by possessing a remnant soul. I had hoped to slowly recover here in the Eastern Region, but now the tiger has fallen to be bullied by dogs."

"Is my final fate to die to this mere Dawn Profound beast?"

The woman's eyes were filled with unwillingness.

Just as the white tiger attacked and she had nowhere to retreat, Zhong Qing made his move.

With casual ease, he cleaved the white tiger in two, then descended beside Bai Ling with Lin Feng.

"Miss, are you alright?" Zhong Qing asked gently.

Bai Ling eyed Zhong Qing warily. After a moment, she nodded. "Thank you for saving me. If there's an opportunity, I'll repay you in the future."

With that, Bai Ling made to leave.

"Wait, Miss."

Zhong Qing couldn't help calling out. "I can see you're seriously injured. Why not come with me first? At least I can ensure your safety."

"Thank you, but you can't protect my safety."

Bai Ling glanced at Zhong Qing and shook her head.

Because of the white tiger's attack, she had been forced to use the power of her remnant soul.

But this leaked remnant soul energy might be detected by her powerful enemies from the Northern Demon Abyss.

From his earlier performance, Zhong Qing did seem to have some skill. But against the enemies hunting her from the Northern Demon Abyss, he would be nothing.
