Chapter 12: The Master of the Bitter Sea... Is Him?!

At first glance, the young man seemed unremarkable aside from his exceptional bearing.

She couldn't detect even a trace of cultivation from him.

But she wasn't foolish enough to actually consider him an ordinary person.

Anyone who could effortlessly pull her out of that black sea had to be extraordinary.

And the complete absence of any cultivation aura?

There was only one explanation: his cultivation was so profound that he could perfectly conceal it.

"Was it Senior who saved me?" Su Wenjiu asked carefully, her tone respectful.

Zhong Qing didn't deny it, simply nodding.

If he hadn't fished her out, this woman probably would never have escaped that pond.

"This junior is Su Wenjiu. Thank you, Senior, for saving my life." She quickly bowed in gratitude.

After her profuse thanks, she couldn't help but voice the question burning in her mind.

"May I ask, Senior—what exactly is this pond?" She glanced back at the small body of water, still shaken.

"The Bitter Sea."

Zhong Qing's reply was casual.

"The Bitter Sea?!!"

Thunder seemed to strike inside Su Wenjiu's head.

She'd once heard sect elders speak of it. In the ancient Buddhist Holy Land, there existed a heaven-defying treasure called the Bitter Sea.

Legend said that those trapped within would never escape.

Hence the saying: the bitter sea has no bounds.

"S-Senior... is this the same Bitter Sea from the ancient Buddhist sect?" Her breathing grew ragged.

Zhong Qing sat on a small stool, baiting his hook and casting it into the pond while listening to her question. He couldn't help but roll his eyes internally.

You're asking me—but who should I ask?

Still, this was a system check-in reward, and the system never gave ordinary items. So this Bitter Sea really might be the one Su Wenjiu was asking about.

"If you say so, it probably is."

Hearing this, Su Wenjiu drew a sharp breath.

Looking back, cold sweat already soaked her body.

She had actually wandered through the Bitter Sea itself!

"Oh, I've got a bite."

Just then, the float in the pond bobbed. Zhong Qing's eyes lit up.

Su Wenjiu looked over and nearly jumped out of her skin.

This person was actually fishing in the Bitter Sea?

Before she could process this, Zhong Qing lifted his rod. A two-inch-long fish, its entire body crimson red—she had no idea what kind—came up on the hook.

The sight of this fish made Su Wenjiu stumble back several steps, her face draining of all color.

Because the instant she saw it, she remembered the colossal creature she'd glimpsed while trapped in the Bitter Sea.

Viewed from above, it had seemed part dragon, part serpent, its entire body flame-red.

Especially that arched spine—though vastly different in scale, the shape and the pattern of its scales were things Su Wenjiu would never forget if she lived a thousand years.

As she stood there in shock, the fish's gaze turned toward her.

Immediately after, a voice transmission entered her mind: "Little one, what a coincidence. I didn't expect you to escape the Bitter Sea too."

The words struck her brain like a thunderbolt.

This fish that had just been caught was actually that colossal behemoth she'd encountered in the Bitter Sea!

Her expression turned to panic.

And when she looked at Zhong Qing beside her, her gaze grew unfathomably deep.

Using nothing but a bamboo rod to fish out something comparable to a divine beast from the Bitter Sea—what kind of godly technique was this?

"Don't be alarmed, little one. He is the master of the Bitter Sea. He's helping me escape from it."

"We both owe him our lives—he has given us a second chance at existence."

"You're human, so perhaps you'll have the opportunity to serve our benefactor properly."

"As for my purpose... I can only add one more steamed or fried dish to his table."

"Cherish this chance. I go now to enter the cycle of reincarnation."

The voice transmission had barely ended when the fish was already placed into Zhong Qing's fishing basket.

But Su Wenjiu's heart couldn't calm for a long, long time.

The master of the Bitter Sea.

What did that even mean?!

She couldn't begin to imagine.

Looking at Zhong Qing now, her initial respectful gratitude had transformed into utter fear and submission.

Like an ant that understood its own insignificance, gazing up at a full-grown elephant.

"By the way, I haven't asked—why did you come to my Mufu Peak?" Zhong Qing had just re-baited his hook when he turned to ask her.

This single question.

Left Su Wenjiu dumbfounded.

If her guess was correct, this Zhong Qing was almost certainly Lin Feng's master.

And her original purpose had been to negotiate with Lin Feng's master, to have Lin Feng transferred to her as a disciple.

She'd even considered using force if the negotiation failed.

But now? How could she possibly say such a thing?

Where would she even find the face to say it?

So in hindsight, falling into the Bitter Sea might not have been such a bad thing after all.

If not for that accident, she probably would have marched right up to Zhong Qing's face and demanded his disciple.

Who knew if that would have ended with her being reduced to ash.

At least her ordeal in the Bitter Sea had preserved her life.

"Hm?"

Zhong Qing noticed her prolonged silence and turned to look at her.

Meeting his gaze, Su Wenjiu grew nervous.

She hadn't figured out what to say yet. She could only steel herself and offer an awkward response: "Senior... would you believe me if I said I was just passing through?"

"What do you think?"

Zhong Qing looked at her sideways.

"Hehe, I wouldn't believe it either."

Su Wenjiu wanted to sink into the ground. Faced with Zhong Qing's questioning gaze, she grew so anxious she was nearly in tears.

Just then, a young figure came flying through the snowy sky and landed beside them.

"Disciple greets Master."

It was Lin Feng.

"Disciple, what brings you here so suddenly? Is something the matter?" Zhong Qing smiled.

"Master, it's like this—in about another month, I'll probably reach Dawn Profound Realm."

Lin Feng spoke respectfully. "Once I reach Dawn Profound, I have some personal matters to attend to. I wanted to ask Master's permission in advance. I may need to leave the mountain for a trip."

"If you have matters to attend to, of course you may go." Zhong Qing smiled and patted Lin Feng's head warmly.

However.

Seeing Lin Feng, Su Wenjiu's face went pale.

Just her luck—what she feared most had arrived.

She tried desperately to hide, terrified that Zhong Qing would notice her.

But how could Lin Feng miss someone standing right there?

He recognized her immediately.

"It's you?"

Lin Feng stared at Su Wenjiu in surprise.

Su Wenjiu's heart sank to rock bottom.

"Oh? You know each other?"

Beside them, Zhong Qing couldn't help but ask.

"Reporting to Master—I was training in the mountains about fifty miles away to stabilize my cultivation and gain combat experience when I encountered her."

Lin Feng answered truthfully, respectfully. "She said she noticed my rapid cultivation progress and wanted me to leave you, Master, and become her disciple instead..."
