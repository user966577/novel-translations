Chapter 75: Brother, Please Stop Refining—You Really Don't Have the Talent

When even using all spirit herbs produced such ghastly results.

If poison was added, who knew if he'd refine something that would make him ascend on the spot, dying right there.

Shi Xiaotian never imagined that in his whole life of never begging anyone.

His first time opening his mouth would be begging someone not to refine pills.

Yet Zhong Qing turned a deaf ear to his pleas.

He handled the spirit materials, measured the dosages.

Everything done to high standards.

That focused expression, those intent eyes, the fluid sequence of operations.

Watching made Shi Xiaotian's heart pound with fear.

Past experience showed that the more Zhong Qing was like this, the more toxic the resulting pills tended to be!

"You have absolutely no alchemy talent!"

"Nothing else—just your technique for extracting spirit herb essence with spiritual power has thirty-seven errors."

He was on the verge of breakdown.

Voice hoarse, tone urgent, eyes red.

Finally, he couldn't help but transform into a guidance master, directing Zhong Qing's alchemy from the side.

"Blood Spirit Flower has domineering properties, carrying extreme heat and solar force. Winter Frost Grass has gentle yin properties, carrying extreme cold."

"Individually, they work wonders for tempering the body and soul. But their properties are opposite—once combined, they produce deadly poison."

"You need to add spirit herbs of the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth."

"Balance the five elements, construct five-element unity, and only then can you bring out the medicinal properties of these spirit herbs."

As expected of a Holy Land elder, a renowned alchemist of the Eastern Region.

When giving guidance, he spoke eloquently.

Cutting straight to the core of the problem.

This gave Zhong Qing a sense of sudden enlightenment.

He humbly accepted Shi Xiaotian's guidance.

Methodically refining his self-created Myriad Spirit Pill.

Yet in the end, the finished product still wasn't ideal.

At least in appearance, it looked no different from before.

But since it was refined under the guidance of an alchemy master.

What the medicinal properties were like was still worth anticipating.

After all, one shouldn't judge by appearances—that saying applied to pills too.

"Eat up!"

"I don't need to feed you, do I?"

Zhong Qing placed the pill before Shi Xiaotian.

The latter's expression shifted between light and dark.

Though the pill had been refined entirely under his guidance.

He had to admit, Zhong Qing's talent was shockingly terrible.

Even with his full guidance, the other still made hundreds of alchemy taboo errors.

No exaggeration—even training a dog would produce better results.

And in alchemy, a single small mistake could drastically reduce a pill's efficacy, or even reverse its properties entirely.

Pills refined by Zhong Qing—how could he dare eat them?

Seeing forced feeding was imminent.

Shi Xiaotian completely broke down.

"I was wrong!"

"I shouldn't have come looking for trouble."

"Whatever pills you want, just tell me—I'll give them to you."

"I'll help you refine pills—a hundred batches, a thousand batches, ten thousand batches—whatever you want."

Clearly, the pills Zhong Qing refined had terrifying power.

They gave Shi Xiaotian a lingering fear, a bone-chilling terror.

Zhong Qing shook his head.

"You don't understand. What I'm refining isn't pills."

"What I'm refining is my passion for pills!"

Passion, my ass!

Refining is refining. What's the point of bringing that up?

Shi Xiaotian was mentally cursing.

But the next moment, his pupils contracted.

Because once again, he was subjected to Zhong Qing's forceful administration.

This time, he only felt his insides churning.

Waves of dizziness and blurred vision came crashing over him.

Inside his body, it felt like ten thousand ants were gnawing.

In his soul, it felt like raging fire was burning.

These pill effects were too terrifying.

Shi Xiaotian felt he was enduring the most horrific torture in all of heaven and earth.

Mind and body suffering twin blows.

That burning, gnawing pain left him convulsing constantly, veins bulging.

At this moment, Zhong Qing was recording every change in his little notebook.

The pills not achieving the expected effect made him a bit down.

But he firmly believed that where there's a will, there's a way.

One or two failures were nothing.

As long as he persisted, he would eventually succeed!

Zhong Qing genuinely loved alchemy.

That wondrous spark produced when different medicinal properties collided and intertwined was intoxicating.

And that sense of achievement when a pill took shape in his hands was indescribable.

Though the results were unsatisfactory.

But labor would bring rewards.

With persistence, there would eventually be satisfying output, wouldn't there?

With this conviction, Zhong Qing began a new round of pill refining.

Watching this scene, Shi Xiaotian shed tears of regret.

"I was such a fool!"

"Really!"

"Why did I have to provoke this harbinger of disaster!"

His pride in his strength had become completely useless here. His powerful background and status—the other didn't care at all.

He felt like a pitiful little wife being abused.

And not just abused once or twice, but lifetime imprisonment abuse.

A sense of despair filled his heart. Shi Xiaotian felt his future had gone completely dark.

"No, I can't just give up like this!"

Just as the pain was about to shatter his sanity, just as despair was about to consume him entirely.

A flash of inspiration crossed Shi Xiaotian's mind.

He suddenly remembered that years ago, when playing chess with his old friend, he had won a treasure from him.

It was called a Realm-Breaking Transmission Talisman!

This transmission talisman was unlike ordinary ones. It could break through any barrier to silently send messages across space.

"As long as I send word that I'm imprisoned here back to the sect, with my friendship with Old White, he'll surely find a way to rescue me."

"He might even bring sect elders to mount a rescue."

"Once the sect's elders arrive, not only will I be saved, but I can also wash away this humiliation."

Thinking of this possibility, Shi Xiaotian's eyes went red.

The seed of revenge grew wild in his heart like weeds.

The bright moon hung high, stars studded the sky like gems.

Shi Xiaotian, who had been "poisoned" all day, finally had a chance to breathe.

By moonlight, he pulled a transmission talisman from his storage bag and wrote a plea for help.

Seeing no one around, he directly channeled the faint spiritual power remaining in his body to activate the talisman.

A streak of light shot through the sky.

Watching the message transmit and disappear into the horizon.

Shi Xiaotian let out a neurotic, manic laugh.

"Just you wait. The humiliation and torture you've subjected me to—one day I'll repay it a hundredfold."

He muttered to himself, his expression twisted, his laughter like that of a yaksha demon.

"Something good happened? Laughing so happily."

"Here, eat this pill first."

But a voice made Shi Xiaotian's laughter stop abruptly.

He watched Zhong Qing approach step by step, pill in hand.

The other looked perfectly transcendent and refined, yet in Shi Xiaotian's eyes, he was utterly terrifying.

His face went green immediately.

This person—was he a devil?

Tormenting him during the day wasn't enough—even at night, he wouldn't let him go.

"No..."

The night sky soon echoed with a heart-rending scream.
