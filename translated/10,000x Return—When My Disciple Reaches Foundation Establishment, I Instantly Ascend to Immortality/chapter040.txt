Chapter 40: Flattening Your Little Heavenly Cloud Sect Would Take Me All of a Minute

One day later.

The two arrived at Heavenly Cloud Sect.

As one of the Eastern Region's most ascendant powers in recent years, Heavenly Cloud Sect's grounds were truly magnificent.

Past the main gate were ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine steps, leading straight up into the clouds.

Reaching for the sky, touching the clouds—hence the name Heavenly Cloud.

Looking up, one couldn't see Heavenly Cloud Sect's full appearance. Only faint celestial light was visible through the haze, and through it, one could vaguely make out a corner of jade palaces and towers.

Naturally, Zhuge Qing and the Grand Elder's arrival was personally received by Heavenly Cloud Sect's Sect Master, Wu Yun.

Heavenly Cloud Sect's great hall.

Wu Yun was exchanging pleasantries with Zhuge Qing.

"Many of our sect's formations have fallen into disrepair over the years. I'm hoping Brother Zhuge can assist us this time." At the head of the hall, Wu Yun stroked his beard and smiled.

"That won't be a problem." Zhuge Qing replied with a faint smile.

After all, such assistance wasn't free.

Each job paid handsomely.

It was similar to how alchemists refined pills for others. Perhaps an alchemist's personal strength wasn't great, but wherever they went, they were treated with respect. Myriad Dao Mountain was much the same.

"By the way, there's another matter I'd like Brother Zhuge's help with." Wu Yun stroked his beard. "As you know, our Heavenly Cloud Sect recently produced a Saintess. I was hoping Brother Zhuge could teach her a thing or two."

"You know how it is in the cultivation world—whether exploring secret realms or traveling abroad, one might encounter formations. If she knew some formation basics, she'd be much safer."

"That would depend on her aptitude."

Zhuge Qing smiled candidly.

"Good. Then let Brother Zhuge test my disciple."

With that, Wu Yun sent a mental transmission. "Xue'er, come in and greet Myriad Dao Mountain's Sect Master Zhuge."

As Wu Yun's voice faded, a white-robed Murong Xue, her long dress trailing behind her, walked in from outside the hall.

"Murong Xue greets Senior Zhuge." Murong Xue curtsied and bowed.

"Truly exceptional!"

Zhuge Qing nodded approvingly. With his experienced eye, he could tell this woman was indeed extraordinary. He got straight to the point. "In that case, let me test you."

"I'll set up a small spirit-gathering formation in front of you now. If you can also set one up after watching me, I'll agree to your master's request."

"Very well. Please proceed, Sect Master Zhuge." Murong Xue said confidently.

Zhuge Qing nodded, pulled three gold coins from his storage ring, arranged them in a triangular formation, then formed a series of hand seals. Soon, a small spirit-gathering formation was complete.

This kind of test seemed casual.

But it was actually the most practical method to determine if someone had aptitude for formations.

"Well, young lady, can you do it?" Zhuge Qing asked.

"What's so difficult about that?"

Murong Xue smiled confidently, also pulled out three gold coins, and began copying him.

Though her movements were somewhat clumsy and the effect wasn't as good as Zhuge Qing's, she did manage to set up a small spirit-gathering formation.

"Hahaha!"

Seeing this, Wu Yun at the head of the hall laughed heartily. "How about it, Brother Zhuge? My disciple is acceptable, yes?"

"Golden talent truly lives up to its reputation!"

Zhuge Qing was genuinely surprised. This talent was only slightly inferior to Heavenly Calamity's back in the day.

He was even tempted to poach her and bring Murong Xue to Myriad Dao Mountain.

"Then Brother Zhuge, why not take my disciple as an in-name disciple?" Wu Yun suggested with a smile.

Murong Xue also looked at Zhuge Qing expectantly.

With her talent, her future achievements in cultivation would certainly not be low.

If she could also gradually receive Myriad Dao Mountain's true teachings, wouldn't she, Murong Xue, become famous throughout the Eastern Region?

Perhaps even become the Eastern Region's most legendary figure ever!

Thinking this, she proudly lifted her chin.

Zhuge Qing barely hesitated before preparing to agree.

This arrangement benefited his Myriad Dao Mountain as well. After all, Murong Xue had golden talent—her future achievements would certainly be remarkable.

Not to mention, he was quite envious of her aptitude.

In that moment, he'd even thought about possibly passing his true teachings to Murong Xue in the future.

However.

Just as he was about to nod.

Beside him, the Grand Elder glanced at his flashing jade slip, and his brow suddenly furrowed deeply.

Ignoring Wu Yun's gaze, the Grand Elder leaned close to Zhuge Qing's ear and urgently transmitted a message.

"What?"

"Such a thing happened?"

After hearing the Grand Elder's transmission, Zhuge Qing's brows knitted tightly together.

And when he looked at Murong Xue again, his expression had completely changed.

Because the message the Grand Elder had just transmitted was intelligence that Myriad Dao Mountain had just gathered from Heaven's Mandate City.

The message.

Included the history between the Murong and Lin families, as well as the engagement between Murong Xue and Lin Feng.

Of course, he also learned that Lin Feng was Zhong Qing's direct disciple.

And that Lin Feng would soon be coming to Heavenly Cloud Sect to challenge Murong Xue.

Connecting all of this, it wasn't hard to guess that Zhong Qing's presence in Heaven's Mandate City was likely related to the matter between his disciple and Murong Xue.

He truly never expected that the Murong Xue before him could be connected to Zhong Qing, who had just saved his Myriad Dao Mountain.

"Brother Zhuge, has something happened at Myriad Dao Mountain?"

Seeing Zhuge Qing's sudden change in expression, Wu Yun couldn't help asking.

"Nothing's wrong with Myriad Dao Mountain. It's just that this disciple—I'm afraid I cannot accept." Zhuge Qing looked at Murong Xue and said.

"What do you mean by that?"

Hearing Zhuge Qing's words, Wu Yun's brow furrowed. "Didn't you just say that as long as Xue'er passed the test, you would teach her? Yet you refuse now?"

"The talent is fine, but her character..."

Zhuge Qing didn't finish, but stood and walked toward the exit.

"As for the formation repairs, let's discuss them another time."

With that, Zhuge Qing left with the Grand Elder.

"Master, what does he mean?" Murong Xue said unhappily. "He's just from a little Myriad Dao Mountain—what airs is he putting on in our Heavenly Cloud Sect? Just because he knows some formations? I don't even want to learn anyway."

"Sigh."

"Xue'er, go back for now. I feel like Zhuge Qing's words had hidden meaning."

Standing in the hall, Wu Yun hesitated briefly, then decided to chase after the departing Zhuge Qing.

Finally, at the main gate, he caught up with them.

"Brother Zhuge, can you tell me what exactly is going on?" Wu Yun asked, his face dark. "I feel like there's more to your words."

Seeing Wu Yun had followed, Zhuge Qing sighed. "Brother Wu, our friendship may not be deep, but we've known each other for several hundred years. For the sake of that history, let me give you a piece of advice."

"What advice? Speak."

"That disciple of yours—you'd better distance yourself from her, or expel her from Heavenly Cloud Sect outright, to avoid bringing disaster upon yourselves." Zhuge Qing spoke with utmost seriousness.

"What did you say?"

Hearing this, Wu Yun practically shrieked.

"Zhuge Qing, have you lost your mind?"

"You want me to expel Xue'er from the sect?"

"Do you know she has golden talent? Do you have any idea how much manpower and resources Heavenly Cloud Sect has invested in her? And you're telling me to expel a golden-talent disciple from the sect?"

"Are you sure you're not joking?"

Wu Yun stared at Zhuge Qing, his face full of anger. Was this guy making fun of him?

But Zhuge Qing's expression remained grave.

"I'm not joking. I'm serious!"

In Zhuge Qing's view, his warning was completely justified.

So what if she had golden talent?

A golden-talent cultivator, if their fortune was lacking, would at most reach Sun Profound in the future. The truly exceptional among them might have a slim chance at Earth Profound!

But Zhong Qing could kill a Sun Profound cultivator with a single figurine.

If a super expert like that became enraged on behalf of his disciple, wouldn't flattening your little Heavenly Cloud Sect take all of a minute?
