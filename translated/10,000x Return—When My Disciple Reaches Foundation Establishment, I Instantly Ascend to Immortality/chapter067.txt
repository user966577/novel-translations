Chapter 67: "Just Passing Through," My Ass

Zhong Qing was a man of action!

Having said he would help his little disciple take revenge, he set off with him early the next morning.

In the sky above, master and disciple transformed into streaks of light, flying straight toward Flying Saber Sect.

The two flew over mountains and crossed rivers.

Little Su Ye was clearly both nervous and eager, his mind highly tense.

Zhong Qing understood his feelings and found a topic to divert his attention: "Your realm has reached a small accomplishment now. I wonder how your actual combat ability is?"

"Reporting to Master, Senior Brother often goes into the mountains to practice against demon beasts."

"Disciple frequently follows him to hunt demon beasts in the mountains."

"Shall disciple demonstrate by fighting one for you to see?"

Little Su Ye asked eagerly.

Zhong Qing smiled.

"Alright. When we reach that mountain ahead, your master will find one for you."

Before long, the two descended into a mountain range.

All around, ancient trees towered, and strange rocks jutted up.

Here, Zhong Qing sensed the presence of demon beasts.

At the same time!

Not far away.

A man and a woman were wandering through the mountains, their faces drenched in sweat.

The man had a somewhat rotund build, wore extremely festive clothing—draped in red and green—with graying temples, appearing to be around forty years old.

The woman was about sixteen, with proper features and pretty eyes.

But that lovely face was now replaced by a look of deep concern.

This was a father and daughter.

The man was named Gu Wan, the woman Gu Ling'er.

"Ling'er, it's your father who has brought harm upon you!"

Gu Wan surveyed his surroundings despairingly.

His face showed a deep sense of defeat.

"Legend has it that a family ancestor dropped our Gu family's clan-protecting treasure here."

"I thought that finding the treasure would help your cultivation advance further."

"Who could have known this place's formation would be so terrifying."

They had been trapped here for half a year!

A full six months.

Not only could they not leave this area, but they also had to endure demon beast attacks daily.

Constantly facing life-threatening danger.

For the past six months, the father and daughter hadn't dared sleep soundly even once.

Every day they tried to find a way out.

Yet every method they attempted ended in futility—they could only wander and circle within these mountains.

"Father, fortune and misfortune are intertwined."

"No one wanted this to happen."

"There's no need to blame yourself. Perhaps this is simply fate."

Gu Ling'er comforted Gu Wan, but the look of despair in her eyes cut him like a knife.

She had been a prodigy of her generation in the clan.

She should have had a broader sky and future.

Yet heaven was so cruel as to trap her to death in this small mountain forest.

Just as the two were feeling dejected, utterly hopeless about the future.

They suddenly heard voices engaged in easy conversation nearby.

The voices were light and relaxed, as if on a leisurely spring outing.

The two looked up and saw Zhong Qing and Su Ye strolling toward them.

Gu Wan's expression turned peculiar: "Did you two also wander into this place by mistake?"

Zhong Qing was momentarily puzzled.

"Wander into what?"

Gu Ling'er added: "Wander into this maze formation!"

Only then did Zhong Qing notice that he had somehow walked into a formation.

And it was a great formation primarily designed to trap people.

He didn't care, since he possessed Formation-Immunity.

No formation had any effect on him.

He replied casually: "I didn't wander in. I'm just passing through."

These words left Gu Wan and Gu Ling'er completely stunned, frozen in confusion.

"Just passing through," my ass.

But looking at Zhong Qing's unhurried demeanor.

He seemed completely confident about finding his way out.

In an instant, the father and daughter—who had been trapped here for six months, nearly resigned to waiting for death—saw hope of escape.

Gu Wan immediately asked: "Friend, can you take us with you?"

The cultivation world was complex, and this was especially evident among cultivators.

Generally speaking, when two unfamiliar cultivators met for the first time, they were inevitably wary, guarded, and distrustful of each other.

But Gu Wan and Gu Ling'er couldn't afford to worry about such things now.

They had only one thought—to get out.

Regarding their request, Zhong Qing hesitated briefly, then agreed.

First, the two weren't very powerful, and second, it wasn't any trouble for him.

"Then follow along."

Su Ye followed him without any interference from the formation, which showed that his Formation-Immunity wasn't just personal—he could bring others through as well.

In other words, even if he hadn't used the small world earlier, he could have led Zhong Changfeng out safely.

"I wonder if this counts as a little bonus from the system's reward, or if the system rewards are just this overpowered."

For things he couldn't figure out, Zhong Qing never bothered racking his brain.

After all, the outcome was good for him.

"Thank you, Senior!"

With Zhong Qing's consent, Gu Wan and Gu Ling'er quickly expressed their thanks.

They caught up.

"No need for such courtesy. It's just a small effort."

Zhong Qing waved his hand: "I'll be lingering here for a while."

"You two may need to wait a bit."

"Please take your time!"

Gu Wan replied hastily.

Having waited six months, they didn't mind waiting a little longer.

But he was curious—what was Zhong Qing going to do?

Soon, his question was answered.

Zhong Qing walked a short distance, then his gaze swept the area, and a smile curved his lips.

"Found you!"

As his words fell.

A beast's roar echoed.

The sound was like thunder, shaking the forest.

The father and daughter's faces changed instantly.

"Two-Headed Demon Ape!"

The Two-Headed Demon Ape was a Dawn Profound mid-stage demon beast.

Immensely powerful and strong, it could crush ninety-nine percent of human cultivators at the same level.

Since the father and daughter had stumbled into this formation, this Two-Headed Demon Ape had been their nightmare.

They had clashed several times.

But each encounter had put them in life-threatening danger.

They had expended countless trump cards and resources just to barely escape with their lives.

This demon beast had become their living nightmare.

"Disciple, it's yours!"

Zhong Qing handed the battlefield to Su Ye.

"Got it, Master. Watch me."

Little Su Ye stepped forward, his eyes burning as he faced the Two-Headed Demon Ape.

"Friend, this demon beast is terrifyingly powerful—it's at Dawn Profound mid-stage cultivation."

"As they say, there's strength in numbers. Why don't we join forces!"

Gu Wan spoke with sweat beading on his forehead.

In his view, Su Ye was too small.

A child barely bigger than a grasshopper—even if he'd been cultivating since the womb, how could he possibly defeat such a terrifying demon beast?

Zhong Qing responded unconcerned: "No need. Let's just watch from the side."
