Chapter 62: The Abyssal Secret Realm

The matter with Lin Yuexia was merely a small interlude in Zhong Qing's life.

On life's road, one inevitably encountered all sorts of people.

Her appearance and exit.

Were like a breeze creating ripples on the surface of a lake.

Once the wind calmed and the waves settled, nothing would remain!

So naturally, Zhong Qing wouldn't take such matters to heart.

Time quickly passed—one day went by!

The rising morning sun represented new life and vitality.

Lu Qingxia was in good spirits!

Though a small unpleasantness had occurred yesterday, fortunately, Zhong Qing hadn't held a grudge over it.

She saw in Zhong Qing the hope of rescuing the Third Ancestor!

Early that morning, she led over a dozen high-ranking members to respectfully welcome Zhong Qing, setting off together to rescue Dawn Mist Valley's Third Ancestor!

After some brief pleasantries and exchanges, over a dozen figures set off grandly.

Elders led the way at the front.

Zhong Qing stood among them, with Lu Qingxia and Su Wenjiu accompanying him on either side.

Several Dawn Mist Valley elders who didn't know Zhong Qing's identity exchanged glances, secretly communicating through voice transmission.

"This is the outside help the Sect Master invited? He looks so young—is he even eighteen?"

"Can someone like this really rescue the Third Ancestor?"

An elder was skeptical.

"I heard that yesterday, because of him, the Sect Master even severely punished a true disciple. In my view, anyone who can be invited by the Sect Master and receive such courtesy must have something exceptional about them!"

"Let's hope so!"

"If something happens to the Third Ancestor, and the Old Ancestor places blame, none of us can bear the brunt of the Old Ancestor's fury."

The group traveled like lightning.

Covering thousands of miles in a day.

By dusk, they finally arrived at the Abyssal Secret Realm!

In this world where cultivation was paramount.

Countless opportunities and fortuitous encounters existed.

Secret realms were one such type.

The birth of a secret realm was either due to predecessors' creations or natural evolution!

Within lay numerous opportunities—alternative blessed lands, miraculous pills, secret techniques, divine weapons...

Every secret realm was a treasure trove of fortune.

Yet fortune and misfortune were intertwined!

Opportunities and dangers were almost proportional.

Predecessors who left behind secret realms would also create corresponding arrangements and trials.

Those who passed the trials could obtain their inheritance and enjoy the fortune.

Those who failed would meet their end, body and soul destroyed.

This was common in the cultivation world.

The Abyssal Secret Realm was somewhat special!

The term "secret realm" here wasn't specific, but rather a general term!

As for the origin of this secret realm area—that was a long story!

At the junction of the Eastern and Southern Regions lay an abyss!

This abyss was vast and boundless, impossible to see the end.

Its formation was unknown.

Some said it was because of a battle between gods, who struck a hole through the continent, thus creating this unique place called the abyss.

Others said that an Emperor had once thrown a spear, piercing a god from the ninth heaven. The god fell here upon death and cast a curse with his dying breath, thus creating this unique place.

For this reason, the abyss was also called the Cursed Land.

There were many versions.

But all carried the color of myths and legends.

The true circumstances could no longer be verified.

It was mysterious, unfathomable, imposing, and immeasurably deep.

Precisely because of the unknown, it was full of all possibilities.

It also attracted batch after batch of people to explore.

Among them were dreamers hoping to reach the heavens in one step and achieve the pinnacle of life.

There were also terrifying powerhouses with profound cultivation but little remaining lifespan.

As a result, the abyss remained the same abyss, but the secret realms grew ever more numerous.

Many emerged naturally, while others were left behind by powerful explorers.

When the quantity reached a certain point, the abyss came to be called the Abyssal Secret Realm!

Upon a desolate mountain range!

Dense fog stretched endlessly, everything shrouded in white!

At the end of the range was a flat, smooth cliff face.

As if some force had sliced it cleanly open.

The edge was smooth, extending endlessly.

Beyond the cliff was the abyss!

The abyss was black as ink, the entire space seemingly filled with night.

So black it made one's heart quiver, as though some terrifying creature could emerge from within at any moment.

Like an eternal polar night!

The mountain range was white and misty!

Black and white stood in stark opposition, clearly delineated, leaving only a narrow boundary zone about ten feet wide where the setting sun's rays could reach.

Truly a rare sight in the world.

At this moment, a secret realm stood before everyone's eyes.

It was positioned on the mountain range, close to the abyss.

Its entire body was ethereal, like a house-sized sphere of light connected to the void.

Surrounding it flickered patterns of light.

Those were ancient formation runes.

"Senior, this secret realm is where our Dawn Mist Valley's Third Ancestor is trapped."

"Please see if you can break through this formation!"

Among the group, Lu Qingxia spoke carefully.

Zhong Qing didn't respond.

Instead, he stopped to observe.

When it came to formations, he knew nothing—one might say he had seven apertures with six open, meaning one was still blocked!

Along the way, he had naturally learned about this formation's peculiarities.

It was said that one needed to break through the entire formation with a single strike.

His current cultivation was at Earth Profound, but he didn't know if he could forcibly break through.

To be safe, Zhong Qing decided to first ask the system.

If he couldn't break through, losing face was a small matter. But if the person inside died because of it!

Then the mission he'd worked so hard to trigger would be wasted.

"System, with my current strength, can I break through this great formation?"

[Detected: This ancient formation can only be broken through brute force by someone at Sky Profound Realm!]

The system quickly provided a response.

These words made Zhong Qing's brow furrow slightly.

Sky Profound—one realm higher than him.

"I wonder if I can break through this formation using all my trump cards?"

Zhong Qing's eyes showed a contemplative look.

This idea was rather risky. If he couldn't break through, the person inside would likely die for certain.

Just as Zhong Qing was hesitating, he suddenly remembered something.

The system had said the person inside the secret realm was on his last breath.

Once he saved the target's life, he would receive his reward...

He seemed to have thought of a solution!

Just then, Lu Qingxia stepped forward and asked: "Senior, how does this formation look? Have you found any leads?"

Zhong Qing emerged from his thoughts and said: "This formation requires at least a Sky Profound powerhouse to possibly break through with brute force."

Upon hearing this, everyone's faces changed dramatically.

To them, Earth Profound powerhouses were already ancestor-level figures.

Sky Profound was the realm of legends.

"Then Senior, can you..."

Involuntarily, Lu Qingxia looked toward Zhong Qing, as she herself wasn't certain whether Zhong Qing had such strength.

Zhong Qing didn't respond to her. Instead, he walked toward the formation.

Their faces lit up with joy.

But just as they thought Zhong Qing was about to use force to break the formation, they discovered that he had actually walked directly into it.

"What?"

"What is he doing?"
