Chapter 55: One Person Becoming an Emperor Isn't Enough—The Martial Brothers Must All Become Emperors Together

One night passed!

A streak of rosy light cut through the sky, dispelling the darkness and illuminating the world.

A new day had arrived!

In the small courtyard, Bai Ling lazily stretched.

After a sleepless night of cultivation, her strength had finally recovered somewhat.

Her complexion had also improved considerably.

Now she had some ability to protect herself.

"It's time to leave!"

Bai Ling murmured to herself.

She gazed wistfully at the courtyard.

Since childhood, she had lived amid scheming and treacherous plots.

She had seen too much of humanity's darkness!

Yet in this place, she had felt unprecedented warmth and tranquility.

But the more it was like this, the more she had reason to leave.

The people of Command Hall Peak were so kind—how could she drag them down?

With this thought, she walked straight to Zhong Qing's door and knocked.

"Just a moment!"

After a rustling of clothes being put on, before long, Zhong Qing opened the door with a yawn.

"Miss Bai, is something the matter?"

Though his cultivation had long since broken through to Sun Profound Realm, allowing him to go years without sleep or rest.

Zhong Qing still maintained the habit of sleeping at night and rising with the sun.

Bai Ling gently bit her lip.

After hesitating a moment, she said, "Sir, I've come to say goodbye."

"Why not stay a while longer?"

"Or does Miss Bai find it uncomfortable here?"

She shook her head repeatedly.

"Sir, here I've felt unprecedented peace and security."

"However, I still have important matters to attend to on this journey."

"I really shouldn't tarry too long!"

"Besides, I've recovered some of my strength. As long as I don't encounter enemies who are too powerful, I'm confident I can protect myself."

"Sir needn't worry about my safety."

"Sir's kindness—I will never forget it. If there's ever an opportunity, I will surely repay this tremendous grace."

Repayment or whatever—Zhong Qing didn't care about that.

Seeing her mind was made up.

He didn't press her to stay.

He knew she had her own destiny to find—discovering her unique physique.

Lin Feng and Su Ye, his two disciples, had activated his ten-thousand-fold increase.

What effects would a new disciple bond bring? He was quite looking forward to it.

If she died from some accident, he might regret it forever.

To that end, Zhong Qing said directly, "Miss Bai, you may encounter danger on your journey out."

"How about this—I'll have the scarecrow go with you to provide some protection!"

As he spoke, Zhong Qing summoned the scarecrow directly.

"Along the way, protect this lady well. Don't let her suffer the slightest harm."

"Yes, Master!"

Red light flashed in the scarecrow's hollow eyes.

This rather surprised Bai Ling.

Of course, she didn't think much of it.

The world was full of extraordinary people.

Some artifact refiners could create all sorts of puppets with unique and varied styles.

In her eyes, the scarecrow just had a somewhat peculiar design.

If she truly encountered the great enemies hunting her, it wouldn't provide any substantial help.

But since it was Zhong Qing's heartfelt gesture, she naturally had no reason to refuse.

In this era, the world was vast and wide.

Sometimes, parting meant never meeting again.

Even keeping it by her side as a memento would be nice.

"Thank you, Sir!"

She solemnly bowed to Zhong Qing.

Since ancient times, partings have been filled with melancholy.

Deep in her heart, she felt a faint reluctance to leave.

But soon, she suppressed this reluctance.

"Bai Ling, oh Bai Ling, Sir has shown you kindness as great as a mountain. How can you harm him for your own selfish reasons?"

Thinking of this.

Bai Ling said to Zhong Qing, "Sir, then I'll be going!"

After her farewell, she set off without lingering, departing with great strides!

The scarecrow took its strange dancing steps and followed closely behind.

Zhong Qing watched her retreating figure, his heart relatively calm.

In his view, the scarecrow was quite powerful.

That fool who appeared last night was formidable enough, yet in the scarecrow's hands, he couldn't even last one exchange.

Protecting Bai Ling was more than sufficient.

The days on Command Hall Peak returned to tranquility.

Lin Feng and little Su Ye, perhaps having received some stimulus, cultivated even more diligently.

Within just a few days, each of their cultivation levels had made new breakthroughs.

[Ding: Host's disciple Lin Feng has broken through to late Dawn Profound Realm!]

[Ding: Host's disciple Su Ye has broken through to early Dawn Profound Realm!]

[Ding: Congratulations to Host for breaking through to Earth Profound Realm!]

On this day, as Zhong Qing lounged under a tree enjoying the cool shade and resting, system notification sounds startled him from his dreams.

"Good heavens!"

"It's only been a short while, and they've both broken through again!"

If he remembered correctly, little Su Ye was only ten years old, right?

What kind of concept was a ten-year-old at Dawn Profound Realm?

Even some world-shaking geniuses and prodigious youths probably couldn't compare.

The simultaneous breakthroughs of both, after the ten-thousand-fold return, had directly pushed him into Earth Profound Realm.

This feeling of becoming stronger while lying down was truly incredible.

Opening his personal attributes panel!

[Host: Zhong Qing]

[Cultivation: Earth Profound Realm]

[Disciple: Lin Feng, late Dawn Profound Realm, hundred-fold boost active.]

[Disciple: Su Ye, early Dawn Profound Realm, hundred-fold boost active.]

[Activated Bond: Trash Bond 2/2, more bonds to be developed.]

[Obtained Physique: None.]

[Obtained Special Skills: Low-Profile Aura, Heavenly Eye, Absolute Suppression, Personal Small World.]

Looking at his personal data, Zhong Qing felt the gates of immortality slowly beckoning to him!

"At this rate, it probably won't be long before I can become an immortal!"

Just thinking about becoming an immortal soon.

Even with Zhong Qing's temperament, he couldn't help feeling waves of excitement.

The future was bright!

Equally excited were Lin Feng and Su Ye!

Speaking of Lin Feng!

Once upon a time, he was just a piece of trash who couldn't cultivate.

He was even humiliated in every way by his former fiancée.

Until he met Zhong Qing and directly began his cheat-like life.

Late Dawn Profound Realm—even elders of second-rate sects were only at this level.

Yet how long had it been since he joined his master's tutelage?

He had already reached this level.

One could say, with each improvement in his strength, his reverence for Zhong Qing grew by one measure.

Without Zhong Qing's guidance, how could he be where he was today?

But he believed that Dawn Profound Realm was far from his endpoint.

"One day, I will follow Master's footsteps and achieve the Emperor position!"

On this day, in a small mountain forest, a young man made an ambitious vow.

"Senior Brother, I want to become an Emperor too!"

Little Su Ye didn't know what "Emperor" represented.

But he felt that whatever Senior Brother wanted must be extremely good.

These words made Lin Feng laugh heartily.

"Good! Then let us martial brothers both achieve the Emperor position and create an eternal legend!"

Inside the ring, Sword Elder watched the spirited young man.

Despite constantly reminding himself to be composed, he couldn't help but silently roast: "Good heavens, you really dare to say it!"

"Do you know what 'Emperor' represents?"

"That is the supreme existence!"

"Looking throughout all of history, how many Emperors have there been?"

"One person becoming an Emperor isn't enough—you want the martial brothers to become Emperors together!"

"If such bold words were heard by others, they'd laugh their teeth off."

But then he thought about Zhong Qing's identity, plus these two's ridiculously extreme rate of improvement.

It seemed that the legend of three Emperors from one sect wasn't impossible to create.

Thinking about this possibility, the furiously roasting Sword Elder instantly fell silent...
