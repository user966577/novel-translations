Chapter 82: Seven-Hundred-Year-Old Outer Sect Disciples

And so, the two men—outwardly cordial but inwardly scheming—set off together after carefully grooming themselves.

They arrived once more at Command Hall Peak.

And found Zhong Qing.

"Senior!"

The two bowed deeply with utmost respect.

"Why are you two here again?"

In the small courtyard, Zhong Qing lounged in a hanging chair beneath the jujube tree, his face showing surprise.

At this point, Wu Yue spoke first: "Senior, the thing is, after I returned, I found myself constantly missing life on Command Hall Peak."

"It even reached the point where I couldn't eat or sleep."

"So I've left Infinity Sect entirely, just to join your Command Hall Peak."

"I beg you, Senior, please take me in. I'm willing to be your test subject for pills, to contribute my humble efforts to your alchemy path!"

For the sake of those formulas in the Myriad Origins Pill Scripture, Wu Yue was going all in.

He was even willing to return to that nightmare of a life that had once haunted his dreams—a living hell.

Hearing this, Zhong Qing felt somewhat tempted.

His alchemy work really did need someone to assist and test pills.

Beside him, Shi Xiaotian grew anxious.

Old White had already seized the advantage. If he didn't make his own pitch now, he might not even get a taste of the soup.

He immediately spoke up: "Senior, I was foolish before and offended you."

"Yet you not only didn't blame me, but let me leave and gave me another chance to mend my ways."

"Such magnanimity commands admiration and leaves me deeply ashamed."

"My reverence for you, Senior, is like the endless flowing river, like the Yellow River flooding, unstoppable once begun."

"I wish to remain at your side, Senior, to learn your selfless and noble character."

"From now on, Shi Xiaotian shall follow your lead absolutely."

"If you tell me to go east, I'll never go west."

"If you tell me to chase dogs, I'll never chase chickens."

"Any pills Old White doesn't dare test, I'll test. Any pills Old White does dare test—please give me double the dose."

"In short, I'm willing to go through fire and water for you, Senior, to die without regret, and I'll have no complaints."

"I beg you, please take me in!"

When these words came out, Wu Yue's eyes went wide.

He pointed at Shi Xiaotian, too shocked to speak.

After years of association, how had he never discovered his friend's boot-licking skills had reached such masterful heights?

By comparison, his own pitch seemed far inferior.

Utterly weak!

Facing these two's performances, Zhong Qing could barely suppress his laughter.

He hadn't realized this Shi Xiaotian fellow was actually quite a character.

Having someone like this at Command Hall Peak would surely bring plenty of entertainment.

With this thought...

Zhong Qing said: "Keeping you at Command Hall Peak isn't impossible."

"However, compared to your former positions as high-and-mighty elders at a Holy Land..."

"All Command Hall Peak can offer you is the status of outer sect disciples. Please consider it carefully."

Two Sun Profound powerhouses, becoming mere outer sect disciples—Zhong Qing felt it was rather beneath them.

But inner disciples were his personal disciples, which wouldn't be appropriate.

And a peak could only establish elder positions once it had a certain number of disciples.

This was an unwritten tradition of the sect.

Thus, what Zhong Qing could offer was indeed only outer sect disciple status.

"No need to consider!"

Yet Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian spoke in unison, immediately making their stance clear.

If they were the type to care about status and position, they wouldn't have resigned from their posts as Infinity Sect elders.

To stay at Command Hall Peak, even if Zhong Qing assigned them to be servants or slaves, they'd accept it gladly.

Compared to that, becoming outer sect disciples of Command Hall Peak was already far better than they'd expected.

"In that case, go register at the sect's Registration Hall first!"

Zhong Qing naturally knew their true purpose.

But he didn't mind.

It was just an Imperial-grade Myriad Origins Pill Scripture.

He had a warehouse full of books at that level.

If their future performance satisfied him...

One measly book—he'd let them read it.

Immortal River Sect!

Registration Hall!

This was where the sect recorded new disciples' names.

Speaking of this place, it was probably the most idle position in the entire sect.

Except for the once-every-five-years disciple recruitment when things got busy, the rest of the time was so slow you could practically squeeze oil out of boredom.

It was also many sect members' favorite cushy position.

The Registration Hall's steward wasn't fixed—it rotated among the peak elders.

Ten-year terms, rotating every decade!

The current steward was an elder from Pill Peak—Tong Youwei!

In the quiet hall, Tong Youwei was dozing at the counter.

Two approaching figures startled him awake.

These two were none other than Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian, who had asked their way here.

Tong Youwei yawned hugely and forced his drowsy body upright, speaking blearily.

"Name?"

"Age?"

"Which peak?"

"What rank of disciple?"

As he spoke, he was already flipping open the registration ledger.

Clearly, he was quite practiced at this procedure.

"Wu Yue!"

"Seven hundred forty-three years old!"

"Joining Command Hall Peak!"

"Outer sect disciple!"

"Shi Xiaotian!"

"Seven hundred twenty-one years old!"

"Joining Command Hall Peak!"

"Outer sect disciple!"

The two reported their basic information.

The drowsy Tong Youwei was thoroughly confused.

At first, he didn't pay much attention.

After all, outer sect disciples—nothing special about that.

The number of outer disciples who'd passed through his hands, if not a thousand, was at least eight hundred!

Though these two were quite pathetic—seven-hundred-year-old outer sect disciples. This was a first in Immortal River Sect's history.

Everyone knew that the older you were when joining a sect, the more limited your future achievements.

Wait... something's wrong?

Suddenly, it was as if lightning struck through Tong Youwei's mind.

Normal people couldn't live over seven hundred years.

Even their Sect Master, without breaking through to a higher realm, couldn't possibly live that long.

His somewhat clouded eyes snapped open.

He wanted to see exactly which young punks had come here to mess with him.

But that single glance made Tong Youwei's heart lurch.

Massive waves churned within him.

Fifty years ago, the entire Eastern Region had held an alchemy conference.

And Command Hall Peak had been fortunate enough to receive an invitation.

At that time, he had accompanied the Pill Peak Master as an alchemist to attend.

It was then that he'd caught a distant glimpse of Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian.

And that one glimpse had stayed with him forever.

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian had been the towering giants of the alchemy world then.

The two brightest stars of that entire alchemy conference.

Their mere appearance had drawn cheers of adoration from ten thousand people, crowds swarming around them.

That scene had been seared into Tong Youwei's memory like a brand.

He had even once set chasing Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian as his lifelong goal.

Yet now these two legendary figures were telling him they wanted to join Immortal River Sect as outer disciples.

Was this a joke?
