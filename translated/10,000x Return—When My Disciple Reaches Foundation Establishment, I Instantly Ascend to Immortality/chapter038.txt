Chapter 38: Master... Carried Off the Coffin?

He felt like he'd seen this person somewhere before.

Elder Yidao racked his brain.

Suddenly, something clicked. He shot up from his seat as if his rear had springs attached.

"Gack!"

His mouth released a sound like a strangled duck.

The noise made everyone's eardrums nearly split.

Elder Yidao's strange behavior instantly drew everyone's attention.

At this moment, Elder Yidao's eyes were bulging, his face was flushed, and he wore an expression of utter disbelief.

"Elder Yidao, what's wrong with you?"

Zhuge Qing asked urgently.

"Yes, Elder Yidao, your sudden behavior—what's happened?"

Everyone else also asked with concern.

This startling behavior was truly nerve-wracking.

And this was the first time in so many years they'd seen Elder Yidao lose his composure like this.

However.

Elder Yidao paid them no mind. Instead, he shot out of the great hall and flew away, leaving everyone utterly baffled.

After flying out, Elder Yidao didn't pause but flew directly toward where Qingniao and Leng Ning were.

The two women were still discussing what to do about the body in their pavilion when they saw Elder Yidao flying toward them at unprecedented speed.

"Master, weren't you at the elder meeting? Why have you returned?" The two women asked, puzzled.

But Elder Yidao ignored their question entirely. Instead, he shouted, "Where is it? Where's the coffin?"

"It's... it's right here, Master. What's wrong?" Qingniao was startled by Elder Yidao's urgent manner and quickly pulled the coffin out of her storage ring.

The coffin landed.

Elder Yidao threw open the lid and stared fixedly at the young man lying motionless inside.

"It really is—it really is him!"

He muttered a few phrases while staring into the coffin, then without another word, hoisted the coffin onto his shoulder and flew into the air, heading toward the great hall.

Apparently worried he wasn't going fast enough, his legs kicked at the air as he flew.

This series of actions left the two women completely dumbfounded.

Their master had... carried off the coffin.

"Something must have happened." Leng Ning sensed something unusual. "Come, Junior Sister, let's follow and see."

Meanwhile.

Zhuge Qing and the other leaders were still bewildered, unable to understand why Elder Yidao had suddenly acted so strangely.

Then they saw Elder Yidao, who had just flown out, return—with a coffin on his shoulder.

This sight.

Left everyone with eyes as wide as saucers.

What had gotten into Elder Yidao?

Had he lost his mind?

Or had the pressure from Heavenly Calamity's threat driven him insane?

Running out perfectly fine, then coming back carrying a coffin?

"Elder Yidao, can you please tell me what's going on?" Zhuge Qing stepped forward, his face full of concern.

"Huff!"

Elder Yidao dropped the coffin from his shoulder with a thud, took a deep breath, then turned to look at Zhuge Qing and spoke gravely, "Sect Master, you'll understand when you see who's in this coffin."

"Who's in this coffin?"

Zhuge Qing was confused.

But he knew Elder Yidao wouldn't act without reason.

So he walked over and flipped off the coffin lid, then looked inside.

When his gaze settled on the body inside, he too let out a sharp cry.

"Gack!"

His cry was even louder than Elder Yidao's.

"Sect Master, what is it?"

The other elders were now extremely curious.

Who was lying in that coffin that could make even the Sect Master lose his composure? They all crowded forward to look inside.

"Gack!"

"Holy—!"

"What the—!"

"Impossible..."

A series of cries and curses echoed from Myriad Dao Mountain's great hall.

Everyone present, without exception, completely lost their composure.

They stared at Heavenly Calamity lying quietly in the coffin as if they'd seen a ghost.

"This—this—Elder Yidao, wh-what is going on here?" Zhuge Qing's voice stuttered. He simply couldn't believe what was happening before his eyes.

Heavenly Calamity.

Heavenly Calamity was just dead like this.

And lying in this coffin.

And this coffin appeared in his Myriad Dao Mountain?

This was too bizarre, too surreal.

Elder Yidao took a deep breath, calming his trembling heart, then explained everything. "This coffin was brought back by my two disciples."

"What?"

This revelation.

Caused another uproar.

Zhuge Qing, being the Sect Master, reacted instantly. He exclaimed, "You mean to say that the figurine Qingniao and Leng Ning have—the one that accidentally killed the 'passerby'—was Heavenly Calamity?"

"Yes!"

Elder Yidao nodded gravely.

Though the whole thing was so surreal that even he couldn't believe it, the facts were right before them.

With Elder Yidao's confirmation, Zhuge Qing and the others were completely stunned.

This was absolutely, mother-of-all-absurdity, off-the-charts ridiculous!

No wonder Heavenly Calamity said he'd attack Myriad Dao Mountain but never showed up—not even a shadow. The bastard was already dead!

And dead at the hands of Myriad Dao Mountain.

So all these days, they'd been on high alert for nothing—just battling their own imaginations the whole time.

Just then.

Leng Ning and Qingniao, who had followed Elder Yidao, arrived at the hall entrance. They happened to overhear the conversation between Elder Yidao, Zhuge Qing, and the others.

The two women were also instantly dumbfounded.

They stood frozen as if turned to stone.

Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

"Sister, am I... am I dreaming?" Qingniao's body trembled as she looked at Leng Ning, stammering, "That unlucky guy was actually Heavenly Calamity???"

Leng Ning was equally too shocked to speak.

Who could have imagined something this absurd could happen?

"Hahaha..."

At that moment, Zhuge Qing's excited laughter rang out from inside the hall. After triple-checking, the person in the coffin was definitely Heavenly Calamity.

No matter how unbelievable it seemed, the facts were the facts.

Heavenly Calamity was dead.

Truly dead. The body was right in front of them.

The crisis threatening Myriad Dao Mountain had been lifted, just like that.

"Truly, heaven is watching! Heaven is watching!"

"By my order: starting today, Myriad Dao Mountain celebrates for three days! All disciples may enter the Scripture Pavilion and select one technique!"

Zhuge Qing laughed with joy.

The other elders and leaders also wore smiles.

These past days, they hadn't had a moment's peace. Only now did their anxious hearts finally settle.

"Oh, Qingniao, Leng Ning—you two heroes! Come in, come in!"

Just then, Zhuge Qing spotted the two women standing at the entrance and quickly waved them over.

"Yes, Sect Master."

The two women also felt everyone's excitement. They were naturally thrilled as well.

Not only was the sect's crisis resolved, but they no longer had to worry about finding the victim's identity and apologizing.

"Can I see those figurines again?" Zhuge Qing asked with a smile after the women entered.

After all.

These figurines had killed Heavenly Calamity.

Sun Profound!

What a terrifying concept was that?
