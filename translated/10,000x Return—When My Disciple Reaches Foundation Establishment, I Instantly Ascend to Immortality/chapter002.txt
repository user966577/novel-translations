Chapter 2: The System's Chosen Disciple!

The next day.

Xianjiang Main Peak.

A sea of people filled the grounds. After all, Immortal River Sect was one of the major sects within a radius of tens of thousands of miles—a sacred cultivation ground in countless people's hearts.

"Silence."

A voice infused with profound energy rang out like a great bell, instantly quieting the noisy crowd.

An elderly man with an immortal bearing stepped onto the hosting platform. Behind him sat several figures radiating deep, powerful auras. The man in the center was Xuanyuan Hong, Sect Master of Immortal River Sect. The others were the various Peak Masters.

"Everyone, form lines and begin talent testing in order."

The elder's voice carried across the grounds again.

Below, ten talent-testing stones had been arranged, their surfaces swirling with light. Ten channels formed for the new disciples to test their aptitude.

Soon, disciples began stepping forward one by one. Young faces tensed with anxiety—talent determined how far their path could take them.

The testing process was simple: inject profound energy into the stone and observe the resulting glow.

The stones produced six possible colors: white, green, blue, red, purple, and gold. White indicated ordinary talent, with each successive color representing better aptitude.

As testing progressed, some rejoiced while others despaired.

Most disciples displayed white aptitude, with a smaller portion showing green. Only a handful revealed blue.

The sect had already designated areas for each talent level. Tested disciples sorted themselves accordingly.

"I wonder if we'll see any surprises this year." Up on the platform, Xuanyuan Hong conversed with the Peak Masters.

"Indeed. A purple talent would be wonderful," one Peak Master remarked.

"If we truly produce a purple talent, the heavens themselves will have blessed Immortal River Sect." Xuanyuan Hong laughed heartily. As for gold talent, something even higher? He didn't dare imagine it.

Before long, the first red talent emerged.

The crowd erupted in exclamations.

Xuanyuan Hong and the others grew visibly excited.

Red talents formed the backbone of any sect. Every Peak Master present possessed red talent themselves.

These red-talent disciples would be the primary targets for each peak's recruitment.

As time passed and testing neared its end, six red talents had appeared in total alongside the whites, greens, and blues.

A fine harvest indeed.

Just when it seemed the results were finalized, a burst of purple light exploded from the testing grounds.

The entire assembly gasped.

Xuanyuan Hong and the Peak Masters shot to their feet, eyes wide.

"A... a purple talent actually appeared." Xuanyuan Hong murmured in disbelief.

The one radiating purple light was a young man in fine robes. He basked in the envious gazes around him, a hint of arrogance on his face.

He had every right to be arrogant.

All the high-ranking eyes fixed on him. Everyone was already scheming how to recruit this purple talent for their own peak.

After this purple-talent youth, the remaining disciples produced nothing noteworthy.

Finally, talent testing concluded.

Next came the Peak Masters' selection of disciples. By tradition, each Peak Master could choose one personal disciple at every recruitment ceremony.

"Let us begin, Sect Master."

Duan Feng, Master of Divine Sword Peak, spoke eagerly. Besides the main peak, Divine Sword Peak was the strongest in all of Immortal River Sect—and by tradition, he selected first.

That meant the purple talent was practically his!

The other Peak Masters gritted their teeth, knowing the purple talent was likely beyond their reach.

"Not yet. Command Hall Peak's representative hasn't arrived."

Xuanyuan Hong glanced at an empty seat and shook his head.

"Command Hall Peak?"

Duan Feng burst into laughter. "Sect Master, Command Hall Peak only has one little waste. Whether he comes or not makes no difference."

"Besides, I don't understand why you even summoned that trash. Are you actually going to let him take a disciple and ruin someone's future?"

The words had barely left his mouth when Zhong Qing's voice rang out.

"Whether I ruin anyone's future isn't for you to worry about."

A white-robed Zhong Qing walked toward Xuanyuan Hong and bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Sect Master."

"Mm. You've had a long journey."

Xuanyuan Hong acknowledged him.

As Zhong Qing took the stage, every eye in the assembly turned toward him.

Everyone had heard of Command Hall Peak's young Peak Master.

Handsome? Certainly. Useless? Absolutely. Not a single trace of cultivation could be detected from him.

"Hmph. You actually showed your face?" Duan Feng looked at Zhong Qing with undisguised contempt. "Your aptly named Command Hall Peak should have been disbanded long ago."

"If you can show your face here, why can't I?"

Zhong Qing smiled at him. "My master once saved your life, yet you've held a grudge ever since because he surpassed you in everything. You've been looking for any excuse to cause trouble. Compared to you, doesn't that make me far more virtuous?"

"You little bastard—you're courting death!"

Duan Feng's face twisted with rage at having his sore spot exposed. "He saved me of his own accord—I never asked! And now he's dead, leaving only a worthless waste behind. Shouldn't Command Hall Peak be disbanded?"

"Enough, both of you."

Xuanyuan Hong's authoritative voice cut through the air. "Let the disciple selection begin."

"Yes!"

Zhong Qing smiled faintly and scanned the crowd below, wondering which one was the "designated disciple" the system mentioned.

Duan Feng snorted and shifted his gaze toward the purple talent, temporarily ignoring Zhong Qing.

Just as Duan Feng prepared to make the first selection as always, Xuanyuan Hong spoke again.

"Given Daoist Nai's outstanding contributions to our sect, and considering Command Hall Peak's current situation, I've decided to give the first selection to Command Hall Peak."

His resonant voice carried across the entire venue.

The crowd erupted in shock.

Disbelief painted every face.

The other Peak Masters' eyes went wide—especially Duan Feng's, which turned red with fury.

The first selection... given to Command Hall Peak?!

On what grounds?!

"Sect Master, you mustn't!"

"Indeed! What qualifies Command Hall Peak for this? The entire peak has only Zhong Qing, and he's a known waste. He'd only ruin whomever he takes!"

"A waste from a desolate peak taking disciples? We'll be laughed out of the cultivation world!"

Protests erupted from all sides. Duan Feng's objections were loudest of all.

"Silence."

"Has my authority as Sect Master become meaningless?"

Xuanyuan Hong's expression darkened. A wave of pressure swept outward, instantly crushing all dissent.

"This is how it will be!"

His tone brooked no argument.

He turned to Zhong Qing with a gentle smile. "Go ahead, child. Choose whoever you like."

Since the sect's founding, Xianjiang had always maintained seven peaks.

His decision today was partly to support Command Hall Peak, to help it rebuild.

Beyond that, there was his private relationship with Daoist Nai to consider.

They'd been martial brothers since childhood. The first time Xuanyuan Hong had ever visited a pleasure house? Daoist Nai had taken him. That was also when Daoist Nai had first adopted his dao name.

As for Zhong Qing's inability to cultivate and therefore teach disciples—Xuanyuan Hong could simply visit Command Hall Peak himself to provide secret guidance. The disciple would still belong to Command Hall Peak.

Zhong Qing hadn't expected this. Gratitude stirred in his heart.

"Thank you, Sect Master."

After a respectful nod, Zhong Qing wasted no time sweeping his gaze across the crowd.
