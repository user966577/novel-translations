Chapter 18: Command Hall Peak's Master Defending Himself—Perfectly Reasonable

"Indeed!"

The other elders and Peak Masters echoed the sentiment.

Zhong Qing was what, eighteen or nineteen at most?

When he'd killed Duan Feng, who was at late Dawn Profound, they'd guessed Zhong Qing might be at peak Dawn Profound.

Even that had been a generous estimate.

After all, they didn't have the courage to guess that someone of eighteen or nineteen had reached Star Profound.

Such cultivation, even in the Eastern Region's Holy Lands, would mark him as an exceptional prodigy—unless Immortal River Sect's ancestral graves were spouting auspicious smoke.

But now word came that he'd killed peak Dawn Profound Xue Kuang with a single finger. That meant Zhong Qing had definitely reached Star Profound.

And not ordinary Star Profound at that.

This wasn't just ancestral graves spouting smoke—this was something else entirely.

After all, Xuanyuan Hong himself, the Sect Master, was only at mid Star Profound.

As for the elders and Peak Masters, aside from the Grand Elder who'd also reached Star Profound, most were only at Dawn Profound.

"What's worse is that Zhong Qing killed Xue Kuang."

"Red-Haired Ghost is behind Xue Kuang. What if he comes seeking revenge?" One elder spoke gravely.

And as if on cue—

The moment the words left his mouth, battle fluctuations erupted from the sect's mountain gate.

A red-haired man carrying a long saber on his back cut through the defending disciples and charged toward the main peak with unstoppable momentum.

"Everyone from Immortal River Sect—get out here!"

With a furious roar, his saber swung down, cleaving off half the main peak's summit.

Boulders tumbled down. The earth shook as if struck by a massive earthquake. Countless disciples died or were injured.

By then, Xuanyuan Hong and the others had rushed out.

Xuanyuan Hong's gaze was grim as he studied the red-haired man.

He never imagined Red-Haired Ghost would attack before they'd even finished discussing countermeasures.

Yes.

The red-haired man was none other than Red-Haired Ghost.

Beneath his wild crimson hair was a face of severe decay and grotesque features. One eye socket was dead and rotting; the other oozed foul pus.

"Red-Haired Ghost, what are you doing barging into Immortal River Sect?"

Xuanyuan Hong's voice was dark.

"Don't play dumb. Hand over that Zhong Qing of yours."

Red-Haired Ghost's killing intent surged. Already hideous, his face now twisted with rage.

"Red-Haired Ghost, what exactly did our Command Hall Peak Master do to you?"

Xuanyuan Hong's pupils flickered as he stalled for time.

Secretly, he transmitted to the elder behind him: "Immediately send word to Zhong Qing. Tell him to leave Immortal River Sect and lay low for now. We can't fight a Moon Profound cultivator!"

The elder nodded and discreetly sent the message.

"Xuanyuan Hong, stop pretending."

Red-Haired Ghost raged. "That little beast knew full well Xue Kuang was my disciple, yet he still dared kill him. Today I'm going to turn that animal into a human stick!"

"Oh, so that's what this is about." Xuanyuan Hong's eyes flashed. "As far as I know, Xue Kuang attacked first, didn't he?"

"What, your disciple can attack others, but Immortal River Sect members aren't allowed to defend themselves?"

"Hmph! My disciple had his reasons for attacking. Your Immortal River Sect's little Peak Master should have either waited to die or begged for mercy on his knees. Who gave him the guts to fight back?"

Red-Haired Ghost's fury radiated in waves.

"My disciple inherited my legacy. Not yet twenty years old, already at peak Dawn Profound. Given time, he'd have trampled all those so-called Holy Land geniuses underfoot. Yet my prodigious disciple was killed by some worthless Peak Master from your Immortal River Sect. I hate it! I HATE IT!"

As he spoke, black mist engulfed Red-Haired Ghost. In his rage, the space around him became a vacuum, and sonic booms crackled beneath his feet.

"Pah! What utter bullshit."

Lei Ning, Master of Divine Tiger Peak, was a bald, straightforward man. He cursed openly. "If your disciple was so amazing, how'd our Command Hall Peak Master squash him with one finger? What's there to brag about?"

"Exactly! Your disciple's life matters, but Immortal River Sect lives don't?"

Another Peak Master released his aura, refusing to back down.

"Besides, you and your disciple are demonic cultivators with countless lives on your hands. Our Command Hall Peak Master was simply ridding the world of evil."

"Hahaha, Third Elder speaks the truth! That Xue Kuang deserved to die long ago. Who knows how many people are celebrating."

"If I'd been there, I'd have slapped him dead myself."

One after another, Immortal River Sect's Peak Masters and elders spoke up.

Within the sect, they might scheme against each other for resources and disciples.

But facing an outside enemy, they always stood united.

"You're all courting death!"

Beneath his crimson hair, Red-Haired Ghost's voice squeezed through clenched teeth.

"Has the message been sent to Zhong Qing?" Xuanyuan Hong transmitted.

"Reporting to Sect Master, it's been sent."

"Good."

Xuanyuan Hong nodded, then raised his head to face Red-Haired Ghost again.

His voice boomed like a bell.

"Red-Haired Ghost, let me make this clear today. Your disciple Xue Kuang attacked first. His skills were lacking, so he died at our Command Hall Peak Master's hands."

"Command Hall Peak's Master defending himself is perfectly reasonable."

"So if you think you're taking anyone from Immortal River Sect today—think again!"

Xuanyuan Hong's aura surged as he called out: "If you want to touch a hair on Zhong Qing's head, come and try us. Let's see who's afraid of whom!"

As his words echoed, the elders and Peak Masters behind him released their power in unison, stepping forward together, instantly forming a united front.

"Fine, fine, FINE! Since you want to die, I'll grant your wish!"

Enraged, Red-Haired Ghost unleashed thick black mist and his formidable cultivation. The darkness spread as a devastating saber strike descended from above.

"Everyone, they've brought the fight to our doorstep. Join me in meeting this attack."

Facing the blade, Xuanyuan Hong showed no fear. "We are Immortal River Sect. We will not show weakness. Even if we fall today, Zhong Qing will grow stronger and avenge us."
