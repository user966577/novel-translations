Chapter 56: In Mortal Peril

Dawn Mist Valley!

A famous Holy Land in the Eastern Region.

This entire sect's legacy stretched back through ages immemorial.

A sect like this Holy Land was akin to a living history.

Having weathered the changing seas, watching the transformations of mortal affairs.

Observing the passage of sun and moon.

Through rising and falling tides, standing firm and unshaken.

This was what a Holy Land sect was!

In the eyes of the world, high and lofty—an existence to be looked up to.

A place countless people desperately tried to squeeze into.

Yet at this moment, the entire Dawn Mist Valley was shrouded in a sorrowful, heavy atmosphere.

In the main hall, nearly half of Dawn Mist Valley's senior members had gathered.

Sect Master Lu Qingxia sat in the seat of honor.

Below her, the numerous elders were each beings who could dominate a region and strike fear into an area.

And there were the various Peak Masters and sect prodigies.

"Fellow sect members, the Third Ancestor is trapped in a secret realm, in mortal peril."

"Does anyone have any ideas for how to rescue him?"

As Lu Qingxia spoke, everyone below furrowed their brows in deep thought.

The Third Ancestor Lu Qingxia spoke of was named Zhong Changfeng—the younger brother of Dawn Mist Valley's founding ancestor.

He held an extremely important position within the Holy Land.

Though advanced in age, he was active and restless.

He loved traveling the world and exploring secret realms.

Not long ago, Zhong Changfeng had sent a distress signal, saying he was trapped in a deep Abyssal Secret Realm.

Upon receiving the news, Lu Qingxia didn't dare delay and personally led people to the rescue.

But at the entrance to that Abyssal Secret Realm stood an ancient formation.

No matter what methods they tried, they couldn't so much as scratch the formation.

Hence this current meeting.

"Sect Master, that formation is quite peculiar!"

"I've studied it. This ancient formation must be destroyed by brute force."

"And it must be destroyed in one blow!"

"Otherwise, once the formation is further stimulated, it will fully activate."

"Once the killing array activates, it will autonomously slaughter all living beings within the formation."

The speaker was the Sixth Elder.

An expert who had immersed himself in the way of formations for many years.

His words, in a sense, represented authority.

These words made everyone's hearts tighten.

They considered their martial prowess quite impressive, yet none had confidence they could destroy the formation in a single blow.

Sect Master Lu Qingxia had already tried attacking it.

It was precisely her bombardment that had awakened part of the ancient formation.

It was continuously draining the life force within the formation.

Making Zhong Changfeng's already difficult situation even more perilous.

If they made another wrong move.

And caused the Third Ancestor's death through her actions.

She would truly become a sinner for all time!

No one dared take on this responsibility!

Perhaps Dawn Mist Valley's Old Ancestor could break through the formation.

But that Old Ancestor came and went like a dragon—never to be found.

There was simply no way to contact her.

At this point, someone suggested, "Sect Master, perhaps we could seek outside help!"

This immediately drew objections from others: "Our Dawn Mist Valley is already a top power in the Eastern Region."

"Who could we seek help from?"

"Undeniably, there are sects stronger than us outside the Eastern Region."

"Setting aside whether we could convince such beings to act."

"Even if we could, traveling to other regions—how long would the round trip take?"

"Can the Third Ancestor hold on that long?"

These words silenced the entire hall.

Everyone felt a heavy pressure.

Though the Third Ancestor's cultivation wasn't particularly high, he was beloved by the Old Ancestor.

Once he died, if the Old Ancestor became furious, everyone present would have to bear the brunt of her wrath!

Just as everyone felt utterly helpless, Su Wenjiu, who had been sitting in a corner, stood up and spoke: "I know someone who might be able to rescue the Third Ancestor!"

These words instantly made her the center of attention.

"Little Su, who is this person?"

Sect Master Lu Qingxia asked in surprise.

The problem that had stumped them all—could Su Wenjiu solve it?

Everyone was skeptical!

Su Wenjiu bowed respectfully to the Sect Master.

After hesitating a moment, she spoke.

"Master, this person is the Peak Master of Immortal River Sect—Zhong Qing!"

"What?"

An elder's eyes went wide, and the way he looked at Su Wenjiu immediately changed.

Immortal River Sect might have some local reputation.

But in their eyes, it was just a second-rate sect at best.

Compared to Dawn Mist Valley, it wasn't even in the same league.

Many elders hadn't even heard of it.

Now, for a problem that had stumped all of Dawn Mist Valley, Su Wenjiu was saying a second-rate sect could solve it? And just a Peak Master?

This was utterly absurd.

Absurd to the point of—it was like absurdity opening the door for absurdity and finding absurdity right at home.

"Wenjiu!"

"I know you want to contribute to the sect."

"I understand your desire to save the Third Ancestor."

"But now is not the time for nonsense. Please step back!"

Sect Master Lu Qingxia's expression darkened, her tone carrying obvious displeasure.

As the Saintess, wanting to demonstrate herself and build prestige in the sect was understandable.

But joking around with the Third Ancestor's life—that was truly unacceptable!

Seeing this, Su Wenjiu became anxious.

"Master, I'm really not speaking carelessly."

"This Zhong Qing gave me a feeling of being extremely powerful."

She then recounted her experience at Command Hall Peak.

After finishing, she summarized: "I suspect that pond is the legendary Bitter Sea!"

"Impossible!"

"Absolutely impossible!"

An elder rejected this outright without even thinking.

"The Bitter Sea is a Buddhist treasure."

"You must understand, even across the entire continent, Buddhism is a prestigious existence."

"The importance of the Bitter Sea to Buddhism goes without saying. There's absolutely no way it could have spread outside!"

"However, based on what you've said, this Zhong Qing is indeed extraordinary, different from ordinary people."

The Bitter Sea's reputation was too great!

In their thinking, what Zhong Qing possessed was probably just an imitation.

But even as an imitation, to replicate the Bitter Sea's characteristics—just this alone was enough to make them take notice.

Of course, taking notice was all it was.

In their hearts, they still didn't believe Zhong Qing could solve the problem that had stumped them all.

"Master, right now the Third Ancestor is in mortal peril."

"And we have no solutions at all."

"Why not take a chance?"

"From here to Immortal River Sect is only about 3,000 miles. With our speed, we can make the round trip in two or three days."

"Perhaps he really can help us!"

Seeing her speak so earnestly, Lu Qingxia couldn't help but waver slightly.

After much deliberation, looking at Su Wenjiu's hopeful eyes, she finally nodded.

"Very well. Then I shall accompany you on this trip!"
