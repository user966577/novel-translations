Chapter 17: The Calamity-Tribulation Physique

As the elder knelt, the other Flying Dagger disciples panicked, unsure what to do. Several dropped to their knees as well.

"Disciple, take a good look. This is the Flying Saber Sect you wanted to join."

Zhong Qing couldn't help but mock.

Su Ye clenched his teeth at the sight.

He would never forget how Flying Saber Sect had disregarded his parents' life-saving grace and tried to hand him over to Xue Kuang.

Compared to how they now knelt before Zhong Qing—

It was pure irony.

"I... I withdraw my application to join Flying Saber Sect..."

Just then, a young man who'd been accepted as a disciple spoke up.

"I'm withdrawing too."

"I refuse to join a sect like this."

Once the first voice rang out, a domino effect followed. One by one, those who'd eagerly tested to join Flying Saber Sect changed their minds.

Truth be told, many had felt a chill when they learned Su Ye's backstory and saw the elder try to hand him over anyway.

But at the time, no one had dared speak up.

"Get lost."

Zhong Qing had no interest in this Flying Dagger elder. He simply kicked him aside.

The elder fled as if granted amnesty, leading his disciples away in disgrace.

"Disciple, let me take you back to the peak."

Zhong Qing took Su Ye's hand, rose into the sky, and vanished from sight in a streak of light.

Watching them go, the crowd took a long time to recover.

No one had expected such a turn of events today.

The immortal sect people looked down upon had shown its true colors.

But Zhong Qing's name now thundered through Tianyue City, becoming the talk of countless conversations.

"Master, can you train me to become powerful?"

Midair, Su Ye suddenly asked.

"Of course I can."

Zhong Qing smiled.

"Then I want to kill someone!"

"Who do you want to kill?"

"Flying Saber Sect's Grand Elder." Su Ye's expression was resolute. "My parents traded their lives for his. He owes them a life. I want to take it back."

Hearing this, Zhong Qing was briefly taken aback.

Then he burst into hearty laughter, praising loudly: "Excellent! Truly worthy of being my disciple! I guarantee it won't be long before you can claim that life."

He ruffled Su Ye's hair.

Pride filled his face.

After today's events, this disciple of his had undergone a transformation.

This was exactly how one should be in the cultivation world!

Soon, they arrived at Command Hall Peak.

Once there, Zhong Qing immediately sent a voice transmission to Lin Feng.

Lin Feng came flying from the horizon, landing to see Su Ye standing beside Zhong Qing.

"Master, is this your new junior disciple?" Lin Feng asked excitedly.

"Indeed. From now on, your junior brother is your responsibility." Zhong Qing smiled, introducing Su Ye to Lin Feng.

"Greetings, Senior Brother."

Su Ye bowed respectfully.

"Oh, Junior Brother, you're too polite! Come, you can stay in the cave next to mine. It's an excellent spot."

Lin Feng warmly welcomed his new junior brother, personally helping him settle in and then showing him around Command Hall Peak.

"A Calamity-Tribulation Physique."

Zhong Qing reclined on his lounger in the courtyard, personally selecting a cultivation method for Su Ye.

Through Heavenly Eye, he'd discovered that Su Ye wasn't poisoned as Xue Kuang had claimed. Rather, he'd been born with something called a Calamity-Tribulation Physique. Once activated, even a single cell of his body would contain deadly poison.

Even without activation, it wasn't something a mere Xue Kuang could withstand. If Xue Kuang had actually used Su Ye as a cultivation catalyst, not only would he have failed to break through—he would have died on the spot!

Activating the Calamity-Tribulation Physique required a specific cultivation method.

In the end, Zhong Qing selected an Imperial-grade method called "Abyss of Calamity." Not only would it perfectly complement Su Ye's physique, but it would also suppress his toxic aura from leaking out.

He then chose an Imperial-grade shadow claw as a weapon and had Lin Feng deliver everything.

He also had Lin Feng pass on the "mantra."

Once Su Ye began cultivating in earnest, Zhong Qing silently activated the 100x bonus.

With the bonus active and the Imperial-grade method amplifying his progress, breakthrough sounds began echoing from Command Hall Peak within moments.

Body Refining Stage One.

Body Refining Stage Two.

Body Refining Stage Three...

And Zhong Qing received 10,000x feedback.

The gap between his cultivation and Su Ye's was enormous, so even with Su Ye's rapid successive breakthroughs, Zhong Qing couldn't break through a single stage himself.

But he wasn't worried.

Two disciples with 100x bonuses, plus his own 10,000x feedback—advancing his cultivation was only a matter of time.

Inside the Desolate Ring, watching Su Ye rocket upward like he'd boarded a space shuttle, Sword Elder couldn't stop sighing.

"Ah, before long, you two kids will surpass my peak state."

"By the time I revive, I'll be the weakest of the bunch."

His feelings were... complicated, to say the least.

When he'd once considered his peak cultivation so difficult, so awe-inspiring—only to discover that others could achieve it by simply sitting down, meditating, and chanting a mantra—the sense of defeat was impossible to avoid.

He found himself marveling again at the terrifying power of Zhong Qing's mysterious mantra.

What kind of mantra could possibly be this powerful?

If only someday he could become Zhong Qing's disciple and learn this mantra himself...

Meanwhile.

News of Zhong Qing killing Xue Kuang in Tianyue City with a single finger had reached Azure Jade Sect.

When word reached the ears of the various elders and Peak Masters, they rushed to the main peak.

"Sect Master, is this true?" An elder couldn't help but ask.

"So you've all heard."

Xuanyuan Hong sighed. "I just received confirmation. It's real."

With the Sect Master's confirmation, everyone drew sharp breaths.

Originally, they'd thought Zhong Qing was just a waste who stayed on Command Hall Peak waiting to die. Then came the recruitment ceremony, where he'd killed the formidable Duan Feng.

That alone had shocked them enough.

Now they'd learned he'd squashed Xue Kuang with a single finger.

"How shameful."

Everyone present felt the sting of embarrassment.

A Zhong Qing they'd assumed couldn't cultivate turned out to have higher cultivation than all of them—even comparable to Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong himself.

"It seems Junior Brother Nai was the truly impressive one. We all misjudged him." Xuanyuan Hong sighed. "Such a genius, hidden right under our noses all along."
