Chapter 11: Fishing With a Net in the Bitter Sea—Is He Even Human?

That was it—the black sea she found herself in wasn't some illusion at all.

It was a real, physical space.

Everyone knew illusions had limitations. While a more powerful creator could reduce those limitations, an illusion could never truly compare to the real world.

Yet everything she'd experienced and witnessed couldn't possibly be recreated by any illusion.

Su Wenjiu's breathing grew ragged.

Despair crept across her face.

If this was real, her chances of escape had become infinitesimally small.

But she couldn't understand how such a thing could exist on this tiny mountain peak!

She looked up. Snow had begun to fall from the sky.

Her heart grew colder still.

"No. I can't die here. I have to get out."

Gritting her teeth, Su Wenjiu flew toward her only point of reference—the white lotus.

In such an environment, even the most accomplished cultivator would lose all sense of direction without a landmark.

"Snowing again?"

In the courtyard hall, Zhong Qing set down the book he'd been reading on his lounger and gazed at the snowflakes drifting outside.

He'd always loved snowy weather.

The old saying went: a timely snow promises a good harvest.

Once upon a time, he'd dreamed of being a wandering swordsman in the snow.

He remembered his past life, at his grandmother's house in the countryside.

During a season when pear blossoms covered every tree, young Zhong Qing had taken the white plastic lining from a fertilizer bag, cut it into a rectangle, and draped it over his shoulders like a cape.

Then he'd chopped a bamboo stalk from the hill behind the house and tied it to his waist with red string.

Wind and snow filled the sky as the young hero set forth, cutting down three hundred meters of foxtail grass without breaking stride.

Even after transmigrating, he'd held onto that xianxia dream for quite a while.

But the useless system that refused to give him any cultivation had slowly ground away his passion.

Even now, with the Trash Bond activated, he couldn't quite recapture that fiery enthusiasm from his teenage years.

After all, he didn't need to cultivate himself. Just lying around made his cultivation rise.

So why bother with effort?

Taking things slow was fine.

He might not be invincible now, but with the Trash Bond's bonuses, he'd get there eventually.

Of course, he still needed to find a second trash disciple.

With two trash disciples, his cultivation feedback would reach 10,000x—and that would be from both disciples combined.

But the system hadn't given him any hints lately, so he could only let nature take its course.

Still, having nothing to do left him restless.

He stood, grabbed the homemade bamboo fishing rod from the corner, donned a straw hat over his white robes, and headed toward the small pond behind the mountain.

This pond was also a check-in reward.

Zhong Qing knew the system never gave ordinary items. Though he still didn't understand the pond's true function—only that the system had named it the Bitter Sea—that didn't stop him from fishing here.

During all those years alone on the mountain, before he could cultivate and skip meals through fasting, this pond had been one of his food sources.

However.

The moment he reached the pond's edge, he froze.

Because inside the pond, a stunningly beautiful woman was scrambling about wildly.

One moment she wore an expression of despair, the next she seemed on the verge of a breakdown, then she'd pump herself up before resuming her frantic movements.

Standing on the shore watching this, Zhong Qing found it rather comical.

But he'd long since grown accustomed to such sights.

The Bitter Sea had been his check-in reward from four years ago, and he'd kept it here ever since. Over those four years, this wasn't the first or second creature to stumble into it.

There had been ordinary birds and beasts, as well as spirit beasts and exotic fowl with considerable cultivation.

After falling into the Bitter Sea, aside from those that drowned, every single one had thrashed about within its confines, unable to escape.

When Zhong Qing first discovered this phenomenon, he'd been curious for quite a while.

Unable to resist, he'd walked in himself multiple times.

But the strange phenomenon never affected him.

The water only came up to his chest. He could dive in and kick his way from one end to the other with a few strokes.

Of course, he figured that since he was the Bitter Sea's owner, he was probably exempt from its effects.

This was the first time a person had fallen in—a woman, no less.

But he had experience with such situations.

He'd long ago prepared a fishing net by the shore.

The net served multiple purposes: retrieving dead animal carcasses to reduce pollution, catching tasty-looking spirit beasts to improve his meals, and scooping out those that were neither dead nor appetizing so they wouldn't distract him while fishing.

So he treated this woman the same as always—aimed, and scooped her up with the net.

Inside the Bitter Sea at that moment, Su Wenjiu was truly on the verge of collapse.

Her cultivation, which she'd always taken such pride in, proved utterly useless trapped in this sea.

No matter how desperately she flew or how violently she attacked the water, nothing worked.

Just as she teetered on the edge of a breakdown, she suddenly noticed an enormous net appearing in the sky above.

Her heart surged with shock.

A net in the sky above this endless black sea?!

She instinctively tried to dodge.

But the net covered everything she could see—the entire world. She had no room to resist at all before being caught within it.

The next moment, a tremendous force pulled through the net, dragging her in one direction.

It felt like her body was crossing through the void, spanning across galaxies. Her head spun and went blank.

While her mind was still reeling, a gentle voice reached her ears.

"Miss."

Su Wenjiu jolted awake and opened her eyes, only to discover a white-robed young man wearing a straw hat had appeared beside her at some point.

The youth looked young, with a warm and scholarly air about him. He held a bamboo fishing rod, snowflakes dusting his shoulders, and was gazing at her.

In this situation, the sight of him gave her such a fright that she instinctively retreated two steps.

Two steps back—and she stood at the very edge of the Bitter Sea.

She turned to look at the black pond, no more than seven feet across, and finally realized she'd escaped that boundless dark ocean.

"I... I actually got out!!!"

Joy and shock mingled as tears nearly spilled from her eyes.

Still reeling, she turned her gaze back to the young man before her.
