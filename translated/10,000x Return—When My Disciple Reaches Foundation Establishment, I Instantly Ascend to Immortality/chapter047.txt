Chapter 47: The Old Ancestor's Outrageous Move

Zhuge Qing and the others all shook their heads and sighed.

Without exaggeration.

All of this was caused by Wu Yun's arrogance, which had brought Heavenly Cloud Sect to this state.

At the same time.

Zhuge Qing was even more amazed at Zhong Qing's methods and power.

Hundreds of Sun Profound cultivators.

A four-hundred-meter saber that brought an Earth Profound cultivator to his knees.

Such power, such scale—Zhong Qing was even more formidable than they had imagined!

"Brother Zhuge, please save my Heavenly Cloud Sect from this crisis. Help me plead with that senior, ask him to let this matter rest." Wu Yun spoke with desperate hope.

"You brought this upon yourself. How am I supposed to save you?"

Zhuge Qing replied irritably. "And let me be honest with you—while I know of this senior, I've never actually met him. So there's no way I can intercede on your behalf."

"A step further—even if I did know him, so what?"

"I'm just a Sect Master of little Myriad Dao Mountain. What virtue or ability do I have to influence such an existence's decisions?"

"So asking my Myriad Dao Mountain for help is simply unrealistic."

"In this situation, no one can save you. Your Heavenly Cloud Sect can only save itself. I wish you well."

With that, Zhuge Qing waved his hand and left with his people.

Left behind, Wu Yun's face was bloodless.

He looked as if his soul had departed.

No words could describe the regret in his heart at this moment.

Either way, death awaited.

Then he would rather die at Heavenly Cloud Sect.

He tore through the sky, racing back toward Heavenly Cloud Sect.

His heart was unbearably heavy.

Because in the time it had taken him to go and return, Heavenly Cloud Sect was probably already destroyed.

He used his last two Long-Range Teleportation Talismans, finally returning to Heavenly Cloud Sect.

He had expected Heavenly Cloud Sect to no longer exist.

But to his surprise, not only was Heavenly Cloud Sect still standing—the battle had also ceased.

"What... what's going on?"

Wu Yun was in utter disbelief, fearing he had seen wrong.

"Master, is the pressure good?"

At this moment, in Heavenly Cloud Sect's great hall, Zhong Qing reclined on the head seat. Behind him stood Heavenly Cloud Sect's Old Ancestor, obsequiously massaging Zhong Qing's shoulders.

Zhong Qing was genuinely helpless about this.

He had been about to bring Zero Seal down on Old Ancestor Guo Shijie's head.

But the moment he drew his weapon, Guo Shijie had fallen to his knees with a thud.

Without any hesitation whatsoever, Guo Shijie immediately raised his fingers and swore a Heavenly Dao Oath, pledging to serve Zhong Qing as a servant. From then on, all of Heavenly Cloud Sect would serve Zhong Qing. If he ever showed the slightest disrespect or disloyalty, he would be destroyed in body and soul.

As if afraid Zhong Qing wouldn't agree, Guo Shijie had then personally executed several elders who had offended Zhong Qing with two swift strikes.

Demonstrating perfect "righteous betrayal of one's own."

This series of smooth operations had left Zhong Qing dumbfounded.

But after carefully weighing the pros and cons, he found that taking this fellow in actually wasn't bad.

After all, even if he wiped out Heavenly Cloud Sect completely, he'd gain nothing from it, and there might be loose ends causing future trouble.

But now.

He had not only gained an Earth Profound servant but also taken over all of Heavenly Cloud Sect. And he didn't need to worry about them turning traitor or having second thoughts.

After all, a Heavenly Dao Oath was not something to joke about.

So a free faction—why not take it? It would certainly prove useful in the future.

With this development, Zhong Qing recalled all his wooden figurines.

The battle that had been to the death simply ended like that.

"Hehe, Master, please have some more tea."

Guo Shijie was extremely attentive.

Just then, his eyes flickered as if noticing something.

Then his hand shot out into the void, and Wu Yun, who had just returned from Myriad Dao Mountain, was snatched back and thrown before Zhong Qing like a dead dog.

"Master, I've captured that scoundrel Wu Yun. How would you like to deal with him?" Guo Shijie asked Zhong Qing obsequiously.

On the ground, hearing Guo Shijie's words, Wu Yun stared at his Old Ancestor in disbelief.

So that was why Zhong Qing had stopped destroying Heavenly Cloud Sect—his Old Ancestor had become Zhong Qing's servant.

Seeing Wu Yun still in a daze, Guo Shijie seemed to know what he was thinking and quickly transmitted a message: "So what if I'm a servant? Being a servant is better than being dead, better than seeing Heavenly Cloud Sect destroyed. What are you standing there for? Hurry and confess your crimes—show some sincerity."

Hearing this, Wu Yun smiled bitterly in agreement.

Yes.

In this situation, even becoming a servant was better than losing everything.

So Wu Yun quickly knocked his head heavily against the ground.

"Senior, I, Wu Yun, was blind. Please forgive me."

Clearly, after Zhong Qing's earlier display of absolute power, combined with his various experiences and regrets during this round trip, Wu Yun had long been stripped of his pride.

This outcome wasn't something he couldn't accept.

At least it could save Heavenly Cloud Sect.

Seeing Wu Yun's relatively sincere attitude, Guo Shijie finally relaxed.

He had genuinely feared that Wu Yun would be stubborn and pull some "death before dishonor" routine.

He had worked so hard to get Zhong Qing to accept him as a servant—if Wu Yun ruined it, he would have wanted to die.

Seeing Zhong Qing seemingly considering how to deal with Wu Yun, Guo Shijie immediately knelt as well. "Master, this Wu Yun angered you and deserves death a hundred times over—his death wouldn't be enough to quell your fury."

"However, this humble servant still dares to beg you—let him also become your servant, let him serve you as a beast of burden, spending his entire life atoning for today's mistakes."

Zhong Qing turned to look at Guo Shijie.

He had to admit, this old man really was devoted.

And knew when to bow and when to stand—quite shrewd.

After a long moment of consideration, Zhong Qing finally nodded in agreement.

Because killing Wu Yun was as easy as raising his hand, but making Wu Yun his dog might actually prove quite entertaining.

Seeing Wu Yun still frozen, Guo Shijie roared, "What are you standing there for? Quickly swear the Heavenly Dao Oath!"

Only then did Wu Yun react, hurriedly swearing: "I, Wu Yun, swear a Heavenly Dao Oath to take Senior Zhong Qing as my master. If I break this oath, may heaven and earth destroy me."

With this Heavenly Dao Oath made.

Zhong Qing knew.

This Wu Yun would never dare have any strange thoughts again.

How unpredictable life was.

He had only come to settle his disciple's affairs, never expecting to take over all of Heavenly Cloud Sect, with both the Old Ancestor and Sect Master becoming his servants.

"Rise."

Zhong Qing said calmly.

Since they had both become his servants, they were essentially his puppets now. There was no need to dwell on past matters.

"Yes."

Only then did Wu Yun dare to stand.

"Handle Heavenly Cloud Sect's aftermath yourselves." Zhong Qing also rose, saying, "I've been out for a while now. I should go back and rest for a few days."

"Yes, Master. Rest assured, we will handle Heavenly Cloud Sect's aftermath properly." Both Guo Shijie and Wu Yun spoke in unison.

"Take this. When I need something, I'll contact you."

Zhong Qing took out a storage ring, tossed it to Guo Shijie, and then walked out of the hall.

"Respectfully seeing off the Master."

Both men bowed respectfully, not straightening up until Zhong Qing had left Heavenly Cloud Sect with Lin Feng.

"You, you! You nearly destroyed all of Heavenly Cloud Sect single-handedly." Back inside, Guo Shijie couldn't help but glare at Wu Yun.

Wu Yun hung his head, not daring to respond.

"But looking at it now, this might actually be a blessing in disguise." Guo Shijie then sighed.

"A blessing in disguise?"
