Chapter 81: Two Great Elders Resign Simultaneously

While Zhong Qing's spirits were soaring.

Far, far away!

Someone was having a miserable time.

Take Wu Yue, Seventh Elder of Infinity Sect. Ever since returning to his sect...

He had no appetite for food, no energy for anything.

His entire being had become listless, shambling about like a walking corpse.

His mind was consumed by those pill formulas.

For an alchemist...

A superior pill formula held an irresistible, fatal attraction.

A book a foot thick, containing who knew how many pill formulas.

The feeling of wanting something so desperately yet being unable to grasp it, unable to hold on—the torment was beyond words.

Then one day!

In White Constancy Hall!

"No, I can't go on like this!"

Wu Yue bolted upright from his bed and scratched at his disheveled white hair.

His eyes red, he gazed out the window.

Finally, as if steeling himself for some momentous decision...

He strode straight out the door and headed for Infinity Sect's main palace—Infinity Hall!

The Sect Master of Infinity Hall was named Ouyang Hao!

A burly, imposing middle-aged man of stern and dignified bearing.

At this moment, he sat upon the great hall's throne, handling sect affairs.

For a Holy Land sect like this, the Sect Master enjoyed supreme authority but naturally had to bear corresponding responsibilities and obligations.

And Ouyang Hao was absolutely a model of diligence.

In his five-hundred-plus years of leadership, the sect had flourished under his guidance.

Disciples, elders, and guest cultivators alike all thrived—a scene of prosperity and abundance.

"Sect Master, the Seventh Elder has come to visit!"

Just then, a guard came to announce.

Ouyang Hao, in the midst of his busy work, paused involuntarily.

"What's he here for?"

Though puzzled, Ouyang Hao quickly responded: "Show him in!"

The Seventh Elder held considerable status in the sect.

His Sun Profound cultivation made him a pillar of the Holy Land sect.

His alchemy skills had reached the pinnacle of mastery—few in the entire Eastern Region could match him.

For such a talent, even as Sect Master of Infinity Sect, Ouyang Hao had to show proper respect.

After the guard left, it wasn't long before Wu Yue's figure appeared in the great hall.

"Seventh Elder, you... what happened to you?"

Ouyang Hao stared at Wu Yue—bloodshot eyes, unkempt appearance, clearly in terrible mental shape—his face full of alarm.

Wu Yue was silent for a moment.

He had come to resign.

The moment he thought of those soul-stirring ancient pill formulas on Command Hall Peak, he couldn't stay a single quarter-hour longer.

Yet when it actually came time to resign, he found himself hesitating.

At Infinity Sect, his position was undoubtedly transcendent.

Of course, if it were merely about transcendent status, he wouldn't have hesitated.

The more crucial reason was that the Sect Master of Infinity Sect had always treated him with the utmost courtesy—a debt of gratitude for recognizing his talents.

If he just left like this, wouldn't it seem too heartless and ungrateful?

But this hesitation quickly transformed into resolve.

Water flows downward, people climb upward—this was an eternal truth.

The Myriad Origins Pill Scripture in Zhong Qing's possession held a fatal attraction for him.

It might even determine the future of his path.

The path of cultivation wasn't about human relationships or social niceties.

Many people, in pursuit of the Dao, even abandoned their humanity, severing emotions and desires.

He was merely pursuing his own path, nothing more.

With this thought, he spoke with utmost seriousness: "Sect Master, I wish to resign!"

The moment these words left his mouth.

Ouyang Hao was stunned.

"Seventh Elder, why is this?"

Wu Yue hemmed and hawed for a moment.

He couldn't very well say: he was resigning because he wanted to join some second-rate sect called Immortal River Sect!

That kind of reason—even if he spoke it aloud, no one would believe it. The Sect Master might think he was just making excuses, insulting his intelligence.

Given this, he could only find some excuse to deflect: "No particular reason."

"I just feel tired and want to retire to the mountains. I hope the Sect Master will grant my wish!"

Ouyang Hao was baffled.

"The Eighth Elder came to resign not long ago, with the same reasoning."

"Could it be that staying at Infinity Sect has truly exhausted you both, body and soul?"

Deep confusion showed in his eyes.

He even began to wonder if the sect policies he'd established had some problem.

Two elders resigning in succession—this was no small loss for Infinity Sect.

Especially since these two were both alchemists.

When Wu Yue heard Ouyang Hao's words, he practically exploded.

"What? Old Black already left?"

"That's right! You two are usually thick as thieves, close as brothers—didn't he tell you?"

Wu Yue fumed internally: "That bastard! I treated him like a brother, like family, and he goes behind my back to join that Senior first."

In that moment, whatever guilt Wu Yue had felt about leaving Infinity Sect vanished completely.

Indeed, when it came to opportunities...

Once you encountered one, you had to seize it immediately.

Hesitate for even a moment, and you'd be too late to catch even a warm pile of shit.

"Sect Master, I have pressing matters. I'll take my leave first."

"Here is my elder's medallion. I'm returning it to you now."

"But rest assured, when I have time in the future, I'll come back to visit."

Having said this, he placed the medallion representing his status as an Infinity Sect elder on the table.

Then he hurried off in a blaze of urgency.

Leaving behind a thoroughly bewildered Sect Master Ouyang Hao.

Since when had a grand Holy Land sect become a place people could join or leave at will?

Even resignations were handled this casually now.

He was tempted to send people to stop him, but after some thought, he ultimately took no action.

In the end, both the Seventh and Eighth Elders were rare talents.

When dealing with talented people, one naturally had to treat them differently from ordinary folk.

Rather than forcibly keeping them, it was better to let them go graciously. At least this way, he'd preserve some goodwill, maintain a connection.

No need to sour the relationship.

If someday he needed to ask for their help, this connection might earn him some face.

Thinking this way, Ouyang Hao's gloomy mood improved considerably.

At the same time, he wondered if he should improve the benefits for the sect's upper echelon.

If he kept losing two elders a day like this, even with a Holy Land sect's resources, who could withstand such a talent drain?

Setting aside the impact and changes Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian's resignations would have on Infinity Sect...

These two, upon leaving Infinity Sect, had rushed non-stop toward Immortal River Sect.

As they approached, both prepared to tidy themselves up.

This time, they had come with sincerity.

If they wanted to successfully join Immortal River Sect, they naturally needed to groom themselves properly, score some impression points.

Beside a clear river.

Shi Xiaotian looked at his reflection in the water, adjusting his robes. He cut quite the distinguished figure of an immortal master—and then he spotted Wu Yue descending from the sky!

"It's you?"

Both their eyes were filled with astonishment.

Neither had expected to run into their old friend in this place.

"You! I treated you like a brother, like family, yet when you left Infinity Sect to join Immortal River Sect..."

"Something this important, and you didn't even tell me."

"Sneaky bastard!"

Wu Yue immediately launched into mockery.

Hearing this, a flicker of shame crossed Shi Xiaotian's face.

After all, what he'd done wasn't exactly honorable.

But he quickly recovered.

The moment he'd left the sect, he'd rushed non-stop toward Immortal River Sect.

He had just arrived here, and Wu Yue had shown up right on his heels.

What did that mean? It meant they'd both had the same idea.

In an instant, his shame vanished, and he shot back: "You're one to talk! I don't believe for a second that when you left, you thought about calling me along."

And so, these two who had been as close as brothers, who practically shared the same pants, began trading barbs and mockery.

In the end, Wu Yue was the first to call a truce.

"Fine, so we both want to join that Senior's service. One more person isn't too many, one less isn't too few."

"Why don't we travel together? We can look out for each other."

"Excellent idea!"

On the surface, the two became amicable brothers once more.

But secretly, they were each scheming.

Having him along isn't bad. If the Senior only takes one person and sets up some test, I'll have plenty of dirt on him to expose, making myself look better by comparison.

As for brothers?

A brother's greatest purpose is to be sold out at times like these!
