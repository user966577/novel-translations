Chapter 10: A Pond You Can Never Escape

"Why is this peak so empty? So quiet?"

"The scenery is pleasant, though."

After landing, Su Wenjiu surveyed her surroundings.

She wasn't in any rush regarding the disciple matter—he wasn't going anywhere.

First, she'd observe the environment. Examining the subtle details would give her a preliminary understanding of Lin Feng's master.

Layout and style could reveal personality.

Formations and defenses could indicate power level.

Such intelligence would smooth the upcoming negotiation.

This extra care was because she valued Lin Feng highly.

Otherwise? She wouldn't bother. She'd simply toss out some benefits—take it or leave it. If they refused, they'd learn to agree anyway.

"Apart from the scenery, this place seems rather unremarkable."

After a casual inspection, Su Wenjiu murmured to herself, "The master is probably just an ordinary cultivator. Nothing particularly special."

"Very well. I'll find him and speak plainly."

"And if negotiations don't go smoothly... with a prodigy like this at stake, perhaps I'll need to apply some pressure."

Decision made, she was about to extend her spiritual sense to locate Zhong Qing's exact position when something caught her eye.

A small pond, no more than six or seven feet across.

Snow piled thick around its edges.

The water within was either murky or simply dark—pitch-black, seemingly bottomless.

At the center of that inky water floated a single white lotus.

Nine petals. Against the black water, it glowed like a full moon.

Su Wenjiu's gaze locked onto it.

A white lotus floating in a pond in the dead of winter was strange enough.

The lotus itself showed no unusual aura. It seemed like an ordinary plant.

Yet she couldn't look away. An irresistible urge to pluck it consumed her.

Almost unconsciously, she walked toward the pond's edge. Profound energy wrapped around her feet as she stepped onto the water's surface.

Where her toes touched, the black water rippled outward in expanding rings.

Step by step, she approached the lotus.

Then—something felt wrong.

The pond was barely seven feet across. From edge to center was maybe three and a half feet—a few steps for even a child.

Yet she'd taken several steps and hadn't gotten any closer. Visually, the lotus appeared exactly as distant as when she'd stood on the shore.

"Hm?"

Su Wenjiu's brow creased slightly.

She simply pressed harder against the water and launched herself toward the lotus through the air.

When she landed again, the lotus remained exactly the same distance away.

Stranger still—she could no longer see the pond's edge.

Looking around, every direction revealed only the edge she'd just left. Both sides, behind her—all gone.

Nothing remained but the endless expanse of black water and that single white lotus she could see but never reach.

As if she floated alone on a vast, dark sea.

"An illusion?"

"Interesting."

A playful smile touched Su Wenjiu's lips.

"Let's see how I break this."

She sat cross-legged on the water, unperturbed, and entered a meditative state.

Against ordinary illusions, one need only keep their mind unaffected, their thoughts still as water. The illusion would break on its own.

After a brief period of focused meditation, Su Wenjiu opened her eyes.

She'd expected to find the illusion shattered. Instead, she remained surrounded by the endless black sea, with only that bright lotus for company.

"Not bad."

Her expression grew slightly more serious.

"If meditation won't work, brute force it is."

Su Wenjiu had complete confidence in her abilities.

Young as she was, she'd been the greatest prodigy in Dawn Mist Valley's history. She'd reached Moon Profound Realm over a year ago.

"Ha!"

With a sharp cry, surging vital energy gathered in her palm.

She struck the water with a devastating blow.

BOOM!

The surface erupted. Massive waves rolled outward for dozens of miles.

A full-force strike from a Moon Profound expert could evaporate a pond ten times this size in an instant.

Even the most powerful illusion couldn't sustain itself if its foundation was destroyed.

Confident, she waited for the array to collapse.

Time passed.

The turbulence from her attack gradually stilled.

The illusion remained intact.

Nothing but endless dark water in every direction.

"What?"

"It won't break?"

Su Wenjiu's brows drew together, her earlier amusement gone.

Her gaze fixed on the lotus—the only point of reference.

"I don't believe this."

She shot into the sky, pushing her Moon Profound speed to its absolute limit, and rocketed toward the flower.

Day turned to night and back again.

Two days passed.

Su Wenjiu's slender form stood upon the water. Her delicate features remained beautiful but couldn't hide the exhaustion and weariness beneath.

Gone was her earlier composure.

Flickers of panic now crossed her eyes.

She'd flown at maximum speed toward the lotus for two full days and still hadn't escaped this tiny pond.

The lotus remained a tantalizingly unchanging three feet away.

"What kind of illusion is this?!"

Su Wenjiu bit her lip in frustration.

The helplessness of trying everything and failing was overwhelming. Anxiety crept in despite her efforts.

She'd even tried using a communication jade slip to contact her sect for rescue. It had vanished into nothing.

Just then, she sensed movement in the water below.

Instinctively, she shot upward.

Rising a thousand feet, she looked down at the surface—and her eyes went wide.

Something enormous swam through the depths.

Thirty thousand feet long, at least.

Its body was crimson, its shape blurred—part dragon, part something else—moving slowly through the water.

As it passed, its massive back broke the surface like a mountain range stretching for miles.

Its sheer size wasn't what terrified her most.

What truly chilled her was the aura it radiated.

Not directed at her. Just the faintest trace leaking out naturally.

Yet that tiny wisp made her scalp crawl. She had no doubt that a single breath from this creature would scatter her soul to oblivion.

At the same time, a horrifying possibility occurred to her...
