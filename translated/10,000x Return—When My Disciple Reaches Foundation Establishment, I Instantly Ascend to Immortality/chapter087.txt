Chapter 87: The God of Wealth Descends

Previously, apart from his first batch turning out somewhat normal, every pill Zhong Qing refined was an absolute disaster.

Either they came out lumpy or carried various bizarre side effects.

But now, he could finally produce normal pills.

Though the quality wasn't high, according to Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian, with stable performance, he was already qualified to be called a first-rank alchemist.

"Not easy at all!"

The happiest people about Zhong Qing's improved alchemy skills weren't him—it was Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian.

Recalling their days as guinea pigs on Command Hall Peak still gave them shivers.

Later, even though they had volunteered to be test subjects, heaven knew how much psychological pressure they'd endured.

Now, with Zhong Qing's improved techniques, those terrifying days were finally behind them.

The improvement excited Zhong Qing greatly.

"Indeed, effort always pays off."

"The ancients didn't deceive me!"

Before the Violet-Azure Spirit Furnace, Zhong Qing refined several dozen batches in one go.

His success rate wasn't particularly high—still only around thirty percent.

But at least what he produced was actually usable.

This gave him hope for refining advanced pills.

Soon, his attention fell upon a formula for the Soul-Tempering Pill.

The Soul-Tempering Pill could temper the divine soul and heal soul injuries.

Powerful effects, extraordinary quality.

Zhong Qing felt mastering it would be extremely meaningful.

Even if he had to grind endlessly, he would conquer it completely.

But just as he prepared to invest time into mastering it, he suddenly realized—he was out of materials!

Every powerful pill required exceptional raw materials.

And the main ingredient for the Soul-Tempering Pill wasn't available at Command Hall Peak. When he sent disciples to inquire at Immortal River Sect, they discovered the sect didn't have it either.

The feeling was quite frustrating.

"Peak Master, the Pill Cauldron Pavilion has an auction house branch in Spirit City."

"Their spiritual material reserves are unmatched throughout the entire Eastern Region."

"If you visit the auction house, you might find what you need."

Seeing Zhong Qing's dejected expression, Wu Yue quietly offered a suggestion.

In the Eastern Region, there were five great Holy Lands.

Pill Cauldron Pavilion was one of them.

But unlike the other four Holy Lands, Pill Cauldron Pavilion's true membership consisted of top-tier alchemists.

It was essentially an alchemist alliance.

A single senior alchemist consumed a terrifying amount of materials.

And an entire Holy Land sect whose members were exclusively alchemists?

Such an organization consumed oceanic quantities of materials annually.

For this very reason, Pill Cauldron Pavilion's material reserves were the greatest in the entire Eastern Region.

"The auction house?"

Zhong Qing made a mental note of the name.

"Peak Master, shall we make the trip for you?"

Seeing this, Shi Xiaotian quickly offered.

"No need!"

Zhong Qing waved his hand.

"The Immortal Dao Conference is about to begin."

"Originally, I planned to take everyone from Command Hall Peak."

"Now, you two can represent Command Hall Peak at the conference!"

"And bring Lin Feng and little Su Ye along."

"Those two are still young and inexperienced."

"I'll trouble you both to look after them."

These words left Shi Xiaotian and Wu Yue feeling deeply honored.

"Peak Master, you're too kind!"

Shi Xiaotian was first to respond: "As their junior martial brothers and outer sect disciples, looking after our senior martial brothers is our duty."

Wu Yue wasn't about to be outdone: "Exactly."

"Anyone who dares harm them will have to step over our dead bodies first."

With their assurances, Zhong Qing felt at ease.

With two Sun Profound powerhouses as guardians, as long as they didn't actively court death, their safety throughout the Eastern Region should be assured.

"Alright, you two prepare. No day like today—depart immediately!"

At Zhong Qing's command, Su Ye and Lin Feng were called out from their closed-door cultivation.

The party of four set off grandly.

In an instant, the already quiet Command Hall Peak fell completely silent.

Zhong Qing didn't mind.

Shortly after his disciples departed, he too set off.

Destination: Spirit City.

Spirit City fell within Immortal River Sect's sphere of influence.

The outer city was where ordinary people lived, while the inner city was where cultivators gathered.

A single wall separated two entirely different worlds—heaven and earth.

The auction house was located in the inner city.

It was a magnificent golden pavilion.

The interior was lavishly decorated, high-end and elegant.

Carved pillars and jade columns, antique fragrances everywhere, with countless dazzling goods on display.

Most of these were precious spiritual medicines.

Every single one was priceless.

As Zhong Qing examined the various materials, a woman in red robes with delicate features approached.

"Sir, is there anything I can help you with?"

"Our auction house has a complete selection of spiritual medicines, from low-grade to top-grade."

"If these don't meet your needs, there will be an auction tonight."

"There may even be Medicine Kings up for bidding."

"I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for here."

These words mildly surprised Zhong Qing.

Top-grade spiritual medicines were already rare treasures in this world.

Medicine Kings were legendary existences of immeasurable value.

From just these few words, the auction house's deep pockets were evident.

"Do you have Ice-Fire Grass? Thunder Flower? Nether Spirit Fruit?"

Zhong Qing listed three top-grade spiritual medicines in one breath.

These were all primary ingredients for refining the Soul-Tempering Pill.

The red-robed woman's eyes widened slightly.

A single top-grade spiritual material was worth a fortune.

Some third-tier sects couldn't acquire even one with their entire sect's resources.

A single top-grade material transaction was major business for the entire auction house.

And it seemed this customer wanted three at once.

Instantly, her smile became even more radiant.

"These three materials are extremely valuable. Most places couldn't gather all of them."

"However, our auction house has considerable stock."

"Would you like just one, or all three?"

Zhong Qing: "However many you have, I'll take them all!"

At these words, the red-robed woman's pupils visibly contracted.

"Sir... you're not joking, are you?"

"The auction house has a batch of stock, gathered from various locations and ready for shipment to headquarters."

"For each material you mentioned, we have no fewer than ten."

"Are you... sure you want all of them?"

Her shock was understandable.

It was like a real estate developer in his previous life opening a new property.

The building was up, ready for sale.

Then someone walks in and says they'll buy the entire building.

This wasn't just a big sale anymore.

This was the God of Wealth descending to earth!

Of course, that assumed the buyer could actually afford it.

And could Zhong Qing really afford this?

With Immortal River Sect's financial resources, buying this many top-grade materials would be quite painful.

A peak master saving for centuries might barely manage full payment.

But let's not forget—Zhong Qing was a transmigrator with a system.
