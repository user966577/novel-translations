Chapter 32: An Ant's Struggle

"I had nothing to do today, so I came to see Father." Murong Xue said. "Is Father comfortable here?"

"Comfortable, comfortable, of course I'm comfortable."

Murong Hai's face was all smiles. "Living here is incomparable to that backwater Heaven's Mandate City. After staying here for a while, I feel like my cultivation, which has been stuck for ages, is finally loosening up."

"That's good to hear. I happen to have some Star-Piercing Pills here."

Murong Xue flicked her jade-like hand, and a crystal-clear jade bottle landed on the table. "These Star-Piercing Pills can increase your chances of breaking through to Star Profound."

"This..."

Murong Hai's eyes lit up. He picked up the jade bottle and opened it to find seven Star-Piercing Pills inside. A rich medicinal fragrance filled the entire room.

"Star-Piercing Pills are truly rare treasures." Murong Hai sighed. "Back in Heaven's Mandate City, I couldn't even get one if I begged for it. And now, seven at once."

"They're just Star-Piercing Pills. Father, feel free to use them. If you need more, I have plenty." Murong Xue said proudly. "With my current status in Heavenly Cloud Sect, getting pills like these only requires a few words."

"My daughter is truly impressive." Murong Hai was filled with gratification, then asked, "By the way, I can't see through your cultivation level. What realm are you at now?"

"Mid Dawn Profound." Murong Xue lifted the corner of her lips.

"Mid Dawn Profound already?" Murong Hai gasped, his face excited. "Your cultivation is almost catching up to mine! I cultivated for decades to reach late Dawn Profound, and you're only in your teens. Golden talent truly lives up to its name."

"Advancing realms is merely a matter of time for me." Murong Xue raised her red lips. "The reason you can't see through my cultivation is because my cultivation speed has been too fast. In just one year, I've gone from Innate to my current realm."

"If word of this cultivation speed got out, it would inevitably invite jealousy. So the sect's Supreme Elders taught me a technique to conceal my aura."

"That's good." Murong Hai smiled. "Every sect has enemies and competitors. If others knew your cultivation speed, it would be disadvantageous for you. The sect did this for your benefit."

Murong Xue nodded proudly.

At that moment, Murong Hai suddenly remembered something and picked up the letter in his hand. "Lin Feng from the Lin family sent a letter. He says that in one month, he wants to honor their three-year promise early and come up the mountain to challenge you."

"Lin Feng?"

"The Lin Feng from the Lin family of Heaven's Mandate City?" Murong Xue tilted her head.

If Murong Hai hadn't mentioned it, she would have forgotten about this person entirely.

"Half a year ago, didn't he clamor about three years? There's still two and a half years left. What does he want to challenge now?"

"I don't know either. This is the challenge letter he sent. Want to take a look?" Murong Hai extended the letter.

However, Murong Xue didn't take it. She didn't even glance at it.

"I really don't know where he gets the courage to challenge me."

Murong Xue couldn't help but sneer.

"I heard some news from Heaven's Mandate City. Apparently, Lin Feng got lucky and found a master. His master seems quite strong—even helped Heaven's Mandate City eliminate a Moon Profound demon beast. His master is probably at late Moon Profound." Murong Hai said. "So Lin Feng likely received help from this person and was able to cultivate."

Hearing this, Murong Xue's expression remained unchanged. "A Moon Profound master, is it..."

"My Heavenly Cloud Sect can casually produce a dozen of those. And which of my teachers isn't at least Moon Profound?"

"True. Moon Profound is nothing special anymore." Murong Hai nodded deeply, a trace of pride on his face.

In the past, Moon Profound was indeed an unreachable existence.

But now...

Not to mention anything else, the elders who treated him courteously on a daily basis were all Moon Profound. He could interact with them every day.

"Perhaps I know why he wants to challenge me now." Murong Xue said mockingly.

"What?" Murong Hai was puzzled.

"Didn't you say he received help from that Moon Profound and was able to cultivate?" Murong Xue said disdainfully. "So he simply wants to prove to me that he's not trash."

"But even so, so what? Acquired? Innate? In my eyes now, he's still trash."

"This kind of proof is child's play to me. Does he think I'll give him a second glance because of this?"

At this, Murong Xue's expression turned icy. "If he wants to come, let him come. But once he's here, he won't be leaving."

"You want to kill him?" Murong Hai was startled.

"Wouldn't it be best if he died on the dueling platform during the challenge?" Murong Xue asked in return.

"Daughter, why not spare his life?" Murong Hai said. "No matter what, the Lin family once helped our Murong family. And setting aside the engagement, you two grew up together—you're practically childhood sweethearts."

"Silence."

Suddenly, Murong Xue's refined face twisted, and she shrieked hysterically, "What engagement? What childhood sweethearts?"

"Do you know who I am? I am Heavenly Cloud Sect's Saintess!"

"This so-called engagement is a stain on me!"

"A stain, a stain, a stain—do you understand?"

"If I don't remove this stain, I feel like everyone looks at me differently. Every gaze carries mockery, making me feel like ants are crawling all over me at every moment."

"So he must die!!!"

Murong Xue's entire body turned cold, her eyes filled with killing intent.

"Alright, alright."

Seeing Murong Xue's sudden fury, Murong Hai was clearly frightened and didn't dare say more.

"I'm going back now. Don't say anything more. Just let him come to his death in one month." Murong Xue said coldly before turning and leaving.

At the same time.

Lin Feng's challenge letter also reached Heavenly Cloud Sect's hands.

After all, since this was an official challenge, Heavenly Cloud Sect naturally needed to be informed.

Heavenly Cloud Sect made no particular statement, tacitly accepting it, but clearly didn't take it too seriously.

After all, as a top-tier sect, their leadership dealt with countless matters every day. Something as foregone a conclusion as this naturally wouldn't warrant much attention.

It was just an ant's struggle.
