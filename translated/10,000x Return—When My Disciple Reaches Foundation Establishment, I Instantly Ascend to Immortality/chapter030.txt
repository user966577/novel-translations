Chapter 30: Designing the Small World

Although small worlds did exist throughout the greater world.

For instance, some reclusive ancient families.

Some primordial clans.

They might live within a small world, drawing a boundary around themselves. They'd set up an entrance and exit point somewhere to come and go.

These reclusive and primordial families—pull any single one out, and they could crush the entire Eastern Region.

But even with such power, the reason they could carve out small worlds was through generations of accumulated effort, working together to open them.

And those capable of participating in the creation of small worlds were beings who had mastered partial control of spatial laws.

Such existences—every single one could make the continent tremble with a stomp of their foot.

Yet Zhong Qing before them had opened a small world all by himself!!!

What did this mean?

For a moment.

The two women looked at Zhong Qing with utter disbelief, their gazes now filled with mystique.

They had never imagined that a simple mission would lead them to encounter such an extraordinary being—and that they would have the great fortune to serve him.

"Is this the place you want us to design, Senior?" Leng Ning asked nervously.

"Correct. This is it. Do you think you can help me transform this place?" Zhong Qing asked with a smile.

"Yes, absolutely."

The women quickly agreed.

By this point, how could they possibly say no? Even if they couldn't handle it themselves, they'd call in reinforcements from the sect to get it done.

"Excellent."

"Then let me explain my general requirements."

Zhong Qing pulled out the rough draft he'd been planning for quite some time and shared his vision with the two women.

Basically, he wanted mountains, water, and greenery.

The two women proved to be true professionals. After learning Zhong Qing's requirements, they combined feng shui principles with the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams of construction, and quickly produced a design plan.

"Excellent."

Looking at the plan, Zhong Qing was very satisfied.

"From now on, this space is yours to work with. Starting now, you may freely enter and exit this small world. When you need labor, just ask Heibai." Zhong Qing instructed.

"Yes."

The two women didn't dare refuse. With serious expressions, they began their preparatory work.

After handing off the project to them, Zhong Qing finally exited the small world.

He reclined on a lounger in the courtyard and began sipping tea.

His small world had excellent features. It could be carried with him—wherever Zhong Qing went, the small world went.

At the same time, he could also anchor it to a fixed point in space and set up an entrance, allowing free access just like a building.

Of course, outsiders wanting to enter still required his authorization.

"If only the range were a bit larger."

"And if only I could fully control this small world's laws."

Zhong Qing sighed softly.

Beyond controlling access, he could also control life within the small world. For instance, the two women currently inside—with a single thought, he could reduce them to dust.

But that was the extent of it. He couldn't use his will to change the small world's weather or terrain.

He wondered if the system would upgrade this feature in the future.

When Zhong Qing had discovered he could control life within the small world, he'd actually thought of another use for it.

Using it as a killing tool.

Trap an enemy inside the small space, then use the space's power of life and death to erase them.

But when Qingniao and the other woman entered the space, Zhong Qing realized it wouldn't be easy.

If the target resisted and wasn't weaker than him, it would be very difficult to pull off.

So it seemed.

This exploit wouldn't work.

For now, this small world could only serve as a mobile private garden and an absolute emergency escape route.

Time passed, and several days went by.

The two women worked diligently on transforming Zhong Qing's small world.

Zhong Qing would occasionally go in to check on progress. What he saw was that at the center of the small world, the women had already created a small lake.

On the other side of the lake, they had constructed a small mountain.

A waterfall cascaded down from the mountain. The lake water wasn't stagnant either—a stream connected the waterfall and the lake, circling the entire small world.

Within the flowing stream was a large water wheel. The current's force turned the wheel, and the wheel's rotation pumped the stream water back up the mountain to form the waterfall—creating a perpetual cycle.

It was practically a perpetual motion machine.

The stream's path wasn't random either—it appeared to form a spirit-gathering formation with feng shui properties for accumulating wind and gathering qi.

At the center of the spirit-gathering formation was a small cluster of buildings.

The building complex was well-organized, with storage areas, living quarters, and leisure zones all accounted for.

Clearly, these two women knew their craft.

Zhong Qing was very satisfied.

This day, Lin Feng came respectfully before Zhong Qing.

"Master, I need to make a trip to Tianyun Sect next." Lin Feng clenched his fists. "I'm going to Tianyun Sect to defeat Murong Xue in a single strike!"

"Disciple, I've told you—whatever you want to do on this trip down the mountain, do it. Master will be with you the whole way." Zhong Qing patted Lin Feng's shoulder encouragingly.

During these days at the Lin family, Zhong Qing had come to understand the history between the Lin and Murong families.

Once upon a time, the Lin family had been one of Fengtian City's first-tier families, while the Murong family had been merely third-tier.

Then one day, Murong Xue's grandfather had offended a powerful being who came to annihilate the Murong family.

Because the Murong and Lin families had always been on good terms—especially their ancestors, who had been close friends after fleeing disaster together and settling here—the Murong family desperately begged for help.

Bound by these connections, the Lin family sent troops to assist.

That battle.

The Murong family was nearly destroyed. The Lin family also lost more than half its experts, but together they finally eliminated the enemy.

Though the Lin family was severely weakened, they had been the local hegemon. They could still hold their position in Fengtian City, and even helped the Murong family get back on track.

That period marked the peak of the two families' relationship.

It was also then that the two families made an agreement: if both bloodlines produced sons, they would become sworn brothers; if both produced daughters, they would become sworn sisters.

If one was male and one female, the two would marry, generation after generation.

In Lin Hanyi's generation, both bloodlines produced sons. So from childhood, Lin Hanyi and the Murong family head—Murong Xue's father, Murong Hai—became sworn brothers.

When Lin Feng and Murong Xue were born, under both families' eager anticipation, the two were engaged at just a few years old.

Everyone thought this would mark the beginning of the two families growing even closer.

No one expected it would mark the beginning of their falling out.
