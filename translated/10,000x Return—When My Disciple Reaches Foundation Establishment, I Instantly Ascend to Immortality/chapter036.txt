Chapter 36: Moon Profound Demon Beast Eyeballs—We Brought Them Back

"Mm? Do you have something to say?" Elder Yidao looked at Qingniao.

Everyone in the hall also turned their gazes to her.

In such a setting, even though Qingniao's status among the younger generation was respectable, she couldn't help feeling nervous under everyone's scrutiny.

Under everyone's watchful eyes, she twisted the storage ring on her finger and pulled out six jade bottles.

"Moon Profound demon beast eyeballs. My sister and I brought them back."

"Six of them."

"And they're mid Moon Profound."

When Qingniao finished speaking, the entire hall erupted in shock.

"What?"

Elder Yidao was the most excited. He lunged forward and grabbed a jade bottle to examine.

Inside the semi-transparent jade bottle, an eyeball was perfectly preserved.

"Well? Elder Yidao, are they really mid Moon Profound eyeballs?" Zhuge Qing asked urgently.

With Elder Yidao's experience, he could identify them instantly. What Qingniao said was true—these really were mid Moon Profound demon beast eyeballs.

He nodded solemnly at Zhuge Qing.

And with his nod, everyone showed expressions of excitement, their gazes sweeping uniformly toward the two women.

"Hahaha! You two have rendered a great service to our Myriad Dao Mountain!"

Zhuge Qing didn't hold back his praise.

The other elders were similarly effusive, showering both women with compliments.

Because these Moon Profound demon beast eyeballs were exactly what they needed most.

After all, Elder Yidao's status at Myriad Dao Mountain was extremely high. The Five Malice Formation he'd developed would definitely be invaluable in the fight against Heavenly Calamity.

All the praise left the two women embarrassed.

But being able to help the sect made them very happy.

"But how did you two obtain these? And six of them at that?" Zhuge Qing asked, voicing everyone's confusion.

Everyone looked at them inquiringly.

After all, even they weren't confident they could obtain eyeballs from beasts of this level.

Even late Moon Profound cultivators might get injured from the death throes of such a demon beast.

"Reporting to Sect Master, a certain senior gave them to us." Leng Ning stood and answered respectfully.

"A senior gave them to you?"

Everyone was incredulous.

What kind of senior would give them something so precious?

These eyeballs from beasts of this level, besides being useful for formations, had numerous other applications. They were, without exaggeration, priceless.

The two women nodded solemnly, then recounted the entire experience to everyone present.

Everyone who heard it found it unbelievable.

"To kill a mid Moon Profound demon beast with a single leaf, and to have a Moon Profound attendant—this person must certainly be at Sun Profound." Zhuge Qing concluded.

"That's not all, Sect Master. That Senior Zhong Qing also has his own Small World." Qingniao couldn't help adding.

"A Small World of his own?"

Hearing this, everyone was shocked again.

"Then either this person's background is extraordinary, or his cultivation is terrifyingly high!"

Zhuge Qing elaborated. "Regardless, the fact that you've formed a good connection with such an existence is your fortune. You've done very well this time, and you've rendered a great service to the sect. Once we've dealt with Heavenly Calamity, I'll reward you properly."

"Thank you, Sect Master."

The two women quickly expressed their gratitude.

Remembering something, Leng Ning added, "By the way, Sect Master, Master, esteemed Elders—when we left, that senior gave us each a wooden figurine."

"We originally thought these figurines were just keepsakes. But on our way back, we somehow triggered something, and the figurines suddenly glowed and launched an attack skyward. And as bad luck would have it, we accidentally killed a passerby."

"Suddenly launched an attack and killed a passerby?"

Everyone in the hall was flabbergasted by this dramatic turn of events.

They also silently mourned for that poor soul's terrible luck.

"Let me see those figurines." Zhuge Qing said quickly.

The two women didn't hesitate and immediately produced the figurines.

For a time, all of Myriad Dao Mountain's leadership studied these two figurines.

But though Myriad Dao Mountain had expertise in such techniques, and even had members who practiced puppet arts...

After thorough examination, no one could find anything special.

No matter how they looked, these figurines appeared completely ordinary.

"Are you sure you saw these figurines launch an attack?" Zhuge Qing asked incredulously.

"Sect Master, we're absolutely certain." Qingniao said urgently. "We saw it attack with our own eyes."

"Then what level of power did the attack possess?" Zhuge Qing couldn't help asking.

"Well..."

The two women exchanged glances and shook their heads. "We couldn't tell. Besides a light wave, there was no aura. It could have been Dawn Profound, or Star Profound, or perhaps even Moon Profound."

"We don't know what cultivation the victim had either. We only learned the attack had hit someone after he was already dead."

"Well, perhaps this figurine uses techniques unknown to us. After all, the world is full of wonders. You two should keep these figurines for now." Zhuge Qing said.

"By the way, Sect Master, we also brought the body back," Leng Ning added. "Since we accidentally killed him, we felt terrible about it. We thought we'd bring the body back, investigate his identity, then return his remains to his family and offer compensation and apologies."

"Deal with that after the Heavenly Calamity matter is resolved." Zhuge Qing said. At this critical moment, he really had no mental energy to spare for such things.

"Yes, Sect Master."

The two women understood the priorities. After putting away the figurines, they sat back down.

With the meeting concluded.

All of Myriad Dao Mountain mobilized. Many disciples were secretly sent away.

After sending them off, all of Myriad Dao Mountain's formations were kept constantly active, and no one was permitted to enter or leave.

Beyond that, the elders brought out their hidden techniques, making final preparations.

And the Five Malice Formation, led by Elder Yidao, was urgently deployed with everyone's cooperation.

Finally, the day before Heavenly Calamity was to attack, the Five Malice Formation was complete.

Another day passed.

The day Heavenly Calamity had proclaimed he would assault Myriad Dao Mountain had finally arrived!

All of Myriad Dao Mountain stood ready.

Everyone who could fight stood in the great hall, weapons in hand.

Many more were stationed at formations, controlling them to respond to any situation.
