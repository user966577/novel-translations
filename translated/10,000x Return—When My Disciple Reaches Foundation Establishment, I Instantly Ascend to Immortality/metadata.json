  "synopsis": "Zhong Qing transmigrated into a cultivation world and spent five years as a talentless waste on Command Hall Peak, the most desolate of Immortal River Sect's seven peaks. His only inheritance from his late master, Daoist Nai, was the Peak Master title and a daily check-in system that rewarded everything except cultivation—Saint-grade methods he burned for warmth, divine weapons he used as kitchen tools.\n\nThen the system finally activates a new feature: the Trash Bond. By taking disciples who are complete wastes like himself, his disciples gain 100x cultivation speed while he receives 10,000x returns. When his first disciple cultivates for a day, Zhong Qing gains the equivalent of nearly 300 years of cultivation.\n\nThe sect that looked down on him, the Peak Masters who mocked him, and the geniuses who dismissed him are about to discover that Command Hall Peak's 'trash' has been hiding a mountain of treasures all along.",
