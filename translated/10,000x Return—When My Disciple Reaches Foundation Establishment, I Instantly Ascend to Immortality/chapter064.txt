Chapter 64: Worthy of a Reincarnated Saint's Character

Outside the secret realm!

Whether it was Lu Qingxia, Su Wenjiu, or the Dawn Mist Valley elders, all were waiting anxiously.

"Could... could something have gone wrong? There's been no movement for so long!"

An elder's face was anxious, his expression uneasy.

"Sect Master, it seems the person you invited simply doesn't have the ability to break this formation. Quite possibly, he's even gotten himself trapped inside."

Someone offered their speculation.

"If you ask me, if you don't have the ability, don't take on the job."

"Now look—not only is he stuck in there himself, but he's delayed the time we have left to rescue the Third Ancestor."

Various voices of doubt echoed endlessly.

"Enough!"

Lu Qingxia spoke angrily.

"Everything must follow a process."

"As the saying goes, ice three feet thick doesn't freeze in a single day."

"This formation is profound and mysterious—doesn't breaking it require time?"

"Senior came to help us, asking for no compensation to rescue our Dawn Mist Valley's Third Ancestor."

"Even if he fails, it would still be an immense favor to our Dawn Mist Valley."

"Now you're asked to wait a little, and you can't bear it."

"One by one with your sarcasm and snide remarks—is this the behavior of a gentleman?"

"If you have the ability, do it yourselves!"

Seeing that Lu Qingxia was truly angry.

Everyone shut their mouths and fell silent.

But in their hearts, they felt there was really no need to keep waiting like this.

A predetermined outcome, unless a miracle occurred, would remain unchanged no matter how long they waited.

However, in the next moment!

A figure strolled out from within the formation.

This person was none other than Zhong Qing.

His appearance nearly blinded the eyes of some Dawn Mist Valley elders.

One might even call it horrifying.

After Dawn Mist Valley learned that the Third Ancestor was trapped in the secret realm.

Many in the Holy Land had conducted detailed research on this formation.

The conclusion was that once the formation activated, one could only enter, not exit.

To get out, one would have to completely destroy the formation.

Yet now, Zhong Qing's appearance was wildly reshaping their worldview.

It was as shocking as a staunch materialist watching Newton's coffin lid fly open.

"Se... Senior, are you alright!"

Lu Qingxia naturally understood this principle.

As a result, even her speech became somewhat unsteady.

"What could happen to me?"

Zhong Qing waved his hand dismissively.

He had to admit, this Formation-Immune Physique was truly domineering.

A thousand formations, ten thousand obstacles—he walked through them all as if on flat ground.

"May I ask, Senior, did you see our Dawn Mist Valley's Third Ancestor!"

Lu Qingxia asked carefully again.

"Of course I did!"

Upon these words, everyone's gazes converged on him.

"Rest assured! I brought him out safe and sound!"

"Brought him out?"

"Where is he?"

"How come we don't see him?"

Everyone searched the surroundings, but apart from Zhong Qing, there was no sign of anyone else.

Zhong Qing had no intention of keeping them in suspense.

The door to the small world opened.

The next moment, Zhong Changfeng walked out.

"He... he's really out!"

At this moment, the Dawn Mist Valley elders' hearts were in turmoil.

To be honest, aside from Sect Master Lu Qingxia and Su Wenjiu, none of the other elders had held much hope that Zhong Qing could actually rescue the Third Ancestor.

Especially when Zhong Qing had directly entered the formation.

In their view, that was no different from seeking death.

Yet who could have imagined.

Even so, he had emerged completely unscathed, and moreover, he had actually brought their Third Ancestor out.

"What kind of technique is this?"

"If I'm not mistaken, that appears to be a small world!"

"Heavens! Where did the Sect Master find such a great figure? He actually carries a small world with him."

"Didn't the Saintess say at the previous gathering? There's a hidden powerhouse concealed in Immortal River Sect, a Peak Master there. It seems the Saintess spoke the truth—this truly is an existence beyond imagination!"

"How laughable that we earlier doubted him. A great master right before our eyes, yet we were blind to it—truly foolish beyond measure."

The Dawn Mist Valley elders exchanged messages secretly, their expressions quite a sight.

There was wild joy at the Third Ancestor's rescue, shock at the unfathomable depths Zhong Qing had displayed, and also some shame and embarrassment.

Compared to the elders' colorful expressions, Su Wenjiu held her head high, like a proud white swan.

She had known that Zhong Qing was unfathomably deep and would surely be able to rescue the Third Ancestor.

Now everything proved her words true.

This was quite an accomplishment.

As for Lu Qingxia, though she strove to maintain her dignity as Sect Master, judging by her constantly upturned lips, she was in excellent spirits.

When she had invited Zhong Qing and told the elders he would be the main force in rescuing the Third Ancestor, she had naturally faced much opposition.

It was she who had overruled all dissent and settled the matter with her authority.

Looking at the outcome, this matter had undoubtedly greatly strengthened her authority.

From now on, her voice as Sect Master would rise to another level.

Among those present, each had their own thoughts.

But the happiest was undoubtedly Zhong Changfeng.

Originally, he had already prepared to meet death.

Who could have imagined.

When all seemed lost, a new path appeared.

Because of Zhong Qing's appearance, he had survived.

At this moment, Zhong Changfeng's complexion was much better than when Zhong Qing had first found him.

The look he gave Zhong Qing was filled with gratitude.

"Benefactor, please come stay at Dawn Mist Valley for a few days and allow me to fulfill my duties as a host."

Upon hearing this, Lu Qingxia also spoke solemnly: "Senior, you've worked hard these past days."

"Today marks the Third Ancestor's day of liberation. Our Dawn Mist Valley wishes to hold a grand banquet and celebrate with the entire sect."

"Might Senior grace us with your presence at the feast?"

The elders all looked at Zhong Qing expectantly.

Very much hoping he would agree.

Before, when they hadn't known of Zhong Qing's power, that was one thing.

Now that they knew he was this extraordinary.

Everyone naturally wanted to build a good relationship with him.

However, Zhong Qing declined.

"I appreciate your kind intentions."

"But I won't attend the banquet."

"Now that mundane matters are concluded, I should return."

"Until we meet again, everyone!"

As he spoke, Zhong Qing had already transformed into a streak of light and departed gracefully through the sky.

"Truly a senior of great mastery!"

"Following his heart, free and unfettered."

Lu Qingxia sighed, her eyes gaining a touch of admiration.

She had wanted to take the opportunity to present him with the Emperor-grade cultivation method.

Though Zhong Qing had said he didn't want it, she couldn't simply not offer it.

Who would have thought that he was truly unmoved by such a treasure.

From beginning to end, he had never asked for even the slightest compensation.

Such character was worthy of a reincarnated saint.
