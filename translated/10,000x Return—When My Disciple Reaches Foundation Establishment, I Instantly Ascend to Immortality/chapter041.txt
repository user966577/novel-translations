Chapter 41: Once You Step onto the Arena, It's Life or Death

So while golden talent was indeed exceptional.

It all depended on who you were standing before.

Before a truly supreme powerhouse, it meant nothing.

"Hmph, you want me to expel Xue'er from Heavenly Cloud Sect with just a word? Since you say you're not joking, fine, then let me ask you—what exactly is the reason? If you can't give me a proper explanation, don't blame me for being discourteous."

Wu Yun was still furious.

Murong Xue was the most prized disciple he had ever had in his lifetime.

Others couldn't praise her enough, yet this Zhuge Qing had the audacity to tell him to cut ties with her.

In his view, Zhuge Qing was simply jealous that Heavenly Cloud Sect had such an outstanding disciple.

"I'll be honest with you—she's offended someone she shouldn't have. The karma attached to her may bring disaster upon your entire Heavenly Cloud Sect." Zhuge Qing spoke with utmost gravity.

"Hahahaha."

But hearing Zhuge Qing's words, Wu Yun burst into laughter.

"Offended someone she shouldn't have?"

"Who could Xue'er possibly have offended at her young age?"

"Besides, with my Heavenly Cloud Sect here, who could do anything to her?"

"I'll tell you straight—even if it were people from the Holy Lands, we Heavenly Cloud Sect wouldn't be afraid."

"Very well, very well. I hope you remember what you said today. In any case, I've already warned you. Whether you believe it or not is your business—you'll bear the consequences yourselves."

Zhuge Qing's expression turned ugly as well. It was only out of respect for the years of friendship between Myriad Dao Mountain and Heavenly Cloud Sect that he'd bothered to give this warning.

He had already done his due diligence. There was no need to say more.

This wasn't his affair anyway.

With that said.

Zhuge Qing prepared to leave with the Grand Elder.

"Wait."

From behind came Wu Yun's voice.

Zhuge Qing turned his head to look at him.

"My Heavenly Cloud Sect has developed to this day, and our foundations are beyond what your little Myriad Dao Mountain can imagine. Whatever your intentions, Heavenly Cloud Sect's affairs are none of your Myriad Dao Mountain's concern."

"As for formation repairs, we won't be troubling your Myriad Dao Mountain in the future."

With that.

Wu Yun gave a cold snort and turned to leave with a sweep of his sleeves.

"Good, good, good..."

Zhuge Qing was so angry his teeth ground together. Wu Yun's words made it clear—because of this matter, he was completely cutting ties with Myriad Dao Mountain.

He had warned them out of genuine goodwill, only to be resented for it.

"I'd like to see, when you truly offend that senior, whether you can still be as tough as you are now."

With an angry snort, Zhuge Qing similarly swept his robes and left with the Grand Elder.

"Sigh, Sect Master, this matter..."

In mid-air, the Grand Elder shook his head and sighed. He really didn't want to see this outcome, and couldn't help but ask, "Actually, why didn't you explain Senior Zhong's situation to Wu Yun, to prove you weren't lying?"

Zhuge Qing was both amused and exasperated by the Grand Elder's question.

"Why should I explain to him? Why should I prove anything to him?"

"It's not Myriad Dao Mountain's affair, and I gain nothing from it. What does it have to do with me?"

"Not to mention, saying too much risks offending that senior. It's a thankless effort!"

"Besides, if we could gather intelligence from Heaven's Mandate City, how hard would it be for Heavenly Cloud Sect to find out? They're just too arrogant to care, too lazy to even investigate!"

"Sect Master thinks of everything."

The Grand Elder nodded in heartfelt agreement.

"I only hope that when that day truly comes, Heavenly Cloud Sect will know when to yield."

Zhuge Qing glanced back at the gradually fading Heavenly Cloud Sect, shook his head, and sped up his return to Myriad Dao Mountain.

Heaven's Mandate City.

The Lin Family.

Zhong Qing reclined on a lounge chair while Lin Feng practiced his profound techniques nearby.

Profound techniques.

As the name suggested, these were cultivation skills. They too were ranked from low to high, following the same grading system as cultivation methods.

In actual combat, possessing higher-grade profound techniques often gave one an advantage.

Of course, cultivating profound techniques also had requirements.

The higher the grade, the higher the threshold.

With Lin Feng's current Dawn Profound cultivation, he barely met the minimum requirements to learn the lowest-grade profound techniques Zhong Qing possessed.

Of course.

Besides profound techniques, Zhong Qing had also given Lin Feng many protective items.

Such as wooden figurines.

Whether auto-defensive ones or those that could be activated for combat, Zhong Qing had given him a whole sack of each.

Setting aside their master-disciple bond, Lin Feng was still his experience goldmine.

So Zhong Qing couldn't allow anything to happen to Lin Feng.

Time flew by.

Soon it was nearly time for Lin Feng to go to Heavenly Cloud Sect.

Zhong Qing took Lin Feng to bid farewell to the Lin family, then set off for Heavenly Cloud Sect.

On the appointed day of the challenge, the two finally arrived at the foot of Heavenly Cloud Sect's mountain.

"You must be Lin Feng?"

"Here to challenge the Saintess today?"

At the mountain gate, a Heavenly Cloud Sect steward had been waiting. He gave Zhong Qing a sidelong glance, then sneered, "I never thought you'd actually have the guts to come court death."

"What did you say?"

Zhong Qing frowned, his icy gaze falling on the steward.

The steward flinched back two steps under Zhong Qing's stare.

But he showed no fear and instead sneered, "What, you want to attack me?"

"If I'm not mistaken, you must be this kid's master—the one who supposedly killed a mid Moon Profound demonic beast. I won't deny you have some skill, but don't forget this is Heavenly Cloud Sect. Keep a civil attitude."

"Otherwise, you won't even know how you died."

But before his words had even faded.

Zhong Qing struck without a word, sending a palm strike directly at him.

"What, you actually dare attack me??"

"This is Heavenly Cloud Sect! Are you tired of living?!!"

"Stop... ahh... ahhh..."

Under his terrified and disbelieving gaze, Zhong Qing slapped him into a pulp with a single palm.

The massive sonic boom echoed throughout the mountain gate.

"What?"

"He actually killed Steward Fang at our Heavenly Cloud Sect's gates!"

This scene immediately attracted countless people's attention. Everyone cried out in shock—no one had ever been bold enough to kill someone at Heavenly Cloud Sect's entrance.

"Is there no one in authority at Heavenly Cloud Sect who will come out?"

Yet facing these hostile gazes, Zhong Qing showed no fear. He looked up toward Heavenly Cloud Sect's interior, his voice rolling out like thunder.

"Such audacity, daring to cause trouble at my Heavenly Cloud Sect."

In mere moments, Sect Master Wu Yun emerged from the sect with several elders, stepping through the air to surround Zhong Qing and Lin Feng.

"I need an explanation."

Wu Yun glanced at the steward who had been reduced to pulp, his face dark as he stared at Zhong Qing.

"Your Heavenly Cloud Sect showed poor hospitality, sending a mere Star Profound ant to prattle insolently before me. I simply helped your esteemed sect clean house." Zhong Qing replied with a cold smile. "So, is there a problem?"

"Such a silver tongue—you kill someone and somehow make it sound justified. I think you're courting death."

Beside Wu Yun, an elder's expression darkened. He raised his hand to attack Zhong Qing.

But at the last moment, Wu Yun stopped him.

"Sect Master, why are you stopping me?" The elder asked, confused.

"Anyone who dares cause trouble at my Heavenly Cloud Sect has never left alive. Since he's already dead, why hurry this moment?" Wu Yun narrowed his eyes. "But I can see that Xue'er has always viewed this former engagement as a stain, something that weighs on her heart. If she can't remove this stain herself, I fear it may affect her future mental state."

"So let Xue'er deal with this stain herself. We can eliminate that kid afterward."

"Sect Master is wise."

The elder suddenly understood.

Murong Xue was now their treasure. They wouldn't allow even the slightest obstacle on her path forward.

"Let's get to the point." Wu Yun narrowed his eyes, speaking leisurely. "You're here about that engagement, to challenge Xue'er, correct?"

"I wanted to get straight to business, but you sent a dog out first to waste our time." Zhong Qing replied coldly.

A flash of killing intent appeared in Wu Yun's eyes, gone so quickly it was barely noticeable. He turned and said, "Very well, follow me."

Moments later.

Zhong Qing brought Lin Feng into Heavenly Cloud Sect, arriving at a place called the Life and Death Stage.

Standing at the head position.

Wu Yun looked down at Zhong Qing and his disciple.

"At my Heavenly Cloud Sect, there's no such thing as a friendly spar. If you want a challenge, it's life or death."

Wu Yun spoke coldly. "So once the battle begins, no matter what happens, no one else may interfere. Do you agree?"

"Fine."

Zhong Qing agreed on Lin Feng's behalf without hesitation.

Then he turned to Lin Feng beside him and said softly, "Disciple, did you hear that? Once you step onto the arena, it's life or death. They clearly never intended to let you leave alive."

"Yes, Master, I understand."

Lin Feng was someone who valued sentiment. Despite having already broken with the Murong family, he hadn't drawn swords against them.

He had been contemplating how to deal with Murong Xue in the end.

But he never expected that they had already decided to take his life through the rules themselves.

Since that was the case, he didn't need to hold back.
