Chapter 85: The Word "Fate"—Wonderfully Mysterious

This competition held no suspense.

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian crushed their opponents all the way through with overwhelming force, claiming first place amid the shocked, horrified, and admiring gazes of Immortal River Sect.

Zhong Qing wasn't surprised by this result.

If two Sun Profound cultivators somehow lost along the way, now that would be strange.

What followed was a long and tedious closing ceremony.

Zhong Qing had absolutely no interest in such things.

Once he knew the final result, he left.

Rather than sitting there wasting time, he might as well go down the mountain and buy some wine—that sounded much more interesting.

Wind scattered clouds, yellow dust swirled across the sky.

Zhong Qing descended the mountain, passed through an ancient road, and arrived at a mortal city.

On the streets, there were quite a few passersby, an endless stream of traffic.

These people—some were wandering knights, some were merchants, some were porters and peddlers—people from all walks of life.

Though this was a world where the strong were revered and cultivation reigned supreme...

Among the vast masses, those with cultivation talent were ultimately few.

Most people still toiled and rushed about for their three daily meals.

There was a wine house!

The small establishment was doing brisk business, nearly every seat taken.

"Sir, please come in!"

When Zhong Qing arrived at the wine house entrance, a waiter greeted him with a professional smile.

"Two pounds of Drunken Blossom brew, three pounds of braised beef, a plate of peanuts, and two pounds of marinated pig's trotters!"

The shop was old!

And Zhong Qing could count himself a regular.

Before long, all the wine and food he'd ordered was served.

Drinking wine, eating meat, listening to traveling merchants from all directions talk about strange tales from far and wide.

This kind of life had its own special flavor.

Just then, an old beggar appeared at the entrance.

"Shoo, shoo, shoo!"

"A beggar like you—don't dirty my master's floor or offend my customers' eyes."

Before the old beggar could enter, he was being chased off by an errand boy.

The old beggar bared his teeth and protested indignantly: "Others can enter, why can't I?"

The errand boy stood with hands on hips, glaring coldly: "You got money?"

One sentence—like a soul-searching question—stopped the old beggar dead in his tracks.

Under the heavens, how many heart-piercing words are born in just such plain, unvarnished circumstances?

After his momentary daze, the old beggar rubbed his hands together and said with an ingratiating smile: "Young fellow, I may not have money, but I've got some treasures here—good stuff you couldn't buy even with money."

As he spoke, he pulled several manuals from his robe.

"I can see you have remarkable bone structure, with a spiritual light emanating from your crown."

"You're excellent material for cultivation."

"Meeting is fate—pick any one of these manuals, and I guarantee you can embark on the path of cultivation."

"Honest price: two jugs of wine. How about it?"

Inside the wine house, Zhong Qing was amused.

This old beggar was quite the character.

The routine, the scenario—it all gave him a sense of déjà vu.

At the entrance, the errand boy's expression instantly darkened.

Any cultivation manual, placed in the mundane world, would be a priceless treasure beyond measure.

Every manual was a closely guarded secret of the great sects and families. Even if some incomplete remnants occasionally leaked out, they'd be jealously hoarded by the wealthy and powerful.

Such things weren't something common folk like them could ever possess.

Now this old beggar was opening with cultivation techniques, holding a whole stack of them.

What, was this some kind of cultivation technique wholesale depot?

Obviously they had to be fake.

The old beggar was clearly using worthless books to insult his intelligence!

"Old man, I'm warning you one last time—leave now."

"If you don't, don't blame me for being rude."

His tone turned hostile.

"Ah, ah, let's talk this out nicely. Why are you getting angry?"

"These are the genuine article."

"Think carefully—pass up this village, and you won't find this shop again!"

The old beggar said meaningfully.

Inside the noisy wine house, a harsh, barking voice rang out:

"Gui-san'er! Can't you see how many customers there are? What are you wasting time with some beggar for?"

"You want to get fired? Then scram!"

Gui-san'er cried out in protest at the injustice.

"Boss, it's not that I'm slacking off."

"This old beggar keeps insisting on trading cultivation manuals for wine!"

The moment these words came out, the whole place erupted in roaring laughter.

What a strange world—something new every year, especially this year.

They'd heard of pawning antiques or valuables for wine.

But trading cultivation manuals for wine? This was truly a first.

Well, here was something new—like a knife opening a butt, they'd really seen it all today.

The boss was clearly impatient, waving his hand dismissively.

"Just a lousy beggar. Beat him out with sticks."

"Don't let him disturb the customers' enjoyment."

As his words fell, four or five fierce-looking toughs immediately charged out.

"Stop!"

Zhong Qing couldn't watch any longer.

"I'll pay for his wine!"

As Zhong Qing spoke, the boss instantly changed his tune.

"Right this way, sir!"

Hearing this, the old beggar strode proudly into the wine house.

Then, as if he owned the place, he settled down beside Zhong Qing.

With a beaming grin, he said: "Thanks, young friend!"

"Seeing as you're so warm-hearted and kind, I won't take advantage of you."

"I've got nine manuals here, all top-quality cultivation techniques."

"How about you pick one, and we'll call it even for the two jugs of wine?"

Zhong Qing could tell at a glance that the old man's manuals were genuine.

And every one was a fine piece—ninth-grade techniques, all of them.

This surprised him slightly.

A ninth-grade technique was enough to serve as a foundational method for a second-tier sect.

For someone to casually produce such techniques—this was no ordinary person.

He immediately used his Heavenly Eye to examine the old beggar.

The man's information and secrets were instantly clear to him.

This left him mildly surprised.

He hadn't expected the beggar to have such a background.

But he didn't dwell on it.

After a moment's thought, he said: "Meeting is fate—no need for the manuals."

"Your wine today is on me!"

"All you can drink!"

Hearing this, the old beggar didn't look pleased—rather, he scratched his head anxiously.

"Oh dear, young friend, you must think like those fools that these manuals are fake."

"Let me tell you..."

Before he could finish, Zhong Qing laughed: "Drinking wine is about the mood. If you can't even enjoy the mood, what's the point of discussing anything else?"

"Come, let's drain this cup!"

This attitude caught the old beggar off guard.

He smacked his lips: "Those words have some meaning."

"Young friend, just for that, this old beggar will gladly call you friend."

"Come, this old beggar toasts you!"

The ways people connect can be wonderfully mysterious.

Some know each other for decades, even centuries, yet remain like strangers.

Others can become friends over a single cup of wine.

The word "fate"—wonderfully mysterious indeed.
