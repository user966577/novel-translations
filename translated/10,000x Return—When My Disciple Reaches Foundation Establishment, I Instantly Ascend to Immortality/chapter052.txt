Chapter 52: An Immortal Emperor Reborn

"Casually producing eight King-grade cultivation methods..."

"In one month's time, bringing someone with white-grade talent from nothing to Dawn Profound Realm..."

"Making Myriad Dao Mountain act like that..."

"Killing the Red-Haired Ghost with a single finger..."

"Instantly slaying a mid-Moon Profound three-headed wolf demon with a single leaf..."

"Then engaging in battle within the top-tier Heavenly Cloud Sect and escaping unscathed..."

Xuanyuan Hong recalled everything that had happened around Zhong Qing recently, pacing with his hands behind his back in deep thought.

Others might not know.

But he knew perfectly well that Zhong Qing's bone age was only eighteen.

He had come up the mountain a few years ago as just a young lad, and Xuanyuan Hong had practically watched Zhong Qing grow up.

Every recent event surrounding Zhong Qing—if it had happened to some ancient monster, he wouldn't have been this surprised.

But for it to happen to someone with a bone age of just seventeen or eighteen was simply bizarre.

Because no matter how talented you were, it simply wasn't possible at this age.

Yet here it was—the impossible happening right before their eyes.

What kind of person was this?

What unknown secrets was he hiding?

This wasn't just Xuanyuan Hong's confusion—it was everyone's confusion.

"Gasp!"

"I remember now!"

Just then, the Third Elder in the crowd suddenly exclaimed, sucking in cold air, standing there with widened eyes and trembling, as if he had thought of some earth-shattering possibility.

The Third Elder's appearance immediately made Xuanyuan Hong and the others nervous.

"Third Elder, tell us quickly—what did you remember?"

Everyone looked at the Third Elder.

"Have you all seen a certain possibility recorded in the ancient texts?"

The Third Elder began to excitedly recount: "A hundred thousand years ago, a genius figure appeared in the Southern Wasteland of the continent. Legend has it that he reached Dawn Profound in half a month, Moon Profound in three months, and advanced to Earth and Sky Profound within a year. At just a teenager's age, he had already mastered various advanced formations, alchemy, and numerous high-level Profound Techniques."

Hearing the Third Elder's words, Xuanyuan Hong instantly remembered and exclaimed, "Are you talking about the Wasteland Lord who later unified the Southern Wasteland and achieved the Immortal Emperor realm?"

"Exactly! That's him!"

The Third Elder nodded solemnly, then continued in a drawn-out voice, "Sect Master, do you know why he was so extraordinarily talented?"

"It's because this Wasteland Lord didn't cultivate normally at all—he was originally an Immortal Emperor who had simply been reborn."

Xuanyuan Hong recalled from the ancient texts and responded point by point.

But as soon as he finished speaking, he realized something and let out a sharp cry.

His body jumped up, disregarding all dignity. "Holy crap! Are you saying Zhong Qing is also a reborn Immortal Emperor?!"

"Exactly!"

The Third Elder responded solemnly.

And as this news dropped.

It stirred up thousand-foot waves in everyone's hearts.

Immortal Emperor.

A reborn Immortal Emperor!

This was too explosive!

Xuanyuan Hong and the others felt their breathing quicken until they could barely catch their breath.

And at this moment, Xuanyuan Hong remembered another crucial piece of information.

Zhong Qing had once told him that the cultivation method he practiced was an Imperial-grade cultivation method.

What kind of person could possess an Imperial-grade cultivation method?

Only an Immortal Emperor could possibly have one!

Thinking about it this way.

It was confirmed.

Zhong Qing was a reborn Immortal Emperor!

And if Zhong Qing was a reborn Immortal Emperor, then all those unbelievable feats he had displayed suddenly made sense.

For a moment.

Xuanyuan Hong and the others were excited beyond words.

Their little Immortal River Sect had actually produced a reborn Immortal Emperor!

And such an existence, given time, would return to his peak.

Then what would their Immortal River Sect become, as a sect that produced an Immortal Emperor?

The Holy Lands of the Eastern Region?

They were nothing!

In the future, Immortal River Sect was destined to become the top power on this entire continent.

"Hahahaha..."

"Old Nai, oh Old Nai! I wonder what expression you'd have if you knew the disciple you brought back was a reborn Immortal Emperor!"

Before he knew it, Xuanyuan Hong was standing ramrod straight, smiling so wide his mouth couldn't close.

The other elders were similarly excited and jumping around.

Not that they could be blamed.

A reborn Immortal Emperor was enough to make them act like this—or even more irrationally.

However.

Just as the Immortal River Sect members were caught up in their excitement, at the entrance of the great hall, one of Xuanyuan Hong's close personal attendants slowly narrowed his eyes.

"Immortal Emperor... reborn, is it?"

"When my soul drifted here, in a moment of crisis I had no choice but to possess a piece of trash for temporary shelter. But this trash's body simply cannot contain my soul, and my soul cannot survive long without a body. So all this time, I've been desperately searching for a new possession target."

"Yet every attempt at possession consumes my soul's power. So the final target will become my future body."

"Unfortunately, over these two months, I've found nothing but trash everywhere—not even half a body that meets my requirements."

"Never did I expect that this Command Hall Peak Master they speak of is actually a reborn Immortal Emperor."

"Heaven is truly helping me!"

This personal attendant couldn't help but lick his lips.

With his status, even when Zhong Qing killed the Red-Haired Ghost with a single finger, he had looked down on it without any thought of possessing Zhong Qing.

After all, once he possessed someone, due to soul limitations, he could only use that body forever.

The body's bone structure and background would greatly affect his future and recovery.

So Zhong Qing merely killing a Moon Profound cultivator and producing a few King-grade cultivation methods was quite impressive for this backwater place, but in his eyes, it really wasn't much.

But now, hearing new information about Zhong Qing and Xuanyuan Hong's speculation that Zhong Qing was a reborn Immortal Emperor, he suddenly became extraordinarily excited.

Because he had to admit—Xuanyuan Hong's reasoning made a lot of sense.

"At my peak, while there was still a huge gap between me and an Immortal Emperor, rebirth is still just rebirth. No matter how strong you were or how many tricks you have, right now you're just in a recovery period."

"And though I'm in soul form, going all out against you in your current state will definitely be enough."

"If I can possess the body of a reborn Immortal Emperor—gain his memories, obtain his techniques—then couldn't I also step into the Immortal Emperor realm in the future?"

"Just thinking about it is thrilling!"

As he thought about this, his excitement even surpassed that of Xuanyuan Hong and the others.

For him, this was a heaven-sent opportunity placed right before him.

An opportunity that could drive him mad!
