Chapter 65: The Holy Land's Specialties

Everyone watched Zhong Qing depart.

After a long while, someone finally reacted.

"Third Ancestor, are you alright!"

Someone carefully supported Zhong Changfeng, their face full of concern.

"I'm fine. If you hadn't invited such an expert this time, your Third Ancestor would most likely have perished here."

Zhong Changfeng sighed with emotion.

His words were filled with lingering fear.

"By the way, who is this great master?"

"The Eastern Region actually has such an extraordinary person?"

Though he had been rescued, he still felt as if he were in a dream.

This was an ancient great formation!

Yet the other party had come and gone freely.

Not only that, he also carried a small world with him.

The abilities glimpsed in that startled moment, upon reflection, were truly awe-inspiring.

It was hard to imagine just how terrifying his true strength and resources actually were.

"Third Ancestor, this person is the Peak Master of Immortal River Sect's Command Hall Peak."

Lu Qingxia looked away and replied.

"Immortal River Sect?"

"What kind of transcendent power is that?"

Clearly, Zhong Changfeng wasn't very familiar with the Eastern Region's powers.

He hadn't even heard of Immortal River Sect.

"Third Ancestor, Immortal River Sect isn't some transcendent power. At most, it's just a second-rate sect."

An elder's expression was peculiar.

"Second-rate?"

"Are you sure you haven't made a mistake?"

"A second-rate sect could produce such a transcendent existence?"

"Third Ancestor, there's absolutely no mistake!"

"This Senior is indeed from Immortal River Sect!"

On this matter, Su Wenjiu had the most authority to speak.

After all, among those present, she had known Zhong Qing the earliest.

She had also spent the most time in contact with Zhong Qing.

"If that's the case..."

Zhong Changfeng stroked his chin. After pondering for a moment, he said: "We should interact and visit with this Immortal River Sect more in the future."

"By the way, did you offer sufficient compensation for our benefactor's help this time?"

"We absolutely must not owe any favors to such an existence."

Lu Qingxia smiled wryly: "I previously offered an incomplete Emperor-grade cultivation manual, but this Senior wouldn't accept it."

"Is that so?"

Zhong Changfeng thought for a moment and said: "An Emperor-grade cultivation method, even just an incomplete manual, is certainly a supreme treasure to us."

"But to someone at his level, it probably doesn't even catch his eye."

"Someone like him has likely seen countless treasures."

"Even if we emptied our Holy Land's treasury, he probably wouldn't be interested."

"You could select some daily necessities and sect specialties to send over."

"Doesn't our sect have Treasure Tea? You could select several pounds to send."

"Also, didn't our sect bury a batch of Peach Blossom Brew?"

"It should be about a thousand years old by now!"

"After we return to the sect, I'll have them all dug up. You can send them over together."

Hearing this, the sect elders' mouths twitched.

That Treasure Tea was a supreme treasure of Dawn Mist Valley, a top-grade spiritual root.

It ripened once every hundred years!

Each harvest yielded only a few ounces.

Its spiritual effects were extraordinary—it could enhance aptitude, cleanse the body, and strengthen one's foundation.

It was truly a treasure difficult to find anywhere under heaven.

Even some of the sect's prodigies, after rendering great service, were only rewarded by the leaf.

Its preciousness was evident.

Yet now they were sending it by the pound.

The elders were quite pained by this.

Then there was that Peach Blossom Brew!

It was a miraculous creation carefully crafted by Dawn Mist Valley's Old Ancestor over several hundred years, collecting the essence of a hundred spiritual things.

Also known as the Drunken Immortal Brew!

Some elders had been fortunate enough to taste a sip, and that flavor could only be described as the finest under heaven.

For wine lovers, it was as precious as life itself.

"I wonder how the Old Ancestor will feel when she learns her wine has been given away like this. Will she be so heartbroken she shivers?"

An elder listening felt heartache on behalf of their Old Ancestor.

But no one said anything against it.

The grace of saving one's life was worth any amount of repayment.

Besides, once they built a good relationship with such a powerhouse, they would benefit as well.

After the group returned to the sect.

The entire Dawn Mist Valley held a grand feast for several days. Then Zhong Changfeng urged Sect Master Lu Qingxia to hurry and deliver the gifts.

Gift-giving was a matter of timing.

The sooner, the better!

If not for Zhong Changfeng's unrecovered body requiring recuperation.

He would have personally made the visit to express his gratitude!

Lu Qingxia didn't decline.

For ordinary people, gift-giving could be handled by sending just any disciple.

But was Zhong Qing an ordinary person?

For such an existence, having anyone below the Sect Master deliver gifts would be disrespectful to the senior master.

On the other side!

Just a few days after Zhong Qing returned to Command Hall Peak, Dawn Mist Valley's Sect Master Lu Qingxia personally arrived with a pile of gifts.

"Sect Master Lu, what is all this?"

Zhong Qing looked at the items she was pouring out of her storage bag.

Densely packed, they nearly formed a small mountain!

"Senior, I know you are a person of noble character. I wouldn't dare mention the Emperor-grade cultivation method again and sully your eyes."

"But these items are just some specialties from our sect."

"They represent our respect for Senior. Please don't refuse!"

With her words having reached this point.

Zhong Qing knew that refusing again would be slapping her face.

But are you sure this is just a token of respect and not a massive one?

"Very well, I'll accept them."

"Also, Senior, this is the Sect Master's token of our Dawn Mist Valley!"

"The bearer of this token is treated as the Sect Master."

"With authority to mobilize all disciples of our Dawn Mist Valley."

"Senior is transcendent and aloof, naturally unafraid of petty individuals."

"But living in the mortal world, it's inevitable that some blind fools might offend Senior's eyes."

"Our Dawn Mist Valley does have some influence in the Eastern Region."

"With this token, you can deter such petty individuals from disturbing Senior's peace!"

At this point, Lu Qingxia presented another token.

The token was palm-sized, shimmering in seven colors.

On the back were written the three characters "Dawn Mist Valley," along with an image of the Dawn Mist Valley Holy Land.

The front was engraved with the two characters "Sect Master."

Neither metal nor wood.

Ethereal light flowed across it, making it appear quite extraordinary.

Since Zhong Qing had already accepted the earlier "specialties."

He didn't mind this token either.

And her attitude had given him quite a favorable impression of Dawn Mist Valley.

These people were good to deal with!

They actually sent things when they said they would.

"I'll accept the gifts."

"If your Dawn Mist Valley encounters any difficulties in the future, you may notify me."

"If it's within my power to help, I'll lend a hand once."

Zhong Qing didn't make any grand promises.

But this promise alone made Lu Qingxia overjoyed.

In her view, Zhong Qing's strength was likely among the top in the entire continent.

With such a great figure's promise, Dawn Mist Valley had essentially gained a death-immunity talisman.

This gift was incredibly worth it.

"Thank you, Senior!"

Her face beamed with joy.

She gave Zhong Qing a solemn bow.

"No need for such courtesy!"

Zhong Qing waved his hand.

Then he invited: "It's already late, and it's mealtime."

"Why doesn't Sect Master Lu stay for a simple meal?"

Lu Qingxia cupped her hands: "Many matters at Dawn Mist Valley await my attention. I won't trouble Senior any further!"

"When Senior has leisure time in the future, you're welcome to visit our Dawn Mist Valley."

"Our Dawn Mist Valley will certainly sweep the path and welcome you warmly."

After some pleasantries, Lu Qingxia finally rose to take her leave.

Just as she had come in a hurry, she left in a hurry.

But she left with a smile.

She couldn't wait to see the expressions on those sect elders when they learned she had obtained a promise from Zhong Qing.

At that time, who wouldn't praise her as wise and brilliant, with outstanding leadership!
