Chapter 59: Formation-Immune Physique

Heibai's speed was fast. In no time, he had arrived in the small courtyard on Command Hall Peak.

Lu Qingxia grew even more puzzled!

An Earth Profound powerhouse—an existence comparable to the Old Ancestor of a Holy Land like Dawn Mist Valley?

Coming to a second-rate sect? What was his purpose!

With this confusion, Lu Qingxia brought Su Wenjiu and once again stepped into the small courtyard.

At this moment, Heibai stood in the courtyard.

His body straight as a peak.

Like an ancient pine.

As if waiting to be summoned!

"There must be something wrong with me!"

"An Earth Profound powerhouse is a distinguished guest wherever he goes."

"How can I use 'waiting to be summoned' to describe him?"

Lu Qingxia slapped her own face, mocking herself inwardly.

At the same time, she carefully observed this terrifying powerhouse.

Her thoughts churning endlessly.

What she was most curious about, naturally, was what he was doing here.

Could it be that Zhong Qing had some connection to this person?

Just then!

Zhong Qing stepped out from the inner courtyard.

Heibai stepped forward.

Kneeling on one knee, he said: "Master, I've retrieved the Mountain Treasure!"

This scene, this short sentence, stirred up boundless waves in Lu Qingxia's heart.

Raising ten-thousand-foot billows.

Her mind thundered.

As if ten thousand heavenly thunderbolts were exploding.

Her pupils violently contracted and expanded, as if her eyeballs were about to pop out.

After a long while, she repeated in disbelief.

"Mas... Mas... ter!"

An Earth Profound powerhouse was actually a servant.

An Earth Profound powerhouse actually called a second-rate sect's Peak Master his master.

She had thought there might be some connection between Zhong Qing and Heibai.

But she never dared imagine.

That their relationship was that of master and servant!

And that Zhong Qing was the master, and the Earth Profound powerhouse was the servant!

At this moment, this Dawn Mist Valley Sect Master—renowned for remaining composed even if Mount Tai collapsed before her eyes—Lu Qingxia, completely fell apart.

In contrast to her loss of composure.

Su Wenjiu was so excited her face turned red.

Her fists were clenched tight.

She nearly jumped up on the spot.

"Master, I told you!"

"This Senior Zhong Qing is a hidden supreme powerhouse."

"And his level is far more terrifying than I imagined."

"To have an Earth Profound powerhouse as a servant, his strength must be above Earth Profound."

"If we can get him to act, the Third Ancestor will be saved!"

At the same time!

On a treetop outside the courtyard.

Lin Feng, who was absorbing spiritual energy on the tree crown, slowly opened his eyes upon hearing this.

He scoffed, "How could Master be merely 'above Earth Profound'? He is a reincarnated Immortal Emperor."

"An existence that shook the ages!"

"These so-called Holy Land sects can't even see through one ten-thousandth of Master."

"Nothing more than this!"

If before, the Holy Land had been a sect he dared not even dream of.

An existence he looked up to.

Then at this moment!

The Holy Land's position in his heart had plummeted in a straight line.

Sword Elder in his ring agreed: "Isn't that right! The Eastern Region's Holy Lands might be towering giants in many people's hearts, unshakable existences."

"But before your master, if he were at his peak, they wouldn't even qualify to meet him."

At this moment in the courtyard!

Zhong Qing received the Mountain Treasure that Heibai presented.

He didn't stint on praise: "Well done!"

"Alright, you may withdraw!"

Heibai bowed respectfully and withdrew.

This casual summoning and dismissing.

Was like a level-twelve gale, buffeting the hearts of Lu Qingxia and her disciple.

They had no idea they had just been looked down upon.

But even if they knew, they probably wouldn't have time to care.

Because at this moment, their entire focus was on Zhong Qing.

Their hearts pounding wildly for him.

Purely from shock.

Zhong Qing waved Heibai away and looked at the master and disciple—one excited, one shocked—with some confusion on his face.

But with the Mountain Treasure in hand and the pill about to be complete, he had no time for them.

"My apologies, I have some urgent matters to attend to."

"How about I have my disciple entertain you two?"

"Se-Senior, please go ahead. Don't worry about us. We'll just sit here and wait!"

Lu Qingxia hastily said with a smile.

Even her form of address for Zhong Qing had changed.

To have an Earth Profound powerhouse as a servant, he deserved to be called "Senior."

"Then I thank you both for your understanding."

Zhong Qing smiled, nodded, and then turned to leave.

Time passed unnoticed—several hours went by.

The two waited until the sun had set!

The moon hung high on the branches.

Only then did they finally wait for Zhong Qing to finish his alchemy.

Whether it was her imagination or not!

Lu Qingxia and Su Wenjiu felt that Zhong Qing seemed more refined than before!

Even more transcendent and otherworldly!

Before they could offer compliments, they heard Zhong Qing say, "My apologies to you both. I've kept you waiting quite a while."

Lu Qingxia smiled and hastily said, "Senior, please don't worry about it. It's no trouble at all."

"But looking at your expressions, you probably didn't come to Command Hall Peak just to pass through." Zhong Qing then asked with curiosity. "May I ask what brings you two here?"

Seeing Zhong Qing had seen through them, Lu Qingxia didn't dare hide anything and immediately cupped her hands and explained honestly.

"Senior! To tell the truth, we master and disciple came specifically to request your assistance."

"Our Dawn Mist Valley's Third Ancestor is trapped in a deep Abyssal Secret Realm, his life hanging by a thread, in mortal peril."

"We desperately need a powerful master to come to his rescue!"

"If Senior is willing to help, our Dawn Mist Valley will offer an Emperor-grade incomplete cultivation manual as a gift."

To persuade Zhong Qing, she had gone all out!

An Emperor-grade cultivation method, even just an incomplete manual, was an extraordinarily precious existence for all of Dawn Mist Valley.

Something that could be passed down through generations.

In the outside world, it would be enough to cause a bloody storm.

Countless powerhouses would fight over it.

She believed that while Zhong Qing was extraordinary, the stronger one was, the more one desired and obsessed over such high-level cultivation methods.

However, upon hearing this, Zhong Qing was about to refuse.

He felt rather speechless inside.

This Emperor-grade cultivation method, even just an incomplete manual—he really didn't lack it.

Of course, more importantly, he had no dealings with Dawn Mist Valley. At most, he knew Su Wenjiu, and they couldn't even be called friends. Saving someone—this kind of troublesome matter—he really had no interest in.

Just then.

The system's voice suddenly sounded in his mind.

[System issues new mission!]

[Detected that Dawn Mist Valley Third Ancestor Zhong Changfeng is on his last breath. Save his life, and Host will receive Formation-Immunity Effect!]

Zhong Qing was surprised.

A mission had actually been triggered!

And the reward was Formation-Immunity Effect.

This ability was extremely overpowered!

After all, in this fantasy world, formations were everywhere. Many supreme powerhouses who entered formations could only meet their end with regret.

If he obtained Formation-Immunity, wouldn't he be able to treat formations as if they didn't exist in the future?

Thinking this, Zhong Qing, who was about to refuse, immediately changed his mind.

He said to Lu Qingxia and Su Wenjiu: "We can be considered fated. I'll accompany you on this trip!"

"As for compensation, forget about it."
