Chapter 3: The System's Super Reward

However.

The moment Zhong Qing's gaze swept over the crowd, everyone averted their eyes.

Who didn't know about Mufu Peak's waste of a Peak Master?

Being chosen by him would essentially end one's cultivation career.

The Peak Masters were silently bleeding. Only so many talented disciples existed—if Zhong Qing took one, they'd have one fewer to choose from.

When Zhong Qing's eyes lingered on the purple-talent youth, everyone's hearts seized.

Duan Feng's eyes nearly bulged from their sockets.

"Purple talent!"

"What an enviable gift!"

Though Zhong Qing couldn't cultivate himself, he understood cultivation knowledge well enough. He had to admit—purple talent was genuinely impressive.

But he didn't make an immediate decision. Instead, he quietly consulted the system.

"System, who exactly is this designated person?"

「Reporting to Host: the only requirement for activating the Trash Bond is that the disciple recruited must be a true piece of trash.」

"True trash?"

Zhong Qing's expression blanked. No one in this square could possibly be complete trash.

Even the lowest white talent could still cultivate.

「Host need not worry. Target has been located: white-talent Lin Feng.」

As the system spoke, it directed Zhong Qing's attention toward a black-robed youth among the white-talent group.

The youth stood straight-backed in plain black clothes, radiating an upright air.

"You're certain he's true trash?" Zhong Qing asked curiously.

「The System does not make errors. Please proceed with recruitment. Upon successful recruitment, Host will receive an unknown reward.」

While Zhong Qing communicated with the system, Lin Feng stood with his head bowed among the white talents.

His right hand unconsciously turned the storage ring on his left ring finger.

Soon, a voice echoed in his mind. "Kid, contracting with you was the worst luck of my eight lifetimes. Do you have any idea how much effort it cost me to mask your super-mega-trash constitution so the test would show white talent instead of nothing? And to do it without anyone noticing?"

"I'm truly sorry, Sword Elder," Lin Feng murmured.

"Forget it, forget it. Since we've contracted, we share the same fate—glory and ruin alike. Just listen to me, and reversing your destiny to become a supreme powerhouse isn't just a dream!"

"Yes! Whatever you say, Sword Elder, I'll do it!"

"Find a way to join Mufu Peak," Sword Elder instructed.

"Mufu Peak?"

Lin Feng looked puzzled. "Isn't that Peak Master just as much trash as me?"

"Trash or not doesn't matter. I'm not telling you to rely on him for improvement. According to my divinations, beneath Mufu Peak lies a strange fire you need. Once you obtain it, I'll teach you to use it for alchemy, allowing you to embark on the cultivation path—and surpass ordinary geniuses by far."

"Besides, having a trash Peak Master actually makes things more convenient."

"Join Mufu Peak, and I guarantee you'll begin cultivating within half a year. Within three years, you'll reach the Dawn Profound Realm. After three years, you can defeat that ex-fiancée of yours and forge an invincible heart!"

"Yes, Sword Elder! I understand. I'll definitely succeed."

Lin Feng's eyes blazed with determination as he clenched his fists. Unconsciously, his gaze drifted toward Zhong Qing.

At that exact moment, Zhong Qing was looking at him.

Their eyes met.

"Him. The disciple in white talent—that one." Zhong Qing pointed directly at Lin Feng.

Silence.

Everyone froze.

What?

Given the first pick, he chose a white talent?

Disbelief rippled through the crowd.

Duan Feng threw his head back and laughed, staring at Zhong Qing. "Little waste, I didn't expect you to have some self-awareness! Knowing you'd hold someone back, you deliberately picked white talent. I'll give you credit for that. Hahaha!"

Beside him, Xuanyuan Hong's face darkened.

He hadn't anticipated this decision either.

But he didn't blame Zhong Qing for wasting his good intentions. Instead, he felt a pang of sympathy.

Perhaps Duan Feng was right—the boy was afraid of ruining someone's future.

"Child, are you certain? I can let you choose again."

"I'm certain. He's the one."

"Very well."

Seeing Zhong Qing's resolve, Xuanyuan Hong said nothing more. He'd find other ways to support Mufu Peak later.

With the decision made, everyone—disciples and Peak Masters alike—exhaled in relief.

The disciples were glad they hadn't been chosen.

The Peak Masters were glad Zhong Qing hadn't taken any talented ones.

"Are you willing to become my disciple?" Zhong Qing raised his chin slightly, looking toward Lin Feng.

Only then did Lin Feng snap back to reality.

He'd been stunned by Zhong Qing's choice.

He never imagined that right after Sword Elder told him to join Mufu Peak, Zhong Qing would select him.

"Boy, this is fortune! Pure fortune!"

"With my guidance and this heaven-defying luck, you have the potential of a Great Emperor!"

Sword Elder's excited voice rang in Lin Feng's mind.

Lin Feng's heart pounded.

"What are you waiting for? Hurry and accept! Just go through the motions, though. A little waste wanting to be your real master? He doesn't qualify!"

"Yes."

Lin Feng nodded. Despite Sword Elder's dismissive words, he still felt grateful toward Zhong Qing.

"This disciple is willing."

Lin Feng smiled and bowed.

"Good. Come stand by me."

"Yes."

Lin Feng nodded happily and walked toward Zhong Qing, taking his place behind him.

The crowd stared at Lin Feng like he was an idiot—the white-talent disciples especially.

Ending up with that waste and still looking happy about it? Being his disciple was probably worse than becoming a menial servant at any other peak.

Next, it was finally the other Peak Masters' turn.

Unsurprisingly, Duan Feng immediately extended an invitation to the purple-talent youth. With various promised benefits, he successfully claimed him.

The other Peak Masters, though disappointed, each selected a red-talent disciple.

But Zhong Qing's face was all smiles.

Because the system's reward had arrived!
