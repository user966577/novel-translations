Chapter 31: Zhong Qing's Preparations

One year ago, on a certain day.

An elder from Heavenly Cloud Sect was passing through Heaven's Mandate City when he spotted Murong Xue's talent at a glance.

He took her as his disciple on the spot.

When the Lin family heard this news, they were happy for her—including Lin Feng.

He and Murong Xue had grown up together. They were childhood sweethearts, as the saying went.

And since she was his fiancée, Lin Feng naturally wished her well.

After all, Heavenly Cloud Sect was one of the Eastern Region's top-tier powers. Rumor had it that in another century of development, they could become one of the Eastern Region's Holy Lands.

But everything changed after Murong Xue joined Heavenly Cloud Sect.

She was discovered to have golden-grade talent and became Heavenly Cloud Sect's Saintess in one fell swoop.

Half a year later, she descended the mountain and came directly to the Lin family.

The Lin family members warmly received her, thinking she had come to share the good news about her golden talent.

But what they got was a bolt from the blue.

In her words, Lin Feng and the entire Lin family were belittled until they were worth nothing.

The meaning behind her words was clear: the current Lin family was no longer worthy of her, Murong Xue.

That day.

Lin Feng's grandfather died from rage.

Lin Hanyi coughed up blood in fury.

He immediately wanted to confront his sworn brother Murong Hai for an explanation, but Murong Hai refused to see him.

And Lin Feng, along with the entire Lin family, became the laughingstock of Heaven's Mandate City. They were targeted by others, and the family's strength fell from first-tier to second-tier.

Deeply wounded, Lin Feng declared: "Give me three years. In three years, I will definitely defeat you, wash away today's shame, and make you regret this decision!"

The three-year promise had originated from this.

Of course, all he received in return was Murong Xue's cold laugh.

What difference would three years make?

She left with a single sentence: "A grain of rice dares to compete with the brilliance of the moon."

At the same time, the entire Murong family relocated with her, moving directly to Heavenly Cloud Sect.

"Sigh, another melodramatic story."

Zhong Qing couldn't help but sigh.

People.

If things go well for you, fine. Breaking off the engagement, fine. From what Lin Feng and his family said, they understood the gap between him and Murong Xue, and they weren't unwilling.

But to insist on trampling on those who once cared for her just to satisfy her own vanity—that was incomprehensible.

Even if he couldn't share Lin Feng's feelings, hearing about this as his master made him furious.

So what if she had golden talent?

His own disciple had hundred-fold amplification plus Imperial-grade cultivation methods. Who was really unworthy of whom?

"So when do you plan to go to Heavenly Cloud Sect?" Zhong Qing asked.

"One month from now."

Lin Feng clenched his fists. "Although I want to go up the mountain right now, and I'm confident I can defeat her and avenge the past shame, it's not enough."

"I want to break through as much as possible in this month, so that before her precious sect, I can instantly defeat her and trample her underfoot."

Lin Feng gritted his teeth. "I want to see what expression she'll make when someone she once stepped on as worthless can instantly turn the tables and step on her instead!"

"I want to see her shock."

"I want her to repent—repent for coming to my Lin family so heartlessly and hurting my family like that!"

"Good. As expected of my fine disciple." Zhong Qing's face showed approval. "Either don't go at all, or achieve the ultimate effect instantly."

"Go ahead and do as you please. As I've said, your master will always be behind you." Zhong Qing spoke solemnly.

"Thank you, Master. This morning, I've already sent a letter informing them that I will arrive at Heavenly Cloud Sect in one month." Lin Feng said.

"Mm, then you need to cultivate even harder from now on." Zhong Qing said.

"Don't worry, Master. I will cultivate diligently and will never disappoint you." Lin Feng bowed solemnly before taking his leave.

After seeing Lin Feng off, Zhong Qing stood with his hands behind his back.

A top-tier sect.

That was far stronger than Immortal River Sect.

But his disciple needed to vent this anger, and as his master, he certainly couldn't hold him back.

However, he could foresee that if Murong Xue was truly trampled underfoot by his disciple that day, Heavenly Cloud Sect would not stand by and watch their Saintess be humiliated. They wouldn't let this go easily.

It seemed he needed to make a few preparations of his own.

"Heibai."

Zhong Qing called out.

"Your subordinate is here."

Heibai appeared respectfully at Zhong Qing's side.

"How are the tasks Leng Ning and the other girl assigned to you coming along?" Zhong Qing asked.

"Reporting to Master, the tasks the two young ladies assigned me have all been completed. There's nothing else for now." Heibai replied respectfully.

"Mm, since there's nothing else, go back to Command Hall Peak and run an errand for me." Zhong Qing furrowed his brow. "First, bring me those ten thousand-plus wooden figurines from my storehouse."

"Oh right, and that scarecrow by the entrance—carry that over too."

"Yes, Master. I'll depart immediately."

Zhong Qing nodded and gave Heibai the coordinates. Heibai instantly transformed into a streak of light and shot toward Command Hall Peak.

With Heibai's Moon Profound cultivation traveling at full speed, plus the time to find everything, it took less than two days for him to return.

A storage ring was filled with over ten thousand wooden figurines.

He also carried a scarecrow on his shoulder.

Zhong Qing inspected the goods and finally relaxed.

These were all items he'd received from check-ins over the years.

The wooden figurines were one-time use. Once activated, they could maintain their form for half a day, and during that time, they would transform into humanoid figures with cultivation levels ranging from Star Profound to Sun Profound.

Having these on hand was a prudent precaution.

If Heavenly Cloud Sect really didn't know what was good for them, he'd release these ten thousand-plus figurines and wreck them.

As for the scarecrow before him.

That was his ultimate trump card.

What practical effect it had, Zhong Qing didn't know, but he knew this scarecrow was one of the few ultimate check-in rewards he'd ever received.

After making these thorough preparations, Zhong Qing lay back down on his lounger with peace of mind.

Heavenly Cloud Sect.

Inside a luxurious side hall.

A middle-aged man with a thin mustache sat upon a grand chair, wearing a brocade robe that made him look wealthy and radiant.

This was the Murong family head, Murong Hai.

Within Heavenly Cloud Sect, although his cultivation wasn't high, his status was terrifyingly elevated because of his daughter.

Even the elders of Heavenly Cloud Sect treated him with courtesy.

Because his daughter was Heavenly Cloud Sect's Saintess. On the surface, she was the Grand Elder's disciple, but in reality, several Supreme Elders of the sect couldn't resist personally teaching her. She was the apple of everyone's eye.

At this moment, he was reading a letter.

After finishing it, a look of disdain crossed his face. Just as he was about to burn it, footsteps sounded from outside.

Then he saw a woman in white appear—her features cold and refined, her face exquisite, exuding an air of nobility everywhere.

Seeing who it was, Murong Hai's face lit up with joy as he went to greet her.

"Daughter, why aren't you cultivating today? What brings you here?"

The visitor was none other than Murong Xue!
