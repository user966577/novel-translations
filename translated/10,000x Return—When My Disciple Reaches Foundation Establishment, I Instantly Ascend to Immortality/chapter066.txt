Chapter 66: Sect Master, Aren't You Getting a Bit Cocky?

Lu Qingxia's arrival didn't create any ripples on Command Hall Peak.

However, some Immortal River Sect elders noticed this Holy Land Sect Master frequently appearing at Command Hall Peak, causing quite a stir of surprise.

When one elder reported this news to Xuanyuan Hong.

The latter responded with an utterly calm expression.

"It's just a Holy Land Sect Master. What's there to make such a fuss about?"

In his heart, Zhong Qing was a reincarnated Immortal Emperor.

What was an Immortal Emperor?

One who dominated an era, sweeping away all enemies above and below the heavens!

An invincible existence who defeated all opponents throughout heaven and earth.

Immortal Emperor was synonymous with invincibility.

And he believed that under Zhong Qing's leadership, Immortal River Sect soaring to the heavens was inevitable.

Perhaps his name might even be passed down through the ages as Immortal River Sect rose to prominence.

Under this mindset, a mere Eastern Region Holy Land Sect Master could no longer stir any waves in his heart!

The Third Elder watched his Sect Master's demeanor.

Several times he wanted to speak but held back.

He had a feeling their Sect Master had gotten a bit cocky.

And quite severely so!

That was a Holy Land Sect Master!

Without exaggeration, a second-rate sect like Immortal River Sect was nothing but a little brother among little brothers before a Holy Land.

"Sect Master, have you noticed that lately, you've been quite... inflated?"

After a long silence, the Third Elder finally couldn't help but speak.

As the helmsman of all of Immortal River Sect.

If his attitude had problems, it would affect the entire sect.

The Third Elder felt it was his duty and obligation to remind him.

Once a person got cocky, problems were bound to follow.

If cockiness led to disaster, that would be a huge mess.

"Have I?"

Xuanyuan Hong was taken aback!

The Third Elder nodded with conviction.

"Sect Master, the Eastern Region Holy Land Sect Master is such a transcendent existence. In the past, if you'd learned she was visiting, with your personality, wouldn't you have made a grand affair of it, mobilizing the entire sect to welcome her?"

"But now?"

"You've completely stopped taking her seriously."

"Though that person is a reincarnated Immortal Emperor."

"He still needs time to grow!"

Only then did Xuanyuan Hong reflect on whether he had been too high-profile and ostentatious lately.

But this change in mindset wasn't really his fault.

Whose sect wouldn't want to show off a bit after producing a reincarnated Immortal Emperor disciple?

The fact that he hadn't announced Zhong Qing's identity was already quite restrained.

But now he also realized his attitude had become a major problem.

The more critical the time, the more low-key one needed to be.

Once Zhong Qing's identity was carelessly leaked, leading to some disaster that cut short his life, then he truly wouldn't be able to face his ancestors even in death.

Especially since Zhong Qing's master was a Daoist.

What Xuanyuan Hong didn't know was that because of them, a super expert named Cang Yu had already gone looking for trouble with Zhong Qing.

And if Cang Yu knew that Xuanyuan Hong's misjudgment had led him to provoke such a great enemy, losing his life for nothing, with even his soul unable to find rest—one wondered what he would feel?

Would he crawl out from inside the scarecrow lantern to fight Xuanyuan Hong to the death?

Of course!

He was destined never to come out in this lifetime.

Souls collected by the scarecrow—whether demon souls or divine spirits—had no precedent of escaping on their own.

At this moment, Zhong Qing was in seclusion in the back courtyard, refining pills!

Ever since he had successfully refined the Beauty Enhancement Pill.

His handsomeness had been improving day by day.

If before, his appearance could be called outstanding.

Now, he could already rival the legendary great beauties of his previous world.

He figured surpassing them was just a matter of time.

This had sparked his intense interest in alchemy.

The cultivation path was full of hardships, the road to longevity was lonely.

For Zhong Qing, the hardships of cultivation were something he'd never experience in this lifetime.

After all, he had the Waste Material Bond System.

His cultivation depended entirely on piling up disciples.

But the loneliness of the path to longevity was beginning to show signs.

To enrich his life, he planned to develop more hobbies.

And alchemy had become one of them.

The only problem was whether it was his inherently poor aptitude.

Or his lack of alchemy talent!

The pills he refined exploded nine out of ten batches!

Zhong Qing was beginning to wonder if his successful first refinement of the Beauty Enhancement Pill had been due to some mysterious newbie protection luck.

But even with furnace explosions, he didn't get discouraged.

As the saying goes.

Failure is the mother of success.

When talent falls short, make up for it with quantity.

He refused to believe that channeling the spirit of a research fanatic, using data to record, wouldn't improve his alchemy success rate.

Under his tireless dedication, the results were actually quite pleasing.

His success rate had improved from ten percent to twenty percent.

Just as he rolled up his sleeves to push on and raise it to thirty percent, Su Ye arrived in the back courtyard.

"Master!"

He respectfully bowed to Zhong Qing.

His expression was somewhat dim, as if something was weighing on his mind.

Zhong Qing sensed something.

He asked gently: "Is there something you need your master's help with?"

Su Ye stood in place.

Several times he tried to speak but didn't know how to begin.

Zhong Qing didn't rush him.

He simply waited quietly for him to explain his purpose.

This child was truly pitiful.

Orphaned at a young age. He had thought that with the Flying Saber Token left by his parents, he could join Flying Saber Sect and change his fate, stepping onto the path of cultivation and leaving behind the hardscrabble life of toiling for survival.

Who could have known the world had declined so, that human hearts were no longer what they once were?

What he thought would be the road to heaven had nearly led him into the depths of hell.

If not for meeting Zhong Qing, Su Ye's life would truly have ended in tragedy.

Time passed—about fifteen minutes.

Only then did Su Ye muster the courage to say: "Master, I humbly request that you strike down Flying Saber Sect's Grand Elder!"

When mentioning Flying Saber Sect's Grand Elder, a thick hatred flashed through Su Ye's eyes.

After all, his parents had died saving Flying Saber Sect's Grand Elder. They had been hunted down by the Grand Elder's enemies and, refusing to reveal his whereabouts, had been brutally killed.

Who could have known that this man not only wouldn't repay his gratitude—when Su Ye had brought the token he'd given to seek entry into the sect, Flying Saber Sect's Grand Elder had turned his face and refused to acknowledge him.

Such behavior was like a thorn in Su Ye's heart.

In a sense, this Grand Elder of Flying Saber Sect was a hundred times more detestable than the ones who had killed his parents. Especially thinking about how his father and mother had died for nothing—he felt a burning hatred.

Upon hearing this, Zhong Qing laughed heartily and said: "I'm glad you brought this up. After all, why wait until tomorrow for revenge your master can help you take today?"

"Before, I thought you wanted to handle it yourself, to resolve your own heart's burden, so your master didn't offer to help. Now that you've asked, your master will accompany you on this trip!"
