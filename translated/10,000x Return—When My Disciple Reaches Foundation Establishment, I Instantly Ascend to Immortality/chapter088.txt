Chapter 88: An Interesting Young Friend

In those early years after transmigrating to this world, while Zhong Qing's cultivation never improved, he'd checked in and accumulated a mountain of miscellaneous items.

The system had given him an enormous variety of rewards.

Many were of extraordinary value.

The cultivation world didn't use money for transactions.

Spirit stones, resources, rare mineral veins—anything of value could serve as currency.

Zhong Qing could easily tell the woman doubted his ability to pay.

He didn't bother explaining.

He simply produced a longsword.

"Can this sword be exchanged for those materials?"

The moment the sword left its sheath, the red-robed woman's eyes narrowed.

From this sword, she sensed an astonishing cold gleam and bone-piercing chill.

Working at the auction house required not just social skills, but sharp eyes—that was how they survived.

She could tell at a glance this was no ordinary weapon.

"Could this be... a King-grade divine weapon?"

Her mind trembled, her eyes seeming to radiate light.

If this truly was a King-grade divine weapon, then... this deal was no small matter, and this person's identity was far from ordinary.

She hadn't expected to encounter such business in little Spirit City.

After all, a single King-grade divine weapon would make first-tier powers fight tooth and nail.

Even Holy Land sect masters would covet such a thing.

But King-grade divine weapons were extraordinarily rare.

Someone of the red-robed woman's rank had never encountered such high-end items.

However, weapons above ninth-grade that reached King-grade had a distinctive characteristic.

That was the weapon spirit—also called a sword spirit.

She could clearly sense emotional fluctuations from the sword itself.

"S-Senior, may I examine this sword?"

At the thought that a King-grade divine weapon transaction might pass through her hands, the red-robed woman nearly fainted with excitement.

"Go ahead."

Zhong Qing casually handed the sword over.

Her heart nearly leaped from her chest.

She accepted it reverently, carefully wiping the blade.

A flash of cold light passed across the surface, making her feel a terror as if from the depths of hell itself.

"With such terrifying properties, this truly must be King-grade."

She reached a firm conclusion.

"Senior, do you truly wish to exchange this divine weapon for those top-grade materials?"

"Please forgive my earlier blindness."

"I cannot estimate this weapon's exact value."

"But even at the lowest valuation, you would be at a loss exchanging it for those materials."

"Perhaps you'd like to look at some other items that might interest you?"

"No need to look. Beyond having all three types of top-grade materials from your warehouse delivered to me, convert the remaining value into other alchemy materials. Choose whatever you think appropriate," Zhong Qing instructed.

For him, alchemy materials were things he'd need eventually.

Having extra materials on hand was never a bad idea.

"And what about the discount?"

Zhong Qing glanced at the red-robed woman.

"Rest assured, Senior. We'll conclude at the lowest possible price."

The woman replied hastily.

She understood clearly that anyone who could casually produce a King-grade divine weapon was no ordinary person.

For such figures, profit wasn't the priority.

Building a good relationship was what mattered most.

"Please wait a moment, Senior. I'll fetch the materials immediately!"

In less than fifteen minutes, dozens of top-grade spiritual medicines were delivered to Zhong Qing.

The efficiency was remarkable.

Having obtained what he needed, Zhong Qing didn't linger and departed with long strides.

Only after he had disappeared from sight did the red-robed woman hurry to send the divine weapon to headquarters.

She requested they verify its exact quality.

What neither of them noticed was this: in a corner of the pavilion, two shadowy figures watched Zhong Qing leave, greed thick in their eyes.

They had witnessed Zhong Qing carrying away a fortune in top-grade materials.

If they robbed him, they'd make a killing in one stroke.

As they say, treasures move the heart and wealth seduces the soul.

Today, fortune had smiled upon the brothers.

To encounter such a fat sheep!

Meanwhile, after leaving the auction house, Zhong Qing had originally planned to return directly to the sect.

But then he remembered his recent promise to visit the old beggar.

He changed direction and headed toward the eastern part of the city.

When he reached the old scholar tree, the old beggar had been waiting for quite some time.

"Young friend, this old beggar has finally waited for you!"

The old beggar grinned, revealing two rows of big yellow teeth.

Golden and gleaming, they gave off a peculiar sense of joy.

"Come, come! These past days I've been hoping and praying, and finally you've come."

"First, let's play a game!"

"I've carefully studied this chess's strategies and patterns. I'd say my level is no longer beneath yours—be careful now!"

The old beggar looked supremely confident.

As he spoke, he was already setting up the board.

But the facts proved that the gap between them couldn't be bridged by self-assessment.

They played all day, and the old beggar lost all day.

"I quit, I quit!"

Beneath the scholar tree, the old beggar waved his hand, looking thoroughly dejected.

"This was meant for entertainment. Why so serious about losing?"

Zhong Qing took a swig of wine and teased.

"If you lost all day, wouldn't you be upset too?"

The old beggar said indignantly.

"In this life, whether we win or lose—if we only care about outcomes, we miss out on so much enjoyment."

"For your young age, you see things quite clearly!"

The old beggar pursed his lips: "I can tell you've got stories."

"Care to share with this old beggar?"

Zhong Qing smiled: "Some stories are meant to be kept to oneself."

"Some stories can only be told when the mood strikes."

"When I'm in the mood someday, perhaps I'll tell you!"

"Anyway, it's getting late. I should head back."

Zhong Qing looked up at the starlit sky and bright moon, bidding the old beggar farewell.

"Alright. Given the chance, this old beggar would like to hear what's so special about your stories."

They parted ways!

Zhong Qing's figure gradually receded into the distance.

The old beggar watched the direction he disappeared in, lost in thought.

After a long while, he finally smiled with narrowed eyes: "Interesting!"

"Truly interesting!"

"It's been ages since I've met such an interesting young friend."

"But to think someone would dare target my young friend—they truly don't know what death means."

He looked toward the two tails following Zhong Qing, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.

Just then—

Two figures approached from afar, stopping directly before the old beggar.

"Old Ancestor, you've been out for several years now."

"Please return with us to preside over sect affairs."

These two were brawny men with powerful builds, muscles knotted like steel, as if they were iron towers forged from metal.

Their auras were deep, their divine light restrained—clearly Sun Profound powerhouses.
