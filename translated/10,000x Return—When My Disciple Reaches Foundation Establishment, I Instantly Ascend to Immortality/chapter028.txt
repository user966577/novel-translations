Chapter 28: The System's Reward—Right to the Heart

This single leaf drifted forward.

The snarling three-headed demon wolf was instantly sliced clean in half, crashing heavily into the forest below.

Such was the terrifying power of Absolute Suppression!

Any being at the same realm or below—any person, any creature—could be annihilated with any action.

The key selling point: effortless and efficient!

Zhong Qing gazed calmly at the three-headed demon wolf, now devoid of any life force, standing with his hands clasped behind his back.

「Congratulations, Host. Quest to slay the three-headed demon wolf completed.」

「Reward: A personal small world of one li in radius. The small world can store any items, including living beings. The Host may also enter it. The small world can be made indistinguishable from the real world.」

"Oh, a small world?"

Hearing the system's voice, Zhong Qing's expression brightened. This damn system really was becoming more reliable!

A portable small world like this might seem useless on the surface, but its practical applications were enormous—especially since it could contain living things, and he could freely enter and exit. This reward truly hit the mark.

Wasn't this small world basically his own private garden?

Beyond that, if he ever encountered real danger—even if the world ended—he could simply retreat into his small world and ignore whatever apocalypse unfolded outside.

So what better self-defense treasure could there be than this small world?

In just this moment, Zhong Qing had already planned out many things.

Setting aside everything else, those countless sacks of cultivation methods and the divine weapons overflowing from his warehouse could all be placed in his small world.

Then he'd build some small structures inside, turn it into his private garden—absolutely perfect.

While Zhong Qing was absorbed in his system reward.

In the distance, Bai Chen and the others were watching the battle from afar.

Including the white-robed and blue-robed women, who hadn't left immediately.

They watched as Zhong Qing waved away the mist and faced off against the three-headed demon wolf.

Just when they thought Zhong Qing would have a fierce battle with the wolf, a fight that would shake heaven and earth, the very next moment the three-headed demon wolf was simply... split in two.

All of this happened in just a few breaths. Before they could even react, the three-headed demon wolf was gone.

"He... one-shot it?"

Everyone was collectively stunned.

Eyes bulging, mouths gaping wide enough to fit an egg.

Too fast.

A three-headed demon wolf as powerful as mid Moon Profound, and it was just... instantly killed.

It was over before it even began.

Was this the power of someone with a Moon Profound servant?

The people of Heaven's Mandate City looked at the figure standing in the sky with nothing but awe.

Especially those family heads who had been clamoring to flee—cold sweat now drenched their backs.

"The Lin family has really stumbled into incredible fortune!"

"Never mind the fortune—I just want to know what the Murong family's expression will be when they find out Lin Feng has such a master?"

"Thank goodness my son was drinking at that tavern that day and got me the news in time so I could rush to the Lin family to apologize. Otherwise, my Fang family would probably be done for..."

The family heads whispered among themselves.

Lin Hanyi, along with the Lin family's senior members, was also present—of course they would accompany Zhong Qing on a demon-slaying expedition.

"So this is my son's master?"

"Truly too powerful!"

Lin Hanyi couldn't hide the pride on his face. Especially feeling the gazes the other family heads directed at him, his Lin family was certainly riding on those coattails.

But those who were most shaken by seeing the three-headed demon wolf killed weren't these people—it was the two women hovering in the air.

Because Bai Chen, Lin Hanyi, and the others only knew that Zhong Qing had killed the wolf.

They didn't know how.

But the women were far stronger than Lin Hanyi and the others, so they could clearly see the battle. They had watched with their own eyes as a single leaf drifted from Zhong Qing's hand and sliced the three-headed demon wolf in half.

Having just fought the wolf themselves, they knew exactly how powerful and well-defended it was.

So under these circumstances, the shock Zhong Qing's leaf delivered was immense.

"S-Sister... I think we've encountered a true master."

In the air, the blue-robed woman's small mouth hung open, her pretty face flushed with disbelief.

The white-robed woman said nothing.

But that face that had always been calm as still water was now filled with incredulity.

Just then, Zhong Qing came walking back through the air.

"Senior Zhong, you are truly too powerful!" Seeing Zhong Qing return, Bai Chen led the city guards in a unified salute. "On behalf of the million people of Heaven's Mandate City, we thank Senior Zhong for slaying this demon."

If before, Bai Chen and the others had merely been respectful toward Zhong Qing.

Now it was awe and submission.

"City Lord Bai, you're too kind. It was nothing." Zhong Qing smiled faintly.

"Leng Ning and Qingniao greet the Senior."

At this moment, the two women in the air also hurriedly descended, bowing respectfully to Zhong Qing. Their expressions were uneasy as they said, "We apologize—we truly didn't know the Senior's strength. We spoke rudely before. Please forgive our blindness."

The two women sincerely apologized.

Their faces were flushed with embarrassment.

Thinking of how they'd looked down on Zhong Qing earlier, they wished they could find a hole to crawl into.

"Please, ladies, there's no need for such formality. I should actually thank you both for telling me the demon wolf's strength." Zhong Qing smiled faintly, not taking offense at their earlier rudeness.

After all, the women hadn't meant any harm—quite the opposite, they'd been trying to help.

"Thank you, Senior."

The women were grateful for Zhong Qing's easygoing nature and quickly expressed their thanks.

"Well then, the demon wolf is dead. I'll be heading back. You may handle the cleanup." Zhong Qing addressed Bai Chen and the others. Although a demon beast of this level had treasures throughout its body, Zhong Qing had no interest in them.

"Yes, Senior Zhong."

Bai Chen quickly agreed and prepared to lead the city guards to process the three-headed demon wolf's corpse.

Though he couldn't do anything to the wolf while it was alive, now that it had terrorized Heaven's Mandate City for so long and was dead, Bai Chen wanted to at least kick the corpse a couple times and then slice it into a thousand pieces.

However, just as Zhong Qing was about to lead the Lin family away, Leng Ning and Qingniao looked at him hesitantly.

Zhong Qing happened to notice this and couldn't help but ask, "Is there something else, ladies?"

"Senior, to be honest, there is something we'd like to ask."

Leng Ning quickly cupped her fists and said, "We're from Myriad Dao Mountain in the Eastern Region. As everyone knows, Myriad Dao Mountain specializes in formations. Our sect is currently researching a new formation that requires demon beast eyeballs for spirit-awakening. The sect gave us sisters this mission—to bring back no fewer than five eyeballs from demon beasts at Star Profound or above."

"We sisters searched all the way here and heard about this demon beast outside Heaven's Mandate City. Thinking we could complete our mission and also rid the people of this menace, we came here. We thought it was only at Star Profound, easily dealt with by the two of us. But who could have imagined it was actually at mid Moon Profound?"

"As the Senior already knows, we failed to slay the demon and nearly died here ourselves..."

"I see."

After listening, Zhong Qing nodded, then looked at the two women. "So you want the eyeballs from this three-headed demon wolf?"

"We wouldn't dare ask for them directly. We're willing to trade items of equal value." Leng Ning quickly cupped her fists. "We beg the Senior to grant our request."

"A trade won't be necessary. However, you mentioned you're from Myriad Dao Mountain. There is something I'd actually like your help with."

Zhong Qing's lips curved up meaningfully.
