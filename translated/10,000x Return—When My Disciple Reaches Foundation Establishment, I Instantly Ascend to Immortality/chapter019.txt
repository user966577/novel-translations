Chapter 19: Moon Profound... That's All?

Against Red-Haired Ghost's strike, Xuanyuan Hong and the others responded with everything they had.

However.

What they hadn't anticipated was overestimating the power of their combined forces.

And underestimating the strength of Moon Profound.

As their attacks converged with Red-Haired Ghost's blade, they realized a Moon Profound cultivator was beyond their reach.

The gap between Xuanyuan Hong and Red-Haired Ghost might seem like just one realm, but it wasn't something numbers could bridge.

The saber cut through their combined assault like it was nothing.

Fortunately, it weakened the strike considerably.

Even so, the residual force sent them all flying, coughing blood as they slammed into the cliff face behind them. Over a dozen craters formed before they finally crashed to the ground.

"Hmph."

"A firefly dares compete with the moon."

High above, Red-Haired Ghost's eyes flashed with contempt. "You think a bunch of trash from Azure Jade Sect can stop me? Laughable."

"One last chance. Hand over Zhong Qing."

"Red-Haired Ghost, forget it." Xuanyuan Hong and the others struggled to their feet, spitting blood. "A man fights for breath as a tree fights for bark. We will never hand him over. You'll never find Zhong Qing."

"Fine, fine, FINE. Since you refuse to see reason, I'll kill all of you, destroy Azure Jade Sect, and then take my time hunting down that Zhong Qing."

Red-Haired Ghost's eyes blazed with fury.

His saber gathered profound energy, the black mist growing denser than ever.

"Everyone, let's meet him one more time."

Xuanyuan Hong watched the figure above, voice heavy. "Go!"

"Yes!"

The Peak Masters and elders stepped forward, faces deadly serious.

They could tell this strike would be even more powerful than the last.

However.

Just as they were about to act, a figure suddenly appeared beside Xuanyuan Hong.

"Everyone, let me handle this one."

As the voice fell, Xuanyuan Hong whipped his head around to find Zhong Qing in white robes standing there, having appeared without warning.

"You—Zhong Qing, when did you get here?"

Xuanyuan Hong was stunned.

"I came as soon as I received Third Elder's message."

"You!"

Xuanyuan Hong's face twisted with frustration. "Didn't the message tell you to run?"

"I'm the one who started this. How could I let you clean up my mess?"

Zhong Qing smiled easily.

This was precisely why he hadn't left Azure Jade Sect even after activating the Trash Bond.

Before, aside from Duan Feng bullying him, the other elders and Peak Masters had never treated him poorly. Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong especially—whenever they crossed paths, he'd always show concern.

This sect.

Small as it was, only second-rate in the Eastern Region.

He still had feelings for it.

And today's display had only deepened his sense of belonging.

"But he's Moon Profound. Even all of us together couldn't stop him." Xuanyuan Hong stared blankly. "How can you face him alone?"

"Moon Profound? That's all. Sect Master, you worry too much."

"Moon... Profound... that's all?"

Xuanyuan Hong and the others gaped at Zhong Qing.

Zhong Qing smiled faintly, stepped forward with hands clasped behind his back, and slowly raised his head to regard the imperious Red-Haired Ghost.

"Red-Haired Ghost, I am Zhong Qing. Your disciple Xue Kuang died by my hand."

"You want to kill me? Then bring everything you've got."

He watched Red-Haired Ghost calmly, voice mild.

"So you're Zhong Qing?"

Red-Haired Ghost's gaze locked onto him. Seeing the one who'd killed his disciple, his already grotesque face contorted further. His crimson pupils bulged as heavy breaths snorted from his nose.

"Good, good, GOOD. Little beast, I never expected you to show yourself."

"Now DIE as payment for my disciple!!"

High above, violent winds erupted with Red-Haired Ghost at their center, spawning a massive cyclone.

The winds merged with his black mist into what seemed like the apocalypse. Everything in its path—buildings, boulders—was ground to dust.

Within the maelstrom, hideous faces and monstrous shapes flickered, emitting blood-curdling shrieks that made scalps tingle.

"So... so terrifying!"

Xuanyuan Hong and the others felt their legs go weak.

So this was true Moon Profound power!

Even he, Xuanyuan Hong, would die instantly if caught in that storm.

Involuntarily, their gazes shifted to Zhong Qing ahead.

How could he possibly stop this?!

In their horror, Red-Haired Ghost moved.

Carrying the swirling tempest, he raised his saber high. Wraiths and monsters coiled around the blade as it slashed toward Zhong Qing.

The blade fell.

The storm followed.

Sky-darkening, earth-shaking.

This strike carried all of Red-Haired Ghost's fury.

Yet facing it, Zhong Qing merely raised his palm.

And extended a single finger.

Then lightly pressed it toward Red-Haired Ghost within the maelstrom.

In an instant—

The storm shattered. Wraiths and monsters dissolved into nothing.

"Wh-what?!"

Red-Haired Ghost's eyes went wide with terror.

The power in this single finger made him feel as if he faced the entire world—utterly insurmountable. Even his saber had begun to vaporize.

"No... don't..."

As the finger pressed down completely, Red-Haired Ghost's final cry of disbelief accompanied his complete dissolution—man and saber alike reduced to nothing.

Long moments passed.

The dispersing battle energy in the sky finally settled.

But behind Zhong Qing, Xuanyuan Hong and the others stood with mouths agape, completely petrified. Their hearts refused to calm.

What had they just witnessed?

Red-Haired Ghost, a Moon Profound cultivator, squashed by Zhong Qing with a single finger?

Not even a hair left behind?

For a long moment, they stared at Zhong Qing as if seeing a ghost.

"You... you, you, you..."

Xuanyuan Hong could only point at Zhong Qing, unable to form words.

The elders and Peak Masters behind him weren't faring any better.

They'd thought they'd already rated Zhong Qing highly enough. After all, his age was plain to see. Yet again and again, he shattered their expectations.

Seeing their expressions, Zhong Qing couldn't help but rub his nose sheepishly.

"You brat—are you even human, or some kind of monster?" Xuanyuan Hong finally recovered enough to speak, eyes wide. "Hiding this deep! Pretending to be trash when you're actually this powerful—you really are..."

"It couldn't be helped, Sect Master."

Zhong Qing chuckled. Naturally, he couldn't explain the system. He could only deflect: "The cultivation world is full of schemes and plots. Staying low-key and hiding a bit of cultivation seems prudent."
