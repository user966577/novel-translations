Chapter 76: I'm Going to Flatten This Command Hall Peak

Infinity Sect!

White Constancy Hall!

This was the palace of the Seventh Elder, Wu Yue.

In the great hall, Wu Yue studied the letter in his hand.

This was information delivered through Shi Xiaotian's transmission talisman.

The entire message was just one line: Immortal River Sect, Command Hall Peak, save me!

Signed: Old Black!

Wu Yue's brow furrowed deeply.

With Old Black's strength, throughout the entire Eastern Region, aside from the major Holy Lands, he could basically swagger anywhere.

Yet now he had sent out a distress signal, and the characters were crimson—written in blood—clearly indicating he was in grave danger.

"This Immortal River Sect? Where is it?"

As for Immortal River Sect, it might be quite famous locally.

But beyond its sphere of influence, it really had no reputation.

Many people had basically no impression or concept of this sect.

Wu Yue immediately summoned the Shadow Guard leader.

"Do you know of Immortal River Sect?"

The Shadow Guard leader was somewhat surprised.

After all, not long ago, the Eighth Elder had requested information about Immortal River Sect from him.

Now the Seventh Elder was also inquiring about this sect.

A mere second-rate sect—what merit or capability did it have to warrant attention from two Holy Land elders?

While thinking this, he didn't dare delay and respectfully replied: "Reporting to the Seventh Elder, this Immortal River Sect is a second-rate sect of the Eastern Region."

"Second-rate sect?"

Hearing this, Wu Yue's frown deepened.

With Old Black's strength, a mere second-rate sect could be easily steamrolled.

How had he ended up in a situation where he needed to send for rescue?

Seeing this, the Shadow Guard leader quietly asked: "Seventh Elder, has this sect offended you and the Eighth Elder? Do you need me to send people to flatten it?"

"No need!"

Wu Yue waved his hand.

Old Black was always one to save face.

If word got out that he'd fallen at the hands of a minor second-rate sect, even if he was rescued, he'd become a laughingstock in Infinity Sect—that would be worse than killing him.

"Give me a map with the exact location of Immortal River Sect. You're dismissed!"

After pondering briefly, Wu Yue decided to go alone on the rescue.

Seeing this, the Shadow Guard leader said nothing more. He respectfully handed over the map and then withdrew.

For the leader of a Holy Land's intelligence organization, carrying a map of the Eastern Region's power distribution on his person was quite reasonable.

After receiving the map, Wu Yue began considering how to conduct the rescue.

Compared to the Eighth Elder Shi Xiaotian's domineering, flamboyant style of using the Holy Land's name wherever he went, his approach was much more cautious.

Though Immortal River Sect was a second-rate sect, since it could make the Eighth Elder send a distress signal, there must be something extraordinary about it.

He had to be fully prepared.

Otherwise, if two Holy Land elders both fell in the same place, that would be a massive joke.

In the hall, Wu Yue paced back and forth, hands behind his back.

Finally, his gaze settled on his private treasury.

Inside the treasury were two guardian puppets, both at Sun Profound level—his hidden trump cards.

Normally, he would never reveal them.

But now, to rescue the Eighth Elder, he decided to bring these two puppets along, just in case.

Then three figures set off grandly from Infinity Sect.

The Seventh Elder himself was a Sun Profound powerhouse, and now with two Sun Profound puppets added.

He was confident that no matter how extraordinary Immortal River Sect was, the combined might of three Sun Profound powerhouses would be enough to suppress everything.

Immortal River Sect!

Command Hall Peak!

For Shi Xiaotian, it was another day of inhumane pill testing. He stared blankly at the sky, wanting to cry but having no tears.

No one knew what torment he had endured during this time, what suffering he had experienced.

As for Zhong Qing's alchemy skills, he had given up complaining.

If not for sending out that message, believing that people from the sect would come rescue him, he might have already lost the will to live.

"Calculating the time, from when I sent the message until the sect responds and dispatches a large force to rescue me, it should be within these few days."

"Old White!"

"Please hurry!"

"If you don't come soon, I'm afraid I won't be able to hold on."

Shi Xiaotian prayed silently.

At the same time, just thinking about Zhong Qing's pills made his body shudder uncontrollably.

Just as he was thinking this, several figures appeared in the sky above.

"That's..."

Shi Xiaotian was momentarily stunned, then wild with joy.

"Old White... Old White is here!"

In this moment, he was so excited he nearly wept.

What were brothers?

This was what brothers were!

The kind who were like flesh and blood.

As for Wu Yue, he had brought two puppets, traveling from Infinity Sect, crossing mountains and rivers, rushing ten thousand miles, and finally arrived at Command Hall Peak.

Sun Profound powerhouses had remarkable eyesight. Even an ant a thousand meters away could be seen clearly.

Even from far away, Wu Yue immediately spotted Shi Xiaotian.

At this moment, Shi Xiaotian was exceptionally wretched.

Covered in pustules, disheveled hair, his whole person a mess, having visibly lost a large amount of weight, reduced to skin and bones.

If the two hadn't known each other for so long, if Wu Yue wasn't extremely familiar with Shi Xiaotian's aura, he might not have recognized him.

"Old Black! What happened to you..."

"What did you encounter to end up like this!"

He immediately rushed into the courtyard, helped Shi Xiaotian undo his bindings, and asked what had happened.

"Old White, brother! You've finally come."

Seeing his old friend again, Shi Xiaotian felt like meeting an old acquaintance after a lifetime apart.

His heart was bitter!

He immediately recounted everything he'd experienced during this time to Wu Yue.

Upon hearing that his good brother had been used as a pill-testing subject and had been tortured to the point of living death, Wu Yue was thoroughly enraged.

"What a Zhong Qing, what a Command Hall Peak Master!"

"To dare humiliate you like this."

"Brother, today watch as I flatten this Command Hall Peak, exterminate this Immortal River Sect, and vent your fury!"

His killing intent surged, rage burning in his eyes.

People of Infinity Sect had never suffered such humiliation before.

At the same time!

Zhong Qing, hands behind his back, strode out from the inner courtyard.

He came directly to the courtyard, his gaze fixed on Wu Yue.

His voice was cold: "You want to flatten my Command Hall Peak, exterminate my Immortal River Sect?"

"Correct!"

His response was Wu Yue's resounding declaration.

"Today I shall wash this place in blood, and let the world know that the Holy Land must not be insulted."

"Boy, if there's a next life, keep your eyes open."

"Some people are ones you can never afford to offend."

With a low roar, Wu Yue attacked directly.

"Old White, be careful—this kid is strange and sinister!"

Shi Xiaotian warned from behind.

"A mere clown, hardly worth mentioning. Just watch how I suppress him!"

Wu Yue's posture was lofty, his every move displaying the bearing of a grandmaster.
