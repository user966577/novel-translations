Chapter 95: The Soul-Tempering Pill

"You mean to say that you two will lead the refinement for the Old Ancestor's pill?"

Ouyang Hao asked, his face full of astonishment.

"Sect Master, you misunderstand!"

"We don't mean to lead the refinement—we mean we two will refine it directly!"

Shi Xiaotian clarified.

But the moment he finished, an angry rebuke rang out.

"Preposterous!"

The Pill Peak Master scolded furiously.

"This concerns the Old Ancestor's life and death—this is no place for jokes."

"You two will refine it directly? How dare you make such jests? If anything happens to the Old Ancestor, can you bear that responsibility? Stand down!"

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian's brows furrowed slightly.

They couldn't help but say: "Peak Master, three days apart, a man should be seen with new eyes. Would we joke about the Old Ancestor's life?"

The Pill Peak Master sneered.

"The Soul-Nurturing Pill requires an enormous quantity of spiritual medicines."

"Just the spiritual energy needed to refine and transform them would exhaust several Sun Profound powerhouses."

"Tell me—with just the two of you, how would you refine it?"

Shi Xiaotian's mouth twitched as he said: "Peak Master, we never said we were refining the Soul-Nurturing Pill."

"What we're refining is the Soul—Tempering—Pill!"

The moment those three words left his mouth, they seemed to carry a strange magic.

The previously noisy hall fell instantly silent.

You could hear a pin drop.

Though only one character different, the Soul-Nurturing Pill and Soul-Tempering Pill were worlds apart.

Even the Sixth Elder had said that with the Soul-Nurturing Pill, the Old Ancestor would have a slim chance under his care.

But with the Soul-Tempering Pill, he was completely confident he could bring the Old Ancestor back.

The difference between them was like heaven and earth.

"Have you two lost your minds?"

Lu Po felt the two had gone mad.

Leading was one thing, but now they claimed they'd refine the Soul-Tempering Pill?

Had he misheard, or had Shi Xiaotian and Wu Yue lost their minds?

Everyone else's gazes were equally skeptical. Clearly, they all thought what the two had said was too outlandish.

Seeing their disbelief, Shi Xiaotian's expression grew serious.

"Everyone, you know our characters. When have we ever made empty boasts?"

"Moreover, when we were in the sect, the Old Ancestor treated us well. Would we harm him?"

These words gave pause to those who'd been doubting.

Indeed.

Neither man was the type to make wild claims.

And they had no reason to harm the Old Ancestor.

"You two... can really refine this miraculous pill?"

Someone asked in shock and uncertainty.

After all, the Soul-Tempering Pill was an ancient miraculous pill—one that had only been heard of, never seen.

The formula had long vanished into the river of time.

"We swear on our lives!" Shi Xiaotian said solemnly.

With such an oath, everyone exchanged glances.

Could these two really have this ability?

For a moment, even the previously skeptical Pill Peak Master fell silent.

They realized that since these two had gone out and returned, they could no longer see through them!

"How about... we let them try?"

Ouyang Hao suggested.

Looking at the serious expressions on the two men's faces, everyone hesitated for a long while before finally nodding.

Seeing agreement, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian sprang into action.

Arguments were far less convincing than results.

As the two sorted through the mountain of spiritual medicines for the Soul-Tempering Pill's ingredients, they immediately fired up the furnace.

Watching this, though everyone harbored doubts, with the Old Ancestor's life hanging by a thread, they could only choose to stand guard and protect them.

Ordinary alchemy was undeniably tedious and boring.

But watching Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian refine pills—their techniques flowing like water, executed in one seamless breath—was a beautiful experience.

Moreover, their alchemy method was distinctly unique.

Most alchemists used fire-tempering techniques.

These two immediately displayed superior alchemy skills.

Water and fire appeared simultaneously—fire tempered spiritual essence while water condensed spiritual crystals.

This single technique alone left every alchemist present feeling inferior.

After all, such exquisite control was beyond ordinary people.

This was also Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian's signature skill.

But as time passed—

The power of water and fire evolved into the radiance of Five Elements.

This transformation made the assembled alchemists cry out in shock.

"Five Elements Alchemy!"

Five Elements Alchemy was a legendary technique, nearly extinct in the current age.

Throughout the entire Eastern Region, no one had ever been heard to have mastered such a method.

"How do they know this technique?"

The alchemists were baffled.

Of course, no one dared speak now, fearing they might disturb the two.

Involuntarily, everyone's skepticism about whether Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian could produce the Soul-Tempering Pill transformed into anticipation.

Before their eyes, the alchemy furnace was wreathed in the powers of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—the Five Elements—radiating five-colored divine light.

One spiritual ingredient after another, under the Five Elements' refinement, transformed into drops of liquid—red, white, blue, purple, and cyan.

Ethereal qi permeated the surroundings.

It transformed into wisps of dark light.

That was the dross of the ingredients.

Such a technique of eliminating impurities and preserving essence was truly breathtaking, leaving everyone deeply shaken!

This was absolutely a visual feast for the alchemy world.

After a full day of refinement—

When the furnace opened, a Soul-Tempering Pill emerged: crystalline and translucent, smooth and round, its fragrance spreading in all directions, radiating ethereal divine light.

With this, the Soul-Tempering Pill—said to be extinct, lost to history—was reborn through Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian's hands.

When they saw the finished product—

Everyone was shaken to their cores.

This was absolutely a King-grade pill!

Those who could refine King-grade pills were called Pill Kings.

Didn't that mean that Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian standing before them were—two Pill Kings!

"Hiss..."

Everyone drew in a sharp breath, their gazes toward the two completely transformed.

Just the title of Pill King alone meant that even Holy Land Sect Masters would defer to them.

And the pill's effects proved to be truly dominating.

The moment it was consumed—

The critically wounded Old Ancestor of Infinity Sect was pulled straight back from death's door.

Though he hadn't awakened yet—

His soul affliction was already dissipating like snow meeting spring sun.

Waking was merely a matter of time.

This news filled everyone with excitement.

Then, someone voiced the question in everyone's mind.

"Elders Black and White, how did your alchemy skills improve so dramatically? Would you share your insights?"

This question spoke for everyone present.

Countless gazes turned to Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian.

The two smiled at each other.

Shi Xiaotian didn't mince words, speaking directly: "This is why we joined Immortal River Sect."

"The Soul-Tempering Pill formula came from our Peak Master!"

At these words, everyone's minds churned with towering waves.

A second-tier sect had produced two Pill Kings?

Possessed such a miraculous formula?

Wu Yue didn't give them time to process.

He announced: "Now that everything is concluded, we two must return."

"The Peak Master is still waiting for us to test pills!"

Everyone exclaimed in amazement.

Using two Pill Kings as pill testers—what kind of outrageous behavior was this?

Pill Kings were precious beyond measure. Wherever they went, they were treated like royalty, honored guests of the highest order.

Yet at some second-tier sect's Command Hall Peak, they'd become test subjects?

More crucially, looking at their perfectly content expressions, there wasn't the slightest hint of reluctance.

In that moment, Immortal River Sect's Command Hall Peak became shrouded in mystery in everyone's minds.

Sect Master Ouyang Hao repeatedly urged them to stay.

"It's already late—why rush back?"

"You saved the Old Ancestor. You're Infinity Sect's heroes."

"Let me arrange a banquet. Eat and drink your fill before leaving—as thanks, and as a farewell."

But Wu Yue refused outright.

"The Sect Master is too kind."

"Infinity Sect is our second home. Treating the Old Ancestor was our duty."

"No need for a banquet. If the Sect Master ever needs anything, just send word to Command Hall Peak."

"Anything we can help with, we won't refuse."

Watching their departing figures, Ouyang Hao's emotions churned—he couldn't quite describe the feeling.

For a moment, he couldn't tell whether their departure from Infinity Sect was good or bad.

After all, it was only by leaving that they'd achieved their current success, and they'd become powerful external allies for the sect.

The downside was that from now on, the label they carried was no longer Infinity Sect, but Immortal River Sect.
