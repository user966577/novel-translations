Chapter 51: Different Thoughts

Soon.

Xuanyuan Hong led the members of Immortal River Sect rushing out in a great hurry.

When they saw that it really was Myriad Dao Mountain's Sect Master visiting in person, Xuanyuan Hong and his people were utterly shocked.

The group went forward to welcome them with extreme respect and courtesy.

"We had no idea Myriad Dao Mountain would be gracing us with your presence. Please forgive our failure to welcome you properly!" Xuanyuan Hong hastily said politely.

However.

What Xuanyuan Hong and the others didn't expect was that the Myriad Dao Mountain delegation was even more courteous than them.

"Not at all, not at all."

Zhuge Qing bowed his body, putting himself in an extremely low posture. "We're the ones who showed up without prior notice. We're the ones who've intruded."

???

Zhuge Qing's demeanor left Xuanyuan Hong and the others utterly confused.

They felt flattered beyond belief.

If Xuanyuan Hong hadn't seen Zhuge Qing at certain occasions before, he would have suspected this Zhuge Qing was an impostor.

After all.

A power as mighty as Myriad Dao Mountain—why would they be so courteous to their little Immortal River Sect?

However.

Zhuge Qing was equally overwhelmed.

He absolutely didn't believe Immortal River Sect was just a second-rate sect.

With someone like Zhong Qing backing them, in his heart, Immortal River Sect was even higher than the Holy Lands of the Eastern Region.

Yet he never expected that, despite being such a sect, Immortal River Sect would be so low-key, so hospitable.

And so courteous to a minor Myriad Dao Mountain Sect Master like himself.

For a moment, both sides, overwhelmed with feeling honored, became even more courteous, putting themselves in even lower postures.

"Sect Master Zhuge is too kind."

Xuanyuan Hong unconsciously lowered himself a few more inches.

"No, no, no, not at all."

Zhuge Qing hastily waved his hands, naturally lowering himself even more. "Rather, it's Sect Master Xuanyuan who's too kind."

"No, no, no, this is all as it should be."

Seeing Zhuge Qing had lowered himself half a head, Xuanyuan Hong instinctively let his own body sink half an inch more.

And so, the two went back and forth like this.

Until finally, both sides were practically prostrating on the ground, about to kowtow to each other.

The elders following behind both parties naturally followed suit, all of them sticking their backsides up in a comical display.

After this extreme exchange of pleasantries.

The members of both sects finally headed back to Immortal River Sect's main peak together, then sat down and chatted merrily.

The conversation was lively and warm.

Both sides.

Were all smiles.

"I thought building good relations with Immortal River Sect would take some effort. Never expected it to go so smoothly."

Zhuge Qing looked at Xuanyuan Hong with a beaming face, thinking to himself.

"We were just saying how difficult it would be to connect with Myriad Dao Mountain. Never expected it to be this easy."

Xuanyuan Hong likewise looked at Zhuge Qing with a beaming face, thinking to himself.

Their smiling gazes met, and they both quickly gave each other another courteous smile.

"Sect Master Zhuge, I have a favor to ask of you."

"Sect Master Xuanyuan, I have an impertinent request."

At this moment, both spoke simultaneously.

Then they exchanged another knowing smile.

"Hahaha, you first, you first."

"No, no, no, you first, you first."

"Alright, then I'll go first."

Zhuge Qing stroked his beard and said, "When I entered Immortal River Sect just now, I noticed your esteemed sect doesn't have a complete mountain-protecting formation. I thought since we happen to have nothing to do, why not let us help your esteemed sect set up a mountain-protecting formation?"

After hearing this.

Xuanyuan Hong and the others' eyes went wide.

They had expected that Myriad Dao Mountain, visiting today with such courtesy, might have something they needed help with.

So when Zhuge Qing mentioned "an impertinent request," Xuanyuan Hong had mentally prepared himself.

But he never expected this to be the "impertinent request."

Xuanyuan Hong scratched his head in confusion.

This wasn't right.

There was such a good deal?

And what he had just wanted to ask Zhuge Qing for help with was precisely for Myriad Dao Mountain to help Immortal River Sect set up a mountain-protecting formation.

So this was speaking right to his heart!

"Um, Sect Master Zhuge, actually what I was about to say was that I wanted to request Myriad Dao Mountain to help us set up a mountain-protecting formation. I never expected you to bring it up first." After recovering, Xuanyuan Hong said.

"Oh?"

Zhuge Qing's eyes lit up upon hearing this.

He had been wondering how to further improve relations with Immortal River Sect when he remembered their weak mountain-protecting formation, so he brought it up.

Originally, he was quite nervous that doing this would be too presumptuous.

After all, with Zhong Qing backing such a sect, why would they need a minor Myriad Dao Mountain to set up their mountain-protecting formation?

But he never expected Xuanyuan Hong to say this.

This was simply, simply...

In any case, the feeling was beyond wonderful.

It seemed Immortal River Sect likely knew about Zhong Qing saving Myriad Dao Mountain and had guessed their intentions.

Combined with Myriad Dao Mountain's sensible behavior, or perhaps with Zhong Qing's permission, Immortal River Sect was giving them this opportunity to repay the favor.

Thinking of this, Zhuge Qing felt immense gratitude.

Soon, both sides settled the matter of the mountain-protecting formation.

After sitting a while longer, Zhuge Qing prepared to take his people and leave.

"Sect Master Xuanyuan, we'll head back first. After all, setting up a formation requires considerable preparation. We'll prepare and return immediately to set up the formation."

After speaking, Zhuge Qing and the others rose with decisive efficiency, having already decided to complete this matter as quickly as possible.

After a brief farewell, they departed directly.

"They just... left like that?"

Watching Zhuge Qing and his group leave just like that, Xuanyuan Hong and the others stood there dumbfounded.

He didn't believe Myriad Dao Mountain would be this courteous to Immortal River Sect for no reason, let alone set up a formation for them for nothing.

So he was certain Myriad Dao Mountain must have something they needed Immortal River Sect's help with—and not some small matter either.

So at the last moment, he had prepared himself to receive whatever conditions Myriad Dao Mountain would propose.

But they just left like that.

It left them completely baffled.

"What exactly is going on?"

In the grand hall of Immortal River Sect, from Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong down to each Peak Master and elder, everyone collectively scratched their heads at this moment.

"Don't look at me. I can't figure it out either."

Xuanyuan Hong was both delighted and alarmed.

Delighted that the mountain-protecting formation he'd been worried about was solved just like that.

Alarmed that he still couldn't figure out what had gotten into Myriad Dao Mountain.

"I've got it."

Just as everyone was racking their brains, the Third Elder in the crowd suddenly exclaimed.

"What is it?"

Everyone immediately looked at him.

"It's Zhong Qing—it must be because of Zhong Qing!"

The Third Elder said excitedly, "Only because of Zhong Qing's existence would Myriad Dao Mountain act this way!"

With the Third Elder's reminder.

The others also instantly understood.

Yes.

Didn't they know exactly how much Immortal River Sect was worth?

Even if their ancestral graves emitted green smoke, it couldn't possibly make Myriad Dao Mountain act like this!

Only Zhong Qing could possibly make Myriad Dao Mountain behave this way!

Someone in the crowd suddenly remembered intelligence from Heaven's Mandate City—the intelligence showed that when Zhong Qing killed the demonic beast, people from Myriad Dao Mountain had been right there.

Connecting everything together.

It seemed the facts were almost certainly as they suspected.

Involuntarily.

Everyone drew a sharp breath.

Zhong Qing had become even more mysterious in their eyes.

After all, Myriad Dao Mountain was different from other powers. Their overall strength might not be the strongest, but precisely because of their special nature, even the Holy Lands probably wouldn't receive such treatment from Myriad Dao Mountain.

Yet.

Zhong Qing could make Myriad Dao Mountain act this way—that alone was enough to prove that Zhong Qing was far from as simple as he appeared on the surface.
