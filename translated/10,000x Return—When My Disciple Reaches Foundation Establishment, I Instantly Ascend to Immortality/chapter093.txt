Chapter 93: What the Hell—They Became Outer Sect Disciples?

Infinity Hall!

Sect Master Ouyang Hao and the elders waited anxiously outside.

"Sect Master, what exactly happened?"

Sect leaders were converging from all directions.

Clearly, they too had heard about the Old Ancestor's return with severe injuries, though they didn't know the specifics.

Ouyang Hao's face was grim, his expression clouded.

But he patiently explained: "The Old Ancestor entered an ancient secret realm."

"He suffered unimaginable injuries inside. The Sixth Elder is treating him now."

"We'll only know the situation after the Sixth Elder comes out."

Just as he finished speaking, a figure emerged from a side chamber and came directly to the main hall.

This was the Sixth Elder who had been treating the Old Ancestor.

"Sixth Elder, how is the Old Ancestor?"

Sect Master Ouyang Hao immediately stepped forward, his voice tense.

This question also tugged at everyone's hearts.

The Sixth Elder frowned in thought, pacing back and forth in the hall.

His manner made everyone's hearts tighten.

Then they heard him say slowly: "The Old Ancestor's condition is not optimistic."

"Not only are multiple meridians ruptured, but his internal organs have also suffered severe damage."

"If it were only this, with enough precious medicines and my treatment, recovery wouldn't be difficult."

"The problem is that the Old Ancestor's divine soul has also suffered extremely severe trauma."

"This is quite troublesome—I'm powerless to help!"

At these words, the already heavy mood sank even further.

The Sixth Elder was a physician.

His medical skills were considered top-tier throughout all of Infinity Sect.

If even he said he was powerless—

Did that mean everyone could only watch helplessly as the Old Ancestor passed on?

"Sixth Elder, is there truly no solution?"

Sect Master Ouyang Hao pressed, unwilling to give up.

The Sixth Elder pondered for a moment, then said: "It's not that there's no solution at all."

"The Old Ancestor's soul is damaged. To my knowledge, there's a pill called the Soul-Tempering Pill, specifically developed for soul injuries."

"If we could find a Soul-Tempering Pill, I'd be completely confident in saving the Old Ancestor."

"However, the formula is said to have been lost for many years."

"Finding a Soul-Tempering Pill would be like searching for a needle in the ocean—harder than ascending to heaven."

Ouyang Hao asked urgently: "Can other pills substitute?"

The Sixth Elder replied gravely: "Less effective alternatives exist."

"The Soul-Nurturing Pill can serve as a substitute!"

"But even as a substitute, this pill is extremely precious. There's none in circulation."

"Only top-tier alchemists can refine it."

"If we could bring in two alchemy grandmasters, the Old Ancestor might have a chance."

At these words, everyone immediately thought of Pill Cauldron Pavilion.

As everyone knew—

Pill Cauldron Pavilion, one of the five great Holy Lands of the Eastern Region, gathered over seventy percent of the region's top alchemists.

Ouyang Hao asked gravely: "How long can the Old Ancestor hold on?"

"I can sustain his life for three days."

"After three days, even immortals couldn't save him!"

These words made everyone's brows furrow deeply.

Among the five Holy Lands, Pill Cauldron Pavilion was located in the extreme south of the Eastern Region, while Infinity Sect was in the extreme north.

The distance between them was hundreds of thousands of miles.

Setting aside the enormous cost of recruiting Pill Cauldron Pavilion's top alchemists—

Even at that distance, not even an Earth Profound powerhouse could make a round trip in three days!

Just as everyone's hearts grew heavy, the Sixth Elder spoke again: "Sect Master, if we combine the efforts of everyone in our Pill Peak, we might have a slim chance of refining it ourselves."

At these words, Ouyang Hao's eyes lit up.

"Then quickly assemble Pill Peak!"

"However, the Seventh and Eighth Elders have already departed... we don't have enough people."

"They may have left, but asking them to return and help shouldn't be a problem."

The bond between them remained.

With him making the request, Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian would surely give him face.

Thinking this, Ouyang Hao immediately summoned the Shadow Guard leader.

As the Shadow Guard leader arrived, Ouyang Hao promptly asked: "Do you know where the Seventh and Eighth Elders went after leaving the sect?"

The Shadow Guard leader's expression immediately turned peculiar.

Infinity Sect's Shadow Guard organization had influence spanning half the Eastern Region, keeping tabs on every development.

As the Shadow Guard leader, he naturally knew where the two had gone.

He'd even been considering whether to report this to the Sect Master.

Now that the Sect Master asked, he immediately shared everything he knew.

"Reporting to the Sect Master!"

"After the Seventh and Eighth Elders left Infinity Sect, they joined a second-tier sect called Immortal River Sect, becoming outer sect disciples at Command Hall Peak."

"At the recent Immortal Dao Conference, both elders represented Command Hall Peak as outer sect disciples. They swept through all competition with overwhelming force, claiming first place."

"Wh-what?"

At this news, Ouyang Hao's pupils contracted and his eyes went wide.

The other elders and leaders couldn't believe their ears either.

They wondered if something was wrong with their hearing.

Holy Land elders held positions of great authority, revered by tens of thousands. Wherever they went, they commanded attention.

But what were they hearing?

Someone had actually abandoned such a lofty position to join a second-tier sect and become—a mere outer sect disciple?

Was this something a normal person would do?

As Sect Master of Infinity Sect, Ouyang Hao felt even worse.

When the Seventh and Eighth Elders had resigned, they'd said they wanted to retire from worldly affairs.

And the result?

They'd immediately thrown themselves into another sect's embrace.

If they'd gone to a better sect than Infinity Sect, or a platform more suited to their development, Ouyang Hao could understand.

Like Pill Cauldron Pavilion!

That organization could provide things Infinity Sect couldn't.

But now, they'd joined a mere second-tier sect.

Second-tier!

In what way was his Infinity Sect inferior to some second-tier sect?

Ouyang Hao felt deceived, and a nameless fury burned within him.

Anger, confusion, bewilderment... countless emotions churned in his eyes.

He prided himself on treating them well, yet their actions had thoroughly wounded his heart. More than anything, he was baffled.

But this wasn't the time for anger.

The Old Ancestor was in critical condition.

The Seventh and Eighth Elders were the only lifeline they could grasp.

"Where is Immortal River Sect? I shall go there personally!"

He took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing his negative emotions.

The Shadow Guard leader respectfully produced a map.

He thoughtfully marked the exact coordinates.

Privately, he couldn't help but think—

This Immortal River Sect seemed rather strange!

Previously, the Eighth Elder had aggressively demanded a map to Immortal River Sect from him.

Shortly after, he'd disappeared.

The Seventh Elder had been the same.

After both returned to the sect briefly, the next they heard of them, they'd become outer sect disciples at that very sect.

Now the Sect Master was asking for a map...

"Hiss..."

He drew in a cold breath, forcibly suppressing the unrealistic thought in his mind.
