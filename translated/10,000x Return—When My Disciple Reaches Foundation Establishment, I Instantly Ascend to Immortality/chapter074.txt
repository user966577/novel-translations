Chapter 74: Zhong Qing's Test Subject

When Shi Xiaotian came to, he felt as if his head was about to split apart!

His brain felt like it had been struck by a meteor.

After recovering for quite a while, he asked a rather philosophical question.

"Who am I?"

"Where am I?"

"What am I doing?"

Another quarter hour passed.

He finally sorted out his thoughts.

"I am the Holy Land's Eighth Elder!"

"I came here to find the Heaven Spirit Grass at Immortal River Sect."

"But it seems I was ambushed by some villain!"

Clearly, Zhong Qing had struck too fast—so fast that Shi Xiaotian didn't even see what happened before he was knocked out.

He raised his head to survey his surroundings!

This was a small quadrangle courtyard.

The courtyard was rather refined!

In the center stood a pill furnace.

In front of the furnace was a well. To the front right of the well were two trees.

One was a jujube tree, and the other was also a jujube tree.

Beside the courtyard was a pen.

Inside the pen was a pig.

It all looked extremely down-to-earth, like a rural farmyard.

"Oh, awake!"

At this moment, Zhong Qing walked out from the inner courtyard carrying a pile of spirit herbs.

Seeing Shi Xiaotian trussed up and tied to a tree, he smiled.

Even as a prisoner, Shi Xiaotian still exuded boundless arrogance.

"If you know what's good for you, release me at once!"

"I am a Holy Land elder."

"The wrath of Infinity Sect is not something your little Immortal River Sect can bear."

"Don't bring disaster upon your sect!"

He glared coldly, his tone haughty, acting like he was above everyone.

Zhong Qing's smile didn't change.

"Here, eat this pill!"

He pulled out the Lump Pill he'd refined.

Without another word, he tried to stuff it into Shi Xiaotian's mouth.

The latter's pupils contracted violently.

Looking at the thing in Zhong Qing's hand, he felt his stomach churning.

He ground his teeth: "You call that a pill?"

As a powerful alchemist, he had seen too many formulas and too many pills.

Quality ranging from flawless to crude and rough.

But he had never seen an irregularly shaped lump of a pill.

The key was not just its lumpy shape.

Its unique appearance—spotted and speckled, impurities piled up, overall yellow in color.

It looked like... excrement.

Others might say someone's alchemy was like refining shit—that was a figure of speech.

But Zhong Qing had literally refined something that looked like shit.

"A scholar may be killed but not humiliated!"

"Boy, you dare insult me like this!"

Shi Xiaotian struggled desperately, refusing to comply.

However, when Zhong Qing punched him in the stomach, he doubled over, mouth gaping open like a limp shrimp.

"Why make this difficult? Just cooperate with me!"

Zhong Qing stuffed the pill into Shi Xiaotian's mouth with lightning speed.

The pill's effect was quite explosive.

The moment he swallowed it, there was an instant reaction.

Shi Xiaotian's entire body began convulsing.

Foam frothed from his mouth, his eyes rolled back.

His stomach churned violently, and layers of red rashes broke out across his face.

Numb and itchy!

"This shouldn't be happening!"

Zhong Qing frowned.

All the ingredients were clearly beneficial spirit herbs.

How did putting them all together produce negative effects instead of enhancing each other?

"Tell me honestly—are you allergic to pills?"

In Zhong Qing's understanding.

Only a pill allergy could explain these symptoms.

"Allergic my..."

At this moment, Shi Xiaotian was so angry he nearly cursed.

He was a distinguished senior alchemist.

His alchemy skills might not be unmatched under heaven, but throughout the Eastern Region, he held a seat of honor.

Now someone was asking if he was allergic to pills?

This question was as ridiculous as asking a fish if it knew how to swim.

Seeing he wasn't being cooperative!

Zhong Qing couldn't help saying: "You'd better describe your reactions one by one so I can improve the formula."

"Otherwise, I'll just have to test pills on you step by step."

His response was Shi Xiaotian's hoarse roaring.

"You'd better not let me escape."

"Otherwise, I'll annihilate your entire clan and leave nothing behind."

His eyes were red, his heart filled with venom.

His killing intent erupted like a small volcano, each wave higher than the last.

For Shi Xiaotian, he was a Holy Land elder.

Extraordinary methods, powerful strength, deep background, and alchemy skills that could be called peerless.

Someone like him—wherever he went, wasn't he looked up to by ten thousand?

When had he ever suffered such humiliation? When had he ever taken such a loss?

One could say that every degree his discomfort increased, his hatred for Zhong Qing grew by the same measure.

As for Shi Xiaotian's threats, Zhong Qing paid them no mind.

A Holy Land wasn't anything remarkable. In his eyes, it was just so-so.

The other's performance was merely impotent rage.

He continued his alchemy.

Continued his experiments.

And recorded the data!

The amount of spirit herbs put in each batch, what differences arose from different ratios.

What effects did temperature have on pills?

What differences existed between the same pill refined with different techniques.

Clinical reactions after consuming the finished product.

What needed improvement, what needed attention.

His little notebook was filled with dense data and Zhong Qing's alchemy insights.

He had to admit, with this Violet-Azure Spirit Furnace.

Zhong Qing's alchemy success rate had greatly improved.

If before his pill yield was around twenty percent, now it was close to thirty percent.

Of course, a large portion still came out in lump form.

The shapes were quite innovative.

The colors were far from satisfactory.

Either black sesame-like or dark yellow.

Either smelling burnt or pungently spicy.

All these pills ultimately ended up in Shi Xiaotian's stomach.

The clinical reactions remained intense!

Either causing his stomach to churn with endless flatulence!

Or causing full-body numbness with partial paralysis.

Eventually his whole body broke out in pus, forming pustule after pustule.

Making him look like a toad.

By now, Shi Xiaotian had lost all his former arrogance.

He lay on the ground like a dead dog.

He couldn't muster any more tough words!

His vitality was utterly depleted.

He looked as if he'd just walked through hell.

Zhong Qing stroked his chin.

His expression grave as he pondered.

What exactly had gone wrong?

Logically, he was refining a Myriad Spirit Treasure Pill that could improve physique, repair injuries, calm the mind and spirit—a multi-functional pill.

But the effects were a hundred and eight thousand miles from what he'd expected.

He looked at the data in his records.

Carefully analyzed it, checking for gaps.

Finally, he slapped his forehead.

He understood!

The saying goes: extremes meet, and excess leads to reversal.

Blindly pursuing ultimate perfection often results in unsatisfying outcomes.

"So I need to find some poison to neutralize the spirit herbs' properties!"

Having found what he believed was the key to the problem, Zhong Qing immediately threw himself enthusiastically into his alchemy enterprise.

"I... I'm begging you, stop refining!"

Nearby, Shi Xiaotian's face went green when he heard Zhong Qing was going to add poison.
