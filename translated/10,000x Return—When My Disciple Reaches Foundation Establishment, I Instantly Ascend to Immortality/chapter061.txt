Chapter 61: Leave Room in Your Actions for Future Meetings

Among these dozen or so people, there were both men and women.

The men were handsome and noble in bearing, the women possessed extraordinary temperament.

All were true disciples of Dawn Mist Valley.

Each one possessed considerable strength.

"Junior Sister, what happened here?"

A slightly older man stepped forward, quickly treating Lin Yuexia's wounds and stopping her bleeding while asking.

One had to admit, a Holy Land truly lived up to its name.

Lin Yuexia, who had just been injured, had already recovered her ability to move after taking a single healing pill.

She pointed at Zhong Qing.

Her voice filled with indignation: "Senior Brother, this thief isn't a disciple of our Dawn Mist Valley at all."

"He trespassed into our Dawn Mist Valley's restricted area, and I caught him!"

"He actually tried to silence me by killing me."

"You must seek justice for me!"

She assumed a pitiful posture, directly positioning herself as the victim.

Not mentioning at all that she had struck first, nor how arrogant and haughty she had been, treating others as nothing.

Upon hearing this.

The surrounding crowd instantly became furious.

"Bold thief, how dare you trespass into our Dawn Mist Valley, injure our Holy Land's true disciple—do you think our Dawn Mist Valley has no one capable of dealing with you!"

A group of people pointed their swords at Zhong Qing, their expressions hostile.

Zhong Qing couldn't be bothered to waste words with them.

Truth and justice were forever held in the hands of the strong.

Only the weak would pursue that illusory fairness with humble postures!

"Come at me together!"

He stood with hands behind his back, his expression calm and unruffled.

Hearing Zhong Qing's words, the dozen disciples were furious beyond measure.

"Running wild in our Dawn Mist Valley, and you still dare to be so arrogant—do you truly think our Dawn Mist Valley has no capable people?"

The atmosphere instantly became tense.

It looked as though a great battle could break out at any moment.

"Stop!"

Just then, a clear voice rang out like a great bell, like a drum.

It echoed through the valley!

Immediately after, a streak of light descended from the sky.

"Sect Master!"

The group of true disciples were overjoyed upon seeing who had arrived.

Although Zhong Qing hadn't displayed any cultivation fluctuations just now.

That mountain-like composure and presence had put immense pressure on them.

Moreover, Lin Yuexia was no weakling.

Among those present, she ranked among the top.

Yet she had still been beaten into severe injury!

From the start to the end of the battle, though they hadn't witnessed it firsthand, those with keen eyes could tell from the clues that it had lasted only a few breaths.

Against such a person, even if they all attacked together, they had no certainty of victory.

Now things were better—the Sect Master had arrived!

They were confident that before the Sect Master's overwhelming strength, all demons and monsters would be subdued and executed!

Lin Yuexia especially.

The look she gave Zhong Qing was filled with hatred and vindication.

Her expression seemed to say: You're dead!

But the next scene left everyone stunned.

Lu Qingxia came before Zhong Qing, her face filled with apprehension: "Senior, my sect's disciple was ignorant of propriety and offended you."

"For this transgression, Qingxia offers her sincere apologies."

"What's going on?"

"Who exactly is this person?"

"To warrant our Sect Master personally apologizing!"

The group of true disciples was dumbfounded.

All wore expressions as if they'd seen a ghost.

Who was their Sect Master?

She was the master of an Eastern Region Holy Land!

One of the highest-ranking existences in terms of power and status in the entire Eastern Region.

Worshipped by ten thousand, revered by the world!

Yet now, such an existence was actually showing apprehension before a young man.

Her posture so low—unheard of, unseen.

Even if their Old Ancestor descended in person, she probably wouldn't cause their Sect Master to act this way!

If Lu Qingxia knew their thoughts, she would probably let out a bitter laugh: Our Old Ancestor and this Senior really can't be compared.

After all, one of Zhong Qing's servants had Earth Profound cultivation.

While their Old Ancestor was merely at Earth Profound as well!

At this moment, Lin Yuexia, the person at the center of all this, was completely stupefied.

Zhong Qing had said earlier that he was invited here by the Sect Master.

But she hadn't taken it seriously at all.

Now it seemed this was actually true.

And judging from the Sect Master's posture, this was clearly a powerhouse even stronger than her own Sect Master.

Thinking about her earlier actions, how she had spoken rudely to such a terrifying powerhouse and had even nearly decided to kill him.

Her heart was filled with fear and unease!

"What exactly happened here?"

Lu Qingxia's face was filled with anger as she turned to address the disciples with a dark expression.

The disciples exchanged glances, trembling under Lu Qingxia's stern gaze, and finally all directed their gazes at Lin Yuexia.

The latter's face instantly turned deathly pale.

These gazes felt like mountains pressing down on her, making it hard to breathe.

But she knew that some things couldn't be solved by avoidance.

Her mind racing.

She immediately knelt before Lu Qingxia, crying and pleading: "Sect Master, this is entirely my fault!"

"I mistook this Senior for someone who had trespassed into our Holy Land."

"Thinking of the sect's safety, I tried to subdue him first."

"All the fault lies with me. I only hope the Sect Master, in consideration of my wholehearted devotion to the sect, will forgive me this once."

She performed the role of a pitiful, helpless woman to perfection.

Combined with her natural beauty, it truly made one want to embrace and comfort her.

At this moment, Lin Yuexia knew that debating right and wrong was undoubtedly an extremely foolish decision.

In the cultivation world, the strong were supreme!

She had offended someone she couldn't afford to offend—that was her original sin.

Better to admit fault first.

Then play pitiful and innocent.

With her status as a true disciple, the Sect Master would very likely raise the board high but let it fall lightly.

She had tried this tactic many times—it was foolproof.

However, she had underestimated Zhong Qing's position in Lu Qingxia's heart.

Upon hearing that Lin Yuexia had actually attacked Zhong Qing.

Lu Qingxia's face darkened to the point where water could drip from it.

Zhong Qing was someone she had invited to rescue Dawn Mist Valley's Third Ancestor!

Now, a mere true disciple had dared to provoke him so brazenly.

The matter hadn't even been handled yet, and the person had nearly been mortally offended!

Once this triggered Zhong Qing's fury, forget about saving anyone—whether Dawn Mist Valley could continue to exist would be questionable.

Thinking this, her anger grew by three more degrees.

She immediately addressed Lin Yuexia in an icy tone: "From today onward, you are stripped of your true disciple status and sentenced to a hundred years of facing the wall at Contemplation Cliff!"

When a Sect Master punished disciples, they typically sought to be fair and justified.

Using sect rules to measure and punishment to judge, striving to make the punished accept their fate willingly.

But Lu Qingxia was too angry now to even look for regulations.

She directly issued the final judgment.

Upon this verdict, all the true disciples gasped in shock.

Lin Yuexia collapsed to the ground as if her spine had been ripped out.

Being a true disciple had given her a lofty status, allowing her to enjoy countless conveniences and privileges.

Naturally, it had also made her enemies.

Once this status was stripped away, her former enemies would surely swarm like sharks smelling blood.

With her cultivation, she wasn't worried.

After all, though she was arrogant, she only offended those she could bully.

However, Contemplation Cliff was a place of punishment.

Many who entered that place were corroded by baleful energy, their strength declining rather than advancing. The longer they stayed, the more their power suffered.

A hundred years of facing the wall at Contemplation Cliff was enough to cripple all her cultivation.

These two punishments combined were a hundred times crueler than simply killing her.

At this moment, Zhong Qing's earlier words kept echoing in her ears.

"Leave room in your actions for future meetings!"

Unfortunately, she hadn't!

An endless wave of regret swept through her heart, making her regret until her intestines turned green.

If only she had listened to even one of those words earlier, she wouldn't have ended up in such a state!
