Chapter 57: Heibai at Earth Profound Realm

Speaking of Zhong Qing lately, life had been quite comfortable.

Every day drinking wine, sleeping soundly, while his cultivation shot up like it was nothing!

But when a person has too much free time, it's not necessarily a good thing.

One needs to find something to do.

Just recently, the system check-in had given him a Myriad Origins Pill Scripture!

Zhong Qing began studying the art of alchemy.

Wispy smoke rose up, accompanied by roaring flames!

A large cauldron stood in the small courtyard!

Zhong Qing studied with a serious expression, arranging spiritual herbs!

"Blood Spirit Flower, one blossom!"

"Bodhi Fruit, half a piece!"

"Ancient Spirit Wood, three coins' weight!"

Following the Myriad Origins Pill Scripture's instructions, Zhong Qing added various spiritual herbs into the furnace in the proper sequence and amounts.

These spiritual materials were all provided by Immortal River Sect.

As a member of Immortal River Sect, Command Hall Peak received quite a generous allocation of cultivation resources every year.

Unfortunately, they had all been gathering dust in the warehouse before.

Now they finally had a use.

"Hmm?"

"Seems like I'm missing one ingredient!"

Zhong Qing stroked his chin, trying to find a substitute among his spiritual herbs.

Unfortunately, his search turned up nothing.

He was refining a Beauty Enhancement Pill!

He thought himself already handsome enough, but who could refuse going up another level in looks?

So he took this pill quite seriously.

Even half a point reduction in effectiveness wasn't something he wanted to see.

"Heibai, where are you?"

As Zhong Qing's voice fell, the Heibai puppet appeared.

It bowed respectfully to Zhong Qing: "Master!"

"I'm missing a key ingredient for this pill—Mountain Treasure. Go find one for me!"

Zhong Qing gave the direct order.

A so-called Mountain Treasure!

Was a rare and precious object nurtured by the mountains and rivers of heaven and earth.

Considered a mountain spirit.

Gathering the essence of heaven and earth, the mysteries of sun and moon.

Once it gained sentience, a Mountain Treasure could even evolve into a divine spirit.

Also called a Divine Spirit Embryo!

Zhong Qing explained to Heibai the characteristics of Mountain Treasure as recorded in the Myriad Origins Pill Scripture, which locations were most likely to nurture them, and the methods for identification and selection.

After that, he suddenly remembered he had recently checked in and received a Puppet Cultivation Upgrade Card.

This upgrade card was truly a conscience-worthy item from the system.

Simply use it on a puppet, and the puppet's realm would reach the same level as his own, allowing it to better serve him.

Originally, Zhong Qing wanted to wait until his own realm was higher before using it on Heibai. But thinking that he had just broken through to Earth Profound Realm, and reaching higher realms would take some time even with ten-thousand-fold amplification.

So after careful consideration, he decided to use it on Heibai now.

After all, a puppet like Heibai—possessing autonomous intelligence, appearing identical to a real person, and completely obedient to commands—was quite useful. Many tasks could be delegated to it, convenient and practical.

If its strength was too weak and it got killed while out and about, that would be a huge loss.

So upgrading its level quickly was the safer option.

As for future upgrades, since check-in could yield an upgrade card once, it should be able to yield one again in the future.

Soon, as Zhong Qing lightly tapped Heibai's forehead.

The next moment, Heibai's cultivation began to surge wildly.

Almost without pause.

From Moon Profound Realm it rose to Sun Profound Realm, and finally reached Earth Profound Realm before stopping.

Sure enough.

Heibai's realm had now matched Zhong Qing's level.

"Life with cheats is just this plain and boring."

Zhong Qing was quite satisfied, amusing himself with a quip.

Then he sent Heibai off to find the Mountain Treasure.

As for himself, he continued controlling the furnace temperature.

In the cultivation world, refining a batch of pills taking three and a half years was commonplace.

This batch Zhong Qing was refining was relatively simple.

A few days should be enough.

Once Heibai found the Mountain Treasure and added it in, the pills should be ready.

Among the wild mountain ranges!

Beast roars echoed from time to time.

This was Myriad Beast Mountain!

A paradise for demonic beasts.

Powerful demonic beasts lived within!

For ordinary people to enter this place was practically a death sentence.

All the villages living nearby treated this as a forbidden zone.

Yet on this day, Myriad Beast Mountain received two unexpected visitors!

Two women of stunning beauty and ethereal bearing!

The younger one wore white, like a white lotus, like a lily—graceful and refined, transcendent and otherworldly, brimming with spiritual energy.

The older one had silver-white hair, cold and supremely beautiful, like an azure lotus gracing the world.

These two were none other than Dawn Mist Valley's Sect Master Lu Qingxia and Saintess Su Wenjiu.

The two had departed from Dawn Mist Valley, crossing thousands of mountains and rivers.

Passing through Myriad Beast Mountain!

They paused here briefly to rest.

"Master, heading west from here for another thousand miles, we'll reach Immortal River Sect!"

Su Wenjiu pointed west, speaking respectfully.

Lu Qingxia stood with hands behind her back.

Looking at the distant white clouds.

She felt her decision had been too hasty.

A problem even she, a Holy Land Sect Master, couldn't solve—how could someone from a small backwater place possibly manage it?

Rather than pinning hopes on Zhong Qing, she might as well hope for a chance encounter with Dawn Mist Valley's Old Ancestor to request her help.

But what was done was done. Thinking more was useless.

Having come all this way, she couldn't very well turn back now.

Just as her thoughts wandered.

Among the mountain ranges, a sudden change occurred. The void trembled.

A streak of divine light flashed by.

Radiant treasure light spilled forth, filling the sky.

A shadow flew past her.

"What's this?"

Lu Qingxia's eyes narrowed.

In her startled glimpse, she caught sight of its true form.

It was fist-sized, like a rough stone, like a ball of flesh.

Its entire body was red.

Astonishing spiritual light emanated from it.

That aura—one whiff was refreshing, and even an anxious heart couldn't help but calm down.

"Mountain Treasure!"

Lu Qingxia exclaimed.

Mountain Treasure could not only be used in medicine, enhancing medicinal properties a hundredfold.

Adding just a fingernail's worth to alchemy could increase quality several times over.

Even if consumed directly, it could temper the body, increase cultivation, and strengthen the soul.

It was truly a treasure that appeared once in a hundred years.

Even Holy Land sects had extremely few of such treasures in their collections.

Lu Qingxia's heart pounded.

She never expected that a simple journey out would bring such an opportunity.

Having encountered it, she naturally couldn't let it go.

Almost without hesitation, she reached out her hand to grab the Mountain Treasure.

But another hand was a step faster.

It seized the Mountain Treasure first, clutching it in its palm.

The owner of this hand was Heibai!

"This treasure is mine!"

Heibai declared ownership of the Mountain Treasure.

"Treasures of the world belong to those with the ability to take them!"

"You think you can take this treasure from under my nose? I'm afraid that won't be easy!"

Lu Qingxia's gaze was deep and cold.

The aura unique to a peak Sun Profound powerhouse instantly exploded.

Disturbing the void, shaking the clouds.

Frightening nearby demonic beasts into panicked flight.

Peak Sun Profound Realm—in the entire Eastern Region, this was a top-ranking existence.

Lu Qingxia was extremely confident.

Confident that this Mountain Treasure was already in the bag.

As she spoke, her pale jade hand reached forward.

About to snatch the Mountain Treasure!

But the next moment, a massive hand came crashing down like a mountain.

"Boom—"

Between heaven and earth, a sonic boom rang out.

Heibai swung his hand.

The aura unique to an Earth Profound powerhouse exploded in an instant.

It directly sent Lu Qingxia flying over a dozen yards!

"An Earth Profound powerhouse!"

She cried out in shock, her spirit shaken.

If not for sensing a strong threat to her life at the crucial moment and summoning Dawn Mist Valley's supreme treasure to block the attack, being sent flying a dozen yards would have been the least of her worries.

From that single clash, she would have been crippled if not dead!

Lu Qingxia never imagined she would encounter such a terrifying powerhouse in a place like this.

This level of existence, even in her Holy Land, would be an Old Ancestor-level figure.

Throughout the entire Eastern Region, this was an absolute apex figure.

"Senior, this junior was rude!"

She suppressed her inner shock and immediately apologized to Heibai.

Heibai coldly glanced at her without speaking.

Taking the Mountain Treasure, he transformed into a rainbow of light and shot through the sky.

Lu Qingxia watched his departing figure, unable to suppress a wave of lingering fear.

Fortunately, the other party hadn't held it against her.

If it had been a powerhouse with a bad temper, this wouldn't have ended so easily.

Today's incident had taught her an unforgettable lesson!

Indeed, she had underestimated the heroes of the world!

In this world, there was no shortage of hidden powerhouses.
