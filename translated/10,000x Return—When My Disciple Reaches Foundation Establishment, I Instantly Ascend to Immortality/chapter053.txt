Chapter 53: No, It's You Who Doesn't Understand

The quiet night was occasionally broken by beast howls!

Adding a touch of life and vitality to the vast empty sky.

Command Hall Peak!

A bonfire blazed brightly, chunks of roasting meat sizzling with dripping oil.

The aroma was enticing, making mouths water!

Zhong Qing ate his meat, drank his wine, and under the moonlight, reflected on the past and envisioned the future.

He felt there was a special charm to days like this.

Cultivation, cultivation—seeking longevity, pursuing freedom, enjoying contentment.

Right now, he felt quite content.

He'd achieved one of the three essentials of cultivation.

"Master, I'm back!"

Just then, Lin Feng came walking under the moonlight.

He carried a pile of vegetables, fruits, and meat, with a pig in tow.

"You brat, I just asked you to buy some food. What did you bring a pig back for?"

Zhong Qing laughed and scolded.

"Doesn't Master like pork?"

As Lin Feng spoke, he approached and placed the purchased food one by one on the wooden rack beside the bonfire.

Then he immediately turned to slaughter the pig.

Zhong Qing called out, "This is enough already."

"Keep the pig for now. Fatten it up before slaughtering!"

"Come, sit down!"

Around the small bonfire!

Zhong Qing sat on one side, with Lin Feng and Su Ye on either side.

Bai Ling, as a guest, was also present.

What should have been a transcendent cultivation mountain had now taken on some earthly warmth!

Master and disciples chatted and laughed.

The atmosphere was exceptionally warm and harmonious.

Yet Bai Ling was heavy-hearted, out of place with her surroundings.

"Miss Bai, to wine we sing, for life is short."

"Happy or not, each day passes the same."

"Why not enjoy the moment and not waste your prime years."

Zhong Qing took a swig of wine and counseled her.

Bai Ling smiled bitterly.

How she wished she could cast off her chains, fly freely, and face life with a smile.

But life came with too many helpless situations.

Great enemies could come knocking at any moment.

Especially since the people of Command Hall Peak were so kind.

A refreshing stream in the cultivation world.

Whenever she thought about how they might suffer calamity because of her.

Her heart felt blocked.

At this moment, Lin Feng spoke with his mouth full of oil, "Miss Bai, actually there's no need to worry about those so-called enemies."

"With my master's abilities, protecting you is more than enough."

"That's right, Sister Bai. Before I met Master, I was also being persecuted by bad people."

Little Su Ye chimed in from the side.

"That Xue Kuang guy was super powerful."

"He wanted to dig out my heart and drain my blood for a pill ingredient."

"But guess what? Facing Master, he couldn't resist at all—killed with a single finger!"

"So you can rest easy!"

Bai Ling happened to have heard of Xue Kuang.

Just a Dawn Profound demonic cultivator.

To ordinary people, such a person was indeed a formidable figure.

But compared to her enemies, he was nothing.

"You don't understand!"

Bai Ling seemed to be responding, yet also murmuring to herself.

"My enemies are terrifying beyond your comprehension."

"No matter what I say, you won't believe me."

Little Su Ye and Lin Feng both fell silent.

Especially Lin Feng, who really wanted to say:

"No, it's you who doesn't understand. You don't comprehend Master's true strength!"

But in the end, he held back.

Master's strength needed no explanation.

Once she had a chance to witness it, she would naturally understand.

The atmosphere grew heavy.

Bai Ling forced a smile and said, "I'm sorry. I've spoiled your mood because of me."

"It's getting late. I should head back."

As she spoke, she said her farewells to everyone.

With heavy steps, she slowly departed.

Moonlight like water, stars dotting the sky.

The three master and disciples continued eating and drinking, their spirits unaffected by her departure.

Just then.

A figure sliced through the sky and descended.

This was a middle-aged man in black robes with a fierce expression.

His entire body was ethereal—clearly not flesh and blood, but a spirit form.

Evidently, to obtain a new body, he had already abandoned his previous one.

But his aura was extremely terrifying.

It disturbed the winds and clouds, shook the void.

It blanketed the area for a hundred yards around.

This commotion naturally alerted Zhong Qing and his group immediately.

Seeing the aggressive, hostile appearance of the newcomer.

Lin Feng rose and shouted angrily, "Who goes there?!"

"How dare you trespass on Command Hall Peak!"

The black-robed man laughed sinisterly, completely ignoring Lin Feng.

Instead, his piercing gaze fixed on Zhong Qing.

This was none other than the mysterious existence who had been lurking in Immortal River Sect, disguised as Sect Master Xuanyuan Hong's close personal attendant.

His name was Cang Yu.

A terrifying powerhouse who had surpassed Sky Profound Realm.

Everyone knew that cultivation in this world was divided into Body Tempering, Acquired, Innate, Dawn Profound, Star Profound, Moon Profound, Sun Profound, Earth Profound, and Sky Profound.

But many didn't know that beyond Sky Profound lay the Three Yin Realm and Three Yang Realm.

Each realm was further divided into three levels.

Though Cang Yu had lost his physical body and was left with only a remnant soul, having subsequently been forced to possess a minor Immortal River Sect disciple.

He was still a solid Second-Level Three Yin Realm powerhouse.

Such an existence—even the Holy Lands wouldn't dare provoke him. In fact, no one of this level existed in the entire Eastern Region.

Cang Yu's appearance even alerted Sword Elder, who was hibernating in Lin Feng's ring.

"Young Lin, this person is extremely powerful—not someone you can currently afford to provoke. You should be careful."

Lin Feng didn't take this to heart at all.

"With Master here, what's there to fear?"

These words left the well-meaning Sword Elder completely stunned.

That's right!

Young Lin's master was an ultra-supreme powerhouse.

Someone terrifying enough to stuff Imperial Dao Scriptures into sacks.

A freak who could single-handedly defy fate and transform trash into world-shaking geniuses.

With such a person around, no enemy was really worth making a fuss about.

"What's wrong with me these days?"

"My composure is really regressing."

"I can't even see what Young Lin understands so clearly. Being so jumpy—that's beneath me."

Sword Elder reflected on himself, deciding to be more composed in the future.

Otherwise, his panicky appearance would only make people look down on him.

At the same time, in the void.

Cang Yu was sizing up Zhong Qing.

"Never expected that an almighty Immortal Emperor would have such a down-to-earth side."

Zhong Qing: "..."

"Are you talking to me?"

This guy couldn't have mistaken him for someone else, could he?

These brief words left Sword Elder in Lin Feng's ring—who had just warned himself to stay calm—completely unable to hold it together!

What was going on?

Zhong Qing was an Immortal Emperor?!

Yes!

He should have realized this earlier.

What level could casually produce Imperial Dao Scriptures?

What level could throw around Venerable-grade, Saint-grade, even Imperial-grade divine weapons?

Who in the world could do this except an Immortal Emperor?

For a moment, Sword Elder was so excited he nearly fainted.

It was the uncontrollable emotion of a fan meeting their idol.

What kind of existence was an Immortal Emperor?

That was a legendary figure who could suppress an entire era and create supreme legends.

One could say that even at his peak, he wouldn't even have qualified to meet an Immortal Emperor.

Now, a living Immortal Emperor stood right before his eyes.

How could he not be wildly excited, how could he not be ecstatically joyful?

Lin Feng watched Sword Elder trembling like he was having a fit inside the ring.

"Sword Elder, are you alright?"

"I'm fine. I've never been better."

"Young Lin, I must say, your luck makes me so envious I could go mad."

"To take an Immortal Emperor as your master—how many geniuses dream of this their entire lives?"

Sword Elder's eyes had reddened from the excitement.

These words sent ripples through Lin Feng's heart.

He truly felt that being able to take Zhong Qing as his master in this lifetime was the greatest fortune imaginable—using up all the luck of his entire life.
