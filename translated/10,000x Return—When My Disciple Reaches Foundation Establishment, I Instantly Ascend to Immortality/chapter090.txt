Chapter 90: Courtesy Demands Reciprocity

Time flew by like a fleeting horse!

In the blink of an eye, over a month had passed.

During this time, Zhong Qing's life was remarkably peaceful.

He practiced alchemy, occasionally went down the mountain for wine, and sometimes played chess and chatted with the old beggar.

It felt like a life of perfect tranquility, a painting of human contentment.

Yet if life contained only these things, wouldn't it be too thin?

This day!

Immortal River Sect was decorated with lanterns and colored banners, draped in red and green. The sound of flutes and drums reached the heavens—it was extraordinarily lively.

At the same time, a figure arrived from afar and headed straight for Command Hall Peak.

This made Zhong Qing, who was refining pills in the courtyard, pause in surprise.

He went out to greet his guest.

"Seeing the Sect Master's radiant face and beaming smile—has something good happened?"

Xuanyuan Hong wore a bright red robe today.

The joy in his eyes seemed ready to overflow.

"Why don't you guess where this joy comes from?"

As they spoke, Zhong Qing had already led Xuanyuan Hong into the small courtyard's reception hall.

After pouring him a cup of tea, he said unhurriedly: "The Sect Master must be referring to the Immortal Dao Conference results."

At the mention of the conference, Xuanyuan Hong's mouth curled irrepressibly upward.

"Since our Immortal River Sect began participating in the Immortal Dao Conference, we've always ranked among the lower middle tier."

"Every time, we've been called tailenders, soy sauce passers."

"But this time, Command Hall Peak's two outer sect disciples truly brought glory to our Immortal River Sect."

"The two swept through all the major sects with overwhelming force, crushing countless prodigies. Even when some sect leaders couldn't sit still and personally entered the fray, they were still thoroughly suppressed."

"You should have seen their faces when they learned that Command Hall Peak's two outer sect disciples were former elders of Infinity Sect Holy Land. They turned green!"

"They cursed us for being shameless."

"But you know what? That feeling of them being furious but unable to do anything about it—absolutely exhilarating!"

These words made Zhong Qing chuckle.

He could imagine those people's desperate and frantic complaints.

The Immortal Dao Conference was meant to be an exchange among sect disciples—yet more than a mere exchange.

It was a stage for prodigies to make their names.

A grand gathering of handsome young men and beautiful women, the younger generation's arena.

And then two old fossils barged in.

Moreover, they were beings whose strength made others look up in awe.

The complexity of emotions must have been quite something.

Just imagining the scene brought a strange sense of absurdity.

"You've cultivated some remarkable talents for the sect!"

At this point, Xuanyuan Hong sighed with emotion.

"Besides Command Hall Peak's two outer sect disciples making a splash and winning face for our Immortal River Sect—"

"Lin Feng and Su Ye also displayed the supreme elegance of our young generation."

"Both at tender ages, they defeated thirty-eight prodigies from various sects. Cross-realm battles for them were like eating and drinking."

"After this, our Immortal River Sect will leap from a second-tier sect to first-tier!"

"All of this is thanks to you!"

The Immortal Dao Conference wasn't merely a comparison of disciples among major sects.

It involved complex situations and intricate webs of interest.

This time, Immortal River Sect had swept through with overwhelming dominance, claiming first place and building tremendous prestige.

With reputation and strength combined—

Rising from second-tier to first-tier was inevitable.

Xuanyuan Hong knew Zhong Qing would lead the sect to greatness.

But he hadn't expected it to happen this way.

So swift, so fierce.

"On behalf of the entire sect, I thank you for your contributions!"

As he spoke, Xuanyuan Hong rose to bow to Zhong Qing.

But Zhong Qing immediately stopped him.

"Sect Master, such a grand gesture is uncalled for."

He said solemnly: "Since joining the sect, I've received great kindness."

"And the Sect Master's protection has been constant."

"Compared to what the sect has done for me, this small contribution is hardly worth mentioning."

Zhong Qing's respect for Xuanyuan Hong came from the heart.

After his master Daoist Nai passed away, if not for the Sect Master's repeated protection, Command Hall Peak might not have survived.

And in his former state without cultivation, leaving Command Hall Peak—even with his many trump cards—survival would have been extremely difficult without a foundation. His supposed mountains of treasure might have become millstones around his neck.

For this alone, Xuanyuan Hong deserved his respect.

This day, the two talked at length.

Xuanyuan Hong practically floated away when he left.

Zhong Qing's attitude showed high identification with and belonging to Immortal River Sect.

Whether it was the two Holy Land elders joining, or the growth and rise of Command Hall Peak's two true disciples—

All indicated that Immortal River Sect's ascent was imminent.

Previously, Xuanyuan Hong had labored tirelessly for the sect's development, giving his all.

But now, he was enjoying the benefits of a free ride.

The opportunity had appeared—the question was how to ride it out in style.

This was worth pondering deeply.

On Command Hall Peak!

After Xuanyuan Hong's departure, Zhong Qing ignored the outside world's clamor and threw himself back into his alchemy endeavors.

Whether it was truly a lack of talent for alchemy, or simply biting off more than he could chew—

After consuming several more batches of Soul-Tempering Pill ingredients, he ended up refining nothing.

Before, at least he produced something tangible.

Now? Straight to slag.

But Zhong Qing refused to accept defeat!

His cultivation talent might be poor, but he refused to be stumped by a mere Soul-Tempering Pill.

The result was two furnace explosions.

This left Zhong Qing thoroughly frustrated.

"Perhaps today isn't right for alchemy!"

When depressed, one needs a way to decompress.

Zhong Qing immediately thought of finding the old beggar for drinks.

Without hesitation, he headed down the mountain under the moonlight.

Spirit City at night was even livelier.

Ten thousand lights blazed, noise and bustle everywhere.

By comparison, the northern city wall was relatively quiet.

When Zhong Qing reached the old scholar tree, he found the old beggar drinking alone, eyes hazy—already three parts drunk.

"Something on your mind?"

Zhong Qing found a spot to sit and asked quietly.

The old beggar turned. Seeing a familiar face, he laughed heartily: "I was just about to leave tonight. Didn't expect to see you one more time."

"Come, drink with me."

He tossed his wine gourd directly to Zhong Qing, who caught it steadily.

They passed the gourd back and forth, drinking together.

When the wine was nearly gone, the old beggar sighed wistfully: "I have to leave. Family troubles—I must go deal with them."

Zhong Qing paused mid-drink: "Need any help?"

The old beggar smiled: "This is something others can't help with."

"This old beggar has wandered south and north all his life. Few people have caught my eye—you're one of them."

Thinking about leaving this place and probably not returning for quite some time, something stirred in his heart.

He immediately removed his personal jade pendant.

"Before we part, I don't have much to give. Take this pendant as a keepsake."

This was a magical artifact he'd refined, with automatic protective functions when the wearer faced danger.

It could block a full-force strike from an Earth Profound powerhouse.

In this world of cultivators where danger lurked everywhere, who knew what the next moment might bring?

This pendant was the old beggar's gift of a lifesaving measure for Zhong Qing—something that could save his life at a critical moment.

He didn't explain the pendant's function.

The friendship between gentlemen is as plain as water. If possible, he hoped Zhong Qing would never need to use it.

But though he said nothing, how could Zhong Qing not see through the item's value?

He examined the pendant, his thoughts complex.

The old beggar had been genuinely good to him.

Not long ago, after noticing he was being followed, the old beggar had secretly sent people to eliminate the threat.

Now, on the eve of departure, he was giving him a precious protective treasure.

This pendant, even for the old beggar himself, was extremely valuable.

Yet he gave it away without hesitation.

This sentiment far exceeded the gift's material worth.

After a moment's thought, Zhong Qing also produced an item.

It was a wooden figurine.

This figurine was a recent system check-in reward, capable of unleashing Sky Profound-level power.

Of course, through this figurine, he'd also figured out some patterns about his check-ins. Apart from cultivation methods and treasures, auxiliary items like this would scale with his own cultivation level.

"They say courtesy demands reciprocity."

"Keep this safe."

Seeing the wooden figurine Zhong Qing offered, the old beggar grinned: "This thing is quite delicate."

"Keep it for yourself. It would be wasted on this old beggar."

Clearly, in his view, the figurine was nothing more than an art piece.

And he completely lacked artistic appreciation.

"Just keep it!"

"At a critical moment, it might help you."

Zhong Qing pressed it firmly into the old beggar's hands.

Seeing this, the old beggar couldn't refuse and accepted.

But inwardly he chuckled bitterly: Throughout the entire Eastern Region, those who could help me are few and far between. What could an artistic wooden figurine possibly do?

"Alright, this old beggar must go!"

"When family matters are settled, I'll come back someday to drink with my young friend until we're both under the table."

The old beggar left.

No sentimental sorrow of parting.

Only a grave expression.

A look of heavy thoughts.
