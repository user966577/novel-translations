Chapter 1: This Pile of Saint-Grade Cultivation Methods Should Last Me Through the Winter

Eastern Region.

Xianjiang Sect.

Mufu Peak.

Deep winter had arrived. Snow blanketed the land, turning the world white as far as the eye could see.

"Sigh..."

Zhong Qing sat by the furnace in a cotton coat, unable to suppress a long exhale.

He'd transmigrated to this world five years ago and had spent every single day on Mufu Peak since.

Sure, Mufu Peak was one of Xianjiang Sect's seven peaks, and he even bore the title of Peak Master. But in practice? Utterly meaningless.

The only reason he'd become Peak Master was because his late master, Daoist Nai, had been a recluse. While other peaks bustled with disciples, Daoist Nai had remained alone his entire life—until his final years, when he'd reluctantly taken Zhong Qing as his disciple.

It wasn't that Daoist Nai had seen any potential in him. More likely, the old man had needed to complete some quota and grabbed the first person he found on the roadside.

Being Daoist Nai's first disciple had caused quite a stir in the sect at the time. Zhong Qing had assumed he possessed some remarkable talent, that his life was about to reach its peak.

Turns out? He was complete and utter trash. No talent whatsoever.

Yet Daoist Nai never went looking for a replacement. He'd treated Zhong Qing well enough, providing everything a disciple should receive.

Life had been comfortable back then. Though Mufu Peak only had the two of them, Daoist Nai's strength alone matched any other peak. No one dared gossip.

Then Daoist Nai left for a journey and never returned. His life jade shattered, leaving behind one helpless disciple.

Given Daoist Nai's tremendous contributions to the sect, Mufu Peak wasn't disbanded. Instead, Zhong Qing—the sole disciple—inherited the Peak Master position.

But without his master as a backer, life grew harder by the day.

As a transmigrator, Zhong Qing wasn't entirely without perks.

Less than a month after Daoist Nai's death, he'd awakened a system that allowed daily check-ins.

Just when he thought his life was finally turning around, he discovered the system was absolutely worthless.

It gave out items every day, sure. But cultivation? Not a single shred. The system wouldn't touch anything related to his actual cultivation.

Take the Saint-grade cultivation method in his hands—a check-in reward. Cultivation methods were ranked from First to Ninth Grade, then King, Emperor, Venerable, Saint, and Imperial grades above that.

A Saint-grade method was nothing to scoff at. Throw one out there and it would spark a bloodbath. But for a talentless waste like him? A method without the cultivation to use it was...

Useless.

Zhong Qing tossed it into the furnace.

The flames roared bright, casting a warm glow across his face.

Did burning a Saint-grade cultivation method sting a little?

Of course it did!

The real question was how long one book would last in this freezing weather. He'd die of cold otherwise!

Zhong Qing stood and dragged over a burlap sack stuffed with cultivation methods, tossing a few more into the furnace to keep it burning strong.

A kettle sat atop the flames. Thanks to the vigorous fire, it soon began whistling.

Zhong Qing brewed himself some tea. On a cold winter day like this, a hot cup was pure comfort.

He'd gotten used to this life over the years.

A year's worth of check-in rewards produced just enough cultivation methods to burn through winter. If he got lucky with a few golden check-ins, he might even have half a storehouse left over come spring.

The check-ins didn't only give cultivation methods, of course. Magic treasures and divine weapons appeared too.

Like the axe he used for chopping firewood by the door. Or the kitchen knife.

Beyond that, there was the orchard and pond behind the mountain, the vegetable garden out front, the scarecrow in that garden, and the two eggs he was currently warming in his hands—all check-in rewards.

In short, he'd accumulated all manner of strange and bizarre items.

But it was still frustrating.

What good were incredible cultivation methods and divine weapons without the cultivation to use them? He was the textbook example of guarding a mountain of gold he couldn't spend.

He didn't dare reveal any of this to outsiders either. Even an innocent man becomes guilty when he possesses a treasure—he understood that much.

Fate was cruel.

Just then, a streak of light appeared on the distant horizon.

Looking up, Zhong Qing spotted a white crane flying toward him from afar.

"No one ever visits Mufu Peak. Why would someone come now?"

As he puzzled over this, the crane arrived overhead. Atop it stood a young attendant looking down at him with obvious contempt.

"The quinquennial Disciple Recruitment Ceremony begins tomorrow. The Sect Master ordered me to notify you to attend at Xianjiang's main peak."

The attendant didn't even bother with honorifics. His gaze dripped with mockery.

He couldn't understand the Sect Master's decision. What was the point of having this waste attend a recruitment ceremony?

Zhong Qing's expression remained flat. He had zero interest in this ceremony and no desire to subject himself to ridicule.

Just as he was about to refuse, a voice echoed in his mind.

「System issuing new mission.」

「Host must immediately proceed to Xianjiang Peak for disciple recruitment. Upon successfully recruiting the designated disciple, the Trash Bond will be activated.」

「Trash Bond: 1/2 activated—all disciples receive 100x cultivation speed bonus, all disciple cultivation returns 1,000x to host. 2/2 activated—all disciples receive 100x cultivation speed bonus, all disciple cultivation returns 10,000x to host.」

The system's voice made Zhong Qing's eyes light up.

Five years.

He'd waited five years for this?

His mountain of gold finally had a purpose?

And this Trash Bond sounded incredible. Just activating the first tier would give his disciples a 100x cultivation boost while returning 1,000x to him.

If both tiers stacked, then a single day of his disciple's cultivation would equal... 100,000 days for himself?

As for fully activating the Trash Bond? That would be even more absurd.

"Very well. I'll be there tomorrow." Zhong Qing stood and raised his head.

"You'd better leave immediately. It's quite a distance from here to the main peak—wouldn't want the ceremony to end before you arrive."

The attendant smirked. "Not that I couldn't give you a ride on my crane, but my companion here has a peculiar temperament. Anyone she doesn't approve of will get thrown off mid-flight."

With a cold laugh, the attendant rode away.

Zhong Qing paid him no mind.

Once he activated the bond, it wouldn't be long before this mere attendant—or even the entire Xianjiang Sect—became insignificant.

After a quick pack, he set off toward the main peak.
