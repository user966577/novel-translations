Chapter 96: The Auction

Wu Yue and Shi Xiaotian came in a hurry and left just as quickly.

After their return from Infinity Sect, Zhong Qing could sense they'd become even more enthusiastic about their duties.

They even competed to be test subjects.

Unfortunately, he couldn't even produce a pill—what was there to test?

Not only that, but the spiritual medicines he'd purchased from the auction house last time were nearly depleted.

He planned to make another purchasing trip.

Spirit City!

Auction House!

Du Yanling, clad in a fiery red robe, sat by the window of a second-floor alcove, gazing at the distant scenery in a daze. Her entire being seemed out of sorts.

Since Zhong Qing had purchased that batch of materials, she'd sent the divine weapon to headquarters for appraisal overnight. But there was still no word, and it constantly weighed on her mind.

What grade was that divine weapon, exactly? Until it was definitively confirmed, she couldn't rest easy.

Because of this, she'd been listless for days—food tasteless, everything joyless.

"Manager, big news!"

Just then, Manager Wu's voice came from downstairs.

These words made Du Yanling's whole body tense. She leaped to her feet.

"Has the divine weapon been appraised?"

The plump Manager Wu, in his gray silk robes and sporting a small mustache, jogged up the stairs.

Seeing Du Yanling's agitation, he scratched his head: "It's not about the divine weapon."

The joy that had bloomed on Du Yanling's face instantly wilted.

She slumped back into her seat.

"If it's not about the divine weapon, how is it big news?"

By now, Manager Wu had reached her side.

He bowed and said: "Manager, the Peng City Auction House is planning to combine all auction house branches within a hundred-thousand-mile radius for a joint auction."

A joint auction meant gathering treasures from all the major auction house branches for unified sale.

Already distracted, Du Yanling's spirits sank even further at these words.

For others, such a joint auction might be a once-in-a-century grand event.

But for people at small branches like theirs, it wasn't exactly welcome.

They'd have to escort precious treasures across vast distances.

If anything went wrong on the road, they'd be held responsible.

If nothing went wrong, they'd get at most a "Well done" from the higher-ups.

That said, the Peng City Auction House was a first-tier branch.

Their Spirit City Auction House was only second-tier.

The other side naturally outranked them.

As they say, an official one rank higher crushes you. Higher-ups speak, underlings run—they had no choice but to attend.

"When does the joint auction begin?"

"In one month!"

After this exchange, Du Yanling waved her hand listlessly.

"Go prepare!"

As her words fell—

Manager Wu was turning to leave when his expression suddenly sharpened.

"Manager, we have an important guest!"

Du Yanling looked down toward the entrance.

The person entering was none other than Zhong Qing.

Now that was truly an important guest.

She immediately collected all her negative emotions.

Straightening her appearance, she hurried downstairs to greet him.

"Sir, how may I assist you?"

Zhong Qing surveyed the merchandise on display.

Then said softly: "The last batch of materials is nearly used up. I'm here to purchase more."

"Do you have Ice-Fire Grass? Thunder Flower? Nether Spirit Fruit?"

This mildly surprised Du Yanling.

These were top-grade spiritual medicines, each worth a fortune.

They could drain the entire resources of some second-tier sects.

Yet he'd already used them up? Was he eating top-grade materials for breakfast?

Little did she know, those top-grade medicines had all been reduced to slag by Zhong Qing.

That was far more extravagant and wasteful than eating them.

After all, eating them would at least have some effect.

Refining them into slag left nothing at all.

This also illustrated that alchemy was an enormous money pit.

Without some assets and backing, one truly couldn't afford to play in this field.

Du Yanling pondered briefly before responding: "Sir, the materials you need—our Spirit City Auction House can't gather them on short notice."

"However, in one month, the Peng City Auction House will host a joint auction combining dozens of branches."

"With treasures from dozens of branches gathered together, I'm certain we can meet your needs."

"A joint auction?"

Zhong Qing noted the location.

He truly refused to accept defeat.

He would conquer the Soul-Tempering Pill, no matter how many resources it took.

Since this location didn't have what he needed, Zhong Qing prepared to leave.

At this point, Du Yanling said: "Sir, if you plan to attend the Peng City auction, please keep this VIP card safe."

"The auction organizers will provide you with the finest service."

Every industry has its own rules.

This sky-blue VIP card was equivalent to an Ultimate VIP from his previous life!

Card holders not only enjoyed discounts at all Eastern Region auction house branches but became honored guests of the auction house.

Such VIP cards were extremely high-level. Even with Du Yanling's authority, she could only gift one in her entire lifetime.

Zhong Qing was the most generous customer she'd ever encountered.

Combined with his extraordinary bearing and massive demand for spiritual medicines—

Du Yanling didn't hesitate to give away her one and only blue VIP card.

Zhong Qing accepted the card with a slightly odd expression.

No wonder Pill Cauldron Pavilion's auction house could monopolize the entire Eastern Region!

These business tactics alone were unmatched by anyone else in the current market.

But he didn't dwell on it.

This was a world where cultivation reigned supreme—fundamentally different from a wealth-driven world.

Strength was the foundation of one's standing. Wealth was merely decoration on the cultivation path.

Time flowed like water. In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

Peng City!

This was an extremely prosperous metropolis!

With a population exceeding ten million.

Convenient transportation, thriving commerce—it was a renowned major city within a thousand miles.

The hottest topic in Peng City recently was undoubtedly the joint auction.

Every auction event sparked a frenzy.

This time, with the Peng City Auction House combining dozens of branches, the scale was unprecedented—a once-in-a-century occasion.

By noon!

Cultivators were streaming continuously toward the Peng City Auction House.

Some were drawn by the treasure announcements.

Some lurked, looking for opportunities to fish in troubled waters.

Most had simply come to enjoy the spectacle.

Though the auction hadn't officially begun, the main hall was already packed.

All manner of people were present.

And seating was arranged according to status, standing, and strength.

In this world of cultivation, hierarchy was everywhere.

A seemingly simple seating arrangement had already secretly assigned everyone a price tag!
