Chapter 71: What It Means to Kill the Heart Along with the Body!

The Grand Elder never would have imagined that a mere wretched spawn born to a pair of commoners could have such heaven-defying fortune, able to bring in such a powerful expert to stand up for him.

At the same time, Zhong Qing's gaze fell upon the Grand Elder.

The latter felt that emotionless stare.

His whole body trembled like a quail, shaking uncontrollably.

Under the threat of death, the instinct to survive made him beg for mercy.

"Se... Senior, don't kill me!"

"I know I was wrong!"

"I didn't want Su Ye's parents to die either!"

"And if I had taken Su Ye in back then, how could he have had this fortune to become your disciple?"

"When you think about it, I actually did him a favor!"

Zhong Qing was disgusted by his shamelessness.

Someone like this—every second he lived was an insult to the air itself.

He immediately struck out with one palm, shattering the other's dantian, crippling his cultivation.

Then he threw him to the ground like a dead dog.

"Disciple, this person is yours to deal with!"

"Thank you, Master!"

Su Ye stepped forward.

He came directly before the Grand Elder.

A fierce light flickered in his eyes.

Even with his dantian shattered and cultivation destroyed.

The Grand Elder still hadn't given up his desire to live.

He crawled like a maggot, wrapping himself around Su Ye's feet, crying and pleading.

"Su Ye, Su Ye, I know I was wrong!"

"Your parents' deaths had nothing to do with me."

"You can't kill me—when you think about it, I did you a favor!"

"Without me, you never could have had this fortune to take such a powerful master."

"I did you a favor, a favor!"

By now, his mind had already broken.

He was like a madman, constantly repeating that he had done Su Ye a favor.

A wet patch had even spread beneath him—he had been so terrified he'd wet himself.

They say that before death, no one can remain calm.

But to be this desperate to cling to life was truly rare.

Facing the Grand Elder's crying and begging, Su Ye showed not the slightest softness.

His parents' faces kept flashing through his mind. If they had known earlier what kind of ungrateful person the Grand Elder was, would they have died?

His killing intent grew ever stronger.

"Boom..."

With one stomp of his foot, the Grand Elder's skull was directly crushed.

Stomped to death in one blow!

"Father, Mother, today your child has avenged half of your grudge!"

"Rest assured, those who harmed you—your child will never let any of them go."

After finishing, Su Ye kowtowed three times toward the west.

The hatred suppressed in his heart for so long had finally found release.

And as his great vengeance was achieved, his mind mysteriously emptied.

His entire being showed signs of breaking through.

Seeing this, Zhong Qing addressed the Flying Saber Sect elders: "Can't you see my disciple is about to break through? Hurry up and prepare a cultivation chamber with dense spiritual energy for his breakthrough."

Everyone: "..."

Was this even human speech?

One moment he'd killed their sect's Grand Elder right before their eyes, and the next he was having them prepare a breakthrough chamber.

What, did he think this was his own home?

Zhong Qing raised an eyebrow: "What? Got a problem?"

Under his sweeping gaze, everyone shuddered in unison.

"No, none at all. I'll arrange it immediately!"

Sect Master Dugu Feng's brow twitched, his heart filled with grievance.

What did it mean to kill both body and spirit? This was truly killing body and spirit!

But might made right.

Before absolute strength, no matter how displeased they were, no matter how unwilling, all they could do was submit.

"Oh, and prepare a room for me while you're at it."

Zhong Qing added: "To kill your Grand Elder, I traveled thousands of miles."

"Now I'm tired. I might as well rest here for the night and leave once my disciple breaks through."

Upon hearing this, everyone's eyes went red.

He really was treating this place like his own home!

But might made right.

Dugu Feng could only grit his teeth and agree.

The reason Zhong Qing acted this way was, first, because these Flying Saber Sect people had thoroughly disgusted him.

He didn't mind giving them a taste of their own medicine.

Second, Su Ye truly needed a place rich in spiritual energy to break through.

Though he could put him in his small world to cultivate.

The system-rewarded small world was still in an extremely primitive, nascent stage.

Though it had various miraculous properties, the spiritual energy within was insufficient to support Su Ye's breakthrough.

This night was destined to be restless for Flying Saber Sect.

Numerous Flying Saber Sect elders stood guard outside the cultivation chamber, protecting Su Ye's breakthrough.

Since Flying Saber Sect's founding, whose breakthrough had ever warranted such treatment?

Yet now an enemy had achieved it.

Not only that, but every Flying Saber Sect elder was extremely attentive, not daring to slack off in the slightest.

Terrified that some accident might occur and cause Zhong Qing, that harbinger of disaster, to explode.

The feeling was maddening beyond words!

The next morning!

Zhong Qing stretched and rose from the Sect Master's bedchamber.

This sleep had been exceptionally comfortable.

Little Su Ye was already waiting outside.

He had successfully used Flying Saber Sect's resources to break through a minor realm.

From early Dawn Profound to mid Dawn Profound. And as little Su Ye broke through, the cultivation returned to Zhong Qing naturally made great progress as well.

Worth noting was that the cultivation chamber Su Ye used had originally belonged to Flying Saber Sect's Grand Elder.

Using an enemy's resources to strengthen oneself—the feeling was quite intoxicating.

Master and disciple met.

Behind them followed a group of Flying Saber Sect elders.

Flying Saber Sect Master Dugu Feng spoke with an unpleasant expression: "Senior, you've killed your man, your disciple has successfully broken through, and you said you wanted to stay one night at our Flying Saber Sect—we've arranged that too."

"Now, can you leave?"

He might as well have carved "Not Welcome" on his forehead.

Yet Zhong Qing replied unhurriedly: "What's the rush?"

"Your esteemed sect's hospitality—it's morning, and you haven't even arranged a meal?"

This was low in damage but high in insult.

All the elders' eyes went red.

You?

Have the nerve to call yourself a guest?

Each of them was holding back infinite rage, yet dared not show even a hint.

"Someone, bring a table of fine food for the Senior!"

Dugu Feng closed his eyes in resignation.

He only hoped to send this harbinger of disaster away as quickly as possible.

Soon, a table of excellent delicacies appeared.

Zhong Qing was in no hurry. Just as if he were at his own Command Hall Peak, he leisurely washed up, then beckoned Su Ye to slowly sit down and begin their private master-and-disciple breakfast.

Under the Flying Saber Sect members' green-faced waiting, the two took a long, long time to finish eating and drinking.

Just when they thought Zhong Qing would leave immediately.

Who knew that after breakfast, Zhong Qing took out a tea set, boiled a pot of tea, and began savoring it.

Only after the oily taste in his mouth had dissipated and his whole body felt refreshed did he finally rise, leisurely leading Su Ye away.

Watching the two figures stroll away at leisure.

An elder gnashed his teeth until blood began seeping from his mouth.

"Too much! This is simply too much!"

"This person has humiliated our sect like this—are we just going to let it go?"

His heart was filled with resentment!

This grievance couldn't be washed clean even if he poured out all the waters of three rivers and four seas.

"What else?"

Another elder's gaze was distant.

"If not let it go, what do you plan to do?"

A Peak Master spoke quietly, and that one sentence immediately silenced the furious elder.

Finally, he let out a long sigh, tears falling in the great hall: "When strength falls short, what can be done!"

As these words fell, a sorrowful atmosphere instantly pervaded the hall.
