Chapter 49: Before Her Former Enemies, She Wouldn't Even Have a Chance to Resist

Let alone Zhong Qing before her.

Even the strongest person in the Eastern Region would be nothing before her former enemies.

"Miss, how do you know I can't protect you?" Zhong Qing couldn't help but smile.

Looking at Zhong Qing's clear, sincere eyes.

Bai Ling couldn't help but pause.

Were people in the Eastern Region really this kind?

She felt a surge of gratitude.

But precisely because of this, she didn't want Zhong Qing getting involved.

It would only drag him down.

"I appreciate the thought, but my opponents aren't this little white tiger—there's someone else. Someone beyond your imagination. If you help me, you'll only be dragged down with me."

"In fact, you shouldn't have helped me at all just now."

Bai Ling spoke with grave seriousness.

She wasn't exaggerating.

Those people would stop at nothing to find her. If they actually followed the remnant soul's energy here, anyone who had contact with her might be tracked down as well.

As if fearing Zhong Qing didn't understand, she added, "In short, I have enemies hunting me. They are very, very powerful—beyond anything you can imagine. If they track me here, it could mean disaster for you."

"It doesn't matter what you believe—these are the facts!"

Bai Ling stopped there, not revealing her identity.

But explaining the gravity of the situation to Zhong Qing was enough.

What she didn't know.

Was that her background had already been revealed by Zhong Qing's Heavenly Eye.

And as for her enemies, Zhong Qing had already guessed most of it from her information.

"Miss, I still suggest you come with me." Zhong Qing said calmly. "In your current state, forget about your other enemies—just running into another beast like the one just now could kill you."

Zhong Qing's words made Bai Ling's expression turn bitter.

Indeed, her current situation was far from optimistic.

Especially after using the remnant soul's power, her injuries had only gotten worse.

At this point, even an ordinary wild animal could take her life.

If she went with Zhong Qing, at least she could stay alive temporarily.

So Bai Ling became somewhat hesitant, saying, "But this really might drag you into it."

"The karma is already attached. No point saying more." Zhong Qing said with a light smile.

Seeing Zhong Qing insist, Bai Ling weighed the pros and cons before finally agreeing. At least she could focus on survival for now.

Zhong Qing smiled and had Lin Feng help support Bai Ling as they left together.

With an extra person.

Zhong Qing didn't linger on the road much longer. He headed straight back to Immortal River Sect.

Before long, the three finally returned to Command Hall Peak.

"Disciple greets Master. Greets Senior Brother." Seeing Zhong Qing and the others return, Su Ye, who had been guarding the peak, immediately came to pay respects.

Seeing his beloved disciple, Zhong Qing couldn't help but ruffle his hair.

"Master, I've been cultivating really diligently lately." Su Ye said quickly, afraid Zhong Qing might think he'd been slacking.

"I know, I know."

Zhong Qing couldn't help but smile.

From the system's feedback, he naturally knew just how diligently Su Ye had been cultivating.

If nothing unexpected happened.

He would soon break through to Dawn Profound as well.

"Lin Feng, settle Miss Bai Ling in a room," Zhong Qing instructed.

"Yes, Master." Lin Feng responded immediately. Thinking of something, he leaned close to Zhong Qing and whispered, "By the way, Master, is this Miss Bai Ling going to be my future junior sister?"

"You're too clever for your own good." Zhong Qing couldn't help but laugh.

Lin Feng grinned.

And knowing Bai Ling was his future junior sister, Lin Feng became extremely attentive, taking care of everything meticulously for her.

Even food and drink were all provided.

Several days passed in a flash.

Bai Ling stood at the entrance of her courtyard, gazing at the distant mountains, her brow furrowed deeply.

Having fallen to this state, she had experienced all the coldness and warmth of the world, along with various betrayals. Since arriving in the Eastern Region, she had suffered endlessly, narrowly escaping death multiple times.

Only after following Zhong Qing to Command Hall Peak did she feel warmth again after so long.

Whether it was Zhong Qing, Lin Feng, or Su Ye—they all took good care of her.

But precisely because of this, she felt even worse inside. She regretted coming to Command Hall Peak.

Because she couldn't be certain whether the people from the Northern Demon Abyss had detected the wisp of remnant soul energy she had leaked.

If they really came, she naturally wouldn't escape.

But Command Hall Peak would also be implicated.

And over these days, she had naturally figured out Zhong Qing's identity.

Just a Peak Master of Immortal River Sect, Command Hall Peak. This wasn't her looking down on Zhong Qing—it was that someone of his status, before her former enemies, probably wouldn't even have a chance to resist.

So.

These days she had been living in constant anxiety, dreading that enemies from the Northern Demon Abyss might suddenly appear.

"I really shouldn't have come here."

Thinking that Zhong Qing and the others might be implicated by her at any moment, she felt a wave of sorrow.

If she really did get Zhong Qing and Lin Feng and the others killed, she probably wouldn't be able to die in peace.

But her injuries this time were worse than she had imagined.

The damage wasn't physical—it was to that wisp of remnant soul.

Already in bad shape, this time it had nearly collapsed entirely.

She could only nurture it slowly.

With her body in such a state, she couldn't use any of her power at all. Wanting to leave was possible, but she probably couldn't even make it down the mountain.

Thinking of this, she decided to go find Zhong Qing again.

At this moment, Zhong Qing had moved the Bitter Sea, the orchard, and the vegetable garden from the back mountain, along with various other items the system had given him through check-ins, all into his small world. He had just sat down when he saw Bai Ling coming to find him.

"Mister Zhong."

Bai Ling greeted Zhong Qing respectfully.

Though Zhong Qing was merely a minor Immortal River Sect Peak Master—whose power might not even match one of her former subordinates—she remembered his life-saving grace.

"Miss Bai, why aren't you resting? What brings you here?" Zhong Qing smiled.

"Mister Zhong, I came to ask you to help me down the mountain." Bai Ling said directly.

"Why? Isn't it nice here?" Zhong Qing asked, puzzled.

"Mister Zhong, I really do have extremely powerful enemies. Their power truly is beyond anything you can imagine. If they track me here, it will be a catastrophic disaster for your Immortal River Sect. I really don't want to drag you into this."

Bai Ling emphasized gravely.

"Didn't you already tell me this? Alright, alright, I know. Just focus on recovering—don't worry about these things."

Zhong Qing smiled while boiling water for tea.

"I'm really not joking!"

Seeing Zhong Qing unmoved, Bai Ling's face filled with anxiety. Knowing Zhong Qing still didn't believe her, she hesitated a moment, then added, "Actually, my true identity is a demoness of the Northern Demon Abyss!"

"I know, I know..."

"Huh, now where did my tea tongs go?"

"I'm sure I put them right here. Where could they have gone..."

Zhong Qing rummaged through his tea set, then bent down to search the ground, trying to remember where he had left the tongs last time...

Standing there, Bai Ling's elegant face darkened, twitching slightly.

She took a deep breath.

Just as she was about to speak again, she noticed Zhong Qing looking up at her.

"Miss Bai, was there something else?"
