The Transplant Center was ablaze with light.

"Xiaoxia! Xiaoxia, where are you?"

A woman cried out in anguish, running frantically through the Transplant Center building, checking room after room.

The medical staff were also searching anxiously, rushing to pull up the surveillance footage.

Ring ring ring—

At home, Qin Feng was sleeping soundly when his phone suddenly rang.

"Mm, your phone's ringing."

The delicate figure in his arms stirred slightly, patting the arm beneath her neck in a drowsy haze.

"It's from the hospital. Go back to sleep."

Qin Feng glanced at the caller ID and spoke softly before getting up and leaving the bedroom.

"This is Qin Feng. What's wrong?"

"Director Qin, something terrible has happened! Xiaoxia is missing!"

"What?!"

Hearing the urgent voice on the other end, Qin Feng's entire body tensed. All traces of sleep vanished instantly.

"Don't panic, and don't disturb the other patients. Send someone to check the surveillance footage immediately, and see if Xiaoxia left anything behind.

"Also, bring Xiaoxia's mother to the office and try to calm her down. I'll be right there!"

He quietly returned to the bedroom and leaned close to Liu Yan'er's ear.

"Yan'er, something's happened at the hospital. I need to go. You keep sleeping, and remember to go home and keep Deputy Director Chen company when you wake up. I'll come pick you up tonight."

"Okay."

Liu Yan'er heard him, her tired eyes barely open. She pouted and nodded.

"Be careful on the road. I'll wait for you to come back."

She reached out her jade-like arm to wrap around his neck, gave him a kiss, then let go and rolled over to continue sleeping.

She looked absolutely adorable.

Qin Feng smiled slightly, got dressed, grabbed his keys, and left.

The roads at 4 AM were nearly empty. He drove his Porsche straight toward the hospital.

After arriving at the Transplant Center, he immediately ran up the stairs—faster than the elevator.

"Any updates? Did you find her?"

The attending physician Ye Zhiqiu, who had been waiting, hurried over when she saw him appear. Qin Feng asked immediately.

"Not yet. We checked the surveillance and found that Xiaoxia left the hospital around 2 AM. She got into a taxi."

"A taxi?"

Hearing this, Qin Feng frowned slightly.

"Did you contact the taxi company?"

"They're not open yet, so no one's answering."

Ye Zhiqiu shook her head anxiously.

It was only 4 AM. The taxi company's customer service wasn't available.

The earliest they could reach the driver would be 9 AM.

But Xiaoxia was just a 13-year-old girl. Where could she possibly go in the middle of the night?

And she had just undergone two rounds of chemotherapy. Her body was still very weak—she couldn't have gotten far.

The most important thing now was to bring her back. Xiaoxia's condition was critical. She could faint at any moment, or worse.

"Where's her mother?"

"In the office. Someone's trying to calm her down, but she's very emotional. Xiaoxia's father is on his way too."

"Good. Let's go see her first."

With that, Qin Feng led her quickly toward the office.

They could hear crying from outside the door. It was heartbreaking.

He pushed open the door and walked to Xiaoxia's mother's side. She was clutching a piece of paper, tears dripping onto it continuously, nearly soaking it through.

On the paper, a few lines were written in crooked handwriting:

'Mom, Dad, I'm sorry. It's all my fault for getting leukemia. They say when people die, they become stars in the sky. If you miss me, just look up and you'll see me.

Don't look for me. Take good care of little brother. I'm leaving now. In my next life, I want to be your daughter again.'

Reading those lines, Qin Feng felt his heart being squeezed. It ached with a sour, painful feeling.

This little girl's "maturity" far exceeded her years—and it was devastating.

These past two years, her family's situation had been difficult. To pay for her treatment, they had even borrowed money for her brother's school fees.

Her elderly grandmother still had to take care of her. Xiaoxia's guilt and self-blame, combined with the agony of her illness, had become too much for her to bear.

And the two chemotherapy sessions and bone marrow biopsies this past week had caused her hair to fall out, leaving her in constant pain.

No child should have to endure this.

So she left, seeking a release—for her family and for herself.

Xiaoxia had changed into her own clothes in the bathroom, put on a yellow duck backpack, wore a mask, and left the Transplant Center.

She walked straight out the hospital entrance, got into a taxi, and drove out of the surveillance area, heading north.

"Did you report this to the police?"

"Yes. The police were just here and are helping search for the taxi."

Ye Zhiqiu nodded and explained the situation.

"Good. I'm going out to search too. Call me immediately if there's any news."

"Understood. Don't worry, Director Qin."

He walked over to Xiaoxia's mother. His expression was solemn.

"Don't worry. I promise I'll bring Xiaoxia back."

Qin Feng didn't offer empty reassurances. He simply patted her shoulder, his gaze resolute.

Then he turned to leave.

"Stay here and look after them. Make sure neither of them leaves. And notify the stem cell bank—we need all the stem cells verified and uploaded to the matching system today."

Ye Zhiqiu nodded firmly and agreed.

Qin Feng pulled up the surveillance video and confirmed the taxi's license plate number.

He had no idea where Xiaoxia might have gone, but based on her appearance, the most logical first assumption was that she was heading home.

There were four ways to leave Jiang City:

The train station, the high-speed rail station, the bus terminal, and the airport.

It had already been two hours. The bus terminal was definitely out. That left the train, high-speed rail, and airport.

He quickly confirmed that the airport was also ruled out.

Train station or high-speed rail station.

Qin Feng had to choose one.

The high-speed rail and train stations were in opposite directions. If she had gone north, it would be the train station.

His gut told him that if Xiaoxia wanted to leave Jiang City, she most likely went to the train station.

Regardless, he had to get there first.

Qin Feng floored the accelerator and sped toward the train station.

Meanwhile, the police began a citywide search for the taxi. They quickly tracked it down.

A pale-faced little girl wearing a hat sat curled up in a hard seat, leaning against the window and watching the dark scenery outside. Tears streamed down her face without her noticing.

Sitting next to her was a woman who looked to be in her forties or fifties, holding a sleeping toddler boy in her arms.

Hearing the soft sounds of the little girl's sobs, she couldn't help but look over. She pulled some tissues from her bag and handed them to her.

"Little girl, why are you crying?"

Xiaoxia turned her head. Through her tear-blurred eyes, she saw the smiling woman and silently accepted the tissues.

"Are you traveling alone? Where are your parents? Did you have a fight with your family?"

Xiaoxia shook her head and spoke in a low voice.

"It's okay. You can tell me. I won't tell your parents."

The woman gently patted her back and spoke in a soothing tone.

Xiaoxia bit her lip and said nothing.

"You must be hungry. Have something to eat and drink. Crying like that will tire you out quickly."

The woman pulled out a bottle of water and a packet of crackers from her bag and placed them in front of her.

Across from them, a bald man who had been dozing slowly opened his eyes at the commotion. He shot a sharp glance at the woman, then closed his eyes again and shifted position to continue sleeping.

About half an hour later, Xiaoxia yawned. Her eyes were red.

Grumble—her stomach growled, and hunger set in.

Looking at the water and crackers in front of her, she licked her dry lips. A conflicted look crossed her face.

She had left in such a hurry that she hadn't bought any food or water. She couldn't bear to spend the money. She clutched her bag tightly.

"You're hungry, aren't you? It's fine, go ahead and eat."

The woman was perceptive enough to notice her small movements. A gentle smile spread across her face as she pushed the crackers and water closer.

"You're quite alert, little girl. That means your parents taught you well. Here, I'll eat one first to show you it's safe."

She tore open the crackers in front of Xiaoxia, took one out, and put it in her mouth.

The crisp crunching sound made Xiaoxia's hunger even worse.

Seeing the woman eat one, she held out for a few more minutes but ultimately couldn't resist the wafting aroma.

Slowly, she reached out, took a cracker, and put it in her mouth.

"Thank you, auntie."

"You're welcome. Eat up. Here's some water too."

The woman's smile grew warmer as she unscrewed the water bottle for her.

At that moment, the bald man across from them opened his eyes again, squinting at Xiaoxia.

His fierce expression frightened her. She quickly averted her gaze, lowered her head, and nibbled on the cracker in small bites.

The woman beside her patted the little boy in her arms, her face full of smiles.

At Jiang City Train Station—

Qin Feng had arrived. About ten minutes earlier, he had received a call from the on-duty physician Ye Zhiqiu.

The police had found the taxi driver and confirmed through questioning that he had taken a little girl to the train station.

They had also contacted the railway police to verify whether Xiaoxia had entered the station or even bought a ticket to leave.

Qin Feng arrived at the railway police office. The two officers inside were startled.

"Hello. I'm Qin Feng, Director of the Transplant Center at Municipal First Hospital. The missing girl, Wei Xiaoxia, is my patient."

Qin Feng quickly explained.

"You're Dr. Qin Feng? We've heard so much about you!"

The two officers were momentarily stunned, then their eyes lit up and they greeted him warmly.

The name Qin Feng might not be familiar to everyone in the general public, but it had already spread throughout government circles.

After all, Jiang City's medical community had produced such a genius that even the municipal government highly valued and promoted him.

How could they not know who Qin Feng was?

He was the brightest rising star in Jiang City's medical world right now.

"I just received word that Wei Xiaoxia came to the train station, so I came to find out more."

Qin Feng smiled and shook hands with both officers, speaking urgently.

"We're reviewing the footage now. Come take a look."

The two officers made room, and the surveillance video appeared before him.

A taxi stopped outside the train station. A little girl got out.

Even with the hat, Qin Feng recognized Xiaoxia immediately.

"That's her!"

"Good. Wei Xiaoxia got out of the car here, entered the station, and went to the ticket counter."

The officer narrated while playing the footage at increased speed.

They watched Xiaoxia buy a ticket and sit down in the waiting hall.

About 15 minutes later—

Xiaoxia checked the time, stood up with her backpack, and walked through the ticket gate.

Qin Feng froze, suspicion rising in his mind.

"Officer, I'd like to ask—Xiaoxia is only 13. How could she buy a ticket by herself?"

"We just verified this. Wei Xiaoxia's ID shows she turns 14 today, which meets the age requirement for purchasing tickets independently."

The officers exchanged wry smiles and explained.

She turns 14 today?

That meant today was her birthday.

Choosing to leave on this day—Xiaoxia had clearly planned this for a while. She had even calculated the timing.

She must have been thinking about this for a long time, waiting until the early morning hours to slip away unnoticed.

What a foolish girl.

"Can you find out where her ticket is going?"

Qin Feng continued.

"She bought a ticket to Guizhou in Changxi Province. The train departed 20 minutes ago."

The officer replied.

"We estimate Wei Xiaoxia has already left Jiang City and entered Peng City. The next stop should be Peng City Station, with a 15-minute layover."

"How long until the train reaches Peng City Station?"

"About an hour and a half."

Hearing this, a thought flashed through Qin Feng's mind.

If he took the highway, he could reach downtown Peng City in an hour and a half. But from downtown to the train station was at least another half hour. He wouldn't make it in time.

"Could you contact the Peng City railway police and have them take Wei Xiaoxia off the train?"

"That's... We can only try to persuade her. We can't forcibly stop her. This isn't a criminal matter—she bought her ticket legally."

The officers looked troubled as they explained.

"I understand..."

Qin Feng nodded. The officers were right. They couldn't use force, and even if he went himself, it would be difficult to change Wei Xiaoxia's mind.

But he was the only one who could save her now. He had to try, even if there was only a slim chance.

If Xiaoxia left now, three days and nights on a train—she could die on the way.

He would do everything in his power to help her, just to make her understand:

None of this was her fault.

Ring ring ring—

In the silence, his phone suddenly rang. It was from the hospital.

"What is it, Zhiqiu?"

"Dr. Qin! We found a bone marrow match!"

On the other end, Ye Zhiqiu's words were like hope descending from the heavens.

Qin Feng's entire body jolted as if struck by electricity. He couldn't contain his excitement.

"Where was the match found? Can they come to Jiang City?"

"It's from our hospital."

Ye Zhiqiu paused briefly before answering.

"Our hospital? That's wonderful! Who is it?"

Hearing this, Qin Feng nearly jumped with joy.

He never expected it to be someone from their own hospital.

This meant the donor was right there. The surgery could be done immediately.

Xiaoxia could be saved!

"Well... Director, the match... is you."

The bone marrow had arrived, against all odds.

And the donor turned out to be him.
