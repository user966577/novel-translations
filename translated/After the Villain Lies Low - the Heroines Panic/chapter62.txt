"Patriarch! We cannot hesitate any longer!"

The Grand Elder shot to his feet, his voice passionate and stirring.

"The power Lin Yuan displayed during the Wilderness Hunt—you saw it with your own eyes! Conjuring formations with a thought, shattering stars with a fist! That's not power a mortal can possess! That's a god! A demon!"

"Compared to him, what is that Liu Mingxuan? Just a piece of trash who was so scared he pissed himself and fainted on the spot! The Liu family is no longer worth betting on!"

"We made a terrible move when we voluntarily broke off the engagement with the Lin family! Now is our only chance! We must spare no cost to repair relations with them! Even if it means letting Ruoxi... marry back into the family! As long as we can climb the great tree that is the Lin family, our Chen family will have nothing to worry about for the next hundred years!"

The Grand Elder's words rang with conviction, earning nods of agreement from several elders behind him.

They had opposed the broken engagement from the start.

Now, the facts proved just how correct their judgment had been!

Lin Yuan was no longer some young genius!

He was a true dragon, one capable of stirring the winds and clouds of the Nine Heavens!

And they had personally pushed this dragon away!

Now, everyone's intestines were turning green with regret!

"Bullshit!"

The Third Elder slammed the table, eyes bulging as he retorted.

"Grand Elder, you're trying to push our Chen family into a fire pit!"

"Repair relations? How would you repair them? What kind of temperament does Lin Yuan have? What kind of house is the Lin family? We offended them to death when we broke off the engagement! Now that their power is obvious, we go crawling back with wagging tails? Even if you don't want face, the Chen family still needs it!"

"Furthermore! That Lin Yuan is a god of slaughter! A madman! Didn't you see? He dares kill even Divine Court members! He dares destroy even the Ye family's plans! Allying with someone like that is dancing with a tiger! One wrong move, and our Chen family will be dragged into an abyss of eternal damnation!"

"The Liu family, on the other hand—while Liu Mingxuan performed poorly this time—the Liu family has deep foundations and has partnered with our Chen family for years. We know them well! This is the safest choice!"

"Safe?!" The Grand Elder laughed in anger. "Third Elder, have you gone senile? In the face of absolute power, you want to talk to me about safe?!"

"You..."

Just as the two were about to clash again.

"Enough!"

From the seat of honor, Chen Tianhao finally spoke, letting out an impatient bark.

The entire hall instantly fell silent.

All eyes focused on the patriarch, awaiting his final decision.

Chen Tianhao's brow was tightly furrowed.

His inner turmoil was more intense than anyone's!

How could he not know of Lin Yuan's power?

That scene of heaven and earth being destroyed—he'd seen it just as clearly through the observation screen!

In that moment, he'd even had the urge to storm into the Liu family and beat that useless Liu Mingxuan to death!

But!

Just then, a voice trembling with fear spoke up from a corner.

"Can't... can't provoke Lin Yuan anymore..."

The speaker was a pale-faced, thin young man.

It was Chen Tianhao's precious son, Chen Yu!

He was also a former member of the "Dragon Slaying Alliance"—one of those "geniuses" who'd been so frightened by Lin Yuan's display that he'd wet himself and fainted.

Ever since returning from the Wilderness Hunt, he'd had nightmares every single night.

Dreams filled with stars falling from the sky and that golden palm that could destroy heaven and earth!

The name Lin Yuan had become a nightmare he could never escape!

"Father! Elders! You don't understand... you don't understand how terrifying he is!"

Chen Yu's voice had turned shrill with fear.

"He's not human! He's a devil! All of us... in his eyes, we're nothing but... ants he can crush at will!"

"Our so-called alliance, our so-called plans—in front of him, they're a joke! A colossal joke!"

"Go find him again? Repair relations? Do you want to die?! Do you want our entire Chen family to be buried with him?!"

He screamed hysterically, tears and snot covering his face twisted with fear.

Looking at his son's pathetic state.

A nameless fury rose in Chen Tianhao's heart!

But even more, there was a deep sense of helplessness.

This son of his had come along only after he'd remarried.

From a young age, he'd placed all his hopes on him, viewing him as the Chen family's future hope.

But now, this hope had been utterly crushed in spirit by a peer!

Trash!

What absolute trash!

Chen Tianhao cursed inwardly, but seeing his son's pitiful state, he ultimately couldn't harden his heart.

His deeply ingrained preference for sons over daughters was unshakeable.

In his view, daughters were destined to marry out—water splashed away and gone.

Only sons were the true foundation of family legacy.

"Patriarch, the young master's words do have some merit."

Seeing an opportunity, the Third Elder immediately pressed his advantage.

"That Lin Yuan is too domineering, too overbearing! He's not a good match! Our Chen family can't control him!"

Chen Tianhao's resolve wavered even more.

On one side, the tremendous temptation of climbing onto a true dragon and soaring to the heavens.

On the other, the endless risk of eternal damnation and complete destruction.

This choice was too difficult.

"What about... Ruoxi?"

One elder cautiously brought her up.

"After all, this is her marriage. Shouldn't we... ask her opinion?"

"Ask her?"

Chen Tianhao acted as if he'd heard the funniest joke in the world.

He slapped the armrest hard, his face showing undisguised contempt.

"What does a girl know about family affairs?!"

"Does her opinion matter?!"

"She just needs to follow the family's arrangements, and that's enough!"

For this eldest daughter of his, introverted and always holed up in her room tinkering with scrap metal, he'd never paid any attention.

He didn't even know what his daughter had been up to lately.

His mind was entirely focused on his precious son.

"Everyone get out!"

Finally, Chen Tianhao waved his hand irritably.

"This matter—let me think on it further!"

He stood and walked toward the back hall without looking at the various expressions on the faces of those assembled.

All that remained were the elders exchanging glances and sighing, and Chen Yu, still slumped in his chair, trembling.

When the surroundings finally quieted.

Chen Yu's gaze unconsciously drifted toward the estate's rear courtyard.

That was where Chen Ruoxi lived.

There, she had her small artifact refining workshop.

Since the Wilderness Hunt ended.

His half-sister had kept herself completely secluded.

What on earth was she doing?
