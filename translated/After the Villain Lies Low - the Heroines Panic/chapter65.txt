After finally steadying his emotions, Chen Tianhao coughed twice and asked again: "Ruoxi, when did your artifact refining skills become so... formidable?"

This was indeed what concerned him most right now.

He knew Chen Ruoxi enjoyed studying artifact refining, but he'd never imagined his eldest daughter's progress would be so incredibly fast!

"It was..."

Chen Ruoxi was about to speak, but hesitated.

That's right!

What should she say?

Just directly say Lin Yuan taught her?

"It was my brother who taught her!"

Before Chen Ruoxi could say anything, Lin Ke'er suddenly spoke up first.

"Your... brother?"

Chen Tianhao was immediately stunned.

"Mm-hmm, my brother!"

Lin Ke'er's face was written all over with pride.

However, she had no idea that her seemingly casual remark had left everyone present utterly dumbfounded!

Especially Chen Tianhao.

At this moment, his thoughts were racing.

Lin Yuan?

Lin Yuan was actually proficient in artifact refining too?

This...

This was too outrageous!!!

Not only was this man's own cultivation outstanding, but he was also proficient in artifact refining? What were his limits exactly?!

Chen Tianhao felt like his brain was about to crash.

"Hahaha... hahahaha!"

"Heaven hasn't abandoned my Chen family! Heaven hasn't abandoned my Chen family!"

Moments later.

A flash of insight sparked in Chen Tianhao's mind.

He understood!

He completely understood!

Lin Yuan!

This man was no genius at all!

He was simply an omnipotent god!

Divine in martial arts!

Divine in artifact refining too!

This was the Chen family's one and only, final chance!

"Someone come!"

Chen Tianhao slammed the table and let out a sharp command!

"Prepare generous gifts! No! Bring me the map to that Stellar Vein in our vault!"

"Patriarch! You mustn't! That Stellar Vein is our Chen family's greatest trump card!"

"Indeed! Stellar ore is a crucial material for producing military-grade artifacts. Possessing this vein ensures our Chen family's prosperity for generations! Patriarch, please reconsider!"

"Moreover, the stellar core within is still gestating—it's meant for crafting a natal weapon for our future prodigy, Young Master Chen Yu!"

The elders' faces changed dramatically.

"Silence!"

Chen Tianhao glared at them fiercely, his eyes gleaming with the mad light of a gambler.

"Compared to the survival of our entire family, what's one little vein?!"

"Compared to connecting with the Lin family, what does it matter?!"

"My decision is made!"

"Tonight, I will personally pay a visit to the Lin family!"

He was going to gamble!

Stake the entire Chen family's future!

To bet on a chance to rise to the heavens in a single bound!

Night, deep as ink.

Lin Family Estate, brightly lit.

Study.

Lin Jianguo sat holding a cup of hot tea, his face dark as water.

Across from him, Chen family patriarch Chen Tianhao stood respectfully, bowing.

He didn't even dare to sit.

That face that normally carried such authority now wore nothing but humble and... fawning smiles.

Carefully, cautiously, he presented a map drawn on special beast hide with both hands.

"General Lin, this is a small token of my sincerity. I hope you will... graciously accept it."

Lin Jianguo didn't take the map.

He merely raised his eyelids slightly, giving Chen Tianhao a casual glance.

Just that one look.

Chen Tianhao instantly felt as if he'd been locked onto by a slumbering primordial beast!

A terrifying aura of iron-blooded carnage, like mountains of corpses and seas of blood, came crashing down like a physical Mount Tai!

Thump!

Chen Tianhao's legs went weak, and he nearly dropped to his knees on the spot!

Cold sweat instantly soaked through his back.

He felt that what he faced was not a man at all.

But a supreme god of slaughter, commanding hundreds of millions of armored soldiers, whose word could determine the life or death of tens of thousands!

This was the might of Dragon Xia Country's nation-protecting general!

"Patriarch Chen, what brings you visiting so late at night?"

Lin Jianguo set down his teacup, his voice flat, devoid of any emotion.

But every word made Chen Tianhao's heart convulse wildly.

"Great... Great General!"

Chen Tianhao's throat went dry.

He forced himself to endure the pressure that threatened to shatter his very soul, and said tremblingly: "This junior... this junior has come to apologize to the Lin family!"

"Previously, my worthless son was foolish and fell for that Liu family brat's manipulation, showing great disrespect to Young Master Yuan. I hope the Great General and Young Master Yuan can be magnanimous enough to forgive us!"

As he spoke, his knees actually buckled, and he was about to kneel!

"Enough."

Lin Jianguo waved his hand. "Matters between children—I can't be bothered with them."

"Speak. What's your true purpose here?"

His gaze was sharp as a blade, as if seeing through all of Chen Tianhao's thoughts.

Chen Tianhao's heart jolted.

He knew that before such a figure, any beating around the bush would only bring humiliation upon himself.

He gritted his teeth and decided to lay his cards on the table!

"Great General sees clearly!"

"My Chen family is willing, from this day forward, to follow the Lin family's lead in all things!"

"This Stellar Vein is our Chen family's... pledge of allegiance!"

Stellar Vein!

These three words finally produced a subtle flicker on Lin Jianguo's eternally unchanging face.

As the supreme commander of the military, he naturally knew what this vein meant.

Stellar ore was the best material for forging standard military artifacts!

Hard, sharp, and capable of resonating with military formations, greatly enhancing an army's overall combat effectiveness!

All this time, Dragon Xia Country's stellar ore had been firmly controlled by the imperial family and the military.

He hadn't expected that even a small Chen family had secretly held one!

Moreover, looking at the reserves on this map, it seemed... quite substantial!

This was indeed a weighty gift!

"The Liu family has been putting great pressure on you?"

Lin Jianguo picked up his teacup and took a light sip.

"Yes!"

Chen Tianhao dared not hide anything. "The Liu family has wolfish ambitions, always wanting to swallow our Chen family and control all the artifact refining resources in Yan Jing City!"

"But a cornered dog will jump over a wall. I fear they will use my Chen family as their final stepping stone!"

"So you want my Lin family to protect you?"

Lin Jianguo struck at the heart of the matter.

"Yes!"

Chen Tianhao nodded heavily. "If the Lin family agrees, my Chen family is willing to go through fire and water for the Lin family for generations, without hesitation!"

Inside the study, a brief silence fell.

Lin Jianguo's fingers tapped lightly on the desk.

Each tap was like a death knell, pushing Chen Tianhao's heart into his throat.

He was waiting.

Waiting for a verdict that would determine his entire clan's fate!

Finally, Lin Jianguo's tapping fingers stopped.

He slowly raised his eyes, his gaze falling on that beast-hide map.

"The map—I'll accept it."

A simple sentence.

But it struck Chen Tianhao's mind like thunder!

It worked!

He'd bet right!

The Lin family had accepted his Chen family's pledge!

"Thank you, Great General! Thank you, Great General!"

Chen Tianhao was so overcome with excitement that his whole body trembled, tears nearly streaming down his face.

He bowed deeply to Lin Jianguo, thump thump thump, three loud kowtows!

This time, Lin Jianguo didn't stop him.

This was his due.

And it was the loyalty the Chen family needed to show.

"From this day forward, my Chen family is willing to go through fire and water for the Lin family for generations! Should there be any disloyalty, may heaven and earth destroy us!"

Chen Tianhao's voice was resolute and decisive!
