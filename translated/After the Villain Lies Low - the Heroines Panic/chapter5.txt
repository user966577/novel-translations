Lin Yuan actually told Li Xuan'er to...

Scram???

The word wasn't loud, but in the quiet cultivation room, it reached every ear with perfect clarity.

The entire room fell instantly silent.

Every classmate's eyes went wide, wondering if they'd misheard.

The sweet smile on Li Xuan'er's face also froze solid. She stared at Lin Yuan in disbelief.

That word again!

He actually told her to scram in front of the entire class?

"Lin Yuan! You!"

Li Xuan'er's cheeks instantly flushed crimson with shame and rage.

Only then did Lin Yuan lazily sit up straight.

His gaze swept across the gawking classmates, then returned to Li Xuan'er, his voice suddenly rising several notches.

"Everyone, let me tell you a joke."

"Yesterday, this very Campus Beauty Li came to my house out of nowhere, demanding three Yellow Rank High-Grade Qi Gathering Pills."

"What? Got chewed out and sent packing yesterday, and today she still has the nerve to come to school asking for Ice Soul Orchid?"

"Li Xuan'er, is your face made of city walls? Or do you think I, Lin Yuan, am some fool you can summon and dismiss at will?"

"Using me as your ATM, taking my resources to support your pretty boy Ye Xuan—you really thought I didn't know?"

Lin Yuan's words exploded like thunder throughout the classroom!

Everyone was completely stunned by this bombshell!

So that happened yesterday?

And Lin Yuan actually...

Knew everything?!

Li Xuan'er felt as if struck by lightning, her face turning deathly pale.

She hadn't expected Lin Yuan to expose everything publicly, speaking so bluntly without leaving her a shred of dignity!

"I... I didn't!"

She instinctively tried to defend herself.

"Shut up!"

Lin Yuan's sudden bark was accompanied by a terrifying pressure exploding from within him!

The aura of peak Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level.

Combined with a trace of the Nine Heavens Thunder Emperor Scripture's lightning will, it transformed into tangible pressure that slammed into Li Xuan'er!

"Thud! Thud! Thud!"

Li Xuan'er felt as though an invisible mountain had crashed into her chest.

Her blood churned as she staggered back seven or eight steps, finally landing with a "thump," collapsing ungracefully to the floor.

She stared at Lin Yuan with a face full of horror, her eyes filled with fear and disbelief.

So...

So powerful!

This pressure was ten times more terrifying than what she'd felt at the villa yesterday!

The entire class was frightened into silence by this sudden turn of events, every face slack-jawed with shock.

"My god... that aura... Lin Yuan, he... what is he trying to do?"

"He actually dared lose his temper at Li Xuan'er?"

"The simp... has he awakened? No, this is evolution into a tyrannosaurus!"

Murmurs erupted again.

But this time, no one dared mock Lin Yuan. The gazes directed at him were filled with awe and shock.

Under countless strange stares, Li Xuan'er felt she had nowhere to hide.

She scrambled up from the floor, shot Lin Yuan a venomous glare, and ran crying from the cultivation room.

As for Lin Yuan, he acted as though he'd done something utterly trivial, leaning back against the wall and yawning before closing his eyes.

Back to sleep.

The incident of Lin Yuan publicly humiliating Li Xuan'er—while displaying what appeared to be the terrifying strength of Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level—spread like a typhoon.

Within half a day, it had swept through the entire Capital Martial Arts Academy.

The former "Number One Simp" who had catered to Li Xuan'er's every whim had suddenly transformed into a cold-faced god of death. This dramatic contrast had everyone buzzing.

The campus forums and various group chats were exploding with discussion.

"Breaking news! Young Master Lin has awakened, and the green tea campus beauty died of embarrassment on the spot!"

"I was there! That aura was too terrifying! Li Xuan'er was literally knocked down and ran away crying!"

"So Lin Yuan wasn't weak before—he just put all his effort in the wrong place!"

"Even a pig could fly with the Lin family's resources to pile on, right?"

"Exactly. Simped for all those years, got nothing. Finally woke up. Taking all those pills he fed to Li Xuan'er and eating them himself—how could he not improve? I think he's just a simp who woke up, nothing special."

This view quickly became mainstream.

After all, how could someone's nature change so easily?

In most people's eyes, Lin Yuan was still that spoiled good-for-nothing who had nothing but his family background.

Lin Yuan couldn't have cared less about the outside gossip.

His former little followers noticed that the young master's life had become terrifyingly routine lately.

Either sleeping in class, or sunbathing on the garden lawn, or spacing out on the library sofa.

In short, one word—

Lazy.

Yet somehow, that faint but unmistakable powerful aura around him grew more alarming by the day.

During break time, in the academy's rear garden beneath a century-old tree.

Lin Yuan lay on the soft grass with his arms behind his head, a grass stem between his teeth, eyes closed as he rested, enjoying the system's automatic idle service.

Just as he was about to fall asleep, a clear, melodious female voice with a hint of teasing rang out above his head.

"Well, well, if it isn't our academy-famous Young Master Lin. Your life sure is elegant!"

Lin Yuan lazily opened one eye and looked up.

What entered his vision was a pair of straight, slender legs wrapped in fashionable jeans, outlining stunning curves.

Gaze traveling upward—a tall, curvaceous beauty with an hourglass figure.

She had chestnut-colored wavy hair, features bright and alluring, with a touch of heroic confidence.

Completely different from Li Xuan'er's pure white lotus type—this was an aggressively striking beauty.

Gu Ningxue.

The name surfaced in Lin Yuan's mind.

The young miss of the Gu family. Though their background wasn't quite on par with the Lin family, they were still a first-rate noble house in Dragon Xia Country.

In the original novel, she was also one of the female leads.

Currently at Marrow Cleansing Realm sixth level.

A top-tier prodigy!

In the early chapters, she'd had some interactions with the original host due to family connections.

But as the original host went further down the paths of simping and villainy, they'd gradually drifted apart.

Later, Ye Xuan rose to prominence.

After helping the Gu family and Gu Ningxue through several adventures, she naturally became another member of Ye Xuan's harem.

But right now, none of that had happened yet.

"Of course." Lin Yuan closed his eyes again, answering lazily. "With weather this nice, not taking a nap would be such a waste."

Gu Ningxue sat down beside him with interest, a pleasant perfume scent wafting over.

She propped her chin on her hand, her beautiful eyes turning mischievously as she smiled. "What's this? Not going to orbit around your goddess Xuan'er today? I heard you practically made her cry."

Lin Yuan couldn't even be bothered to move his eyelids, just shifted the grass stem to the other side of his mouth.

"Goddess? Don't make me laugh. She doesn't deserve that title—'goddess of delusion' might be more like it."

His tone was so flat it seemed like he was discussing something that had nothing to do with him.

"Oh?"

A flash of surprise crossed Gu Ningxue's beautiful eyes.

"She doesn't deserve it?" These four words coming from Lin Yuan—who used to worship Li Xuan'er like a deity—packed quite a punch.

"You didn't used to talk like this," Gu Ningxue probed. "Back then, if anyone said a bad word about Li Xuan'er, you'd fight them to the death."

"People change." Lin Yuan's voice betrayed no emotion. "Simp long enough, and you get tired. Besides, facing a block of ice that won't melt no matter how hot your heart burns—continuing to persist isn't devotion. It's stupidity."

Having said his piece, he fell silent, as though he'd truly fallen asleep.

But Gu Ningxue was stunned.

She stared at Lin Yuan's profile.

Sunlight filtered through gaps in the leaves, casting dappled shadows on him.

He was clearly talking about something sad, yet his tone was terrifyingly calm, as if narrating someone else's story.

This near-cold rationality and nonchalance was completely different from the impulsive, obsessive simp she remembered.

Like two entirely different people.

Lost in thought.

She suddenly felt that this Lin Yuan, "giving up on life" while lying on the grass, was far more interesting than the one who used to chase after someone else.
