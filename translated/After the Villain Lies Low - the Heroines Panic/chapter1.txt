"Lin Yuan, I need three Yellow Rank High-Grade Qi Gathering Pills and a Hundred-Year Blood Ginseng. Go get them for me right now."

A cold, commanding female voice rang in his ears.

Lin Yuan felt his head splitting with pain as countless fragmented memories flooded into his mind like a tidal wave.

Transmigrated?

He snapped his eyes open, and the first thing he saw was a face of breathtaking beauty.

The girl before him had silky black hair cascading to her waist, skin white as snow, and features so refined they seemed crafted by the finest artist.

She wore a pure white dress, her demeanor cold and aloof, like a snow lotus untouched by worldly affairs.

Li Xuan'er.

The name surfaced instantly in Lin Yuan's mind.

Then more memories came rushing in.

Only then did Lin Yuan realize—

He had transmigrated!

He'd crossed into an urban cultivation novel called "Supreme Martial God" and become the book's top villain who shared his name.

And his identity? An absolutely godlike starting hand!

His grandfather, Lin Zhan, was one of Blue Star's pinnacle combat powers.

Single-handedly guarding Dragon Xia Country for a century, his fame resounded across the globe—a legendary War God whose mere stomp could make the world tremble!

His father, Lin Jianguo, was Dragon Xia Country's Grand General.

Ranked first among the Three Dukes, wielding supreme authority!

His mother, Su Qin, was a member of Dragon Xia Country's Elder Council, universally acknowledged as the nation's strongest female Elder, her influence spanning the entire court!

Not to mention his elder sister who controlled the nation's top financial conglomerate, and his little sister who was a prodigy in esoteric formations!

With such a background, he could win while lying down.

Yet somehow, the original "Lin Yuan" in the novel was an utter moron!

He was hopelessly obsessed with the cold goddess before him, Li Xuan'er, becoming a complete and utter simp.

Li Xuan'er treated him like her personal ATM.

Cultivation resources, rare treasures—whatever she asked for, the original host would eagerly hand over.

However, Li Xuan'er would turn around and give all those resources to the novel's Child of Destiny—Ye Xuan.

In the end, the original host's fate was utterly miserable.

Not only was he trampled underfoot by Ye Xuan, becoming a stepping stone for the protagonist's rise to fame.

The entire Lin family was also gradually consumed and destroyed by the rising Ye Xuan because of him.

When Lin Yuan read this novel in his previous life, he'd nearly had a stroke from the original host's idiotic decisions.

A perfect godlike start.

He could've won just by lying down!

If the author hadn't forced the plot, how could he possibly have lost to the protagonist?

And now, he'd become this moron?

No, absolutely not!

In his previous life, he was a corporate slave working 996, slaving away day after day, "enjoying the blessing" of overwork.

Having finally transmigrated once, and with such a divine starting position, how could he repeat the same mistakes?

He had to turn things around!

He was going to lie flat properly!

And enjoy this hard-won premium life!

Just then, an ice-cold mechanical voice rang in his mind.

[Ding! Detected Host's strong desire to lie flat. Divine-Grade Lying Flat System binding successful!]

[This System aims to help Host better enjoy life. Host only needs to maintain a lying flat posture to receive generous rewards!]

[The flatter you lie, the richer the rewards!]

Lin Yuan's eyes instantly lit up.

A Lying Flat System?

There's actually such a good thing?

This was practically tailor-made for him!

[Ding! Detected Host's first binding. Distributing one Newbie Gift Pack. Open immediately?]

"Yes! Open it now!"

Lin Yuan silently affirmed without hesitation.

[Ding! Congratulations Host, obtained supreme physique—Primordial Sacred Body!]

[Primordial Sacred Body: The number one sacred body throughout the ages, one in billions. Can automatically absorb Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi at all times, cultivation speed advances a thousand li in a day, physical body indestructible, immune to all techniques!]

A warm current instantly surged from his heart, flowing through his limbs and bones.

Lin Yuan felt his body undergoing earth-shattering changes. Every cell was cheering and leaping, as if breaking free from some shackles, filled with boundless power!

"Lin Yuan? What are you spacing out for?"

Seeing Lin Yuan standing there in silence with a vacant look, Li Xuan'er's delicate brows furrowed even tighter, her tone growing increasingly impatient.

"Did you hear what I said? Yellow Rank Top-Grade Qi Gathering Pills and Hundred-Year Blood Ginseng! Brother Ye Xuan is about to break through and needs them urgently! Hurry up and give them to me!"

Just as expected!

Lin Yuan sneered inwardly.

Exactly like the original plot—these resources were meant to serve as breakthrough capital for that Child of Destiny, Ye Xuan.

In the original novel, simp Lin Yuan would go crazy with jealousy upon hearing his goddess mention "Brother Ye Xuan."

But to please his goddess, he'd still obediently hand over treasures from the family vault.

Too bad the current Lin Yuan was no longer that simp.

You want to take my resources to support your pretty boy?

Dream on!

Lin Yuan slowly raised his head, his gaze calmly meeting Li Xuan'er's. His thin lips parted, uttering a single word.

"Scram."

The air instantly went silent.

The impatience and entitlement on Li Xuan'er's face froze solid. She even wondered if something was wrong with her ears.

"You... what did you say?" she asked in disbelief. "Lin Yuan, say that again!"

"I said, scram." Lin Yuan's tone was perfectly level, yet carried an undeniable coldness. "Don't you understand human speech?"

Li Xuan'er was completely stunned.

The Lin Yuan who had always obeyed her every word, who held her in the palm of his hand—he actually dared tell her to scram?

A surge of shame and rage rose in her heart.

She immediately threw a princess tantrum, her eyes reddening with grievance. "Lin Yuan! What's wrong with you today! How dare you talk to me like this? Don't you love me anymore?"

In the past, whenever she put on this pitiful act, Lin Yuan would immediately soften.

No matter how angry he was, it would all dissipate, and he'd get on his knees to coax her.

But this time, she miscalculated.

Lin Yuan slowly rose from the sofa.

As he moved, an invisible aura exploded forth!

It wasn't mere cultivation pressure, but a crushing force originating from the very level of life itself!

The Primordial Sacred Body!

The number one physique throughout the ages!

It inherently carried a supreme divine might!

Li Xuan'er felt a terrifying pressure slam down on her head, making even breathing difficult. Her legs went weak, and she nearly collapsed to her knees!

Her heart pounded wildly, all color draining from her face.

This...

This was Lin Yuan?

How had he become so terrifying!

"Don't play these games with me. They're useless."

Lin Yuan looked down at her, his eyes cold. "I'll say this one last time. Get out of my sight. Otherwise, face the consequences yourself."

Under that pressure that seemed capable of crushing souls, Li Xuan'er couldn't utter another word.

The petty tricks and temper in her heart were washed away completely by fear.

She stumbled back two steps, gritting her teeth, squeezing out a face-saving line.

"Lin Yuan, you... you just wait! You'll definitely regret this!"

With that, she didn't dare linger.

She turned and fled in panic from this suffocating villa.
