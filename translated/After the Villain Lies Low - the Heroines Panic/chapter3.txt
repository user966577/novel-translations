Meanwhile, at the Lin family estate.

Having chased away that green tea bitch Li Xuan'er, Lin Yuan felt thoroughly refreshed.

He lazily sprawled on a beach chair beside his backyard's enormous swimming pool.

Overhead was a sun umbrella, beside him an iced fruit juice, as he leisurely enjoyed the afternoon sun.

Now this was the life!

In his past life, he got PUA'd by his boss daily for a pittance of a salary. Now, the world was vast, but lying flat was paramount.

[Ding! Detected Host has successfully maintained lying-flat posture for half an hour. Primordial Sacred Body automatically operating, spiritual qi absorption efficiency +10%!]

The system notification chimed in his mind.

Lin Yuan immediately felt an extremely pure stream of Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi rushing into his body from all directions at a terrifying speed.

The Lin family estate was built atop a massive Spiritual Vein, with top-tier Spirit Gathering Arrays deployed throughout. The spiritual qi concentration here was already dozens of times higher than the outside world.

And now, Lin Yuan with his Primordial Sacred Body was like a human black hole, greedily devouring everything.

After this spiritual qi entered his body, the Primordial Sacred Body instantly refined it without the slightest delay.

It directly converted into the purest cultivation, washing through his limbs and bones, his extraordinary meridians.

He could clearly "see" his bones beginning to glow with a faint jade-like luster, while his bone marrow flowed like liquid mercury, shimmering with brilliant radiance.

Every part of his body was being strengthened, transformed.

Just then, the spiritual power accumulated within him reached a critical point!

It was as if an invisible barrier had been broken through, and an aura far more powerful than before surged up from within him!

Breakthrough!

In this world, martial cultivation realms were divided into: Bone Forging Realm, Marrow Cleansing Realm, Qi Sea Realm, Meridian Opening Realm, Aura Transformation Realm, Essence Gathering Realm, Rebirth Realm, Sky Riding Realm, and Sky Trampling Realm.

Each major realm was further divided into levels one through nine.

The original host was already a genius at Marrow Cleansing Realm sixth level.

And now, empowered by the Primordial Sacred Body, Lin Yuan had directly broken through the bottleneck and entered Marrow Cleansing Realm seventh level!

Yet this was only the beginning!

That massive torrent of energy showed no signs of stopping, continuing to surge and roar within him!

Another muffled sound—Marrow Cleansing Realm eighth level!

BOOM!!

Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level!

Only when his cultivation stabilized firmly at the peak of Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level, just one step away from opening his Sea of Qi and stepping into the next major realm, did the breakthrough momentum finally subside.

"Holy crap..."

Lin Yuan felt the surging power within him that seemed ready to overflow, unable to help but curse.

"I'm already at... Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level?"

How long had it been?

From binding the system until now, only about an hour had passed, right?

He'd just lain here drinking juice, and he'd directly jumped three levels, from Marrow Cleansing sixth level to ninth level peak?

This Primordial Sacred Body was way too overpowered!

Lin Yuan couldn't help but mentally compare his strength to his academy classmates.

Dragon Xia Country's Capital Martial Arts Academy gathered the nation's top geniuses.

But even so, most freshmen were still at Bone Forging Realm, tempering their bodies.

Those who could enter Marrow Cleansing Realm were already excellent students, mostly at first or second level.

Those who could reach third or fourth level were called geniuses, key cultivation targets of the academy.

Someone like the original host, reaching Marrow Cleansing Realm sixth level at eighteen, was already exceedingly rare—a phoenix feather or qilin horn!

And now, he was at the peak of Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level!

The gap was a tier-crushing advantage!

At this level, he'd be outstanding even nationwide!

Lin Yuan couldn't help but think of that Child of Destiny, Ye Xuan.

According to the original novel's memories, Ye Xuan right now should still be at Marrow Cleansing Realm first level.

Though he was extraordinarily talented, blessed with great fortune, able to fight above his level—a prodigy praised by all.

But no matter how much you can fight above your level, can you skip eight minor realms?

You think you can fight me?

A playful smile curled at Lin Yuan's lips.

He remembered clearly.

In the original novel, at the school-wide competition a month from now, Ye Xuan had risen to fame precisely by stepping on the then-sixth-level "Lin Yuan."

That battle, Ye Xuan defeated someone stronger than himself and dazzled everyone.

While the original host became a laughingstock, a stepping stone highlighting the protagonist's glory, never to recover.

"Ye Xuan, oh Ye Xuan..."

Lin Yuan murmured to himself. "At this school-wide competition, you still want to step on me to rise? I wonder how wonderful your expression will be then?"

He didn't even need to do anything deliberately, to target anyone specifically.

He just needed to lie there peacefully, and his strength would rocket upward.

This feeling was simply too amazing!

This kind of crushing dominance—unknowingly leaving the so-called Child of Destiny so far behind he couldn't even see your shadow—that was the highest level of showing off!

"Young Master, would you like me to bring you another glass of iced spirit fruit juice?"

A pretty maid in a maid outfit approached silently, asking respectfully.

She was tall with long, slender legs outlined tightly by black stockings, her walk carrying a certain charm.

"Mm, bring some pastries too."

Lin Yuan waved lazily, not even bothering to open his eyes.

Soon, fresh juice and exquisite pastries were served.

Lin Yuan contentedly sipped his juice, thinking this was truly the life he'd dreamed of.

As for what Ye Xuan and Li Xuan'er were feeling right now, he couldn't care less.

The Child of Destiny was still fretting over scraps of cultivation resources.

While he had already begun enjoying life.

Just then, the system notification sounded again.

[Ding! Congratulations Host, successfully maintained lying-flat posture for one day. Achievement "First Taste of Lying Flat" unlocked. Reward: Heaven Rank top-grade cultivation method—"Nine Heavens Thunder Emperor Scripture"!]

Lin Yuan's eyes instantly lit up.

More rewards?

And it's this kind of divine-level cultivation method?

He immediately chose to receive it. A massive stream of information poured into his mind.

Before Lin Yuan could recover from the rush of jumping three levels, the system notification made his spirits surge again.

Heaven Rank top-grade cultivation method?

Without hesitation, he mentally affirmed: "Receive!"

In this world, cultivation methods were divided into four ranks: Heaven, Earth, Profound, and Yellow.

Yellow was the lowest, Heaven the highest.

Each rank was further divided into lower, middle, upper, and top grades.

A Heaven Rank top-grade cultivation method was the strongest grade possible, cultivated only by humanity's most powerful!

And he'd just directly obtained one?

Incredible!

BOOM!

As if the first thunderbolt had struck from the nine heavens, an incomparably vast, mysterious, and domineering stream of information instantly poured into the depths of his soul.

"Nine Heavens Thunder Emperor Scripture"!

This was a supreme technique created by the ancient Thunder Emperor!

Cultivated to great completion, one could transform into lightning itself, wield the punishment of heaven and earth, speak laws into existence, summon divine lightning from the nine heavens with a single thought, and judge all things!

Countless golden ancient characters spiraled and branded themselves in his Sea of Consciousness, each character containing the will of thunder.

Simultaneously, the spiritual power within him began circulating automatically according to the unique method of the Nine Heavens Thunder Emperor Scripture.

Threads of pale purple lightning power manifested from nothing, surging and racing through his broad, resilient meridians, crackling softly.

His physical body, already refined to near perfection by the Primordial Sacred Body, was tempered once more by this lightning power, becoming even more indestructible!
