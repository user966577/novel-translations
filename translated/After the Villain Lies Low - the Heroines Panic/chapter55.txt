Hum——

Hum——

Hum——

Pillars of light descended from the sky, enveloping all the surviving participants in the wilderness.

The next second.

Light flashed, and everyone's figures reappeared in the massive plaza where the hunt had begun.

Only.

The atmosphere in the plaza now was worlds apart from before!

Silence!

A silence ten thousand times more profound than when Lin Yuan had been sleeping!

The several hundred surviving prodigies, every single one, stood like puppets with their souls extracted.

Their faces were pale as sheets, eyes vacant, bodies trembling uncontrollably.

No one cheered.

No one talked.

There wasn't even anyone breathing loudly!

Everyone's gaze, unconsciously, with a fear and reverence rising from the depths of their souls, turned toward the very center of the plaza.

There.

A figure slowly materialized.

Lin Yuan.

He still wore that lazy expression, as if the earth-shattering battle just now had been nothing more than a trivial after-dinner amusement.

He even yawned and stretched.

Yet!

The instant he raised his arm!

Whoosh——!

With him at the center, everyone within a hundred-meter radius screamed in terror like they'd seen a ghost, scrambling and crawling backward as fast as they could.

As if Lin Yuan carried some world-destroying virus!

In an instant.

A massive, eerie vacuum zone appeared at the center of the plaza!

And Lin Yuan stood alone at its very heart.

Those heirs who had been clamoring to team up and take him down now wished they could find a crack in the ground to hide in!

They finally understood how laughable, how childish their earlier thoughts had been!

Defeat, cripple, or even kill Lin Yuan?

With their lot, no better than ants?

Kill a god who could summon stars at will and shatter the earth with a single palm?!

That wasn't seeking death!

That wasn't even qualified to be called seeking death!

They weren't even in the same dimension!

The gap between them and Lin Yuan was billions of times greater than the gap between humans and dust!

Facing those gazes of awe, fear, and even worship all around him.

Lin Yuan's face showed not a ripple.

He didn't care.

Couldn't be bothered to care.

He just felt a bit hungry.

So.

Under the watch of several hundred pairs of eyes.

He took his steps, unhurried, walking toward the plaza exit.

Wherever he passed.

The crowd parted automatically to either side.

Everyone held their breath, lowered their proud heads, respectfully making way for their "god"—a path to the mortal world.

No one dared block him.

No one dared speak.

The entire world seemed to hold only the sound of his unhurried footsteps.

Yet.

Just as Lin Yuan was about to exit the plaza.

A cold voice, tinged with hesitation and nervousness, broke the silence.

"Wait... wait!"

It was Gu Ningxue!

Every gaze snapped toward the woman who dared call out to stop their "god"!

Gu Ningxue's cold, stunning face now wore a rare blush.

She hurried up to Lin Yuan, head slightly lowered, not daring to meet his eyes, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Just now... and before... thank you."

She knew that without Lin Yuan, she would already be dead.

Without Lin Yuan, all the prodigies of Yan Jing City would have been swept away in that conspiracy!

Lin Yuan stopped, glancing at her with some surprise.

Then, in a tone so matter-of-fact it held not a ripple of emotion, he spoke.

"Oh."

"No trouble at all."

With that.

He didn't even spare another glance at the number one campus belle of Capital Martial Arts Academy.

He simply turned and continued walking toward home.

As if saving her had truly been no more than lifting a hand to dust off some dirt—not worth mentioning.

"Hey..."

Gu Ningxue suddenly raised her head, seeming to want to say something more.

But that man's back was already growing distant.

Still that lazy, couldn't-care-less-about-anything demeanor.

Yet so... unreachable.

Gu Ningxue's lips moved, but in the end, no sound came out.

She could only watch helplessly as that figure grew smaller and smaller.

Still so casual, so offhand.

As if everything he'd just done was really just taking out the trash.

The feeling was... strange.

A mix of the humiliation of being utterly ignored and an indescribable sense of security.

As if the sky could fall and someone would find it annoying, then casually slap it back up.

And all she needed to do was stand far enough away not to get her clothes dirty.

Just as her thoughts tangled and wandered.

An arm suddenly reached over from beside her, draping familiarly across her shoulders.

"Well, well."

A voice laced with teasing and amusement rang in her ear.

"Our Capital Martial Arts Academy's eternal ice princess... has her heart been stirred?"

Gu Ningxue stiffened. Without even looking, she knew who it was.

Only Song Yao, who feared nothing in heaven or earth, would dare joke with her like this at a time like this.

She felt somewhat embarrassed as she gently shrugged off Song Yao's arm. The blush on her pretty face that hadn't yet faded deepened a few shades more.

"What nonsense!"

She protested weakly, her voice lacking conviction.

"I was just... just saying thank you! He did save all of us!"

"Oh? Just saying thank you?"

Song Yao folded her arms, looking her up and down with great interest, the teasing curve at her lips growing wider.

"Does saying thank you require blushing down to your neck?"

"Does saying thank you mean staring longingly after someone who left without even turning back?"

"How does it feel? Our Yan Jing's number one campus belle taking the initiative, and he doesn't even give her a proper look. Doesn't feel good, does it?"

Every word Song Yao spoke was like a tiny needle, precisely piercing Gu Ningxue's proud ego.

"You!"

Gu Ningxue was flustered and annoyed, yet she couldn't refute a thing.

Because everything Song Yao said was true.

She could only turn her head away, refusing to look at Song Yao's infuriating smug face, though her gaze drifted uncontrollably toward the plaza exit where Lin Yuan had long since vanished.

"When did you... become such a gossip?" was all she could squeeze out through gritted teeth.

"I'm not gossiping."

The smile on Song Yao's face gradually faded.

In its place was an unprecedented gravity.

Her gaze turned to that same exit, her expression becoming incredibly complex.

"I just feel..." she said.

She paused, her voice dropping very low, as if afraid of disturbing some forbidden existence.

"We were all too ridiculous before."

"Competing for the title of top genius, fighting to death for a few extra numbers on the leaderboard."

"Looking back now... we're just a bunch of ants arguing over who can carry a bigger grain of rice."

"And he..."

Song Yao drew a deep breath, trying to suppress that shock in her chest.

But she failed.

"He simply doesn't live in the same world as us. Conjuring formations with a thought, shattering stars with a punch, turning a sword into an ocean..."

"This kind of gap can't even be described with 'talent' anymore!"

Song Yao's voice was like sleep-talk.

And Gu Ningxue beside her seemed to have heard what she said.

At this moment, she too spoke in a dreamlike voice: "Such a... massive gap?"
