Under the spotlight of countless eyes, the annual school-wide tournament of Dragon Xia Country's Capital Martial Arts Academy officially began.

The entire academy was swept up in an unprecedented frenzy.

The massive central arena was packed with spectators, colorful banners fluttering in the wind.

Countless students and representatives from various factions who'd come to observe focused their attention here.

For students, this was the perfect stage to make a name for themselves.

Those who distinguished themselves in the tournament would not only receive massive resource rewards from the academy but might also catch the early attention of Dragon Xia Country's military, the Elder Council, or major financial conglomerates—launching their careers to the stratosphere.

At the registration area, Ye Xuan stood tall and straight, his gaze sharp as a blade.

He clenched his fists, feeling the surging Marrow Cleansing Realm second level spiritual power within him, his heart brimming with soaring battle intent.

Lin Yuan!

He swore he would crush that guy beneath his feet on this grand stage before all these watching eyes.

Every humiliation inflicted upon him would be repaid a hundredfold!

He would show everyone who the true Child of Destiny was!

He stood there like a spear poised to strike, his eyes locked on the registration entrance, waiting for that familiar figure to appear.

However, time ticked by, minute by minute.

From dawn to dusk, as the registration window was about to close, Ye Xuan's brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

Where was he?

Why hadn't that Lin Yuan guy shown up yet?

"Registration closed!"

With the supervising teacher's loud announcement, the registration window slowly shut.

Ye Xuan stared at the empty entrance, completely dumbfounded.

He rushed to the registration list in disbelief, scanning it from top to bottom, checking it three times over.

Nothing!

Lin Yuan's name wasn't there at all!

That guy...

He simply hadn't registered!

"Pfft—"

Ye Xuan felt a surge of blood rush to his head, his throat sweetening as he nearly coughed up a mouthful of old blood.

He felt like a championship boxer who'd spent months in meticulous preparation, mustered all his strength, struck his coolest pose—only for his opponent to never even step into the ring!

This punch had landed squarely on cotton!

No, on thin air!

That frustration, that helplessness, was driving him mad!

"Why?"

Unwilling to accept it, he grabbed a passing student and demanded, "Where's Lin Yuan? Why isn't he participating in the tournament?"

The student, startled by his intensity, stammered out a reply, "Y-Young Master Lin? He... he seems to be sleeping in the back garden..."

Sleeping?!

Ye Xuan could no longer contain his fury. He spun around and charged toward the back garden like a maddened bull.

Sure enough, he immediately spotted that infuriating figure.

Lin Yuan lay beneath that familiar ancient tree.

Arms pillowed behind his head, sleeping soundly, even wearing a contented little smile at the corner of his mouth, as if having some pleasant dream.

"LIN YUAN!!!"

Ye Xuan's roar was like thunder, shaking the surrounding leaves into a rustling cascade.

Lin Yuan was jolted awake. He rubbed his eyes irritably.

Looking at this red-faced, trembling guy in front of him, he asked lazily, "What's all the yelling about? Don't you know it's rude to disturb someone's sleep?"

"I'm asking you!" Ye Xuan jabbed a finger at his nose, his voice quivering. "Why aren't you participating in the school-wide tournament?!"

Lin Yuan looked at him like he was an idiot.

"Why should I participate?"

"You... don't you want to prove yourself? Don't you want to settle things with me once and for all?"

"Prove myself?" Lin Yuan scoffed and lay back down. "Who do I need to prove anything to? As for you..."

He paused, his tone flat yet filled with supreme contempt.

"You're not qualified to interest me."

Ye Xuan froze completely.

He realized that all his efforts, all his anger, all his resentment, were nothing but a joke before this guy who'd completely embraced lying flat.

You can never use reverse psychology on someone who doesn't care about winning or losing.

You can never defeat an opponent who simply refuses to fight you.

An unprecedented sense of powerlessness washed over Ye Xuan like a tidal wave.

For the first time, he discovered that he had absolutely no way to deal with this guy.

News that Lin Yuan wasn't participating in the school-wide tournament exploded like a bombshell throughout the campus.

The entire school forum crashed again.

"Massive scoop! Lin Yuan forfeits! He didn't even register!"

"What's going on? Wasn't he acting all arrogant before? Now that it's time to get real, he chickens out?"

"I knew it! He's scared! He knows he can't beat Ye Xuan who's been training like crazy, so he's just being a turtle hiding in its shell!"

"Give me a break. Would sixth-level Marrow Cleansing Young Master Lin be afraid of a second-level?"

"You can't say that for sure. I heard Ye Xuan has extraordinary talent and tremendous strength—he can always challenge opponents above his level! Who knows if he could beat Young Master Lin?"

"Hiss... could Young Master Lin really be all talk, afraid Ye Xuan would stand up for the campus beauty on stage?"

All kinds of gossip circulated among the students.

Mockery wasn't in short supply.

After all, as the academy's notorious spoiled rich kid, Lin Yuan had plenty of enemies besides his lackeys.

Students who'd been intimidated by Lin Yuan's powerful aura before were now poking their heads up again, speculations and ridicule flying everywhere.

In their eyes, backing out at the last moment was even more shameful than losing.

In the girls' dormitory.

Li Xuan'er looked at the forum posts, a satisfied cold smile curling at her lips.

"I knew it!"

"He's just a paper tiger! All he can do is talk tough. When it actually comes time to prove himself with real strength, his true colors show!"

She said to her roommate beside her.

She felt like the resentment from being publicly humiliated by Lin Yuan had finally found an outlet.

Weren't you acting all high and mighty? Didn't you say Ye Xuan wasn't worth your time?

Now you don't even have the courage to face Ye Xuan on the same stage?

Coward!

Li Xuan'er's contempt for Lin Yuan deepened several more notches, while her confidence in Ye Xuan grew even stronger.

On the other side of the academy, Gu Ningxue also saw the news.

Her delicate brows furrowed slightly. She felt things weren't that simple.

Based on what she'd sensed of Lin Yuan's personality that day, he absolutely wasn't the type to back down out of fear.

That man had an indifference in his bones that looked down on everything.

Driven by curiosity, she once again came to that ancient tree in the back garden.

Lin Yuan was still lying there, as if the uproar in the outside world had nothing to do with him.

"You really can stay calm!"

Gu Ningxue stopped beside him.

Arms crossed, she looked down at him from above. "The whole school is calling you a coward now, saying you're afraid of Ye Xuan. Don't you want to explain yourself?"

Lin Yuan didn't even open his eyes, just lazily replied, "Explain? Why should I explain?"

"You... you're just going to let them talk about you like that?"

Gu Ningxue was half-amused, half-exasperated by his impenetrable attitude.

Lin Yuan finally opened his eyes.

He sat up, his calm gaze meeting Gu Ningxue's as he asked in return, "Does a lion care what a flock of sheep thinks?"

"Do you think I need to prove my strength to a bunch of ants?"

Those dark eyes held no ripples, yet emanated a bone-chilling dominance and confidence.

Gu Ningxue's heart skipped a beat for no reason.

She looked at this man who was clearly "giving up on life" yet more arrogant than anyone, and for a moment couldn't find words to respond.

Yes, with his Lin family status, with his own strength, he really...

Didn't need to prove anything to anyone.

At the Lin family estate.

Old butler Uncle Zhong was pacing back and forth in the living room like an ant on a hot pan.

He'd already heard all the rumors circulating at the academy.

His young master being called a "coward" and "turtle" by the whole school wasn't just damage to the young master's own reputation—it was an affront to the Lin family's honor!

He'd just gone to persuade him again, but the young master had only given him one sentence: "Don't bother me, I'm sleeping." He'd nearly had a heart attack.

"Ah! Young Master, oh Young Master! Why won't you take this seriously!"

Uncle Zhong sighed to the heavens, knowing there was no way he could convince him on his own.

Left with no choice, he gritted his teeth and made a decision.

Looks like the only option was to bring out the big guns!

He dialed that number again.

Light flickered as the video connected.

Uncle Zhong straightened his collar and bowed respectfully to the figure on the other end.

"Old Master, something's happened!"
