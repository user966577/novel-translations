Ye Xuan's roar echoed like a beast's howl.

Through the bamboo grove.

His eyes blazed with killing intent so intense it had nearly solidified, wanting nothing more than to tear Gu Ningxue to pieces and scatter her ashes to the wind!

Sensing the approaching danger.

Gu Ningxue immediately gripped her sword tightly, not daring to relax for even a moment.

And Song Yao beside her also furrowed her brows, moving closer to Gu Ningxue.

Though she hadn't said a word, everything was understood—Song Yao would not abandon Gu Ningxue!

"Even with another helper, it won't change your fate of certain death!"

"Kill!!!"

As his words fell.

Ye Xuan and Li Xuan'er hesitated no longer.

They flanked left and right, transforming into two blood-colored phantoms, charging at Gu Ningxue with lightning speed.

At the same moment, both struck!

BOOM——!

Blood-colored claw light, carrying an aura that corroded all things, descended from above!

Two forces intertwined, forming a net of certain death, completely sealing off all escape routes for Gu Ningxue and Song Yao!

"Ice Phoenix Dance!"

Gu Ningxue's pretty face was solemn.

In that instant, she pushed the spiritual energy in her body to its absolute limit without any reservation!

A lifelike ice crystal phoenix condensed behind her, letting out a clear cry as it met the deadly net with endless cold!

BANG——!!!

Ultimate cold collided with ultimate evil!

The entire bamboo grove was instantly leveled by this terrifying energy impact!

However...

The ice crystal phoenix lasted less than three seconds!

Under the corrosion of the interwoven blood and pink evil energy, it let out a mournful cry and shattered!

"Pff——!"

Gu Ningxue was struck as if by a heavy blow. Her slender body shuddered violently as a mouthful of fresh blood sprayed forth!

Her body flew backward like a kite with a broken string!

Ye Xuan's and Li Xuan'er's faces twisted with savage satisfaction!

This was exactly the result they wanted!

They would trample this woman—hailed as Yan Jing's number one prodigy—firmly beneath their feet, right in front of everyone!

"Die!"

Both roared simultaneously as their figures shot upward again. Two even more ferocious killing moves blasted toward the defenseless Gu Ningxue in mid-air!

This strike was unstoppable!!!

BOOM!!!!

But at this moment.

A sword qi, overwhelming and unstoppable, appeared out of thin air.

In a completely unexpected instant, it blocked that terrifying strike, shattering the combined assault of Ye Xuan and Li Xuan'er into nothing!

The crisis facing Gu Ningxue and Song Yao was dissolved into nothingness in that single instant.

Even so.

The powerful shockwave still caught Gu Ningxue off guard.

Her entire body was sent spinning through the air, tumbling for a long time before she could stabilize.

Yet at that moment.

A figure appeared behind her out of nowhere.

A hand reached out, gently catching Gu Ningxue's slender waist, steadying her securely in his arms.

Thump...

Then, landing lightly on the ground.

The entire sequence flowed like water.

Graceful, effortless.

And at that moment, Ye Xuan finally saw clearly who had come.

It was Lin Yuan!

Time seemed to freeze in that instant.

Ye Xuan and Li Xuan'er stared dead at this man who had suddenly appeared.

In their eyes was shock, was fury...

And that towering hatred erupting like a volcano!

"Lin... Yuan!"

Ye Xuan practically squeezed those two words from between his teeth!

The blood-colored evil aura around him surged wildly!

"Good! Very good! You finally decided to come out!"

"I was planning to deal with this slut first, then come find you! Who knew you'd deliver yourself to my door!"

"Today, I'll make you two lovebirds die together!"

Li Xuan'er's eyes were also filled with venom and madness!

"Lin Yuan! I'll tear you to pieces! Return everything you did to me a hundredfold!"

BOOM! BOOM!

Two terrifying auras at the peak of Qi Sea Realm erupted toward the sky!

The entire wilderness seemed to tremble under their pressure!

Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu, collapsed on the ground nearby, were scared witless!

Was this Ye Xuan's current strength?

Too terrifying!

However.

Facing this pressure that would make any prodigy despair.

Lin Yuan's face showed not the slightest change in expression.

He couldn't even be bothered to glance at them.

He simply lowered his head, looking at the pale-faced Gu Ningxue in his arms, his brow furrowing slightly.

Then, he casually pulled out a medicinal pill emanating a rich fragrance and placed it in her mouth.

After doing all this, he finally raised his eyelids, giving those two who seemed possessed by demons a look as if he were regarding garbage.

"Finished talking?"

"Good. Time for you to go."

"Seeking death!"

Lin Yuan's casual contempt completely ignited the last thread of reason in Ye Xuan's heart!

"Blood Demon Heaven-Devouring Claw!"

He roared, gathering all his strength into this single strike!

A massive demonic claw formed from pure blood evil qi tore through the air, carrying world-destroying might, descending upon Lin Yuan from above!

Li Xuan'er attacked simultaneously!

"Blood Prison Descent!"

Countless blood-colored beams transformed into soul-hooking chains, binding toward Lin Yuan from all directions!

This was their strongest strike!

Their hope for vengeance!

The pinnacle power they were confident could crush everything!

However...

Facing this heaven-shaking combined assault.

Lin Yuan finally moved.

He merely extended a single finger.

And casually drew a line before him.

A sword qi that seemed plain and unremarkable, even somewhat dim, flashed from his fingertip.

No earth-shattering momentum.

No world-destroying power.

Just like a child's casual doodle.

Yet this simple sword qi.

The instant it touched that blood-colored demonic claw and the chains filling the sky!

BOOM——!!!

Utterly devastating!

That imperious blood-colored demonic claw melted away like snow under sunlight, vanishing in an instant!

Those soul-stealing chains filling the sky burned away like spiderwebs meeting flame, turning to ash in an instant!

The sword qi continued, its momentum undiminished!

At a speed that transcended time and space, it struck heavily against Ye Xuan's and Li Xuan'er's chests!

Puff! Puff!

Two fountains of blood shot toward the sky!

Two figures, as if hit head-on by a speeding maglev train, flew backward at ten times the speed they'd come, smashing into the distant cliff face, carving two human-shaped craters into the solid rock!

The sound of shattering bones was clearly audible!

The entire scene fell silent!

Ye Xuan struggled as he slid down from the rock wall.

He stared in disbelief at his pierced chest, then at that man who hadn't even changed his posture.

His mind went blank!

How... is this possible?

Why... is it like this?

I've clearly become so strong!

I've clearly devoured so much blood essence!

I clearly have such powerful strength!

Why...

Why in front of him, am I still...

Not even equal to an ant?!

His confidence, his twisted yet powerful pride that he'd just built up.

In this moment, was cut to pieces by that casual sword qi...

Shattered beyond repair!
