Meanwhile.

In some unknown, dark underground chamber.

A thick stench of blood mixed with medicinal herbs filled the air, nauseating to breathe.

On two cold stone slabs.

Ye Xuan and Li Xuan'er lay side by side.

Their faces were white as paper, their auras weakened to the extreme. Their entire bodies were wrapped in thick bandages, looking like two mummies.

Their bodies had been shredded by Lin Yuan's sword intent.

Their souls had nearly been scattered by the aftershock of Lin Zhan's world-ending palm!

Now, forget moving—even breathing brought excruciating, tearing pain!

"Lin... Yuan..."

Ye Xuan ground out those two words through gritted teeth.

His eyes were filled with endless hatred and... despair.

He had lost.

Lost utterly and completely!

Lost without the slightest chance of luck!

That man, like an insurmountable mountain piercing the clouds, pressed heavily upon his heart!

Making even breathing feel like a luxury!

Seek revenge?

Defeat him?

Stop dreaming!

Right now, he was nothing but a thorough waste!

A pathetic wretch who couldn't even move a finger!

Li Xuan'er beside him was trembling all over. That once seductively beautiful face now showed only bone-deep fear.

She didn't even dare to hate anymore.

Just then.

A sinister figure appeared like a specter, standing silently beside the stone slabs.

It was Ye Canglan!

He looked at his son, lying there like a dead dog.

Beneath his hood, his eyes blazed with towering fury!

Not just at the Lin father and grandson!

But at his useless son as well!

Trash!

What utter trash!

Gaps in cultivation could be bridged, but a shattered spirit—that was truly pig-stupid!

Couldn't even withstand this bit of setback!

He forced down the rage in his heart and spoke in a voice so cold it held no trace of emotion.

"Xuan'er."

"Do not despair."

Hearing this, a mocking light flickered through Ye Xuan's ashen eyes.

Not despair?

How could he not despair?!

Everything he had was ruined!

Yet.

Ye Canglan's next words struck him like a bolt of lightning!

"This is only the... beginning of your true rise to power!!!"

Beginning?

Ye Xuan struggled to roll his eyes, looking at his bandage-wrapped body, his shattered meridians.

Grow powerful?

Right now, he was nothing but a waste who couldn't even move a finger!

Someone who'd been utterly crushed by Lin Yuan, by that monster of a grandfather—his dignity, his spirit, his everything—ground to dust...

A pathetic worm!

What power? What beginning?

Endless despair, like icy seawater, swallowed him completely.

Yet just as his heart turned to ash, about to be consumed entirely by that despair!

An aged voice exploded in his sea of consciousness!

"Ye Xuan! Wake up! Whatever you do, don't listen to his lies!"

It was the Supreme Dao Ancestor!

He could hold back no longer!

"Your current injuries, though they seem severe, haven't destroyed your foundation! With quiet recuperation, given time, returning to your peak isn't impossible!"

"But once you believe your father's seduction and walk that evil path, you'll truly be... beyond all redemption!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice was filled with unprecedented gravity and... fear!

He could sense it.

That man, Ye Canglan, was like a bottomless dark vortex. The path he was guiding Ye Xuan down was absolutely not some road to power!

It was a road of no return... leading to endless abyss!

"Shut up!"

Ye Xuan let out a hysterical roar in his mind.

Those ashen eyes were instantly replaced by endless hatred and madness!

"You think I'll still listen to you?!"

"You old fossil! I respected you as my master! But you?!"

"When have you ever truly helped me?!"

"When I was humiliated, where were you? When I was mocked as trash, where were you?!"

"When Lin Yuan trampled me like an ant, where were you?!"

"All you ever did was tell me to endure! To wait! To be a coward!"

"Now, I don't want to endure anymore! I don't want to wait anymore!"

"I want to walk my own path! I want power! Power at any cost!"

His consciousness raged like a maddened beast, crashing wildly through his sea of consciousness.

The Supreme Dao Ancestor's phantom remnant soul flickered and dimmed under this onslaught, as if it might scatter at any moment.

"You... you've gone mad! You've truly gone mad!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice was filled with disbelief.

"Mad?"

Ye Xuan let out a neurotic cold laugh.

Then, he made a decision that made the Supreme Dao Ancestor's soul nearly leap from his body in terror.

He suddenly raised his head.

Those eyes full of madness and resolve locked dead onto the demon-god-like figure standing beside his bed.

"Father!"

He howled with all his remaining strength, "I... I want to tell you a secret of mine!"

"Oh?"

Beneath Ye Canglan's hood, those deep eyes stirred slightly.

"Speak."

"In my sea of consciousness, there dwells a remnant soul!"

Ye Xuan's voice was full of vindictive satisfaction!

"He's called... the Supreme Dao Ancestor!"

BOOM!!!

The words "Supreme Dao Ancestor" were like a thunderbolt.

Making Ye Canglan's eternally icy aura waver violently for the first time.

"What did you say?!"

He stepped forward, appearing instantly before Ye Xuan. One hand, like an iron vise, clamped onto Ye Xuan's skull.

A consciousness, cold to the extreme, forced its way into Ye Xuan's sea of consciousness.

"Wretch! How dare you!!!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor let out a howl of shock and fury.

He desperately tried to hide his aura.

But before Ye Canglan's consciousness, vast as an ocean, his meager remnant soul power was like a firefly in the night—nowhere to hide.

"Hm hm..."

"Indeed... it really is the Supreme Dao Ancestor!"

"The old fool who fought the previous Divine Lord a hundred years ago and had his soul obliterated—actually left behind a remnant soul, hiding in my son's body?"

Ye Canglan let out a chilling, hair-raising laugh.

"Truly... heaven helps me!"

"Xuan'er! You truly are the most perfect gift heaven has given me!"

"Refine and absorb this remnant soul, and not only will your injuries be fully healed—your cultivation might even leap to the sky! Breaking through to Meridian Opening Realm wouldn't be impossible!"

"NO!!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor was utterly despairing.

He never could have imagined that after hiding for so many years, he would be exposed in such a way?

"Ye Canglan! If you dare touch me! I won't let you go!"

His final threat rang out.

"You? A mere remnant soul, and you dare be so insolent?!"

Ye Canglan sneered with cold contempt.

As his words fell.

He stomped his foot hard.

HUM——!

Every wall and floor of the underground chamber instantly blazed with countless crimson runes.

A massive formation roared to life!

"Blood Refinement Array, activate!"

Ye Canglan's icy voice echoed through the chamber.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two more figures in wide black robes, like specters, appeared silently behind him.

Divine Court, the Twelve Divine Officials!

Besides Ye Canglan, two more had appeared!

This was the Divine Court's top combat power in Dragon Xia Country!

"Both of you, lend me your strength!" Ye Canglan commanded. "Refine this wretch and hasten the completion of our Divine Court's grand plan!"

"As you wish!"

The other two Divine Officials responded in equally hoarse voices.

The next second.

Three Divine Officials stood in a triangle formation.

All extended their hands simultaneously, pressing down on Ye Xuan's head!

BOOM——

Three completely different yet equally powerful terrifying forces flooded into Ye Xuan's body!

"AAAAAAHHHHHHH——!!!"

Ye Xuan let out an inhuman, bloodcurdling scream!

He felt like his head was being crushed alive by three mountains!

Within his sea of consciousness, towering waves surged!

A blood-red furnace, constructed from three streams of evil energy, materialized out of thin air, trapping the Supreme Dao Ancestor's phantom remnant soul dead center!

"NO! Let me go! Ye Xuan! You treacherous, master-slaying beast! I won't let you go even as a ghost!!!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor let out his most vicious, most desperate curse.

Yet.

Ye Xuan's only response was even more crazed, more twisted laughter!

"Hahaha! Old thing! Just accept your fate as nourishment for my growth!"

The blood-red furnace contracted violently!

Endless crimson hellfire burned madly against the Supreme Dao Ancestor's remnant soul!

"AAHHH——!"

The screams cut off abruptly.

That remnant soul which had once commanded the winds of an era was completely refined into the purest, ownerless soul essence.

The next second.

This energy, like a bursting dam, flooded wildly into Ye Xuan's limbs and bones.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Those shattered meridians, those broken bones, began healing at visible speed, rapidly reconstructing!

A power ten times, a hundred times stronger than his prime, began growing madly within him!

"Haha... hahahaha!"

Ye Xuan shot up from the stone slab.

Feeling the unprecedented surging power within him, he let out laughter—wild to the extreme, utterly cathartic.

"Good! Such powerful strength!"

He slowly clenched his fist, feeling the power within capable of crushing mountains, a sickly intoxication spreading across his face!

"Lin Yuan!"

"Just you wait!"

"Next time we meet, I will tear you to pieces!!!"
