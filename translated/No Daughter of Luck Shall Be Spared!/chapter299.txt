Lanzhi heard Xiao Fan discussing business with Yu Yue and knew he had matters to attend to. "Husband has things to handle. Let's not get in his way, sisters."

Jiang Lanzhi smiled as she spoke. The other women glanced at Xiao Fan and took the hint.

Yu Yue said, "Young Master, we'll take our leave for now."

Xiao Fan nodded. The five women departed, a picture of harmony.

But Xiao Fan could tell it was only surface-deep.

Zhao Ling'er, with her tender maiden's heart, was wary of Lanzhi—afraid this newcomer might steal Xiao Fan's love away from her.

Anxiety came naturally with youth.

Xinxi felt much the same. Her personality was spirited and free, and she only smiled through it to avoid making things hard for Xiao Fan.

Yu Yue was gentle and considerate, one hundred percent obedient to Xiao Fan's wishes. She might not say it aloud, but her heart surely craved more of his time.

Ningbing never competed or demanded anything. Sweet and docile—how could anyone not adore her?

And Lanzhi was Xiao Fan's mother-approved fiancée. Xiao Fan loved her deeply, and they shared One Heart Same Body—you could hardly call anyone more intimate.

Their love for Xiao Fan was real.

Their desire to monopolize him was equally real.

No one was generous enough to willingly share his affection with others.

Xiao Fan understood that keeping things perfectly balanced was nearly impossible.

These five weren't like the demoness Nana or Chen Miaoli—women driven purely by physical desire.

As the saying went, conquering the world is hard, but holding it is harder.

Xiao Fan could offer his own version: Making different women fall for you is easy; managing the relationships between them is the real challenge.

"So I need to give each of them a purpose—a domain of their own, like Shen Biru."

"As they grow stronger, my reach will extend through them to control many worlds."

A plan was forming in his mind.

Just as he was mulling it over, Lingyan walked into the palace.

She was a vision of elegance—slender and graceful, dark hair cascading like a waterfall, long legs peeking through the slit of her purple gown.

Tall and refined, with jade-pale fingers, her royal upbringing gave her an innate air of nobility.

Her features were exquisite—arched brows, porcelain skin, a face both adorable and striking, cherry-red lips curved in a gentle smile.

Facing Xiao Fan, she dipped into a slight bow. "Lingyan of the Heavenly Demon Tribe greets the Young Master."

Xiao Fan studied the beauty before him. Her face bore such a striking resemblance to Nana's that his imagination began to wander.

Lingyan's features were more refined and regal. If the two stood side by side, they'd look like sisters.

Minus a degree of innocence, plus a degree of nobility—and most importantly, he hadn't had her yet, which preserved a certain mystique.

Lingyan felt his gaze and assumed he was reading her micro-expressions, trying to gauge her bottom line.

She didn't flinch. Her smile only deepened.

"There's no need for formalities," Xiao Fan said. "Just call me Xiao Fan."

"I wouldn't dare," Lingyan replied. "Even Palace Master Yu Yue doesn't address you by name. What right would I have to speak so familiarly?"

Lingyan was surprised.

In her imagination, whoever had won Yu Yue's complete devotion must possess extraordinary power and the commanding presence of a supreme overlord—the kind of person who looked down on all creation from on high.

At the very least, he should exude cold, untouchable authority.

But the young man before her seemed different from what she'd imagined.

No haughty airs. Rather approachable, actually. That eased her nerves considerably.

Xiao Fan said:

"Yu Yue told me you want the Heavenly Demon Tribe to serve as guards for Yaochi Immortal Palace, in exchange for protection from foreign cultivators?"

Lingyan drew a deep breath. Finally having the chance to negotiate, she needed to be at her absolute best.

"That's correct."

As if worried he might not grasp the full value and refuse her proposal, she smiled warmly and said:

"You can rest assured, Young Master—we've come with complete sincerity and would never let you come out at a loss."

"Tell me what you want and what you're offering." Xiao Fan played dumb, despite knowing perfectly well.

He watched Lingyan's face with keen interest, unconsciously comparing her to Nana.

"Certainly." Lingyan chose to lay out the situation before making her pitch. "As you're likely aware, Young Master, the foreign cultivators' arrays have opened across the Eternal Immortal Domain."

"These invaders stream through constantly, pillaging without restraint."

"Yaochi Immortal Palace hasn't been spared from their harassment."

She hadn't stated her demands. Instead, she first described the facts, then highlighted the Palace's predicament.

The subtext was clear: We're here to solve your problem.

The most effective way to open a negotiation was to frame it from the other party's perspective.

Lingyan knew this well.

Hearing this, Xiao Fan couldn't help but view her more favorably.

Not bad. Compared to the Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor—a brute who only knew how to swing his fists—her approach was far more pleasant to the ear.

In his mind, Xiao Fan awarded her two points: one for poise and elegance, one for shrewdness.

Lingyan continued, "Young Master, the Heavenly Demon Tribe committed a transgression when we previously raided the Eternal Immortal Domain. This time, we've come specifically to make amends."

"Here's our proposal: the Heavenly Demon Tribe will safeguard Yaochi Immortal Palace, ensuring no foreign cultivators cause you any trouble."

"We won't charge a single coin. This is purely voluntary, born from a genuine desire to atone."

"Of course, to facilitate our efforts in clearing out the foreign cultivators, we have just one modest request."

"We ask that Yaochi Immortal Palace allow the Heavenly Demon Tribe to establish a foothold in the Eternal Immortal Domain."

"Many factions near the Palace have already been overrun by foreign cultivators, leaving their lands vacant. We only need two of those unclaimed territories."

Her proposal was straightforward: land.

The Heavenly Demon Tribe currently inhabited the outer stars, where the soil was barren and spiritual energy scarce.

With the great catastrophe approaching, the stars' energy was all but depleted. How could they develop under those conditions? They desperately needed fertile land.

Her terms weren't unreasonable, either. All Yaochi Immortal Palace had to do was agree, and they'd gain a capable fighting force to secure the surrounding area.

There was no reason for the other side to refuse!

But Lingyan also knew that no matter how eloquently she presented her case, she was ultimately the one asking for something.

She couldn't rule out the other party driving up the price. As long as the cost was reasonable, she could accept it.

What she hadn't expected was for Xiao Fan to turn her down flat.

"Your terms are quite generous—practically tailor-made for Yaochi Immortal Palace's benefit. You're sure you won't be shortchanged?" Xiao Fan said with a smile.

Lingyan returned the smile. "We came to make amends. Taking a small loss is only natural."

Xiao Fan's smile faded. He shook his head. "I think you're oversimplifying things."

Lingyan's smile stiffened. Here it comes—the price hike.

"Let me be clear," Xiao Fan said. "You need us more than we need you. Without Yaochi Immortal Palace's permission, you can't enter the domain."

"This is clearly a trade, yet you present it as though you're the ones making all the sacrifices while we reap all the benefits."

"Furthermore, this business about 'keeping Yaochi Immortal Palace safe by eliminating foreign cultivators'—that's misleading."

"Those foreign cultivators have been raiding for quite some time. Their pockets must be stuffed with plunder by now."

"When you wipe them out, all the loot that drops from their corpses—whose is it?"

"You didn't say, which means it defaults to you."

"In other words, you're hunting prey on our territory. How is that taking a loss?"

"Those two points alone show that your only real cost is guarding the Palace, while your gains include both wealth and land. That's a guaranteed profit no matter how you slice it."

Xiao Fan spoke with a smile, his appreciation for this woman growing. He wanted to make her his.

She really knew how to talk. No wonder they sent her to negotiate.

Lingyan had come prepared. Haggling was inevitable—as long as there was room for discussion, she was fine.

"Then how about this," she proposed. "The Palace can send disciples to accompany us. They don't need to fight—just keep a record of everything we collect."

"At tally time, we split everything sixty-forty—sixty percent to the Palace."

Concessions. Compromises.

Her ultimate goal was land.

Everything else could be negotiated.

The rise of the Heavenly Demon Tribe required a fertile, spirit-rich territory.

Xiao Fan shook his head. "Not good enough."

Lingyan's expression stiffened, then she pressed on.

"Seventy-thirty isn't off the table either."

Xiao Fan shook his head again.

"Young Master, you have to leave us something to work with," she said. "Otherwise, where's the motivation?"

Xiao Fan laughed. "You misunderstand."

"What I mean is—you may not be aware of the current situation out there."

"The teleportation array has been destroyed."

"The foreign cultivators in the Eternal Immortal Domain are now a finite resource. Kill one and they stay dead."

Lingyan's face fell. She was silent for a long moment.

This...

If the array was destroyed, then her offer of protection was meaningless.

Only with the ongoing chaos of invaders streaming in did the Heavenly Demon Tribe have any leverage to insert themselves.

"Young Master, is this true?"

"Of course. I'm the one who destroyed it."

Hearing this, Lingyan's last hope crumbled. It seemed the Heavenly Demon Tribe was doomed to languish among the outer stars. Terrible timing.

Xiao Fan watched her deflate and decided it was time to throw her a lifeline—a chance to grab hold of.

But the price... well, that would need some discussion.
