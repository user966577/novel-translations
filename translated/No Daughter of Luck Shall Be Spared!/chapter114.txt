Chapter 114: Mobile Artillery, A New Child of Destiny

That Immortal King who died trying could never have imagined that the pagoda he had painstakingly refined for combat would be transformed by Xiao Fan into a mobile artillery platform.

Ready to fire anytime, anywhere—every moment, every opportunity, firing on the spot.

Jiang Lanzhi had lost count of how many times her soul had left her body. All she remembered was Xiao Fan using the power of love to bring her infinite joy.

Making her intoxicated, making her obsessed.

She could no longer live without this man—psychologically or physically. She had completely taken his shape.

"You rascal, really. I was trying to discuss serious matters, but you had to do all this."

"But you were moaning and begging me not to stop..."

Before Xiao Fan could finish, Jiang Lanzhi, flushed with embarrassment, pinned him down and silenced him with her lips.

Xiao Fan didn't even close his eyes. Watching her close hers and attempt to turn the tables was quite amusing. Rather than play along, he simply captured her tongue and savored it thoroughly.

While he was at it, he sampled the Empress's sweet nectar.

After a long while, Jiang Lanzhi retreated in defeat, panting and flushed as she pouted: "Consider that my apology. Don't bring it up again."

Xiao Fan looked at her serious expression and gently pulled her into his arms.

So eager yet so inexperienced—where did you find the courage to challenge me?

Jiang Lanzhi nestled against him, her heart sweeter than ever before.

If time permitted, she truly wished they could just live like this forever, just the two of them.

During their intimate moments, Xiao Fan also asked her about the Hundred Flowers Saintess selection—how exactly did it work?

Jiang Lanzhi lay against his chest, softly explaining the details.

The Hundred Flowers Saintess selection lasted ten days in total.

The first three days were individual competitions between disciples. The higher a disciple ranked, the more priority they had to enter the secret realm first in the upcoming team competition.

The final seven days were team battles. Each disciple could lead a team of up to one hundred people into the Flower Fairy Secret Realm arranged by Hundred Flowers Holy Land, collecting the flower petals that fell within.

The team with the most flower petals would be the winner and could claim the Saintess position.

In other words, the first half's talent competition couldn't decide the outcome. The true deciding factor was the second half's team competition.

And in the team competition, there were no restrictions on whom the disciples could choose as helpers. As long as you had the ability and could summon the people, bringing Grand Ascension cultivators would be perfectly acceptable.

Yes, that was exactly how it worked. This was the key to the Hundred Flowers Saintess selection!

Calling in reinforcements! Being able to summon helpers proved you had connections.

The more people you could summon, and the stronger they were, the greater your abilities—and the higher your chances of winning.

This was why people said the Hundred Flowers Saintess selection was really about choosing the forces backing the Saintess.

Listening to Jiang Lanzhi's explanation, Xiao Fan gained a deeper understanding of Hundred Flowers Holy Land's selection process.

The design was rather clever. After all, this was the code by which Hundred Flowers Holy Land survived—they couldn't afford to be careless.

"Don't worry. With my current strength, probably not many people in the entire Holy Land can match me." Jiang Lanzhi spoke to him softly.

Indeed, Xiao Fan's strength could kill a Grand Ascension cultivator with a single punch.

Through their shared heart, Jiang Lanzhi's strength was overwhelming—killing a Body Integration cultivator with one punch wouldn't be a problem.

Combined with her cultivation methods, combat experience, and memories from her previous life as an Empress, even Grand Ascension cultivators would struggle against her.

Xiao Fan naturally understood her strength. This Saintess position was as good as won.

"Of course. My Lanzhi is the most beautiful woman under heaven—beauty and strength combined." Xiao Fan pinched her slightly chubby cheeks as he spoke.

Jiang Lanzhi pouted and said: "In the future, when we're outside, don't do these things. Wait until the selection is over and I return to my cave dwelling—then we can play."

"Oh?" Xiao Fan looked at her in surprise, catching a glimpse of seduction in her eyes. Not bad—this little minx had learned how to tempt him.

You little vixen Lanzhi, tempting me hundreds of times a day. Just wait until the selection is over—I'll stuff your little cave dwelling full with my big gift and make you moan and beg for mercy.

Hmph, then you'll know what cruelty really means!

Besides their dual cultivation, the two didn't have much time alone—mainly because Jiang Lanzhi needed to prepare for the selection.

Xiao Fan escorted her to behind the arena. As they parted, she kept looking back reluctantly.

Not until Jiang Lanzhi's figure disappeared from sight did Xiao Fan prepare to leave. It was time to return to his group.

Just as he was about to leave, a beautiful and pure-looking woman quietly appeared before him. Perfectly timed, she bumped right into him.

With a thud, Xiao Fan didn't move an inch, while she stumbled back two steps and sat down hard.

After getting up, she didn't worry about herself. Instead, she addressed Xiao Fan:

"Oh, I'm sorry. Pardon me, young master—I've troubled you."

Her face was apologetic, and paired with her innocent maiden looks, it was easy to believe her.

When she came to her senses and saw Xiao Fan's face clearly, her expression shifted to shock. Her eyes sparkled with little stars, her bright pupils blinking.

She appeared extremely excited, as if wanting to grab Xiao Fan's hand to express her enthusiasm.

However, Xiao Fan subtly pulled back, smoothly avoiding her move. She recovered naturally, not a trace of awkwardness, and said excitedly:

"You're the Supreme Mystery Holy Son! Your Highness Holy Son, I never expected to meet you here. What fortune!"

Holy shit, this one's an expert!

Who was Xiao Fan? He was the one who fooled women—no woman could fool him.

You, a Nascent Soul cultivator, somehow bumped into me by accident? The acting was a bit weak. However, Xiao Fan was curious to see what this woman was playing at.

He smiled ambiguously. "And then?"

"I'm sorry, Your Highness. How about I show you around Hundred Flowers Holy Land, give you a full tour—consider it my apology. What do you think?"

She spoke pitifully, and paired with that innocent maiden face, anyone less perceptive would easily be drawn in.

"Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm a disciple of Hundred Flowers Holy Land. My name is Xia Huaxuan."

She introduced herself proactively, her voice sweet but with a casual boldness that naturally made people feel close to her.

Xiao Fan roughly understood what was happening. This was probably a carefully orchestrated encounter.

After all, with his status and position, as long as he nodded, women would immediately line up to be with him.

Absurd, ridiculous, yet also very real and very brazen.

If this was the case, then he had no interest. Too calculating, too scheming.

Utterly boring. Xiao Fan prepared to leave. Just then, a clear voice called out.

"Miss Huaxuan, so this is where you were. I've been looking everywhere for you."

Xiao Fan looked up. This was a young man with sharp eyes and prominent brows, a sunny smile on his face that made people feel at ease.

Xia Huaxuan also heard the voice. A flash of displeasure crossed her eyes, but her overall expression remained that of innocent naivety as she turned around.

She said flatly: "You are?"

"Miss Huaxuan, don't you remember me? Last time in the Forest Sea Secret Realm, after we obtained the spiritual herb, we were ambushed by demonic beasts."

"I gave you the herb and stayed behind to cover your escape, allowing you to get away safely. Does that ring a bell?" He smiled bashfully.

Xia Huaxuan put on an expression of sudden realization. "Oh, so you're the one from back then. I left in such a hurry that I forgot to thank you. Thank you for saving my life."

The young man said shyly: "It was nothing, not worth mentioning. Oh, last time after you got the herbs, you mentioned you were still missing one ingredient: the Nine-Turn Spirit Ginseng Flower."

"I've been having good luck lately, and I happened to come across the very herb you needed. Here you go." As he spoke, the young man produced the herb and offered it to Xia Huaxuan.

Xia Huaxuan was conflicted—accepting or refusing, neither felt right.

She genuinely needed this herb, but accepting it in front of Xiao Fan, entangled with another man—how would she pursue Xiao Fan then?

The young man also noticed Xiao Fan's presence. The two were standing quite close together. He immediately understood—he had interrupted someone's date.

He apologized:

"Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb Miss Huaxuan. I'll leave right away."

Without waiting for a response from Xiao Fan or Xia Huaxuan, the young man placed the jade box containing the herb in Xia Huaxuan's hands and left without looking back.

"As long as she's happy."

"Whether the person by her side is me doesn't matter." He thought to himself, deeply moved—self-moved—as he departed.

"Your Highness Holy Son, I really don't know him well. We only crossed paths once in a secret realm."

The young man hadn't gone far when Xia Huaxuan explained hastily. She wasn't afraid of that young man hearing—she was only afraid of Xiao Fan misunderstanding.

What relationship these two had, Xiao Fan didn't care.

What he cared about was the golden script floating above that young man's head!

Holy shit—a child of destiny!

Ignoring Xia Huaxuan, Xiao Fan mentally opened the young man's script.

One glance at the name told Xiao Fan everything about this protagonist's destiny.

Those three characters were known far and wide:

[Child of Destiny]

[Name: Fei Yangyang!]

Heavyweight! Epic tier!

A chance encounter, risking his life to provide cover, just to give Xia Huaxuan a chance to escape.

Even afterward, he still remembered what she needed and delivered it personally.

No doubt about it—Fei Yangyang, true to his name.

Great, now I've become the sheep!

Regarding the child of destiny's name, though he could guess about ninety percent of the situation, curiosity got the better of him, so he took a quick peek.

[Fei Yangyang: A people-pleasing type of destiny's child. The more the woman he likes ignores him, the more he self-soothingly grovels.]

[Just now, can you believe it? After leaving, his first thought was:

"As long as she's happy."

"Whether the person by her side is me doesn't matter."]

Reading this, Xiao Fan felt physically uncomfortable. What kind of psychological deformity was this child of destiny?

He was absolutely done with these people. This kind of self-deluding simp was truly rare—no, truly pathetic!

A walking child of destiny—taking him out would definitely yield a nice amount of villain points. Just as Xiao Fan was thinking about how to kill him discreetly—

Xia Huaxuan beside him, seeing Xiao Fan's silence, hastily said: "Your Highness Holy Son, I really don't know him. Please believe me."

Xiao Fan snapped back to attention. Looking at this pure and lovely Xia Huaxuan, a plan formed in his mind. You like being a simp?

I'll show you what happens when simps simp to the very end—they get nothing. Not only nothing, but their lives too.

Xiao Fan reached out and tilted her chin up, studying her carefully and clicking his tongue in admiration. "What a beauty. It's just a shame about the complicated relationships."

Xia Huaxuan looked directly at Xiao Fan. His intimate gesture startled her, but after the surprise came joy. He called me beautiful—does he have feelings for me?

"Your Highness, you're making me so embarrassed." She turned her head slightly, her eyes shy, and spoke in a coquettish tone.

Xiao Fan immediately released her without going further.

Instead, he said: "Unfortunately, you've gotten tangled up with disreputable people. My woman cannot have any involvement with other men."

Xia Huaxuan's heart sank. Her murderous intent toward Fei Yangyang intensified. She had been so close to success, and he had ruined everything!

She said tearfully: "Your Highness, I really have no relationship with him. Please believe me."

Xiao Fan smiled and handed her the Fortune-Plundering Sword.

"Prove it to me."

Looking at the gleaming blade, Xia Huaxuan knew she had to clear her name.

Without hesitation, she accepted it on the spot.

"Your Highness, I will prove to you that there's truly nothing between us."

Did Xiao Fan care? Not at all. He just wanted Fei Yangyang dead. As for why he had the sheep do the deed herself—it was simply to destroy a man's heart completely.
