Chapter 130: I Have Standards—Misleading the Disciples

Left Wu was now completely wrecked. Both wings had been broken—flying with them was impossible. His left leg was shattered; he could only stand on one foot.

His entire body was drenched in blood. His face was swollen like a pig's head, no trace of his former cold demeanor remaining.

His signature hooked nose had been punched inward by Xiao Fan.

It had become a peculiar "hooked-in nose."

All he wanted was to survive!

"Don't—don't kill me. I can serve you, take you as my master." Left Wu abandoned all else and knelt to beg for mercy.

Xiao Fan said: "Sure."

Left Wu was overjoyed, thinking he was saved.

But the next sentence was a death sentence.

Xiao Fan: "The first task in serving me is to offer up your life."

Xiao Fan thrust his spear, piercing straight into Left Wu's brow. With a forceful twist, the nether qi from hell instantly invaded his skull, destroying his entire physical body.

No chance of survival!

Simple.

"Seems like killing Grand Ascension cultivators has become as easy as killing chickens for me," he thought.

All this fell into the eyes of those cultivators, leaving everyone dumbstruck.

In this moment, they could only think Xiao Fan was either a god descended to earth or an immortal reborn.

"The Holy Son—he killed another Grand Ascension cultivator."

"When did Grand Ascension cultivators become so worthless? Our old ancestor cultivated for thirty thousand years, and during his tribulation, lightning struck off one of his hands before he achieved Grand Ascension.

Yet the Holy Son has killed three Grand Ascension cultivators in three days. How can the gap between people be so vast?"

"A few days ago, we could say the Holy Son relied on treasures to kill Grand Ascension. Now—real weapons, one-on-one duel, solo kill complete. The Holy Son's strength is already on a completely different level from ours."

"You think that's all? The Holy Son is only twenty years old, already at Void Refining, and has slaughtered Grand Ascension."

"I estimate he'll definitely ascend to immortality within a hundred years."

"A hundred years? He'll be immortal next year!"

These spectating cultivators' claims grew more outlandish by the minute.

Even Xiao Fan couldn't bear to listen anymore.

Never expected I'd become a celebrity too. Just feels like I'm being a bit hypocritical. Sigh, fame has its psychological burdens.

He put away the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda and prepared to leave—saying nothing, playing it cool, concealing his merits and fame.

But the next moment, the Hundred Flowers Holy Land female disciples instantly swarmed around him, their melodious voices surrounding him completely.

"Holy Son, are you hurt?"

"Holy Son, are you tired? Want me to massage your back?"

"Holy Son, have some tea. This is jasmine immortal tea I prepared for you. It restores vitality, calms the mind and spirit. I've already let it cool—it's just warm enough now, perfect for drinking. Fragrant on entry, sweet aftertaste."

Hundred Flowers Holy Land's recruitment standards had appearance as the first priority.

This group of bold Hundred Flowers female disciples all focused their attention on Xiao Fan, love undisguised in their eyes.

Peach-blossom gazes held infatuation, obsession, little stars—incomparably fervent. Xiao Fan felt like he'd fallen into a sea of flowers.

Every bloom was his to pluck at will.

Not only could he pick them one by one, he could grab them by the handful.

If he simply said he wanted to sleep with someone, they'd probably strip themselves and deliver themselves to him. So this was what it felt like to have groupies.

Too bad I, Xiao Fan, am not that kind of casual person.

"Is this jasmine immortal tea really that good? My hand is a bit sore—it's not very convenient."

That charming female disciple heard this, emotions stirring as she proactively brought the tea to his lips.

"Holy Son, p-please drink."

Xiao Fan took a light sip. Didn't feel like there was much difference. If he had to say what was different—it was the feeling of walking through ten thousand flowers without a single petal touching him. So satisfying!

I am the man you'll never have!

Just kidding. Xiao Fan wasn't lacking for women now, so he couldn't just take any random one. He had to have standards—looks were basic, noble status preferred, and ideally something special. Like a yandere, or perhaps a... certain type of physique.

Quality and ambition!!!

[Ding! Your heart is lewd and depraved, without any standards, only thinking of toying with women's emotions. Bah—only thinking of toying with women's bodies. Truly the mindless horniness essential to any brainless villain. Lecher!!

Villain Points earned: 33,333.]

Mm, very good praise. This system's getting better at compliments.

[Ding! You killed Left Wu. Your acting was truly atrocious. Fortunately, someone covered for you, making it barely passable. Truly a staged performance.

Villain Points earned: 22,222.]

[Ding! You killed Left Wu. Obtained Wu Tribe intelligence and hideout location.]

Intelligence and hideout location?

The Wu Tribe probably wasn't that strong anyway, and he wasn't some savior. Let them hide if they want.

Boring.

Though the sea of flowers was lovely, it wasn't a place for gentle dreams. Xiao Fan merely sampled the sensation before extracting himself.

He returned to the Supreme Mystery Holy Land contingent.

The Supreme Mystery disciples, seeing Xiao Fan, couldn't hide the pride in their eyes.

So powerful—this was the strength our Supreme Mystery Holy Son should have!

"Holy Son, you're too strong!"

"Holy Son, how do you cultivate? Can you tell us?"

"Yes, you're so powerful—your cultivation must be very diligent, right?"

Xiao Fan looked at these disciples following beside him, enjoying their reverent gazes. He was in a good mood.

He said solemnly: "Actually, you could all be as strong as me too."

Everyone perked up their ears the moment they heard this, afraid to miss anything.

"You're right—I cultivate very diligently. Eight hours a day, five days a week, with only two days of rest. I've persisted like this for twenty years, and only then have I barely achieved my current strength."

"Is... is that really diligent?"

These words were so shocking that no one believed them.

Before Xiao Fan could answer, someone had already thought up an explanation for him.

"The Holy Son's natural talent is already strong. Isn't that effort enough? It just means everyone's constitution is different. A genius only needs occasional cultivation, while ordinary people like us should just focus on cultivating diligently."

Xiao Fan gave him an approving look. This kid gets it!

"Correct. I'm not showing off my talent. I'm just illustrating that in all things, one must persist. Take one thing to the extreme, and you too can become a genius like me. Good luck!"

With that, Xiao Fan slipped away.

Leaving a crowd of disciples staring at his departing figure in a daze.

"He really is a genius."

"Even his words are so philosophical! No wonder he's so powerful."

This feeling of lying through his teeth while having people make excuses for him was truly wonderful beyond words.

The power of braindead fans was invincible!

[Ding! You're spouting nonsense again, feeding disciples chicken soup. Truly misleading the youth. So wicked!

Villain Points earned: 66,666.]

Oh? This works too?!

The happiest were the Supreme Mystery elders. Heaven blesses our Holy Land—to have produced such a peerless genius!

"Holy Son, if there's ever anything you need me for, just say the word. This old man will never refuse."

Who could compete with the Holy Son? Better grab onto this thigh first!

Xiao Fan nodded and said lightly:

"Elder, your consciousness isn't high enough. Everything I do is for the Holy Land's development. How can you call it doing things for me?"

The Grand Ascension elder had an epiphany and quickly corrected himself:

"Following the Holy Son's commands, serving the Holy Land's development. Everything for the Holy Land. Under the Holy Son's leadership, we'll push the Holy Land toward prosperity!"

Xiao Fan gave an approving look and said:

"Elder, work hard. I have faith in you."

Outwardly calm as still water, but inside Xiao Fan was beaming. Before, with only status, his position wasn't this elevated.

Now, with just a minor display of strength, he'd won a chorus of cheers. Strength was everything!

As he walked, Xiao Fan noticed a figure constantly following behind him.

He looked back. Hong Rushuang!

Hong Rushuang still wore a black collar around her neck, the collar connected to a black chain.

Her whole body trembled. Her two hands gripped the chain, following closely behind Xiao Fan, cautious and careful.

The moment Xiao Fan turned around, Hong Rushuang immediately lowered her head, not daring to meet his gaze. Her entire body shook as if facing a monster.

Xiao Fan said coldly:

"Why are you following me?"

These words frightened her badly. She immediately knelt, speaking nervously, her voice stammering.

"R-replying to the Holy Son, y-you ordered me not to leave your sight, otherwise—otherwise I would anger you, and you would kill me."

That proud and arrogant Hong Rushuang, haughty and disdainful of everyone—now stood before Xiao Fan meek and subservient, speaking haltingly, not daring to breathe too loudly.

Thinking about it, he did seem to have said something like that.

"Fine. Go back and follow Lanzhi."

But Hong Rushuang didn't move. She said:

"Holy Son, my mistress is still in the trial. I can't enter her cave dwelling."

He thought for a moment. There was that Wu Tribe intelligence, and this woman before him was still the Witch-Yao King's daughter. Perhaps combining the intel with what she knew, he could extract something useful from her.

"Come with me."
