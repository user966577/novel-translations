365x time acceleration—activated!

Time rushed by like water. In the outside world, a year had passed.

Jiang Lanzhi tried to flee after regaining her senses, but Xiao Fan gave her no chance. He ordered Miao Xiaoqing to draw a fragrant bath for himself and Lanzhi—a couple's soak.

And then he made Miao Xiaoqing serve as an attendant.

Why bother with silk towels to dry off when Xiao Fan could simply have Miao Xiaoqing shift into her original form?

And serve as a cat towel!

Watching this operation, Jiang Lanzhi broke into a smile.

Where did he come up with these ideas?

Only Miao Xiaoqing's eyes were dead, her soul long departed.

It's your love story. Why does my body have to be part of it?

Am I just another accessory in your couple games?

Jiang Lanzhi helped Xiao Fan dress and groom himself, gentle and devoted as a young bride.

When she was done, she said, "Xiaoqing mentioned she has something to report. You two talk—I'll step out."

Jiang Lanzhi had already received her fill of Xiao Fan's love. She knew he wouldn't neglect her, so there was no need to cling. Give him space and freedom.

Xiao Fan caught Jiang Lanzhi's hand. "Whatever she has to say, she can say it here. Stay with me."

Jiang Lanzhi's eyes brightened. He's considering my feelings. He really does care!

She linked her arm through his. "Mm."

Miao Xiaoqing had seen enough to understand: this principal wife's position in the master's heart was untouchable. He couldn't bear to let her suffer even the slightest hurt.

Clearly, she'd need to win Lanzhi's favor going forward.

Cats could be shrewd too.

"So, what did you want to tell me?" Xiao Fan asked.

Miao Xiaoqing answered, "Master, I've heard that the Holy Academy lost over ten thousand disciples and elders. Every single one was a core elder or elite prodigy."

Xiao Fan raised an eyebrow. "That many dead, and the outside world barely heard about it?"

"The Academy forbade anyone from spreading the news. Violators face severe punishment."

"What's the reason?"

"According to the Dean's explanation, he discovered a secret realm in the outer stars and secretly dispatched over ten thousand people to explore it. Something went wrong inside, and they all perished."

Miao Xiaoqing laid out the cover story.

A secret realm?

Xiao Fan didn't buy it for a second. Standard procedure for any realm exploration was to send a small advance team to scout first, then deploy forces based on the realm's classification and difficulty level.

No preliminary investigation, and the only justification being "secrecy"—sending over ten thousand people blind? The logic didn't hold.

No—that was a trade.

Xiao Fan quickly pieced it together.

The foreign cultivators had entered the Eternal Immortal Domain through the teleportation array. That required the Holy Academy's tacit approval.

In exchange, the Academy's disciples were pillaging other realms the same way.

He'd destroyed the array not long ago, cutting off the foreigners' retreat.

Then he'd authorized the Blood Emperor to enter the Eternal Immortal Domain and exterminate them.

The foreign powers must have retaliated against the Academy's people abroad.

His plan had come to fruition. Perfect.

Xiao Fan tugged Miao Xiaoqing's ear. "Good work. Your intelligence was timely. Keep it up!"

Miao Xiaoqing glowed with secret pride. I'm still useful to the master.

At least more useful than a cat towel.

"Master, there's actually one more thing," she continued.

"Go on."

"The Holy Academy has issued orders to select gifted disciples for advanced training at the Holy Temple."

"They say the Great Calamity is approaching and the opportunity for Sainthood will soon appear. Any one of these prodigies could receive the fortune and become this era's brightest star."

"After all, the one who attains Sainthood won't necessarily be some ancient relic—it could just as easily be a rising prodigy."

Prodigy boot camp, huh?

Xiao Fan immediately sensed a child of destiny lurking in the mix!

And this was organized by the Holy Temple itself—which meant this child of destiny was no small fish.

Miao Xiaoqing continued:

"Master, my reputation in the Academy has already surpassed the other seed candidates. I'm just one coronation ceremony away from officially becoming a Holy Apostle."

"So for this Holy Temple training, I'll be leading the Eternal Immortal Domain's Academy delegation."

Xiao Fan listened with growing interest. Things were getting fun.

"Can you get me in?" he asked.

"If you're willing, Master, I can have you disguise yourself as my attendant and enter the Holy Temple with me. Of course, it would only be a disguise—absolutely nothing more than that."

Miao Xiaoqing hastily clarified, cat ears twitching as she meowed ingratiatingly. Inside, however, she was over the moon.

The master acting as my attendant—even if it's just for show—the mere thought is thrilling!

"Fine. When the time comes, give me a heads-up and I'll go with you."

"Meow~ Thank you, Master!" Miao Xiaoqing beamed, her dainty white cat tail practically standing straight up.

"Alright, off you go."

Xiao Fan dismissed her.

Miao Xiaoqing scurried away with her tail between her legs, though she'd gained a new understanding of Xiao Fan.

And here I thought you were an untethered playboy. Turns out you have a soft spot after all.

Watch me win over Sister Lanzhi. I'll have you wrapped around this kitty's tail in no time—meow meow meow~

Miao Xiaoqing laughed, feeling as if victory were already hers.

A cat's fantasy time had begun.

Watching the little cat leave, Lanzhi smiled warmly, resting her head against Xiao Fan's shoulder.

"Husband, weren't you planning to break through to Sainthood?"

"Lanzhi is willing to help."

"Sure. There's nothing left to deal with anyway. Might as well break through when we're free." Xiao Fan nodded.

Lanzhi: "Shall we go now?"

"Let's go."

Xiao Fan scooped Lanzhi up and settled her in the treasure shuttle, then piloted it out beyond the Eternal Immortal Domain's starry border.

They traversed hundreds of millions of miles of starlit space. Watching the glittering stars and falling meteors, Jiang Lanzhi nestled against him, her eyes soft with emotion. Only with Xiao Fan could she let that shy tenderness show.

When Xiao Fan judged the location suitable, he set her down and produced the Primordial Chaos Grand Luo Fruit.

"We've left the Eternal Immortal Domain. There's nobody around—break through here. I'll stand guard."

Jiang Lanzhi took the fruit without an ounce of hesitation and nodded.

"What do I need to do?"

"Eat it. It will take you straight to the Primordial Chaos Grand Luo realm."

"Okay." Jiang Lanzhi replied obediently.

Xiao Fan embraced her. They held each other for a long time before letting go.

"Sainthood... what kind of realm is that?" he mused.

[Ding—Detecting that the Host is about to achieve Sainthood. Past-life memories are prepared and will unlock upon ascension.]

The system's notification made Xiao Fan's eyes light up.

Unlocking memories?

Good. He wanted to pierce the fog shrouding his previous life.

[Ding—The Host is simply reclaiming his original cultivation. No tribulation is required. When Jiang Lanzhi successfully crosses her tribulation, the Host will achieve Sainthood instantaneously.]

[Ding—Upon the Host's ascension to Sainthood, a new Saint will be added to the roster of all heavens and realms. This will inevitably cause a stir, drawing the attention of numerous powers. However, the Host need not worry.]

[This System fitted the Host with the Dark Mask and a fabricated destiny from the moment of weakness.

With each stage of growth, the mask has deepened by one layer, and the false destiny has grown one degree more convincing.

On the day of Sainthood, the Host shall achieve true freedom from karma—untraceable by any being.]

[Truly transcendent, standing above all creation.]

[The Saint Realm will unfold after the Host's ascension. The Host is encouraged to cultivate diligently and reclaim the throne. This System looks forward to the Host restoring his former glory.]

The cascade of system notifications brought some surprises—yet all within expectations.

At last, Sainthood was within reach. And the fog of his past life would finally begin to lift.
