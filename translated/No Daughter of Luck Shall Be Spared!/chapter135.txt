Chapter 135: Qingyu's Scheme—Corrupting the Disciple, Defying the Master!!

"What's going on with all of you?" Xiao Fan casually stopped two disciples to ask.

The two were about to flare up—who was blind enough to obstruct their marriage prospects? But when they turned and saw it was Xiao Fan, one instantly switched to a smiling face:

"Recently, a savage tribe called the Wu Tribe appeared. They've already killed many people. We're all actively registering to vanquish evil and defend the Dao, protecting our human territories from demonic suffering!"

He recounted everything that had recently happened—the Wu Tribe's emergence, the genocides, the blood sacrifices...

By the end, he spoke with an air of duty-bound righteousness.

Hiss! Were the Holy Land's disciples really this enlightened?

Xiao Fan felt somewhat inadequate. Guess I'm really not cut out to be a righteous person.

The other disciple couldn't stand it anymore and directly exposed his hypocritical facade!

"Holy Son, don't let him fool you. Last time he even invited me to the pleasure district to listen to music. Not only that, at the Drunken Spring Pavilion, he spent a month's salary hiring three demon girls to serve him. When he came out, he couldn't even stand straight."

"What kind of enlightenment is this? The Grand Elder said whoever earns the most contribution points can marry into the noble families—that's why he's going."

"How can you slander my good name!" The disciple protested.

Xiao Fan understood. Arranged marriages!

The Grand Elder was truly a genius. Not giving them spirit stones or pills, but using women to motivate this bunch of old lechers.

"Holy Son, we're in a hurry to go vanquish evil. May we take our leave?" His face showed urgency.

Xiao Fan waved his hand. "Go ahead."

The two scurried off, afraid they'd miss the formation if they were even slightly late.

Appetite and lust were natural human desires. The Grand Elder truly was an old lecher.

After dismissing them, Xiao Fan returned to his palace, carrying a little black dog, planning to arrange a guard post for it.

Xinxi had also left. Truly a Dog Wangcai finally let out a breath of relief.

But the next second, it started trembling again.

Holy shit, why is everyone around Master so powerful? This can't be right?

The moment Xiao Fan entered, he noticed a woman in green standing in the palace, watching him with a smile.

Xiao Fan was somewhat surprised. This... eager?

He glanced at the trembling Wangcai, then at his beautiful Master. Without hesitation, he tossed Wangcai behind him and shut the door.

Find somewhere to stay on your own. Guard duty, doghouse—handle it yourself.

Qingyu's gaze was gentle, tender as water, her hands folded at her lower abdomen, dignified and graceful.

Today's Qingyu was different from usual. She'd applied light makeup—not gaudy or flirtatious, nor as stern as before.

There was a hint of demure charm about her. Combined with Qingyu's naturally petite frame, it added an extra layer of allure.

"What? Surprised to see your master?" She smiled mischievously.

Her composed demeanor instantly crumbled.

Xiao Fan shook his head. "No, I just feel like Master Yu'er seems different somehow."

Hearing this, Qingyu froze. Different? Had her makeup smeared?

"Different how? Is there some distinction?" She asked nervously.

"Nothing bad. I just feel you have an extra touch of youthful beauty today. Of course, Master Yu'er has always been beautiful—it's just that today you're especially radiant."

Qingyu was stunned for a moment. Rosy clouds instantly climbed her jade-like cheeks as she chided: "Wicked disciple!"

She feigned anger, charming yet playful. Beneath her long dress, her bare, delicate jade feet alternated rapidly as she walked toward Xiao Fan.

Hiss, damn it!

Xiao Fan was filled with regret. His cultivation was still too low.

Otherwise, right now he could have turned Master Yu'er into Wifey Yu'er.

Qingyu took his hand and led him to a nearby table and chairs with practiced ease, as if she'd designed this palace herself.

Xiao Fan rather enjoyed this feeling. Mm, there was a certain thrill to corrupting the disciple and defying the master.

"Tee-hee. You little rascal really showed off in front of your fiancée."

Qingyu was somewhat jealous. Clearly she'd known little Fan first, yet she wasn't the first to have him.

"A man can have countless fiancées, but there's only one Master Yu'er. In my heart, no fiancée compares to your importance."

Qingyu found this strange. You want countless fiancées?

She was about to question him, but his words about Master Yu'er being irreplaceable went straight to her head.

"Where did you learn all this? Just know how to sweet-talk me." She scolded playfully.

Xiao Fan's expression turned solemn: "These days, is speaking the truth not allowed either?"

Finally, he sighed: "Sigh, but I truly can't bring myself to lie to Master Yu'er."

Hearing this, Qingyu's eyes filled with spring emotion. Now she couldn't even pretend to be angry.

Though she knew he was just flattering her, she truly ate it up. Her heart felt somewhat itchy.

"Alright, enough of this." Qingyu waved her hand, then produced a green bamboo box from within her robes.

She handed the box to Xiao Fan, her eyes smiling with a hint of anticipation.

"What's this?" Xiao Fan was puzzled. Why so mysterious?

"Open it and see."

"Mm."

Xiao Fan opened the lid. Inside lay a five-colored immortal pill, medicinal fragrance wafting, precious light swirling, mysterious runes drifting above it.

Just inhaling once, he felt his cultivation surge. A pill gifted by Master Yu'er absolutely couldn't be as simple as an ordinary immortal pill.

"Master Yu'er, what pill is this? It looks very precious."

Seeing Xiao Fan's surprised expression, Qingyu smiled brilliantly: "Impressive, right?"

"This is the Supreme Five Elements Grand Unity Pill I spent a thousand years refining. Why do you think I haven't come to see you? I was refining this pill for you."

Ah? So even where he couldn't see, she was thinking of him? What a foolish master!

And that name sounded incredibly intimidating. With "Grand Unity" in the name, wouldn't the medicinal power blow him up?

Qingyu said proudly:

"This pill is extremely potent. Just gathering the ingredients took me eight thousand years."

"Eight thousand years?" Xiao Fan thought he'd misheard.

Qingyu smiled: "That's right. Very precious. Especially the main ingredients—five elemental spirit treasures that must be primordial spirits from the creation of heaven and earth: White Tiger of Metal Fire, Vermilion Bird of Departing Fire, Azure Dragon of Wood, Black Tortoise of Water, and Qilin of Earth."

"I had no choice but to travel everywhere, spending all my time on the road.

But heaven rewards the diligent. There were some setbacks in seeking the ingredients—I didn't ask for much, just a single drop of heart's blood from each.

Those five old fogies from those tribes actually cursed and refused to give it. They forced me to beat them up before they'd let me draw their blood."

Uh, that sounded more like a female bandit going door-to-door robbing people.

Still, heart's blood from five primordial five-element spirit beasts sounded incredibly precious.

So this was what corrupting the disciple and defying the master felt like? Too blissful.

Xiao Fan picked up the pill and examined it. He could indeed sense the dense five-element energy within, perfectly suited to his Five Elements Spirit Body.

If he swallowed this, his cultivation would definitely skyrocket!

Just as Xiao Fan was about to take it, Qingyu snatched it away. A mischievous glint flashed in her eyes as she scolded: "Fool. Can you even handle this pill's medicinal power?"

"I thought Master had some special refining method to avoid that." Xiao Fan smiled awkwardly, feeling helpless.

Could it be he could only look but not eat? Just something to play with?

Please no.

Just as he was about to say something, Qingyu placed the pill in her mouth before his puzzled gaze.

"Mm, you can't refine this pill. I'll help you."

Xiao Fan was dumbfounded. This was too much.

Her scheming was far too loud, damn it.

Xiao Fan had no choice. Master Yu'er had spent so much effort refining this divine pill—what was wrong with being a corrupted disciple for once?

Qingyu's brows trembled slightly. Having cultivated for hundreds of millions of years, this was the first time she felt nervous. She slowly closed her beautiful eyes, leaned her body toward Xiao Fan, and her soft, boneless hands gently cupped his face.

Mm! Nn! Hmph!

Clearly a novice, yet she'd proactively hatched this wicked plan.

Xiao Fan clearly sensed that Qingyu's delicate body first tensed up, but gradually, she couldn't maintain the tension and began to soften.

Xiao Fan reached out, embracing her slender waist, gently kneading her jade back—only to be scolded:

"Wicked disciple, you're distracting me like this. You'll die."

"If I lose focus, you won't be able to handle it!"

Sigh, being weak was also a kind of suffering.

Clearly just one step away from pushing Master Yu'er down, yet the gap in cultivation meant their bodies and souls weren't on the same level.

A small horse simply couldn't pull a large cart!

Qingyu admitted she'd used some scheming, but the longing was unbearable. Besides, she was helping him increase his cultivation.

She was merely fulfilling a master's proper duty.

Don't focus too much on the process. They were purely increasing cultivation.

Endless five-element energy flowed from Master Yu'er's lips into Xiao Fan's body. As if receiving an empowerment, his just-breakthrough mid Void Refining was rising again.

Mid Void Refining...

Late Void Refining...

Above, tribulation clouds had already begun gathering, about to trigger tribulation lightning.

Boom! A thunderous sound shook the entire Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

Qingyu waved her jade hand. The tribulation clouds instantly scattered.

Don't ruin my fun!

Xiao Fan felt the same. He immediately guided the five-element energy—forget breaking through realms, just level up the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art.

Don't ruin my fun either!

Truly, like master, like disciple—their thoughts were identical!

Endless five-element energy cleansed every giant elephant particle. The giant elephant power completely transformed.

Dragon-shaped, elephant-fierce, a dragon-elephant particle of heaven-shaking might formed!

After the first breakthrough, each subsequent one would follow naturally.

Instantly, the dragon-elephant particles in his body sprouted like bamboo after rain.

3 million.

5 million.

8 million.

10 million.

Endless five-element energy awakened countless dragon-elephant particles.

The medicinal power hadn't stopped; the awakening continued.

When it finally ceased, he'd reached 360 million dragon-elephant particles.

This medicinal refinement lasted four hours. Actually, after the first two hours, Xiao Fan could tell Master Yu'er could have completely transferred the medicinal power from the start.

But she hadn't.

She was too scheming!

Hmph, watch me teach her a lesson!

Thus, Xiao Fan turned the tables, engaging her in battle.

But her cultivation was too high. He couldn't reach the final step—couldn't achieve complete victory.

Still, there were partial victories. Qingyu reclined in Xiao Fan's arms, her beautiful eyes somewhat hazy, her face flushed red as if drunk.

Crystalline beads of sweat dotted her face. Her flowing hair was somewhat disheveled, clinging to her face—graceful and elegant.

"I'm truly a beast, exploiting little Fan's trust." Afterward, the master who had corrupted her disciple felt guilty.

Definitely won't happen again. I swear!

...

Only swear to myself! That might be a bit harsh.

...

Effective for three... three days. Mm, three days!

"Master, thank you," Xiao Fan said.

"Hmph, back off. Don't overthink things. I was just helping you increase cultivation."

"Hurry up and cultivate to immortal realm."

"Also, the medicinal power isn't fully refined. You probably won't completely absorb it until Grand Unity realm. Of course, I'll help you."

Help how? She didn't say. But probably similar to today.

With that, feeling somewhat guilty, she fled the palace.

This cultivation session left Xiao Fan amused. Usually, he was the one scheming others.

Though he'd been schemed this time, he'd seen through Master Yu'er's crude scheme yet still went along with it.

Was this love?
