Chapter 145: Deep Sisterly Affection

Li Yuxian said her sister didn't like seeing men around her.

She looked at Xiao Fan with pleading eyes, hoping he'd understand. Xiao Fan of course understood and left.

Not only did he understand—in the end, he'd come back to help her solve the problem. Hehehehe...

[Ding. You've taken your first immortal-realm cultivator, and she's a Daughter of Fortune no less. Truly a villain's model.]

[For claiming first blood at the immortal level, you receive a reward: the supreme divine pill, Desolate Primordial Kidney Body Pill.]

[Desolate Primordial Kidney Body Pill: After consumption, you will evolve into a Desolate Primordial Kidney Body—indestructible, supremely virile. Guarantees a month without flagging, and greatly increases the speed of dual cultivation.]

Worthy of the old pervert system—even the rewards were so distinctive.

Xiao Fan took out the pill and consumed it, refining it. Soon, dense yang energy radiated from his body. Overflowing with virility!

Meanwhile.

Inside the thatched cottage, Li Yuxian nourished Li Yutong's immortal meridians and gave her Immortal Spirit Pills to replenish her depleted immortal power.

However, over twenty days of high-intensity combat had severely depleted Li Yutong's meridians. They could only be slowly restored by her own cultivation.

Li Yuxian had no choice but to give her some pills for strengthening foundations, replenishing qi, and nourishing blood, hoping she'd recover soon.

Fortunately, Li Yutong was only overtired. Her body was otherwise fine. After three days of rest, she finally awakened.

During those three days, Li Yuxian never left her side, tending to her constantly, afraid something might go wrong.

Peach blossoms bloomed. Though they were inside the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda, this place felt like a paradise beyond the world. A gentle breeze passed, stirring the pink blossoms on the trees.

Whether it was the wind's pursuit or the tree's failure to hold on, the petals ultimately drifted down with the breeze.

Through the window, a tender pink petal floated down onto Li Yutong's delicate nose. Her nose wrinkled, she sneezed, and slowly awakened.

Her head ached. Her body was sore and limp, her limbs without strength.

This was Li Yutong's second sensation.

As for her first thought—she shot up from her deathbed and cried out: "Where's sister?"

"Sister?"

Fortunately, the moment she opened her eyes, she saw the sister she'd yearned for day and night.

Tears welled in her eyes. The heavy stone in her heart finally dropped. She embraced Li Yuxian, weeping, face streaked with tears.

"Sister, thank goodness you're alright. I thought something had happened to you. You scared me to death."

"I shouldn't have brought you here. It's all my fault."

Her voice was full of self-blame. Even now, all she thought about was Li Yuxian.

Li Yuxian also embraced her tenderly, stroking her back, soothing her emotions. She said softly: "Don't blame yourself. You're my sister. It was I who failed to protect you, letting you suffer like this."

Li Yuxian's caring gesture was purely out of concern, but it made Li Yutong's heart overflow with sweetness. Sister is hugging me, even caressing me. Does she have feelings for me?

Li Yuxian hadn't thought much of it, but Li Yutong's mind raced with thoughts—always scheming to win over her sister.

At first it was fine, but gradually, her hands began to wander, wanting to explore Li Yuxian's body.

However, Li Yuxian quickly caught on. She pushed her away, her expression stern: "I'm taking care of you, not giving you permission to feel me up. Can't you be serious?"

"Oh." Li Yutong said meekly. Caught.

Seeing she was fine, Li Yuxian prepared to leave. But Li Yutong grabbed her hand, looking pitiful: "Sister, right now I'm pitiful, weak, and helpless. You can't leave me alone. I'm scared."

Li Yuxian said: "There's no danger here. Rest easy."

Only then did Li Yutong realize her attention had been entirely on her sister, and she hadn't noticed this was a thatched cottage.

She asked curiously:

"Sister, where is this? Did we escape from that pagoda?"

"No, we're still inside. But I've found a way out." Li Yuxian said. The pagoda's owner is my lover now. Getting out is simple.

"What way? Did you find an exit?" Li Yutong asked curiously.

"Once you've recovered, we'll leave in a couple days." Li Yuxian said.

Li Yutong said: "A couple days might not be enough. My body's quite weak. How about a couple years?"

This girl was like a piglet wearing a bra—one scheme after another.

Her calculations were too obvious. To spend an extra two years alone with her, she was willing to stay locked up.

"No. We're leaving soon." Li Yuxian said evenly.

Li Yutong pouted, somewhat helpless.

A woman's intuition was powerful. She stared at Li Yuxian, feeling her sister had become more beautiful somehow.

But she couldn't pinpoint what was different.

Something had been added? She couldn't say.

"Sister, did you encounter some fortune? I feel like you've become much prettier." Li Yutong asked, her gaze growing even more infatuated. Sister's even more beautiful now.

Li Yuxian's cheeks flushed slightly. She'd heard that after such things, women became more mature, more alluring and enchanting. Perhaps it was because of him.

Li Yuxian shook her head: "No. You must be seeing things."

But she was pleased in her heart.

The unusual expression that flickered across Li Yuxian's face, though fleeting, couldn't escape the keen perception of a woman obsessed with love.

Li Yutong caught the abnormality in Li Yuxian's expression. Not only did her sister look more beautiful, but there was something different about her scent too—a masculine quality.

A man!

A terrifying thought flashed through Li Yutong's mind.

Did her sister... have a man now?

The thought struck her like lightning. Impossible. Absolutely impossible!

She studied Li Yuxian intently, more serious than she'd ever been. This made Li Yuxian somewhat flustered.

Why is she looking at me like that? Did she discover something?

She'd really found something!

Li Yutong didn't act coy. She simply said coldly: "Sister, come here."

Li Yuxian's heart sank. She didn't move.

Li Yutong extended her pale, delicate hand, grabbed Li Yuxian's hand, and pulled her over.

With lightning speed, she plucked the strand of hair hidden among Li Yuxian's silken locks.

She trembled all over with cold rage, her whole body shaking uncontrollably. Her voice quavered: "Sister, what is this thing!"

She felt betrayed. Her sister had gone behind her back and gotten a man.

Li Yutong was devastated. She hadn't cried when trapped in desperate straits. She hadn't cried when facing death. But thinking about her sister being claimed by a man—her tears flowed uncontrollably, pouring like rain.

Li Yuxian panicked. Blame Xiao Fan for being so creative, insisting on putting things in her mouth. She'd lost her mind at the time—she loved him too much and went along with everything he wanted. She'd even gagged.

This was nothing special. But how had it left evidence?

"Yutong, it's not what you think. There's really nothing going on."

"I won't listen, I won't listen, I won't listen! Sister, can't you see my love for you?"

"Can't you accept me? If you need these things, once my cultivation is higher, I can transform my body and help you."

Li Yutong had lost her mind. She felt she could never love again.

No matter how Li Yuxian explained, Li Yutong refused to listen. She even threatened to kill herself, leaving Li Yuxian at a complete loss.

Watching Li Yuxian's predicament, Xiao Fan knew it was about time for him to come out and play the villain.

He kicked open the door, his mocking expression mixed with a lecherous grin. He strode in without a care.

"My, my, such deep sisterly affection. I kept my promise and saved her. Don't forget our deal." Xiao Fan said loudly.

His voice was loud—not meant for Li Yuxian, but for Li Yutong to hear.

Sure enough, the moment those words left his mouth, combined with that shameless leering face—

Li Yutong had a moment of clarity. She stared fixedly at Li Yuxian and demanded: "Deal? Sister, what deal do you have with him?"
