Chapter 109: Xiao Fan's Masterful Manipulation Technique

Xiao Fan's expression shifted as he stared at her, frozen.

After a long moment, he pushed Qingyu away with one hand and spoke with pained indignation:

"What do you mean by that!"

"Are you questioning my relationship with her?"

Qingyu's expression also turned cold. "You know perfectly well what you've done. She's already taken your shape—did you think you could hide it from me?"

Xiao Fan wore a look of grief. "What kind of relationship do we have? Master and disciple! Are you going to interfere with my choice of Dao companion too?"

"Master Qingyu, you're too selfish!"

The joy of their reunion had made Qingyu lose her head.

So much so that she'd forgotten their relationship was that of master and disciple.

"Let me make this clear right now—Yiyun is my woman, and I'm not afraid to admit it." Xiao Fan's voice rang with conviction.

Then he shook off her hand, his face cold.

Qingyu reconsidered. It did seem to make sense. Even her parents hadn't objected—who was she, as merely his master, to interfere so much?

Still, she couldn't help herself.

But this time, her tone had softened considerably.

"Xiao Fan, I didn't mean it that way. Have you ever considered my feelings?"

"You were supposed to be mine alone, but now another woman has wedged herself between us. I can't accept this."

Qingyu spoke gently, though her tone brooked no argument. Exclusive possession!

Xiao Fan actually shed two tears.

This sudden turn of events left Qingyu completely at a loss.

"Xiao Fan, why are you crying?"

She felt a pang of heartache watching him. She wanted to wipe away his tears, but Xiao Fan pushed her hand away, weeping sorrowfully:

"You're actually objectifying me?"

Qingyu was caught off guard. What did he mean by objectifying?

"I'm a living, breathing person—flesh and blood—yet you say I'm 'yours alone.' In your eyes, am I nothing but your plaything?"

A plaything? That works too! Pah pah pah, what am I thinking!

Qingyu hastily denied it: "Xiao Fan, I didn't mean it that way. I just care about you too much."

She tried to take his hand again, but Xiao Fan pushed it away once more, his face full of grief.

"Don't touch me!"

"I..." Qingyu hesitated, her outstretched hand withdrawing.

The joy of their reunion made her restrain herself, unwilling to force her will upon him.

From the corner of his eye, Xiao Fan noticed the conflicted expression on Qingyu's lovely face. There was no obsessive madness—she still seemed fairly rational. He had a good grasp of the situation now.

Soon enough, I'll make you lose that rationality.

Xiao Fan composed himself, gazing at Qingyu with tender affection. "Master, do you know what I find most captivating about you?"

This sudden shift in his approach left Qingyu bewildered. He was just angry with me, and now he's calling me captivating?

With that, Xiao Fan's right hand took the initiative to grasp Qingyu's jade-like fingers—delicate and tender—while his left hand cradled her perfect, beautiful face.

His eyes glistened with tears as he gazed at her with deep affection.

Feeling the warmth and tenderness from his hands, Qingyu's cheeks instantly flushed crimson, her eyes becoming soft as spring water.

"R-Rebellious disciple, what are you saying? I'm your master! You dare describe me as captivating? Are your intentions impure?" she whispered in mock anger.

It came across more as bashfulness, utterly without intimidation—if anything, it only added to her allure.

Hiss! Xiao Fan sucked in several breaths of cold air to suppress the fire in his heart. Damn, aside from her excessive possessiveness, Master Qingyu was perfect in every way.

No, I have to change that trait of hers!

Xiao Fan gave a gentle tug, and Qingyu's body fell into his embrace without any resistance. He smiled tenderly:

"Master Qingyu, do you remember when we first met? You were so gentle, so understanding. You taught me Daoist arts, passed down cultivation methods to me. Besides my parents, you're the person closest to me."

"I even said that when I grew up, I would marry no one but you. Can you comprehend how important you are to me?"

Xiao Fan sat calmly, his gaze distant, as if reminiscing about days long past.

Qingyu was completely flustered by his sudden confession. Back then, Xiao Fan had only been eight years old. How could she have taken the words of an eight-year-old child seriously?

As they spent more time together, she gradually fell for this disciple she'd raised. In her heart, she began hoping he would say those words again: that he would marry no one but her.

"Master Qingyu, we've known each other for a thousand years. I don't know when it started, but you transformed from a gentle, cultured, graceful woman into someone possessive. Your desire to possess grew unchecked, until you became a stranger to me."

"I felt suffocated, trapped. That feeling of having no freedom was choking me. Gradually, all I wanted was to escape from you. Do you understand my pain?"

Drip, drip. Tears fell, landing on Qingyu's face. Her heart was deeply moved, thrown into chaos.

Had I really caused Xiao Fan this much distress?

She began to doubt her own past.

As everyone knows, memories tend to be rose-tinted. People habitually embellish them, so he was certain that Qingyu's memories were all of their happy times together.

As for the unhappy times, Xiao Fan couldn't quite remember them either—but he could make things up.

"I took in two maidservants, and while you didn't say anything openly, Master Qingyu, you privately told me several times that with you looking after me, Yu Yue and Xinxi could just go back."

"At first, I said nothing and simply arranged for them to stay elsewhere, providing for them from a distance."

"Gradually, you wanted me to distance myself from every woman around me. Even my own mother—you wanted me away from her, saying something about how grown sons shouldn't rely on their mothers. Your possessiveness was so overwhelming it suffocated me."

"I tried to be understanding, to talk to you about it, but all I got in return was escalation."

At this point, Xiao Fan sighed softly. "It was my indulgence that made you lose yourself. That gentle, lovely Master Qingyu will never return."

Qingyu was deeply moved. Had she really put so much pressure on him?

Of course it was fabricated—though there was about thirty percent truth mixed with seventy percent lies.

Qingyu was indeed extremely possessive. With her formidable strength, she was accustomed to having the final say, with everyone obeying her commands.

When it came to the man she loved, she couldn't bear for Xiao Fan to have any contact with other women.

Qingyu said timidly, "Xiao Fan, I..."

Xiao Fan looked down at her, smiling gently. "It's not your fault, Master Qingyu. It's all my fault—I was too indulgent with you."

"Even so, I still don't want you to suffer even the slightest harm."

"Didn't you ask why I left without a word, why I distanced myself from you?"

Qingyu stared at him blankly, sensing he had suffered tremendous grievance—after all, he'd once said that real men don't cry easily.

"Even though you've become willful, Master Qingyu, you still hold an important place in my heart."

"I knew that if I told you I was going to my death, you definitely wouldn't allow it. So I could only deceive you, saying I was just going home for a visit."

"At that moment, I felt a sense of relief—the feeling of escaping suffocation. Can you understand?"

"Even though you put so much pressure on me, I still didn't want you to suffer any harm. I left secretly, alone. Do you understand?"

"I thought that our separation would give us both time to calm down. I never expected that you still haven't grown, Master Qingyu."

"It seems it was just my wishful thinking." Saying this, Xiao Fan closed his eyes, tilting his head slightly upward as a tear unconsciously slid from the corner of his eye.

"Perhaps our fate has run its course."

With that, he lowered his head and gave her a sorrowful kiss.

A brief touch, then separation.

"Let this be our farewell kiss." He smiled bitterly, then released her hand, turning to leave.

Qingyu's heart shook with unprecedented force. She began to reflect on what she might have done wrong.

But before she could react, she felt Xiao Fan's resolve—a mix of regret and reluctance, a sorrow rising from within that couldn't be severed.

"Don't go! Master was wrong. Xiao Fan, please don't leave me!"

Without thinking, Qingyu's crystalline, delicate feet hurried after him. She embraced him from behind, her jade hands and tender fingers locking tightly around his waist, as if afraid he might slip away.

A barely perceptible trace of satisfaction appeared at the corner of Xiao Fan's mouth. Everything was going according to plan.

"You've done nothing wrong, Master Qingyu," Xiao Fan said gently, though his hands didn't stop. He pried open her fingers one by one from around his waist.

"How could I bear to blame you for making mistakes? It's my fault for giving you too much freedom."

"If there's anyone to blame, it's me. My indulgence made you this way."

He freed himself from Qingyu's embrace and continued walking forward.

Qingyu's mind was already in chaos. She too was beginning to think something was wrong with herself.

After years apart, on their very first meeting, they were about to separate again. She couldn't do it. She truly couldn't.

"Don't—don't go. I'll change. All those problems you mentioned, I'll change. I'll change everything." Qingyu held him tight once more, her soft body pressing against his back, her cheek buried in his shoulder, trying to convey her gentleness to him.

Her voice carried a trace of sorrow. Warm tears slid down her face, dripping onto Xiao Fan's shoulder.

That's probably enough. Push any further and she might actually turn dark. Traditional courtship requires knowing when to stop. Don't overdo it!

Xiao Fan stopped trying to leave, standing still. The two of them remained there, motionless.

However, Xiao Fan's offensive hadn't ended—it had merely changed direction.

After a long while, Xiao Fan finally spoke, his voice faint: "For Master Qingyu's sake, I'd rather die than drag you down. Don't you understand my heart yet?"

Qingyu pleaded, "Xiao Fan, give me another chance, please? I promise I won't make you uncomfortable anymore."

But Xiao Fan said, "Master Qingyu, you know me. I can't abandon Yiyun just for your sake."

"To me, they're both precious. I'm a man who loves deeply, and I've even been engaged to someone through a family arrangement."

"I'm no longer pure. Master Qingyu, I don't deserve you."

"I admit I once loved only you, Master. But I've discovered I was naive—my heart has shattered into millions of pieces, and each piece has fallen in love with a different woman."

"I've simply made the mistake that every man makes."

"Let's part amicably and find our own happiness."

Qingyu's mind was already muddled. How could she accept such words?

"I won't pressure you anymore, Master promises. I'll listen to whatever you say, alright? You can be responsible to them too—just don't neglect me."

She had become somewhat humble.

Indeed, those who fall deeply can only be humble.

Xiao Fan felt he was truly terrible, always toying with others' feelings. Ah well, then I'll just keep toying with them—for a lifetime.

He turned around, gazing deeply into Qingyu's reddened eyes, crystalline tears pooling in them.

It was enough to make anyone's heart ache.

He lovingly wiped away her tears. "Master Qingyu, won't this be unfair to you?"

"It won't. As long as you're happy." Qingyu had humbled herself to the dust.

Xiao Fan's heart roared. Playing with Master Qingyu's feelings—I'm such a beast!

But outwardly, he remained gentle. He knew that Master Qingyu was currently accepting this under duress.

There must still be reservations in her heart. Next, he needed to launch a psychological offensive to eliminate those reservations.

"Actually, if I told you that from beginning to end, I've only ever loved you alone—would you believe me?" Xiao Fan said with deep sincerity.

Yet as he spoke these words, his face showed an expression of painful struggle.

"R-Really?" Qingyu asked, her starry eyes sparkling, her brows like spring willows, breathtakingly beautiful.

"Really. I, Xiao Fan, never lie to women."

He spoke with conviction. "If you don't believe me, I can swear to the heavens. If I've deceived Master Qingyu in any way, then let me suffer eternal..."

Before he could finish, two jade-like fingers pressed against his lips, hushing him. "Don't make casual oaths. I believe you."

Xiao Fan's face gradually showed relief. He placed a gentle kiss on her forehead. "Thank you for trusting me, Master Qingyu."

With that, he let out a sigh.

"Actually, I didn't want things to be this way either."

"I once died, and a woman brought me back."

He pulled out the cultivation method "Heart-Stealing Beauty" to show her.

Qingyu asked curiously, "What's this?"

"This is why I was saved. In the demon abyss, I was gravely wounded. It was my fiancée who carved out her own heart and used the 'One Heart, Same Body' technique within this method to resurrect me and preserve my life."

He spoke solemnly, with a hint of sorrow.

"What? You encountered danger again? Why couldn't I sense it?" Qingyu exclaimed. Though she didn't watch Xiao Fan constantly, she would certainly intervene if she sensed he was in danger.

Xiao Fan was vague in his response. "I was pulled into a different dimension at the time—a secret realm not open to outsiders. Even with your power, Master, it's normal that you couldn't sense it."

"But that's not the point." Xiao Fan quickly changed the subject.

He continued, "You can examine the power of this Heart-Stealing Beauty yourself. My heart has already merged with hers—it no longer belongs exclusively to you, Master."

"During this merger, my heart shattered into countless pieces. I can feel that each piece will fall in love with a different woman. I... don't deserve you, Master Qingyu." Xiao Fan spoke with devastating grief.

Qingyu wanted to say something, but Xiao Fan continued:

"This is also why I left you, why I didn't dare have too much contact with you."

"Because your possessiveness is too strong, Master. I was afraid you couldn't bear it. Rather than let indecision lead to disaster, even if you end up resenting me, even if I have to bear the name of a heartless man, I had to sever this bond with you."

Qingyu wept silently. Even now, he's still thinking of me.

The last trace of reservation in her heart dissolved.

This wasn't something he actively pursued—he was forced into it. What right did she have to make demands?

"Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Qingyu asked through tear-blurred eyes.

"Only useless men complain to women. I couldn't do it—I didn't want to pour out my troubles to Master Qingyu."

"If you hadn't held me and cried today, making me unable to bear it, I planned to bury this secret in my heart forever."

Qingyu couldn't hold back any longer. Tears streamed down her face as she buried it in his chest.

Xiao Fan simply sighed. "I don't want you to be hurt—not even emotionally."

At these words, Qingyu began sobbing on the spot, unable to say another word.

Xiao Fan gently stroked her back, softly rubbing her head, his face full of tenderness.

Feeling Xiao Fan's affection, Qingyu also held him tightly, unwilling to part.

After a long while, Qingyu came back to her senses. She pulled away from his embrace, her face showing a smile full of tenderness:

"From now on, no matter how many women are by your side, you can't neglect me. Understand?"

"Master Qingyu, no one can replace you in my heart. I will never neglect you," Xiao Fan said solemnly.

Pfft. Qingyu broke into a smile, gradually accepting the reality that she wouldn't have Xiao Fan all to herself.

As long as I'm the most important person in his heart, that's enough.

Xiao Fan truly understood manipulation. Exclusive possession? Not happening—but if I just turn around and leave, then you can accept that he has several women.

His manipulation technique had reached a new level!

As the two shared a tender moment, Su Yiyun returned to Holy Master Peak.

Uncle Jiang had brought a jade slip to deliver to Xiao Fan, but couldn't find him. He happened to run into Su Yiyun.

Su Yiyun didn't think much of it. She accepted the slip and went to deliver it to Xiao Fan. But the moment she returned to Holy Master Peak, she saw Xiao Fan holding the Holy Master, the two of them whispering sweet nothings to each other.

Seeing this, Holy Master Qingyu was too embarrassed to speak. What kind of situation was this?

She could only bury her head deeper into Xiao Fan's chest.

Xiao Fan also noticed Su Yiyun. Their eyes met.

Su Yiyun immediately felt she'd come at the wrong time. She hurriedly said, "I'm sorry! Perhaps I've come at a bad time."

She turned to leave.

A mischievous thought flashed through Xiao Fan's mind.

He slightly extended his hand, and an invisible force pulled Su Yiyun over. He embraced one woman in each arm.

He said gently:

"No, you've come at exactly the right time."

Although this is just one chapter, it's quite lengthy. This section was really difficult to split up, so I've combined it all together.
