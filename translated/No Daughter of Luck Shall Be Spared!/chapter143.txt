Chapter 143: I'll Take Responsibility For You

While Xiao Fan was scheming against Li Yuxian, Li Yuxian was equally scheming against him.

Weathered by life, seasoned, devastatingly handsome, brilliantly talented, naturally tranquil in temperament—so many virtues gathered in one person.

Most importantly, it was Xiao Fan's cultural refinement that left her in awe.

Such a perfect man. I really want him.

Li Yuxian was conflicted. Afraid he wouldn't come, yet afraid he'd go too far. Wanting to have him, yet fearing he'd despise her and call her an opportunist.

She was torn.

Xiao Fan didn't know her thoughts. Since she wasn't objecting, he might as well use the drunkenness as an excuse and make his move first.

Xiao Fan murmured, treating her as his deceased mortal wife from long ago, establishing that he didn't know she was Li Yuxian while simultaneously reinforcing his devoted lover persona.

Even at a time like this, you don't forget to build your character. Truly worthy of you.

Still pining for a mortal woman who died so many years ago—was there anyone more devoted than him?

Li Yuxian found it even more thrilling. That feeling of being held in someone's arms while they called another woman's name—this strange sensation made heat rise in her heart. What kind of situation was this?

She didn't understand. She only knew it was exciting.

Xiao Fan's seventy-percent-drunk gaze was filled with affection as he looked at Li Yuxian.

He held her in his arms. The two lay on their sides on the bed, noses nearly touching.

His heavy, masculine breath barged uninvited into Li Yuxian's delicate nose, instantly making her mouth go dry. Her breathing quickened too, fragrant as orchids, like a spring breeze against his face.

She was completely moved.

Though he was drunk and what she was doing was somewhat opportunistic, if she didn't do this, she'd regret it for the rest of her life.

Forget it. She closed her eyes. Her curved, upturned lashes trembled slightly. Xiao Fan could even see her eyelids quivering as her red lips moved toward him.

He was still thinking of what excuse to use, and she delivered herself to his door?

No more talking. Was he supposed to let her take the initiative?

Xiao Fan made the first move, cupping her lovely face, holding it firmly, then losing himself in that nectar-sweet ambrosia. Far better than any wine.

Li Yuxian's body stiffened. The temperature of her delicate form instantly rose, like a burning coal. Her entire being felt unbearably hot.

She had no experience. A complete blank when it came to matters between men and women.

Xiao Fan was a veteran of romance. He knew exactly how to ease tension and make a budding flower bloom into full splendor.

He held Li Yuxian tight, the two of them pressed close without a gap between them. He embraced her slender waist with tender care.

Her rigid body slowly melted, like a frozen river with ice and snow thawing, becoming soft as water.

Li Yuxian's body went limp. She buried herself in his embrace, lost in desire.

If the Soul Transformation realm of cultivation was about cultivating one's divine soul, then this moment was about one's soul ascending to the heavens—a pleasure she'd never experienced before.

Desire spread silently, consuming Li Yuxian's body and mind. Right now, all she wanted was to become Xiao Fan's woman.

Xiao Fan savored this perfect form—soft yet warm. The fragrance of innocence, combined with her unique scholarly elegance, created an extraordinary sensation.

Like a well-read good girl whose head had been completely turned by Xiao Fan.

Burning with desire!

Xiao Fan said nothing. He felt he'd reached a critical point, and Li Yuxian had too.

Opportunity was fleeting. Xiao Fan seized the moment, looking down at her from above.

Her gaze was hazy, filled with tender affection as she looked at the man before her. She knew what was about to happen. A bit nervous, but also expectant.

Looking at Li Yuxian's exquisite, fairy-like, beautiful and ethereal face, and those eyes that silently gave permission, Xiao Fan smiled and placed his hand at her waist.

With a gentle pull, that light purple sash came undone.

Half-concealed, he could see beneath the purple—a flawless, tender form, pure as jade.

The light purple mist rose suddenly, then drifted to the floor.

Li Yuxian, with her defenses lowered, her innocent yet alluring self fully exposed before Xiao Fan. She bit her lip and turned her head away, eyes filled with shyness and anticipation.

Li Yuxian was perfect. Skin as delicate as a baby's, impossibly soft, yet carrying the rosy blush of a young woman—shy and infatuated, innocence tinged with sweetness.

Xiao Fan turned her face toward him and leaned in. Li Yuxian's jade-white arms gently hooked around his neck—boneless yet soul-stirring.

Xiao Fan gazed at this water-like beauty before him.

He moved with practiced ease. Li Yuxian's initially blissful face showed a flash of pain, her beautiful eyes squeezing shut. But soon, under Xiao Fan's soothing, the pain faded away.

Life was like this—first bitter, then sweet. A truth Li Yuxian experienced firsthand.

The only imperfection was that Li Yuxian, having read too many books, used somewhat stiff vocabulary—not wild or uninhibited enough. Both a virtue and a flaw.

Madness until exhaustion.

Ten days later.

Li Yuxian had never experienced anything like this. She felt indescribably happy. Not only that, but Xiao Fan seemed to have some special cultivation technique—while they were together, her cultivation had actually improved.

The drunkenness wore off quickly.

He'd sobered up by the second day.

So why did it only end after ten days?

Both were thinking of explanations.

Xiao Fan was most anxious. While drunk, he could use "I wasn't aware" and "drunk mistakes" as excuses.

But what about the nine days after the second day? He was completely sober—why didn't he stop?

What to do, what to do? What excuse could he use to fool her?

Could he really only settle for a fleeting romance? Absolutely not—Li Yuxian could only have him as her man!

Li Yuxian was anxious too. Why wasn't he saying anything? Did he resent her?

He was only Grand Ascension. His strength couldn't match a fraction of hers. If she'd wanted to break free, he couldn't have stopped her.

But she hadn't.

He didn't dare stop—could it be because he saw how happy she was and feared stopping would anger her? Would he think she lacked propriety?

As for not separating during those later days, it was because she was truly addicted. She wished she could meld him into her own body.

The two sat facing each other. The atmosphere fell into awkward silence.

Li Yuxian spoke first. She gently extended her delicate hands, tenderly embracing Xiao Fan's body, burying her head in his broad chest.

Li Yuxian said softly: "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have taken advantage of you while you were vulnerable. I just like you too much."

"I'll take responsibility for you."

She lifted her head slightly, meeting Xiao Fan's gaze.

Her once innocent eyes now carried a hint of allure and infatuation. That gaze was filled with the obsession and happiness of someone who'd fallen in love.

Xiao Fan's CPU overheated. Wait, what do you mean you'll take responsibility for me?

Holy crap, I was the one being played?
