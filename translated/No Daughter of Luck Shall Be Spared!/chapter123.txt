Chapter 123: Power Means You Can Do Whatever You Want! Will You Seize the Future?

No one dared say a word against Xiao Fan's arrogance.

Though his realm wasn't particularly high, his strength was formidable and his background profound.

As long as you're strong enough, everything you do is right.

Xiao Fan understood this principle. Otherwise he wouldn't have disregarded Hundred Flowers' rules and directly refined Hong Rushuang into a slave.

He walked back toward the palace at a leisurely pace. Along the way, cultivators from other factions naturally parted to make way for him, like a retreating tide.

The gazes they directed at Xiao Fan held awe and boundless worship.

"Holy Son, you're so strong!"

On the way back, a young girl who appeared to be a Hundred Flowers Holy Land disciple appeared before Xiao Fan, her eyes shining with longing as she spoke with some infatuation.

Xiao Fan felt like a celebrity. This Hundred Flowers Holy Land female disciple's eyes were filled with adoration—the kind with little stars twinkling in them.

"Not really. I'm just a bit more hardworking than you all. As long as you're willing to cultivate desperately, you can also reach the heights you desire."

Xiao Fan smiled as he spoke.

He was completely different from the silent killing god of moments ago—like two different people.

"Really, really? Can I become as strong as the Holy Son?" the girl said nervously.

She didn't know why she had mustered the courage to step forward and speak with Xiao Fan, but she had done it.

Xiao Fan nodded earnestly. "I truly am just a tiny bit more hardworking than you all. Keep it up! You're the best!"

As he spoke, Xiao Fan patted her head. He had to admit, young girls were always enticing.

Without lingering further, he continued on his way.

Along the route, many people still called out to him, praising his formidable strength. He simply smiled in response.

It felt pretty good.

The young girl whose head he'd patted flushed bright red, her body stiffening slightly. The Holy Son encouraged me!

"Holy Son, I'll work hard!" she vowed silently in her heart.

Xiao Fan's words and actions were witnessed by others.

"Damn, I told you the Holy Son is a gentle person! If the Shaman God Sect people hadn't provoked him, how could he possibly have killed them?"

"Exactly! You can only blame Hong Rushuang for having no sense. She just had to cause trouble for the Holy Son."

"She had it coming."

"The Holy Son has no airs at all. How can he be so approachable? Honestly, our sect master's illegitimate son is more arrogant than anyone—acting like his nostrils point to the sky, looking down on everyone with disdain."

"Is this what an heir of a great family is like? Virtuous and talented, graceful as jade—the Holy Son's looks make even me at my peak have to step aside."

"Ah yes, yes—and once you stepped aside, you never returned, right?"

Xiao Fan only showed a bit of tolerance, patience, and kindness, yet won countless praises. This further confirmed his belief.

Having power really means you can do whatever you want!

The more Jiang Lanzhi looked at Xiao Fan, the more infatuated she became. She wished she could stick to him at all times, but the second round of the assessment was about to begin—there wasn't much time.

"I need to go now."

"Mm."

The second round of assessment was about to start, but the biggest competitor, Hong Rushuang, was already eliminated.

"Holy Son, do you still need me to accompany her?" Xinxi suddenly asked.

Xiao Fan had originally wanted Xinxi to go, but it seemed unnecessary now.

"No need. She can handle it herself."

"Yes, sir." Xinxi had no objections.

After Xiao Fan dealt with Hong Rushuang, most of the other Hundred Flowers Holy Land disciples gave up on the assessment and no longer participated in the second round.

There was no point. They couldn't compete anyway.

Better to withdraw now and maintain some dignity.

On Xiao Fan's way back to the palace, another young girl who appeared to be a Hundred Flowers Holy Land disciple jumped out. He thought she was another fan girl like the previous one.

But when he looked up, she seemed familiar.

Xia Huaxuan!

"Congratulations, Holy Son," Xia Huaxuan said with a smile.

Her face was full of smiles.

"Mm, come with me."

Xiao Fan spoke, having everyone else wait outside the door.

Xia Huaxuan followed him inside.

As soon as the door closed, Xia Huaxuan spoke respectfully:

"Holy Son, your sword."

She handed over the Fortune-Plundering Sword, returning it to Xiao Fan.

Xiao Fan raised his hand, lightly drawing it in. The Fortune-Plundering Sword flew back into his grasp.

"You did well." Xiao Fan praised her lightly.

Indeed, he hadn't expended any effort and gained 88,888 Villain Points for free—all delivered by Xia Huaxuan.

Not bad at all.

Xia Huaxuan showed a smile. She was somewhat reserved because Xiao Fan's strength exceeded her imagination, but she still tried to appear composed.

"Holy Son, this is his corpse. Would you like to inspect it?"

Holy shit, this woman was terrifying—she even carried the corpse with her!

Xiao Fan stopped her. "No need. I saw your every move. He's already dead. I trust you."

He didn't want to see a corpse. Only then did Xia Huaxuan refrain from taking out Fei Yangyang's body.

Nothing stirs without profit. Xiao Fan could naturally see that Xia Huaxuan had something to ask of him.

"Speak. What do you want?" Xiao Fan sat in a chair, resting his hand on the armrest and tapping it casually.

Xia Huaxuan's expression stiffened, but she quickly relaxed. She said, "Nothing. I simply admire the Holy Son."

"Not honest." Xiao Fan smiled.

No one would kill someone pursuing them just for a single sentence.

He didn't want to press the issue. If she wouldn't say, then forget it.

However, when he saw the golden script above Xia Huaxuan's head, his expression instantly became serious.

A Child of Destiny!

"System, if I'm not mistaken, she didn't have a golden script before, did she?" Xiao Fan thought.

【Correct. The Fortune-Plundering Sword kills, and she also receives a portion of the destiny. Fate transformation and replacement aren't impossible. It's a matter of timing and fate.】

After thinking for a moment, Xiao Fan opened the golden script above Xia Huaxuan's head to read about her life's background.

【Xia Huaxuan: Newly ascended Child of Destiny. Due to slaying Fei Yangyang with decisive ruthlessness and receiving a portion of the Fortune-Plundering Sword's destiny, her fate has undergone a transformation.】

【Life Background: Daughter of Falling Leaf Valley's Valley Master. After her family was destroyed, she joined Hundred Flowers Holy Land.

Falling Leaf Valley was a small sect whose strongest member was only at Nascent Soul Middle Stage. When Xia Huaxuan was twelve, a spirit spring emerged from the back mountain of Falling Leaf Valley. A peerless cultivation method flew out from within, accompanied by霞 light filling the sky, countless spirit insects dancing, and spiritual herbs everywhere.】

【It turned out this Falling Leaf Valley location was actually an ancient paradise cave dwelling from a powerful faction, buried by time and made unremarkable.

Through the erosion of ages, this paradise cave dwelling resurfaced once more.】

【There was a traitor within Falling Leaf Valley. News of the paradise cave dwelling spread rapidly. The innocent possess treasures, inviting disaster. A Nascent Soul Middle Stage faction was destined to be unable to protect such a paradise cave dwelling. Falling Leaf Valley wanted to relocate and avoid calamity.】

【A clan—the Wang family—learned of this matter, sealed off the information, and trapped all of Falling Leaf Valley's people within the valley, forcibly seizing the paradise cave dwelling.

Falling Leaf Valley's people didn't dare resist at all because they were too weak. The opposition could send anyone at Soul Transformation realm. They complied, only wanting to live.】

【The Wang family seized the paradise cave dwelling and took the spirit spring. To conceal the truth and prevent exposure, the Wang family eliminated everyone from Falling Leaf Valley, cutting the grass and pulling the roots.】

【Xia Huaxuan was also pursued at the time, but fate was on her side. She fell off a cliff, triggered a teleportation formation, escaped the pursuit, and joined Hundred Flowers Holy Land under a new identity to evade assassination.】

【Cultivation Motivation: The Wang family is a mid-level clan. Their strongest member is only at Body Integration realm. Xia Huaxuan's goal is to cultivate hard, become a Body Integration cultivator or even Grand Ascension cultivator, destroy the Wang family, and avenge Falling Leaf Valley's senior brothers and sisters, her father and mother.】

【Currently encountering a cultivation bottleneck and needs to break through, so she's sought you out.】

This summary was fairly standard—barely qualifying as a revenge-type female lead.

But why was she seeking him out for a cultivation bottleneck? Did he look like someone easily taken advantage of?

Or did she think he was too righteous and would definitely eradicate evil and help her destroy the Wang family?

However, he also noticed a particular phrase: changed her appearance!

He knew things weren't simple. How could a mighty Child of Destiny's appearance be only slightly more outstanding than ordinary people!

Seeing Xiao Fan's silence, Xia Huaxuan grew anxious. What should she do? Did he think she was a scheming woman trying to get close to him?

While there was indeed a bit of that, she swore to the heavens that she absolutely wasn't using him—she was showing loyalty and letting him see her value.

Commonly known as: latching onto a powerful patron!

As long as she could gain the Holy Son's response, destroying the Wang family would be effortless.

Xia Huaxuan didn't know what to say, afraid of speaking wrongly and displeasing him. She could only maintain silence.

As everyone knows, Xiao Fan never let any Child of Destiny slip away. He said:

"You're from Falling Leaf Valley and want to grow strong enough to destroy the Wang family clan."

"Right?"

Xia Huaxuan's expression changed, but she quickly recovered. A great clan wanting to investigate her background might have some difficulty, but could ultimately discover it.

She boldly admitted, "Yes, Holy Son. I want to follow you. I can even lay down my life for you."

"You're quite interesting." Xiao Fan said with growing interest.

This person was clever. She didn't show her own needs but instead considered things from his perspective, showing she understood how to weigh benefits and could consider problems from others' viewpoints.

"Follow me and use my influence to destroy the Wang family?" Xiao Fan smiled.

Hearing this, Xia Huaxuan's body trembled. She immediately knelt to explain. "I don't mean that! I just want to follow by your side to learn and cultivate, to solve problems for the Holy Son."

Good grief, her calculations were quite precise.

Follow me, leech off my cultivation resources, and secretly grow stronger, was that it?

After a long silence, Xiao Fan said, "Let me see your true appearance."

Xia Huaxuan didn't hesitate. To show sincerity, she couldn't hide anything from him.

She immediately placed her jade hand on her face and gently pulled.

A mask as thin as cicada wings peeled away from her face.

What appeared was a timid, shy young girl's face—fair-skinned like an exquisite porcelain doll.

A pair of lively eyes under willow-leaf eyebrows appeared pure and sweet, though they harbored a trace of sorrow—the hatred of unavenged grievances surfacing in her gaze.

Her face was small, like a budding flower—not yet gorgeous, but making one couldn't help but anticipate this bud's blooming.

A typical delicate, young, slender beauty. However, her bosom was remarkably ample. Today, Xia Huaxuan wore a pure white dress with a green jade hairpin in her hair. Tender yet slightly unripe, she gave off a feeling like a white moonlight.

Her watery, lively eyes looked at Xiao Fan expectantly, awaiting his response.

"Holy shit! I knew no Child of Destiny was simple. This is a natural seductress!" Xiao Fan felt he needed an Ancient Kidney Physique.

"Not bad. You're honest." Xiao Fan spoke in a superior's tone, without sorrow or joy.

Xia Huaxuan was delighted, thinking Xiao Fan had agreed to let her follow.

Unexpectedly, Xiao Fan said:

"You follow me simply to borrow my power to grow strong enough to destroy the Wang family. I'm right, aren't I?"

Xia Huaxuan shook her head. "No, this subordinate truly wants to follow the Holy Son."

She admitted that at first there was some scheming, but she had no choice. Without support, power, or influence, to survive in this cultivation world, one had to have schemes.

This was forced by the environment. People without cunning and depth couldn't survive.

Xiao Fan didn't ask about the reasons. He continued, "What you want is power, correct?"

"Yes!" Xia Huaxuan nodded.

"That's simple. I can grant you power. However, there's a price. It depends on whether you'll accept it." Xiao Fan said softly.

If she wasn't even afraid of death, how could she fear a price?

With almost no hesitation, Xia Huaxuan answered, "Everything is at the Holy Son's discretion."

Xiao Fan: "Mm, no regrets?"

"No regrets!"

Xiao Fan nodded. He'd confirmed it repeatedly.

He threw out the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda, bringing both of them inside. The sudden change made Xia Huaxuan somewhat nervous.

The next moment, a manual fell into her hands—Phoenix-and-Dragon Technique.

"Holy Son, this is...?"

"Granting you power."

"Inside contains the method for your future growth. It will change your aptitude and raise your cultivation. I'll personally help you clear your meridians."

Hearing this, she was deeply moved and immediately flipped through the Phoenix-and-Dragon Technique. After just two or three pages, her face flushed red, her fair face dripping with shy sweetness.

"The future is in your hands. It just depends on whether you'll seize the future!" Xiao Fan said.

The future—seize the future!

Nearly 4000 words—giving me some power⚡ isn't too much to ask, right?
