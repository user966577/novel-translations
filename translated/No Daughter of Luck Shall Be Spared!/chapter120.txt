Chapter 120: The Witch-Yao King's Princess, The Three Great Wu Generals

Victory was decided in an instant.

The collision produced a thunderous boom. The violent impact sent out an invisible shockwave. Fortunately, the stone floor was sturdy enough—only spider-web cracks appeared, radiating outward from where Jiang Lanzhi stood.

No dust was raised, so there was no need to wait for it to settle before seeing the outcome.

"That's—Senior Sister Lanzhi! Yes, the one standing on the arena is Senior Sister Lanzhi!"

"So strong! Senior Sister Lanzhi only used one punch—she didn't even use any techniques!"

"In other words, Senior Sister Lanzhi held back. She only used her fist."

On the arena, Jiang Lanzhi slowly lowered her fist, as casually as swatting away a fly. Effortless.

Her verdant dress swayed elegantly. Her expression remained unchanged—not a trace of excitement, as if this outcome had been expected all along.

The face of a master!

Her ink-black hair cascaded naturally, swaying without wind.

Jiang Lanzhi withdrew her fist, turned toward the stands, and smiled warmly at Xiao Fan—showing her gentle side only to him.

"How was that? I'm impressive, aren't I?" she asked with a radiant smile.

Xiao Fan nodded: "Not bad. Still a bit below my level, though."

The arena's protective formation separated combatants from spectators—otherwise, Jiang Lanzhi would have flown right over.

This sudden public display of affection left the audience dumbfounded.

"She's showing off even now?"

"I can't believe it. Senior Sister Lanzhi is acting cute? When we went on missions together, she was slaughtering old monsters with a single sword stroke each!"

"I thought Senior Sister Lanzhi never smiled. Turns out I misunderstood—she only smiles for the Holy Son."

Her sisters from Hundred Flowers Holy Land felt like they were seeing her for the first time. Was this the power of an engagement?

Jiang Lanzhi didn't argue. She simply gave him another tender smile, then descended from the arena with graceful steps.

Of course, she didn't forget to add a parting jab: "Senior Sister Rushuang, your armor doesn't seem that impressive. Could it be fake?"

"Stop pretending. I didn't use my full strength—I just knocked you off the arena."

Hong Rushuang had been lying on the ground like a dead fish, utterly ignored by everyone.

But hearing Jiang Lanzhi's words, that corpse-like body twitched slightly.

Jiang Lanzhi had held back because the Saintess selection forbade killing. With her true strength, a single punch could have obliterated Hong Rushuang.

"Don't push your luck!"

Hong Rushuang struggled to her feet. Her once-beautiful face had taken Jiang Lanzhi's casual punch—her nose was caved in, her features twisted. Combined with the blood streaming down, she looked terrifying.

"So what if I bully you? Fight me if you dare!" Jiang Lanzhi sneered.

"Today, the selection rules protected you. Don't think I won't kill you. Say one more bad word about me behind my back, and you'll be the first I crush."

"You—!" Hong Rushuang's chest heaved with rage. She wanted to charge forward, but knowing she couldn't win, she held herself back.

Hong Rushuang: "Don't be so arrogant!"

Jiang Lanzhi: "If I'm not arrogant while I'm young, when should I be?"

Hong Rushuang: "You—just you wait!"

Jiang Lanzhi: "What, you want to offer your face for another punch?"

Every retort was a complete shutdown. From combat prowess to verbal sparring, total domination.

Having lost the match and her dignity, Hong Rushuang couldn't handle Jiang Lanzhi's merciless mockery. She couldn't catch her breath and fainted dead away.

Her eyes rolled back, her body went limp, and she collapsed backward.

This alarmed the Hundred Flowers Holy Land staff—don't let her die from anger when we didn't even kill her in the fight!

They rushed to help. Fortunately, it was just a case of rage-induced qi disruption—nothing serious.

Xiao Fan watched Jiang Lanzhi's performance with great satisfaction. As expected, even her words were domineering.

Bai Fengliu, on the other hand, was furious. He had planned to make a splash and spread the Dark Radiance Battle Armor's fame so he could sell it for spirit stones.

Instead, Jiang Lanzhi had shattered it with a single punch!

He'd never had such terrible luck.

"Sect Master Wu, this is just the high-grade Dark Radiance Battle Armor. We also have the supreme-grade version, comparable to a Dao artifact in strength. You'd only need to spend one-third the cost of a Dao artifact to get one."

"Order now and I'll give you an additional discount—only one-quarter the cost of a Dao artifact."

Bai Fengliu maintained his smile.

But the cultivator across from him—who had been interested in the armor—now looked uncertain.

"I think... this needs further consideration. Please give me time to discuss it with my sect elders."

Bai Fengliu's expression froze.

But he recovered quickly, forcing a standard smile.

"I hope we can work together."

"Certainly."

Xiao Fan had also noticed the Dark Radiance Battle Armor. It was actually quite useful.

If he could equip every elder and disciple of Supreme Mystery Holy Land with a set, wouldn't that be amazing?

Good idea. Conquer the Shaman God Sect and take it all!

Force them to work for me. One set per person!

After Jiang Lanzhi's stunning debut—one punch, one victory over Hong Rushuang—no subsequent match generated the same shock.

Three days of arena battles passed quickly.

Without any surprises, Jiang Lanzhi single-handedly dominated all the current-generation disciples of Hundred Flowers Holy Land.

She claimed first place.

Hong Rushuang, having faced Jiang Lanzhi early, could only settle for top eight.

"How can she be this strong!"

In the backstage rest area, Hong Rushuang fumed.

Bai Fengliu entered and consoled her: "Don't worry. The Saintess position depends on backing, not just personal strength."

Hong Rushuang considered this and found it reasonable. What good was strength? Connections were what mattered.

"You're right. She can't beat me." Hong Rushuang smirked coldly.

Bai Fengliu nodded: "Still, we shouldn't be careless. I didn't expect them to bring three Grand Ascension cultivators. I only brought one elder. We might be at a disadvantage in the coming rounds."

Hong Rushuang laughed: "No matter. I've already summoned Father's Three Great Wu Generals—all at Grand Ascension. With your elder..."

"Four against three. The advantage is ours!"

The Three Great Wu Generals!

Hearing this title, Bai Fengliu's heart settled!

The Three Great Wu Generals were the Witch-Yao King's three mightiest warriors. And the Witch-Yao King was one of the Wu Tribe's Seven Supreme Lords—each capable of matching ten thousand soldiers.

Hong Rushuang was actually the Witch-Yao King's princess. She had been placed in Hundred Flowers Holy Land since childhood, all to seize the Saintess position and help the Wu Tribe emerge into the world.

Jiang Lanzhi's sudden rise had disrupted those plans.

Bai Fengliu nodded in agreement. He looked at Hong Rushuang and noticed the wounds on her face hadn't healed.

Curious, he asked: "Rushuang, why hasn't your face healed? Did she use some dark technique that caused special damage?"

Hong Rushuang sneered: "No. I just don't want it to heal yet. Let the Three Great Wu Generals see what happened to me. I want her dead!"

Bai Fengliu understood—she was playing the victim. He stepped forward and wrapped an arm around her slender waist.

The servants nearby tactfully withdrew.

"Rushuang, I..." Bai Fengliu smiled suggestively.

"No. My Wu Tribe bloodline hasn't fully awakened. I can't lose my primal yin." Hong Rushuang pushed his hand away and stepped back.

Bai Fengliu's smile stiffened. He laughed awkwardly: "Very well."

Before either could say more, three powerful auras suddenly descended upon Hundred Flowers Holy Land without warning.

Hong Rushuang sensed them immediately, and her expression brightened. They're here!

She walked out calmly, ready for her moment in the spotlight.

Three Grand Ascension cultivators arriving unannounced—that was quite a statement.

The Three Great Wu Generals were cold-faced and imposing, their massive muscular frames evident even beneath their armor. All wore matching black battle armor, their icy gazes making observers shiver.

The Hundred Flowers Holy Land elders rushed out to surround the three.

"Gentlemen, you are...?"

"We're here to back the princess." One of the generals spoke flatly.

Princess? No one understood what he meant.

Until Hong Rushuang emerged, rose into the air, and landed before the three.

"Princess!"

The Three Great Wu Generals saluted in unison.

"Mm, you've arrived. Rise." She waved them up.

"As you command."

Everyone stared in shock. Princess?

"What's going on?"

"Hong Rushuang is a princess? What royal family has the surname Hong?"

"No idea. Maybe there is one? I've heard of someone named Red Boy."

"You don't know? Hong Rushuang's origins have always been mysterious. She was brought to Hundred Flowers Holy Land by a Grand Ascension cultivator. Having some background isn't surprising."

"There's more to this?"

A Hundred Flowers elder asked: "Rushuang, what is this?"

Hong Rushuang smiled: "Elder, they're people I invited. Don't worry."

"As you wish." The elders withdrew.

"Follow me." Hong Rushuang commanded.

"Yes." The three generals nodded and fell into step behind her, utterly obedient.

This caused an immediate uproar among the onlookers.

"Damn! I thought Jiang Lanzhi had won, but Hong Rushuang just summoned reinforcements. Impressive."

"Exactly. Supreme Mystery Holy Land brought three Grand Ascension elders, while the Shaman God Sect only had one. I thought they'd already lost. Now with three more, it's four against three."

The Three Great Wu Generals' arrival had completely shifted the balance.

Elsewhere, Jiang Lanzhi was also surprised by Hong Rushuang's formidable backing.

"What? Didn't your past-life memories include Hong Rushuang?" Xiao Fan asked.

He normally couldn't be bothered to check minor fortunes, but when a "princess" identity suddenly appeared, he immediately reviewed her script.

The identity wasn't simple at all—princess of the Witch-Yao King.

A Wu Tribe chess piece hidden within Hundred Flowers Holy Land, placed to seize the Holy Master position and help the Wu Tribe return to the world. Quite the elaborate scheme.

Jiang Lanzhi replied: "I have memories of her, but they're unclear. By then she had already left the Holy Land. Something about connections to the Wu Tribe."

"Did she become Saintess?"

"No." Jiang Lanzhi said.

If she didn't get it in the previous life, she wouldn't get it in this one either.

"Those three are dangerous. I can sense they're all body cultivators. Body cultivation is extremely difficult—reaching Grand Ascension is almost unheard of."

"Moreover, in same-level combat, if a body cultivator gets close, ordinary cultivators struggle to defend."

"But there are ways to counter them. I know several methods, though they'd require the three elders' cooperation." Jiang Lanzhi spoke seriously, drawing on her extensive experience.

But Xiao Fan waved dismissively: "No need for that."

"Xinxi, I'll leave this to you. Is that alright?" He turned to his maidservant.

"Whatever you say, Holy Son. I'll follow your orders." Xinxi nodded obediently.

Jiang Lanzhi glanced at Xinxi. She had always assumed she was just an ordinary servant. Apparently, she was a hidden expert.

"Xiao Fan, she..."

"Xinxi is very powerful. She could probably kill those three with a single breath."

Jiang Lanzhi's expression shifted. Not even ordinary immortals could do that. Clearly, Xinxi was no ordinary person.

"I'll follow your lead." Jiang Lanzhi agreed.

Xiao Fan hadn't wanted to deploy Xinxi, but the other side had broken the unspoken rules by calling in reinforcements.

So he wouldn't play nice either. Xinxi would simply crush them.

Suddenly, an angry voice rang out.

"Who did this to our tribe's princess? Come out now!"

"Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!"
