Chapter 134: A Paragon of the Righteous Holy Lands

Together they ascended to the clouds and rain's peak.

Jiang Lanzhi grew ever more alluring, stoking Xiao Fan's fire until he ruthlessly interrogated her. Saintess? Nothing more than a juicing machine.

Hiss! How could you bite people!

Xiao Fan departed Hundred Flowers Holy Land in high spirits.

"Holy Son, where did you get this mongrel? It's all black and kind of funny looking."

A Grand Ascension elder remarked.

Finding it amusing, he grabbed the little dog by the neck, examining it from all angles, poking its head.

The little dog seemed frightened, its whole body trembling.

"Don't do that. You're scaring the poor thing. What if it dies of fright?"

Another elder intervened, even conjuring a bone and offering it:

"Here, doggy, give it a try."

The Nether Hound kept trembling. Damn it, why is there a powerful cultivator next to Master?

Holy shit, feels even more terrifying than those monsters in hell.

It didn't know Xinxi's true power, but merely standing there, the Nether Hound felt like a grain of dust in the stellar sea compared to her—while she was the endless cosmos. A single glance from her could crush it.

Xinxi took the Nether Hound, holding it by the neck and setting it on the ground, smiling as she said: "Elders, please don't frighten the Holy Son's spirit pet. You're about to scare it out of its wits."

The elders smiled awkwardly. They didn't understand why the Holy Son would bring a little black dog, just found it curious.

Meanwhile, Xinxi transmitted to the Nether Hound, her voice cold and emotionless, utterly frigid: "Keep trembling and see if you can ever move again."

"Mercy, Senior! I'm just an ignorant little dog. If I've offended you in any way, please forgive me." The Nether Hound trembled, on the verge of kneeling to beg.

"I don't know how you wormed your way to the Holy Son's side, but the Holy Son seems quite fond of you. Don't disappoint his expectations. If I discover you mean him any harm, your dog head is gone."

These words frightened it so badly its head went crooked, and it immediately played dead on the ground.

Xiao Fan had no idea what had transpired.

At this moment, he was cultivating.

He hadn't worked hard in a long time. This time he went all out—using the Time-Space Scripture to accelerate time, madly devouring spirit stones, raising his cultivation while nourishing his giant elephant particles.

His cultivation rose steadily, seemingly on the verge of reaching mid Void Refining.

But it wasn't that fast. He estimated he'd need at least ten more days to break through to mid Void Refining.

Under the Time-Space Scripture's five-times time acceleration, only two days would pass outside.

Still two more days until he could level up? When would he get to enjoy leveling up once a day?

Probably a distant dream.

His God-Demon Physique was also growing rapidly—balanced between righteous and evil.

His Five Elements Spirit Body's properties grew ever more potent.

The two physiques combined seemed divine yet demonic, while the five elements circulated endlessly.

A hodgepodge? No—this was primordial chaos, the beginning of the journey from order to disorder, capable of embracing all things.

"You—who are you people? What are you doing?"

"Run! Run quickly!"

"These are demons! Hurry..."

Before the words finished, blades flashed, stones shattered the sky.

A sharp sword pierced the heavens, releasing a shrill metallic ring. Whoosh—a long arm flew through the air.

This was the territory of a small tribe called the Phantom Spirit Tribe—spirits that had taken form and gathered together as a community.

A minor tribe among the myriad spirits.

On this day, countless black shadows streaked across the sky, surrounding their tribe completely.

"What a weak tribe."

The black-robed man leading them spoke.

Then with a single slash, endless blade light swept down like wind scattering clouds, mercilessly reaping every Phantom Spirit Tribe life.

"We never provoked you. Who are you people?"

Among the Phantom Spirit Tribe, an elder spoke with his dying breath, his heart filled with grief.

Gone. All gone.

"Weakness is the original sin."

"Kill."

Merciless slaughter. The Phantom Spirit Tribe—exterminated!

"Wu General, this is the blood essence of a hundred million Phantom Spirit Tribe members. Collection complete."

"Move on to the next target."

"Yes."

The Flame Tribe—a community that lived near volcanoes and cultivated by absorbing fire-attribute spiritual energy—was likewise erased overnight without a trace.

The Wind Howl Tribe, the Green Wood Tribe, the Sand Tribe—these tribes that kept to their small corners, none of them powerful—suffered the same fate.

Overnight, countless small tribes were mercilessly wiped from the land.

The great races like Humans and Yao weren't spared either.

Some human cities on the frontier suffered the same massacre.

Without any warning.

Overnight, countless genocide cases occurred. A thick fog of mystery hung over everyone's heads—who was behind such slaughter?

Supreme Mystery Holy Land received the news. The Grand Elder assembled his people to discuss countermeasures.

The incident was so sudden that before they could react, the massacres had already happened. His mood was rather heavy.

The Grand Elder might be a bit of an old lecher in daily life, but when it came to serious matters, he didn't slack off at all.

As a righteous holy land of the human race, when such disasters occurred, they had to find the mastermind and make them pay in blood!

"Grand Elder."

In the Mysterious Pass Hall, the elders had none of their usual relaxed demeanor—all wore solemn expressions.

"Speak. What's the situation?" The Grand Elder asked.

"Grand Elder, the situation is dire."

"When we arrived, everyone there was dead. Their deaths were horrific—all desiccated corpses, completely drained of blood."

"Without exception, their purpose in killing was simple: to collect blood."

The Grand Elder fell silent for a long moment, then said:

"Is it the Blood Clan? Weren't those creatures driven away by us?"

Among the many races, the Blood Clan was also a relatively powerful group—not matching the three great races of Human, Yao, and Demon, but formidable nonetheless. They lived on blood, killing indiscriminately.

"No."

"Though the Blood Clan is savage, they wouldn't slaughter entire cities. And the Blood Clan prefers fresh blood, drinking on the spot. But in the massacred cities, we found blood-gathering formations. The mastermind is clearly collecting blood essence."

"Not only that, many weak tribes allied with us humans suffered the same fate. Currently, 1,083 tribes have been exterminated."

The Grand Elder said nothing, his mind churning, seeking any clue.

Who could it be? What use was collecting so much blood essence?

Soon, an elder rushed in.

"Grand Elder, we've identified the situation."

"Speak."

"We found a corpse in one of the cities. We immediately sent it to the Holy Land's Corpse Examination Pavilion. The pavilion elder just sent word—that corpse is of Wu Tribe origin. Look."

He handed a jade slip to the Grand Elder.

The Grand Elder's expression changed.

As the leader of a major power, he naturally knew certain secrets unknown to others.

The Wu Tribe!

So it was those creatures.

Wait!

In the primordial era, the Wu Tribe had also collected blood essence like this.

Back then they were powerful, and other races could only suffer their oppression with no means to resist.

And when they collected blood essence, it was for sacrifice—the most heaven-defying ritual: the Myriad Spirits Blood Sacrifice!

It all made sense now.

"Those Wu Tribe bastards. Back then we didn't exterminate every last one, and they went into hiding. Now they dare emerge to plague the world."

"Have you found their trail?"

"Yes. They're heading west, about to reach West Talisman Prefecture."

"West Talisman Prefecture. That place has a major teleportation array, right?"

"Correct."

"Good. Youxu, you lead the team. I'll give you ten Grand Ascension cultivators, thirty Body Integration cultivators, one hundred Void Refining cultivators, eight hundred stewards, and ten thousand Nascent Soul core disciples."

"Your mission is to slaughter every last Wu Tribe member. Leave none alive." The Grand Elder addressed Elder Youxu in the hall.

Elder Youxu—the Grand Elder's junior brother—was equally powerful as a Grand Ascension elder and despised demonic evil above all.

Elder Youxu said: "Rest assured, Senior Brother. I won't disappoint you."

Hearing this lineup, some elders raised their eyebrows. Wasn't this a bit extravagant?

"Grand Elder, is such a large force really necessary?"

The Grand Elder glanced at that elder and said solemnly:

"You're all too young. When eliminating evil, be thorough. If we can find the Wu Tribe's lair, I'll personally go destroy it—leaving none alive!"

As he spoke, his voice carried threads of cold killing intent. Everyone present understood the Grand Elder's determination.

To encourage the disciples' enthusiasm for vanquishing evil, the Grand Elder also issued a new decree:

[Recently, the Wu Tribe has been plaguing the world, invading our human territories' frontiers. Our frontier humans are suffering Wu Tribe massacre—the situation is critical.]

[This decree hereby states: Any member of Supreme Mystery Holy Land who slays Wu Tribe members shall earn contribution points. The more Wu Tribe killed and the higher their cultivation, the more points earned.]

[Our Supreme Mystery Holy Land is a righteous holy land of the human race. Having received support from humans across the world, we naturally must do our part to protect all humans.]

[I won't mince words—I'll give you directly what you want. Recently, over a dozen noble families have sought marriage alliances with our Holy Land, all noble daughters wishing to marry into our ranks.

I'll say it here: whoever earns the most contribution points from slaughtering Wu Tribe will be our Holy Land's representative for these marriage alliances. Your status in the Holy Land will increase, and your children can even come to the Holy Land to study cultivation techniques.]

The Grand Elder understood human nature deeply.

Did appeals to righteousness work? Somewhat, but not much.

For matters like this, rewards were needed—visible, tangible rewards. Like these marriage alliances, which were excellent incentives.

"Holy shit, vanquishing evil shouldn't happen without me! Everyone, don't fight for it—this is dangerous business you can't handle. Let me do it. I'm not afraid of death."

"You call that vanquishing evil? I'm too embarrassed to call you out!"

"I heard the Jiang family's daughter is as beautiful as flowers, her smile captivating cities. That day I accidentally caught a glimpse of her and haven't been able to forget her since."

"Is that why you've been praying for guidance every day?"

"Damn, you bunch of old lechers—can't you be more proper like me?" One righteous-looking disciple said disdainfully.

Then he turned to the disciple issuing the order, face full of smiles: "Fellow disciple, might I ask—is the Wind Star City Lord's daughter among them?"

"She is. Both daughters—they're twins."

"Good! I too must vanquish evil!"

Such were Supreme Mystery Holy Land's disciples. Each and every one a righteous person, scrambling to register for the Wu Tribe extermination force.

Within half a day, the quota of ten thousand Nascent Soul core disciples was filled—and exceeded by eight thousand.

Clearly, vanquishing evil was the behavioral code of every Supreme Mystery disciple!

When Xiao Fan returned to the Holy Land, the first thing he noticed was the neatly arrayed forces. He was somewhat puzzled.

Were they going to war?
