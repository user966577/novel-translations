Chapter 119: Jiang Lanzhi vs. Hong Rushuang

Xiao Fan hadn't done a thing, yet he'd raked in 88,888 villain points. Thanks, Fei Yangyang—you died where you... well, you died where you deserved to die.

With the Fortune-Plundering Sword in play, he didn't need to worry about Fei Yangyang making some miraculous comeback.

"Simps don't deserve to be children of destiny!"

Turning his attention back to the arena, Jiang Lanzhi had won every single match flawlessly.

Any disciple who faced her—as long as they weren't too aggressive—she would gently toss off the platform.

Her ranking climbed steadily.

Top sixty-four.

Top thirty-two.

Top sixteen.

Top eight.

The strongest female disciple present was merely at Nascent Soul late stage. Soul Transformation cultivators and above served as stewards and elders and couldn't participate.

With her strength—capable of killing a Body Integration cultivator with a single punch—no disciple could stand in her way!

"Senior Sister Lanzhi is so strong!"

"I don't think anyone has lasted more than one move against her."

"We still don't know how powerful she really is."

"How terrifying. No wonder Senior Sister Lanzhi won the Holy Son's heart—she's too talented."

The female disciples of Hundred Flowers Holy Land marveled at Jiang Lanzhi's overwhelming strength. She was practically invincible.

Even disciples from previous generations felt inferior.

Some were happy; others, worried.

Jiang Lanzhi's heaven-defying abilities weighed heavily on Hong Rushuang's mind.

Because her semifinal opponent was none other than Jiang Lanzhi.

"Such incredible strength. Even if I go all out, I only have a thirty percent chance of winning!"

Hong Rushuang's gaze toward Jiang Lanzhi was always laced with deep hostility, wishing she could stomp her rival beneath her feet.

She had once been Hundred Flowers Holy Land's pride—brilliant and celebrated, with everyone living in her shadow.

But one person had broken through, overshadowing her completely. That person was Jiang Lanzhi.

In her drive to become stronger quickly, Jiang Lanzhi had shattered record after record. Every ranking in Hundred Flowers Holy Land had fallen to her.

And she dominated them effortlessly—claiming the top spot on her first attempt every time. The Best Rising Star ranking, the Same-Stage Combat Power ranking, even the prestigious Hundred Flowers Beauty ranking—Jiang Lanzhi held first place in them all!

She was like a goddess descended from heaven, sweeping every leaderboard in Hundred Flowers Holy Land. An instant number one across the board!

And second place was Hong Rushuang.

Hong Rushuang couldn't accept it. She challenged Jiang Lanzhi to a duel, determined to prove to everyone that she, Hong Rushuang, was the true prodigy of Hundred Flowers Holy Land!

Jiang Lanzhi accepted. They fought on the arena, and neither could gain a decisive advantage.

But at the time, Jiang Lanzhi was only at Golden Core late stage while Hong Rushuang was at Nascent Soul mid-stage.

Jiang Lanzhi knew her momentum was too fierce. She wanted to hold back, pretend to lose narrowly. But Hong Rushuang pressed relentlessly, throwing killing blow after killing blow.

Finally, Jiang Lanzhi lost her patience and slapped her flying with a single strike. Hong Rushuang didn't recover for days.

She had planned to play weak and concede, but Hong Rushuang hadn't known when to quit. So she had no choice but to cart her off.

After that, everyone understood: Jiang Lanzhi had defeated Hong Rushuang with a single blow—a Golden Core cultivator beating a Nascent Soul cultivator. The gap in their abilities was plain as day!

From that day on, Hong Rushuang's reputation as a genius was forever tarnished.

She had become Jiang Lanzhi's stepping stone.

Losers don't deserve to be remembered.

Later, Jiang Lanzhi returned home—apparently to get engaged to the Xiao family's young master. When this news arrived, it struck Hong Rushuang like a hammer blow.

Stronger than me, and engaged to a great family's heir on top of it. Her mind began to twist.

Especially when Xiao Fan publicly declared that no one but Jiang Lanzhi could become Saintess—her composure shattered completely.

No matter what, she had to bring Jiang Lanzhi down. No matter what!

On the arena, a female elder serving as referee took the stage. Her hair pinned up elegantly, she wore a faint smile as her voice carried through spiritual power:

"After intense competition, we've reached the semifinals."

"Let us welcome Jiang Lanzhi and Hong Rushuang—two of our Holy Land's finest prodigies—to show us an exciting match."

She withdrew immediately after speaking, not lingering for a moment.

Everyone had been eagerly awaiting this bout.

Especially the disciples of Hundred Flowers Holy Land—this match would determine who was truly number one.

"Last time, Senior Sister Lanzhi beat Senior Sister Rushuang. The result shouldn't be much different this time."

"Not necessarily. Three months ago, Senior Sister Rushuang broke through to Nascent Soul late stage and awakened her physique. The outcome isn't certain."

"That's wrong. Senior Sister Lanzhi was only at Golden Core last time—now she's at Nascent Soul. Her growth is greater than Senior Sister Rushuang's. I think Senior Sister Lanzhi is still stronger."

"Their last fight was private—no magical treasures, just pure technique. It only showed that Senior Sister Lanzhi's mastery of techniques is superior."

"True, but this match includes treasures, combat experience, tactical decisions, even strategy. It's a comprehensive test. Senior Sister Rushuang has the advantage there."

The two combatants had already taken their positions.

Though Hong Rushuang felt the weight of pressure, she maintained a light smile, projecting an air of confidence.

"Junior Sister Lanzhi, you won't be so lucky this time."

Jiang Lanzhi's eyes were calm as still water. Honestly, she hadn't wanted to provoke this woman.

After all, having lived through a previous life, her journey far exceeded Hong Rushuang's. To Jiang Lanzhi, Hong Rushuang was nothing but a minor footnote—not worth mentioning.

"Mm, can we begin?" Jiang Lanzhi asked flatly.

This air of absolute confidence instantly shattered Hong Rushuang's composure. Again with that attitude! What gave her the right to be so sure she'd win!

"Hmph. I hope you can stay this calm later." Hong Rushuang sneered.

With that, she rose into the air, looking down from above.

Her waterfall of long hair swayed without wind.

She swept her right hand out, and her crimson robes gradually darkened to black. Her entire demeanor turned cold and fierce, like a hell demon descended upon the world.

Black battle armor wrapped tightly around her lithe form, accentuating her curves. The dark glow spread upward, encasing even her head in a black helmet.

An aura of invincibility radiated from Hong Rushuang.

"Huh? What's going on? She's stacking armor before the fight even starts?"

"That black battle armor looks strange."

"I've seen it before. That's the Shaman God Sect's signature Dark Radiance Battle Armor. Its defensive power is incredible—wearing it dramatically enhances the cultivator's physical body."

"Right, the Shaman God Sect's rapid rise owes much to this armor."

Bai Fengliu watched Hong Rushuang in her full armor, domineering and magnificent, with satisfaction.

He had specially prepared this Dark Radiance Battle Armor for her—precisely to showcase its power to the world.

With so many factions gathered here, no venue could be better for demonstrating the armor. As long as it performed impressively in this competition, he could use it as a selling point across the cultivation world.

Difficult times require creative solutions. To expand, the Shaman God Sect needed funds—land, pills, materials all required spirit stones. Spirit stones were what they needed most!

During this era of peace, they couldn't start wars with other human factions. That's why they had attacked the yao race instead, seizing their territory.

But constant warfare wasn't sustainable. Though they had built their reputation fighting the yao race, they had also lost many elders and disciples.

They needed a new strategy—like selling rare treasures. The Dark Radiance Battle Armor was the perfect product.

In other words, this was a product showcase.

Hong Rushuang understood Bai Fengliu's plan and was happy to cooperate.

"This is high-grade Dark Radiance Battle Armor! Even a Void Refining cultivator can't breach its defense. Among treasures, it's top-tier! Only a Dao artifact could break through!"

"More than that—it also enhances my physical strength, giving me a body comparable to a yao beast's!" Hong Rushuang announced loudly, like a saleswoman.

Several faction representatives' eyes lit up at this.

A Nascent Soul late-stage cultivator wearing this could block a Void Refining attack? Was that even possible?

If true, this was huge.

Someone immediately asked: "Young Master Bai, is this Dark Radiance Battle Armor really that powerful?"

Business opportunity!

Bai Fengliu smiled: "Let me put it this way—this high-grade Dark Radiance Battle Armor has defensive power comparable to a supreme-grade treasure. A Void Refining cultivator's attack will lose ninety-nine percent of its force against it, and the remaining fraction gets reflected back."

"Better yet, the spirit stones needed to buy one supreme-grade treasure could buy five sets of Dark Radiance Battle Armor. The main selling point is affordability and practicality."

Bai Fengliu spoke with confidence: "I won't say more. Watch carefully, everyone. See for yourselves."

"If you're interested, come find me afterward. I'll give you a good price."

His words drew everyone's attention to the arena, eager to see if the armor was really as miraculous as he claimed.

Bai Fengliu's goal had been achieved!

Xiao Fan also returned to the arena, watching the two women face off—particularly the black-armored Hong Rushuang. He was somewhat puzzled.

"What's going on with her?" he asked.

"Holy Son, that's some kind of Dark Radiance Battle Armor. Supposedly it can block attacks from Void Refining cultivators. It's absurd." One of the Hundred Flowers disciples explained.

"Yeah! Senior Sister Lanzhi is strong, but only compared to cultivators at her level. With that kind of defense, it's basically cheating—winning without honor!"

Ha! She thinks putting on a turtle shell makes her invincible?

Xiao Fan smirked. That black shell might work against ordinary people, but against Jiang Lanzhi? That turtle shell was about to get smashed.

"Holy Son, aren't you worried?"

"Not really. I'm more worried Lanzhi might use too much force and hurt a fellow disciple."

On the arena, Hong Rushuang stood proudly, as if victory was already hers.

You can't even break my defense. What are you going to fight me with?

"Well? Aren't you going to bring out some treasure?" Hong Rushuang sneered.

Jiang Lanzhi shook her head: "I gave you time only to let you embarrass yourself longer."

"After all, the higher they rise, the harder they fall."

Hong Rushuang's expression turned icy. That smug, confident attitude disgusted her!

Hong Rushuang began channeling her power. Wings of spiritual energy materialized on her back.

Energy wings! Wait, wrong scene—spiritual energy wings.

She dove down at tremendous speed.

All eyes were on the arena. Jiang Lanzhi clenched her jade fist. Against others, she might show mercy.

But Bai Fengliu and Hong Rushuang were thoroughly annoying.

So she wouldn't hold back.

An ordinary punch!

A tremendous collision echoed, followed by a heart-wrenching scream.

"It hurts! It hurts so much!"

A bloody black figure flew through the air, landing outside the arena like a large black rat.

Bai Fengliu had been confident: "Look! This is the power of the Dark Radiance—"

But when he saw that crumpled heap on the ground, the rest of his words caught in his throat.

This...
