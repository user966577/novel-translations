Chapter 133: Blood of the Wu God—The Immortal in the Painting

In the Dark Abyss, the man and woman sat in the high seats of the great hall.

Below them, the Seven Supreme Lords of the mortal realm's Wu Tribe—led by the Witch-Yao King—stood respectfully, ramrod straight, motionless.

"Honored emissaries, since the primordial era when our Wu Tribe declined along with the immortal path, we've never had a chance to rise again."

"Fortunately, heaven took pity on us, allowing us to contact the immortal Wu Tribe above. We beseech the two divine emissaries to help our Wu Tribe dominate heaven and earth once more."

The Seven Wu Tribe Supreme Lords spoke one after another, their tones respectful, like mortals praying to gods and buddhas.

The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden remained stone-faced, her calm gaze sweeping over the assembled Supreme Lords. Inside, she was utterly disappointed.

Born as rulers of heaven and earth—a god-tier starting hand—and you played it into this? Truly a disgrace to the Wu Tribe.

However, thinking that she still needed to use these people, she restrained herself somewhat.

But the Wu Tribe Divine Son who'd come with her sneered coldly:

"And you wastes have the nerve to speak? Stubbornly clinging to your ways, lacking all ambition—your current predicament is entirely your own fault."

As he spoke, his fierce aura exploded outward.

Though only at Body Integration realm, his presence firmly suppressed the Seven Supreme Lords of the mortal realm's Wu Tribe.

This overwhelming power made everyone's hearts tremble. Was this the might of cultivators from the upper realm?

So strong!

The Seven Supreme Lords' hair stood on end. These two were merely the Divine Son and Divine Maiden—the attendants escorting them were even more powerful.

Their auras were at a higher level, probably immortals.

Any random one could hang them up and beat them senseless.

The Wu Tribe Divine Son restrained his aura and switched to a kindly expression, like a completely different person.

"However, since you carry Wu Tribe blood, you naturally can't be allowed to remain inferior."

"I've descended this time under orders from our ancestral elders to revitalize our Wu Tribe."

"After all, if none of you ascend, others might think our Wu Tribe can't produce anyone worthy of ascending." He spoke in a lofty tone, as if bestowing a favor.

The Seven Wu Tribe Supreme Lords didn't dare object, only lowering their heads in agreement.

"We beseech the two divine emissaries to help our Wu Tribe."

"Of course." The Wu Tribe Divine Son said.

Then he produced seven blood-colored stone tablets.

Each was engraved with strange patterns—monstrous beasts with gaping maws, turbulent oceans, and nameless abysses like black whirlpools, bottomless.

Each tablet was infused with the unique aura of the Wu Tribe. A single glance would reduce the clarity in one's eyes by three parts.

Soul-captivating!

The Seven Wu Tribe Supreme Lords looked once and were instantly drawn in.

Fortunately, their cultivation was deep, and they didn't remain lost for long.

"Divine Son, what are these?"

The Wu Tribe Divine Son smiled lightly:

"These are called Wu God Tablets—divine artifacts refined by our Wu Tribe's ancestral elder for bloodline transformation."

"Take one tablet each back to your territories. On the night of the full moon when stars fill the sky, perform the sacrificial rites. Our progenitor will bestow the Wu Tribe divine bloodline through these tablets to help you transform."

He spoke beautifully, even invoking the name of the Wu Tribe progenitor.

The Seven Supreme Lords suspected nothing. In fact, from the moment these tablets first appeared, they could no longer generate any suspicion.

Seeds had already been planted in their subconscious.

That brief moment of confusion followed by restored awareness was merely a trick.

The Witch-Yao King said excitedly: "Divine Son, can these truly help our tribe transform?"

The Wu Tribe Divine Son said coldly: "Hmph, would I deceive you?"

"We wouldn't dare. Forgive us, Divine Son."

The Seven Supreme Lords spoke softly, their tones revealing pleasant surprise.

The ancestral elders above were so kind! No blood relation, yet helping us so much—truly good people!

"Now that you understand, hurry along. In half a month, the full moon night will be the perfect time for the sacrifice. You still remember the most primal Wu Tribe sacrificial rites, yes?"

"We do."

The Seven Wu Tribe Supreme Lords nodded.

The most primal Wu Tribe sacrificial rite: Blood Sacrifice.

Not just any blood sacrifice—it had to be a Myriad Spirits Blood Sacrifice!

Gathering the blood of myriad races into a sea of blood, burning incense in prayer, reaching toward the heavens, using the blood essence of all races as a medium. To achieve the proper effect, each type of creature needed to number 99,990,000, and for yin-yang harmony, males and females had to be captured in pairs.

This was the Myriad Spirits Blood Sacrifice—an affront to heaven's principles.

When the Wu Tribe was powerful, the Myriad Spirits Blood Sacrifice was extremely prevalent.

All races under heaven had long suffered under the Wu Tribe—this was precisely why Human, Yao, and Demon had united to exterminate them.

A common enemy!

"Then why aren't you moving?" The Wu Tribe Divine Son said.

"As you command."

With that, the Seven Wu Tribe Supreme Lords each took a Wu God Tablet and departed in high spirits.

Little did they know that what awaited them was disaster.

After the Seven Wu Tribe Supreme Lords left, the Wu Tribe Divine Son sneered: "A bunch of ants, truly a disgrace to our Wu Tribe's reputation."

"Still thinking heaven would drop gifts on them. Naive!"

"Races that only know to pray for heaven's protection don't deserve to exist in this world." The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden, who had been silent all along, finally spoke.

Neither sorrowful nor joyful, her tone held not a shred of sympathy.

She addressed the attendants behind her:

"How long have we been out? How many drops of Wu God Blood have we collected in total?"

"Replying to the Divine Maiden, eighty years ago, when our Wu Tribe prophet made the prophecy that a great calamity would befall our tribe, we descended to collect Wu God Blood."

"We've traveled through 782 mortal realms. Several Wu God realms saw through our schemes and didn't sacrifice to the Wu God Tablets, so we couldn't refine them. To date, we've only collected 723 drops of Wu God Blood."

The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden frowned. So few?

"Hopefully we'll make it in time," she said.

All Wu Tribe members were descendants of the Wu God. In other words, every Wu Tribe member carried Wu God Blood in their veins.

As time passed, the Wu God Blood in later generations became increasingly diluted. Some even intermarried with other races, mixing in other bloodlines.

Now, even in the immortal realm, there were no pure-blooded Wu Tribe members.

Their purpose in coming was to use the mortal realm's Wu Tribe as raw material—extracting and refining Wu God Blood.

This Wu God Blood would be used to create pure-blooded Wu Tribe members. Only pure Wu Tribe could unlock the treasures left by the Wu God, or even achieve bloodline reversion to become true Wu Gods.

According to the Wu Tribe prophet's prediction, only a Wu God could lead the Wu Tribe through their extinction crisis.

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. We'll definitely collect enough Wu God Blood and welcome the Wu God."

The Wu Tribe Divine Son smiled.

However, the Divine Maiden ignored him, silently leaving the hall.

He wanted to reach out and call her back, but thought better of it—best to let things take their natural course. As long as he persisted, she would surely come to understand his true feelings!

Within the Wu Tribe Divine Son's sea of consciousness, a hazy figure drifted.

Seeing the Divine Son's clumsy pursuit techniques, the figure sighed internally. Even dogs would shake their heads at this.

He couldn't help but say:

"Kid, you're too timid. What's with all this hesitation? If you like her, pursue her. Hiding and hedging—what kind of skill is that? You don't even dare speak up."

"You don't understand. What I'm pursuing is heart-to-heart communication, that feeling of perfect understanding without words. Do you get it?"

"Fool. I think that girl was right—you should have your dick chopped off."

"Let's not discuss this. Senior, do you really think there's a secret cache left by the Wu God in this realm?"

"Hehe, would I deceive you? Back in the day, I was the Grand Protector at the Wu God's side. I know everything about the Wu God."

"Please help me, Senior."

"Of course. You bear the Wu God's mark—you're the chosen one. I will naturally assist you."

After reaching an agreement with the soul shadow in his sea of consciousness, the Wu Tribe Divine Son left the Dark Abyss alone.

Meanwhile, the Wu Tribe Divine Maiden returned to her chambers.

With her disguise removed, she no longer bore any trace of coldness. From the flowing silk sleeves of her magnificent robes, she drew out a painting and eagerly unrolled the scroll.

When she saw the woman in the painting, her eyes involuntarily took on a dreamy look.

The painting contained a breathtakingly beautiful woman—delicate brows, charming smile, beautiful eyes full of longing, bright eyes and white teeth revealing threads of absolute beauty, dignified yet noble.

The woman in the painting bore a striking resemblance to the Wu Tribe Divine Maiden. The only difference was that the painted woman was more serene, her gaze clearer.

Yes, the painted woman's eyes were clear.

While the Wu Tribe Divine Maiden's eyes burned with desire. The contrast was extreme.

"Sister, how much longer before you can come out?"

She spoke coyly, wishing she could immediately rush into the painting to reunite with her sister—to cuddle, to embrace. Just thinking of those embarrassing scenes made her jade legs go rigid.

As long as I have my sister, I need nothing else.

"Hard to say. Could be a year or half a year, could be thirty to fifty years. Once I've fully comprehended the Immortal in the Painting legacy, I'll come out."

"Sister, I..."

"I miss you a little." She said sweetly.

The painted woman felt somewhat helpless. Her little sister was too clingy, and even... sigh.

"Enough talk. I'm at a critical juncture in receiving the legacy."

With those words, the woman in the painting vanished.

Only the Wu Tribe Divine Maiden remained, gazing lovingly at the scroll, a besotted smile on her face.

While the Wu Tribe members were descending to the mortal realm, the Hundred Flowers Saintess trials also concluded.

Without any surprises, Jiang Lanzhi won first place and became Saintess.

Xiao Fan felt somewhat emotional. Among the women he'd deeply connected with, Su Yiyun and Ji Qingxue were both Saintesses, and now Jiang Lanzhi had become one too.

Three Saintesses. As everyone knew, "Saintess" meant female. Put the three together—did that count as the "Three Holy Mothers"?

"What are you thinking about?" The moment Jiang Lanzhi finished her trial, she rushed out and took Xiao Fan's arm.

The other Hundred Flowers female disciples watched with envy. Sigh, no chance now. Senior Sister Lanzhi was already the Holy Son's fiancée, and now she's become Saintess too. They're truly a perfect match.

Xiao Fan smiled: "Nothing. Just thinking about some happy things."

Group gameplay was indeed more fun than solo. He preferred one-versus-many.

"By the way, there's still some time between now and the Saintess coronation. Would you... like to stay at my place for a couple days?" Jiang Lanzhi's cheeks flushed, her beautiful eyes full of spring emotion, seeming to hold infinite passion.

Little minx. Damn, you're playing with fire!

"Sure, I'll stay a few extra days."
