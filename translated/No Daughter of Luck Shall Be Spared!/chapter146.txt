Chapter 146: I Don't Know How, But I Can Learn

Li Yuxian looked completely confused. Xiao Fan hadn't told her about this beforehand!

Besides, he was acting completely out of character. Usually a refined gentleman, today he was utterly lecherous. He must have his own plans.

Xiao Fan walked into the thatched cottage. Step by step, he approached, lightly hooking Li Yuxian's waist and pulling her soft, tender form firmly against him.

Under Li Yutong's stunned and furious gaze, Xiao Fan's other hand lifted Li Yuxian's jade-white chin, turning her face toward him.

Their eyes met. Li Yuxian was bewildered, with no idea what Xiao Fan was thinking.

Xiao Fan simply gazed at her, eyes filled with deep affection. He slowly lowered his head, aiming for those luscious red lips.

Li Yuxian let out a soft sound, instinctively extending her tongue. But she immediately came to her senses—no, my sister's still here.

She quickly resisted, pushing Xiao Fan away. Without anger, just complaint: "What are you doing!"

Xiao Fan was pushed back. He showed no annoyance, only licking the corner of his mouth as if savoring the taste, making Li Yuxian blush with embarrassment.

"Don't resist. This was the condition for me agreeing to save your sister." Xiao Fan chuckled.

"Need me to remind you of the terms you agreed to?" With that, he tossed Li Yuxian a jade slip.

Li Yutong was too stunned to speak. The extreme pain of grief wasn't loud crying—it was being unable to say a word.

After a long while, she finally managed to say, voice trembling:

"Sister, you—is he threatening you? What terms did you agree to?"

In her heart, countless thoughts flashed by. Her sister couldn't possibly betray her. He must have threatened her somehow.

Yes, that must be it. Otherwise, why would he say things like "the conditions you agreed to" and "deal"?

Li Yuxian accepted the jade slip and probed it with her divine sense.

She immediately understood.

[Don't be afraid. I'm here.]

[Didn't you say you dote on your sister most? Seeing how she treats you, I really can't stand it. Say nothing, just cooperate with me. I'll establish your image as a sister who sold herself to save her sibling—make her feel guilty.]

[Besides, she's a woman—your sister—but that's still no excuse. Anyone who dares to grope my wife, even your sister, I can't tolerate. I'm going to get even with her. Don't stop me!]

[And I must straighten her out. That's your wish. I've always remembered it. Your wish is my wish.]

[Desperate illness calls for drastic medicine. My methods of straightening her out might be a bit forceful, maybe even contrary to ethics. But my heart belongs only to you. Trust me. I'm very pure.

Besides, your sister is my sister too. I can't bear to watch her go astray and make you sad and worried. Let me be the villain.]

"This..." Li Yuxian stared at these words, dazed. You want to play the villain?

"If you won't agree, then I'll kill her." Xiao Fan threatened coldly.

At the same time, he moved close to Li Yuxian, whispering in her ear like a villain threatening a young maiden.

"Yuxian, forgive me for being so abrupt. I really couldn't stand it anymore. I'll always remember your image as a gentle older sister. I'll help you maintain it." He transmitted secretly, then planted a light kiss on her flushed cheek.

"Mm." Li Yuxian nodded shyly.

He's thinking of me. Shouldn't I cooperate with him?

Threats! Blatant threats! That was Li Yutong's impression.

Li Yutong understood the situation now: This bastard was using her life to threaten her sister. Her sister chose to sacrifice herself so she could survive.

Yes, that must be it. Otherwise, why would he talk about conditions and deals?

"I..."

Her chest felt so tight she couldn't speak. The pain of betrayal vanished, replaced by sympathy for her sister's tragic fate.

And guilt for having misunderstood her sister, treating her with cold hostility.

Yes, how could her sister possibly betray her? There must be something behind this.

How could I not understand the situation before lashing out at her? I, Li Yutong... two lines of tears streamed down her face.

She was filled with guilt and unease, her voice aching with heartbreak: "Sister, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I just care about you too much."

"Bastard, what exactly did you make my sister promise? Tell me!" She snarled at Xiao Fan.

Li Yuxian wanted to speak, to ask Xiao Fan not to be so hard on her sister. But then again, he had a point. Desperate illness called for drastic medicine.

But all of this, in Li Yutong's eyes, became her sister enduring humiliation, selling herself to the devil to protect her.

Thinking of this, her heart ached even more. Her remorse toward her sister deepened. "Sister, I'm sorry. Your little sister misunderstood you."

Li Yuxian knew her acting was poor. If she stayed any longer, she'd give herself away. She pushed Xiao Fan off and walked out of the thatched cottage.

The room now held only Xiao Fan and Li Yutong.

Watching Li Yuxian flee without a word, Li Yutong understood—her sister didn't want to be groped by this man in front of her. She'd always loved her.

Xiao Fan sat down at the bedside, casually taking Li Yutong's delicate hand, regarding her with a half-smile.

Li Yutong's heart lurched with an unfamiliar feeling. She'd never touched a man before. She only liked her sister. Xiao Fan's move startled her, and she immediately tried to pull her hand back.

But Xiao Fan's next words made her freeze.

"Don't try to resist. Otherwise, I can't guarantee your sister's safety."

"You!"

Li Yutong glared at him, eyes full of fury. If she hadn't fallen into his hands, how would things have come to this!

Wait—she could use her sister's life to threaten him back. After all, he didn't know the truth.

"Don't think about tricks either. I dared come here because I'm not afraid of your schemes. Go ahead and try. Succeed, and you escape. Fail, and I can only say your sister is finished."

Xiao Fan of course knew that in her eyes, he was someone she could easily crush.

To prevent her resistance, it was better to threaten her with something.

Sure enough, the moment those words left his mouth, she immediately became obedient.

"You—Supreme Mystery Holy Land in the upper realm is at least a righteous holy land. How can they have scum like you? You call yourself worthy of being a Holy Son?" She cursed, seething.

Li Yutong didn't dare gamble. She'd already hurt her sister once. She couldn't let her sister be hurt again.

Watching Li Yutong want to hit him yet hold back, not daring to act, Xiao Fan felt he really was too wicked.

"Aren't you curious what conditions your sister agreed to?" Xiao Fan said.

Li Yutong had already guessed. It was nothing more than carnal matters. This guy was a demon of lust. His smile was too lecherous. What else could it be?

"Hmph. Just say it directly. What will it take for you to let my sister go?" Li Yutong said coldly.

She wasn't about to show any kindness to someone who'd harmed her sister.

Xiao Fan clicked his tongue in admiration, unabashedly scanning her pretty face and graceful figure. Worthy of being twins—even their proportions were nearly identical.

The only difference was their temperament.

The older sister Li Yuxian was cultured and well-mannered, the very picture of a noble lady. The younger sister Li Yutong exuded cold beauty and indifference—the aloof ice queen type.

"Let her go? That won't do."

"She agreed to become my woman in exchange for your life. How could I let her slip away?"

Xiao Fan chuckled. He reached out to lift her chin, thumb brushing against her red lips—soft as warm jade. Truly perverted.

Li Yutong turned her head away. Her disgust was unconcealed.

"Quite the personality." Xiao Fan laughed.

"Either you stay and she goes, or she stays and you go. You're twins anyway—it's about the same for me. It just depends on whether you're willing to sacrifice for her, or she's willing to sacrifice for you."

Xiao Fan chuckled. "I'll give you the choice."

No need to think. For Li Yuxian, Li Yutong would even give her life. As long as her sister could live, that was enough.

Her voice trembled, nearly sobbing, as she spoke these words: "I'll stay with you. Let my sister leave."

Xiao Fan shook his head. "Anyone can make promises. What if your sister leaves and you immediately kill yourself? Would I be left with nothing?"

"Show me through your actions."

Xiao Fan smiled as he spoke. But in Li Yutong's eyes, that smile was more terrifying than any demon crawling out of hell.

"I... I..."

Li Yutong hesitated briefly, but soon steeled her resolve.

"As long as sister is free. As long as sister can be free." Tears glistened in her beautiful eyes as she extended her delicate hands to hook around Xiao Fan's neck.

Eyes closed, red lips slightly parted and trembling, she moved toward Xiao Fan for a kiss.

Seeing her abandon resistance, Xiao Fan couldn't help but sigh. Having a weakness really did make someone easy to manipulate.

He forcefully pried open Li Yutong's teeth. Li Yutong tried to resist, but Xiao Fan only said: "If you don't want to, you're free to leave. Just let your sister stay instead."

"No. I'm just... inexperienced. I can learn." She said firmly.

Xiao Fan's manipulation technique was perfected to mastery.

Captured, forced to take initiative, then further manipulation of her weakness—she had no choice but to be proactive.

Not only that, she had to appear enthusiastic, showing she was trying hard to learn.

"Mm. Not bad."

Xiao Fan enjoyed Li Yutong's inexperienced tongue, doing as he pleased, rampaging through her mouth, grazing against her pearly teeth and warmth.

Li Yutong was terrified of displeasing him. She had to perform well so her sister could gain freedom. She was giving it her all to satisfy Xiao Fan.

Xiao Fan could feel her sincerity. He held her soft, slender waist, gently stroking her back. This made her body stiffen slightly, her heart burning. This strange sensation was completely new to her.

She was inexperienced yet eager, stiff and clumsy as she responded to him.

Xiao Fan thoroughly enjoyed teasing her. Like training a pet. Li Yutong's breathing grew more rapid, her breath fragrant as orchids. The refreshing scent sprayed against his face, drilling into his heart, making his desire burn fiercely.

Li Yutong couldn't hold on any longer. She pushed him away, gasping heavily. Her beautiful eyes were hazy with confusion—a normal physiological response that left her flushed.

"You're very dedicated, but I don't think your efforts are satisfying me." Xiao Fan continued with his half-smile. "Your sister was better."

"No. I'm better than my sister. You're not allowed to touch her." With that, afraid he might change his mind, she directly stripped him bare.

But that was as far as she got.

She'd never seen these things before. She was at a complete loss, even turning her head away, not daring to look.

Veteran actor "Phoenix and Dragon" takes the stage. Xiao Fan lay down, letting her handle the practical work.

Xiao Fan: "Show me what you've got."

Li Yutong: "I'll learn quickly."
