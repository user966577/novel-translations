Chapter 121: What Are You Barking About? Killing a Grand Ascension Cultivator

The sudden roar of fury left Xiao Fan somewhat baffled.

But when he heard "princess," he knew exactly who was throwing a tantrum.

Before Hundred Flowers Holy Land could respond, Xiao Fan took Jiang Lanzhi's hand and stepped forward.

The three Wu Tribe cultivators stood with their hands behind their backs, hovering in mid-air. Their cold gazes were fixed on Supreme Mystery Holy Land's position, burning with fury.

If not for the three Supreme Mystery elders standing guard outside, the Wu Generals would have charged in to demand an explanation.

Hong Rushuang hung back, watching events unfold without a word.

Now, with the balance of power in her favor...

When she saw Xiao Fan holding Jiang Lanzhi's hand, her expression darkened. Especially seeing Xiao Fan's devastatingly handsome face—her anger flared.

Why did her fiancé have to be better-looking than mine? Why!

"Was it you?"

The voice carried crushing pressure, trying to break Jiang Lanzhi's spirit. But with the three Supreme Mystery elders on guard, the pressure had no effect.

Still, the sheer arrogance and disregard for rules was on full display.

"Holy Son." The three elders bowed as Xiao Fan emerged.

"Holy Son, please step back. Let us teach these blind fools a lesson."

"Indeed. No one has ever dared disrespect Supreme Mystery Holy Land like this."

"If we don't take one of their legs today, this matter isn't settled."

The three elders were ready for battle. Had they not worried about Grand Ascension-level combat damaging their surroundings and harming their disciples, they would have already attacked.

Xiao Fan's expression turned frigid. These people dared get in his face?

Rules be damned. They were all going to die today.

"You're the one who hurt our princess?" One of the Wu Generals spoke coldly, still unmoved.

Jiang Lanzhi showed no fear. But she felt Xiao Fan's hand tighten around hers, pulling her protectively behind him. A warmth she'd never known washed over her.

So this was what it felt like to be protected? She had never experienced this before. In her past life, she had always relied only on herself. Being sheltered this way... it was intoxicating.

Xiao Fan glared upward, his eyes cold.

How dare anyone yell at his woman? These people had clearly never faced death before.

He bellowed: "What are you barking about?"

"What the hell are you barking about!"

This sudden explosion caught everyone off guard.

It was clear to all that the Supreme Mystery Holy Son had no intention of backing down—he was ready to clash head-on with three Grand Ascension cultivators.

"Holy shit, are Grand Ascension cultivators about to fight?"

"A legendary battle!"

"How terrifying."

The watching cultivators whispered excitedly. Grand Ascension cultivators were rare enough—now they might actually see them fight?

The Three Great Wu Generals narrowed their eyes at the insult, momentarily stunned.

In their eyes, Xiao Fan was merely a Void Refining cultivator. What threat could he pose?

"Boy, what did you say?" One of them spoke icily.

He released his Grand Ascension pressure. Within hundreds of miles, all could feel his terrifying presence—a display of raw power meant to crush Xiao Fan's will.

A flower petal drifted out, scattering golden petals that instantly dispersed the pressure. A graceful figure appeared.

The Hundred Flowers elders recognized her immediately and bowed:

"Holy Master."

"Greetings, Holy Master."

An Wen waved them off. "No need for formalities."

She addressed Hong Rushuang: "Rushuang, won't you control your people?"

Hong Rushuang showed no fear, emboldened by her advantage:

"Holy Master, I only want an apology."

"Her—kneeling before me to apologize." She pointed at Jiang Lanzhi.

"That's against the rules. You lost fair and square—you can only blame your own inferior skill." An Wen spoke softly.

"Then I'll seek justice myself." Hong Rushuang replied.

"Enough! I'm done talking. They're all going to die." Xiao Fan's voice was cold.

He threw out the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda. The palm-sized tower spun through the air, expanding inch by inch until it towered a hundred yards high.

A sense of mortal danger erupted.

The Three Great Wu Generals clearly felt the tower's extraordinary power and immediately attacked, trying to knock it away.

But the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda radiated five-colored divine light that easily deflected their attacks. It didn't budge an inch, rising straight into the sky.

The pagoda descended over Hong Rushuang, the Shaman God Sect members, and the three Grand Ascension cultivators—sealing them inside to prevent escape.

Xiao Fan released Jiang Lanzhi's hand and spoke softly: "No one can bully you. Anyone who dares yell at you—they die."

"Mm." Jiang Lanzhi smiled. He truly was perfect.

"Aunt An, please step back. I promise no one else will be harmed." Xiao Fan rose into the air, his robes billowing without wind.

He had only said it casually. Whether An Wen retreated or not wasn't his concern.

"Alright. Be careful." An Wen simply spoke one sentence and withdrew.

The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda dropped threads of golden light that transformed into golden chains. Without warning—clang!—they pierced through the shoulder blades of the Three Great Wu Generals.

The chains continued to extend, wrapping around their bodies and binding them like rice dumplings.

Xiao Fan only fought when he had overwhelming advantage!

He had never tested himself against Grand Ascension cultivators and wasn't about to take risks. The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda had never shown its full power—now was the perfect time.

"Ahhh!"

The moment the golden chains pierced their shoulder blades, the Three Great Wu Generals let out agonized screams.

"Was that you barking just now?" Xiao Fan pointed at one of the generals.

"Boy, what kind of treasure is this? Whoever you are, release me immediately!"

"It seems you don't understand your crime." Xiao Fan spoke softly.

He raised his right hand, fingers spread, facing the general bound by golden chains. A smile crossed his face.

"Reaching Grand Ascension isn't easy. So I'll make it easier—I'll send you to your death."

The emotionless words left his lips, his smile making him seem like a demon walking out of hell.

His fingers closed. The golden chains tightened, causing excruciating pain that twisted the general's face in agony.

"Stop—stop! I am—"

"I know. You're just a dead man."

His fingers closed into a fist. The Grand Ascension cultivator was crushed by invisible force, exploding into a rain of crimson blood.

It drifted down between heaven and earth.

Everyone stared in disbelief.

A Grand Ascension cultivator—completely helpless, crushed just like that?

Every faction present felt their hearts leap into their throats. A Grand Ascension cultivator—someone who should stand at the pinnacle of this realm—had been squashed like an ant.

The impact was no less than a mortal watching a god die before their eyes.

"Just... like that?"

The cultivators gaped, feeling as though they were in a dream. Too surreal.

Those watching merely felt shock. But those trapped inside the pagoda—the Shaman God Sect members, Hong Rushuang, Bai Fengliu—felt a bone-deep chill.

"Dead... he's dead?"

They looked up at the Grand Ascension realm—supposedly unreachable—only to see one killed without any chance to fight back. Their worldviews were crumbling.

Hong Rushuang's legs went weak. She had kicked an iron plate this time.

Bai Fengliu's mood plummeted. This person was terrifyingly strong—what kind of treasure was that? Insane!

"Break through! Everyone, break through!"

"Destroy these barriers and get out!" Bai Fengliu commanded urgently.

"Yes!"

His subordinates began attacking desperately, throwing everything they had at the barrier. No one wanted to die here.

But all their efforts were futile. This was an Immortal artifact—an Immortal King-level treasure. Mortals breaking through? A fool's dream.

"It won't break! We can't break through!"

"Divine Son, what do we do?"

Bai Fengliu was frantic. He shouldn't have let her act so recklessly!

Xiao Fan laughed softly, devoid of emotion.

"Don't worry. Your fate will be better—at least you won't die right now."

He needed them alive to lead the way so he could wipe out the entire Shaman God Sect.

He moved on to the second Grand Ascension cultivator.

"I wonder—can you withstand one punch from me?" Xiao Fan smiled.

With a thought, the golden chains dragged the prisoner toward the barrier formed by the five-colored divine light. Xiao Fan flew over, preparing to strike.

"Boy, release me now! I am one of the Witch-Yao King's Three Great Wu Generals! Kill me, and you'll face the Witch-Yao King's wrath! Don't be reckless!"

Fear had set in. He was completely outmatched.

His companion hadn't even had a chance to resist before being crushed to death.

Xiao Fan shrugged: "Take one punch from me, and I'll spare your life."

Everyone assumed Xiao Fan was showing mercy.

After all, someone with three Grand Ascension subordinates must be formidable. It made sense to leave some room for negotiation.

The Wu General also thought his words had worked. Saved!

A Grand Ascension cultivator who couldn't take a punch from a Void Refining cultivator?

What a joke. If he couldn't handle that, his years of cultivation would have been wasted!

"You give your word?"

"If I beat you to death—then yes, my word stands." Xiao Fan clenched his right fist, his eyes showing unprecedented focus. Killing the first one using the pagoda didn't count as killing a Grand Ascension cultivator with his own hands.

This time was for real.

840 million phantom elephants roared within his body. Power gathered and stacked—from his core, through his back, along his arm, finally concentrating in his fist.

"Take my Ordinary Punch!"

His aura erupted violently. It was as if an ancient primordial elephant had possessed him. An invisible phantom elephant trumpeted, and stars fell from the heavens, crashing down with world-ending force.

In that moment, he seemed to be a god!

The Wu General's pupils contracted. He had underestimated his opponent! No chance to dodge.

This person was a monster. His power couldn't be measured by cultivation level.

"Don't kill—"

But his words never finished.

A storm of force arrived instantly. The Grand Ascension cultivator's head exploded on impact—red watermelon juice splattered everywhere, white tofu-like brain matter scattered across the ground.

When the storm subsided...

A headless corpse stood suspended in mid-air.

Xiao Fan withdrew his fist, satisfied: "You're too weak. Can't even take one punch."

In that moment, every gaze fixed on Xiao Fan.

Shock. Fear. Worship. But most of all—that unreachable sense of awe.

He had killed a Grand Ascension cultivator with his bare hands!

Grand Ascension—just one step from immortality—dead, just like that?

Using the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda to kill could be attributed to the treasure. But now, Xiao Fan had shattered a Grand Ascension cultivator's body with raw physical strength alone.

What terrifying power.

Just how strong was he?
