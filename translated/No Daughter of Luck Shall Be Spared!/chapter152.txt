Chapter 152: Hell Demon Gods Evolve: Primordial Angels

Long Ningbing stood outside the palace, gazing at the pagoda in the sky, waiting anxiously.

"It's been almost a month. Is he in danger?"

Long Ningbing's jade hands clenched tightly. Perhaps from too much worry, her palms were sweating.

Yes, a month had passed, yet Xiao Fan still hadn't emerged.

She could sense that those eleven women had come with hostile intent. Could he handle them alone?

Xinxi watched her and clearly had no idea what kind of person her Holy Son was. When the Holy Son faced women, as long as they didn't anger him and were reasonably attractive, he generally wouldn't let them go.

"Sister Xinxi, why hasn't he come out yet?"

"Perhaps the Holy Son is in the heat of battle." Xinxi said meaningfully.

Her "heat of battle" landed in Long Ningbing's ears, but she imagined a scene of bloody combat, life-and-death struggle. Her face instantly paled, worry etched across it.

"Sister Xinxi, what can we do to help him?" Long Ningbing asked nervously.

"Help?"

Xinxi thought for a moment. This really wasn't the time to join in—be careful of friendly fire.

"The Holy Son will be fine. Have faith in him." Xinxi smiled.

Seeing Xinxi completely calm, Long Ningbing guessed Xiao Fan must have remarkable abilities she didn't know about.

Indeed, with Wu Lingyun, Xiao Fan hadn't bothered with feelings—he'd just disciplined her thoroughly.

Disobedient? Then more discipline. He wasn't lacking for women anyway.

Fortunately, his physique was powerful enough to conquer her. But Xiao Fan understood that Wu Lingyun was only submitting on the surface. Inside, she definitely still resented him.

No matter. He only wanted her body—he wasn't interested in her feelings or sincerity.

Putting away the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda, Xiao Fan returned to the palace.

He'd barely landed, hadn't even entered, when Long Ningbing flew into his arms like a swallow returning to its nest. Her soft, white lotus-like arms held him tight.

Even her slender, soft dragon tail wrapped forcefully around Xiao Fan's waist, as if afraid he'd slip away from her.

"You scared me to death. I thought you were trapped in the pagoda, in danger." Long Ningbing's beautiful eyes glistened with tears as she buried her delicate face in Xiao Fan's chest.

This caught Xiao Fan off guard.

Such an innocent young girl was so easy to fool—one basic attack and she'd used her ultimate.

A fresh, elegant floral fragrance—the scent of a virgin—drifted into his heart, making Xiao Fan's thoughts wander.

Fortunately, he'd just been through a great battle. As they said, before the act one's a demon, after one's a Buddha.

Right now he was in the Buddha stage—not much interest.

Xiao Fan gently held Long Ningbing, smiling: "Those people frightened you, so I taught them a lesson. Just took some time."

Feeling Xiao Fan's gentleness, Long Ningbing's nervous heart calmed. But once calm, she immediately realized her loss of composure and quickly withdrew her soft dragon tail.

Her emotions had gotten out of control. That dragon tail had wrapped around him of its own accord. Long Ningbing didn't understand what was happening either.

Xiao Fan didn't tease her further. He just felt that Long Ningbing had a pure beauty from the depths of her heart—that was what attracted him most.

After briefly comforting Long Ningbing, Xiao Fan let her leave.

Xinxi stood quietly nearby without saying anything, though inside, she was somewhat envious.

When would the Holy Son notice her?

Spreading favor evenly, Xiao Fan naturally couldn't neglect Xinxi who'd stayed by his side. He walked over and drew Xinxi into his embrace.

Xinxi was caught off guard. The Holy Son, he...

Xinxi felt her head going fuzzy. Her jade hands unconsciously clenched into fists. She wanted to embrace Xiao Fan but feared he wouldn't like it.

Her face flushed with spring warmth, eyes tender with affection. Nervousness made her breathing quicken.

Xiao Fan understood her feelings. He gripped her jade hand firmly and pressed it against his face. Xinxi's face turned crimson. Nestled in his arms, she tilted her head up slightly to look at Xiao Fan's gentle smile.

"I've watched you accompany me all this time. No one is more important than you." Xiao Fan said.

Then he lowered his head and pressed his lips greedily against Xinxi's pink, glistening lips.

Xinxi's beautiful eyes showed shock and bewilderment, but soon only pure joy and sweetness remained. She summoned all her courage and cupped Xiao Fan's face.

Inexperienced, she let him take what he wanted.

Everything Xinxi had belonged to the Holy Son. Xinxi belonged only to the Holy Son.

She closed her beautiful eyes, utterly compliant. Her entire body went soft and weak, melting into Xiao Fan's arms like flowing water.

After a long while, their lips parted.

Xinxi's beautiful eyes were tender as water. The spring feelings on her face had fully blossomed. She was very happy—the Holy Son had finally made his move on her.

Looking at the beauty in his arms, Xiao Fan felt infinite tenderness, for companionship is the longest confession of love.

With ascension approaching, Xiao Fan had more matters to attend to.

He'd wanted to become the Holy Lord, but after only two years of development, he was ascending. Did this mean he'd have to become the Holy Lord of the upper realm's Supreme Mystery Holy Land?

Coming to the Mystic Gateway Hall, he sought out the Grand Elder ahead of time.

He gave fair warning, lest he disturb him while he was having another "study session" with a female elder.

The Grand Elder emerged with a spring in his step. Looking at his expression, Xiao Fan knew without thinking that he'd probably just been having a study session.

"Holy Son, you were in such a hurry to find me. Is there something you need to say?" the Grand Elder asked.

"Nothing major really. I wanted to catch up with you, Grand Elder, but time is short so I won't waste it." Xiao Fan said.

"Oh? Holy Son, did something big happen?"

Xiao Fan shook his head and said casually: "No, I just felt a premonition recently. I'm about to ascend, so I wanted to let you know."

"I see. I thought it was something big—wait, what did you say?"

The Grand Elder had been fine at first, but suddenly hearing the word "ascend," he felt his brain wasn't working properly.

"Right, I'm going to ascend. Just letting you know. Don't miss me too much." Xiao Fan smiled.

He was genuinely grateful to the Grand Elder. Good person, didn't meddle, gave him all sorts of privileges, and never pulled rank.

Most importantly, they shared the same interests—they could discuss how to pick up women together. A kindred spirit!

The Grand Elder had much to ask but didn't know where to start. He could only say with some regret:

"Holy Son, you must be the reincarnation of some heavenly genius. It's just a pity that from now on, I won't be able to discuss with you how to understand women's hearts. I'll have lost a stepping stone to improvement."

"We aren't fickle—our hearts have simply shattered into countless pieces, each one loving a different person." the Grand Elder said.

A kindred spirit indeed! Xiao Fan looked at the Grand Elder with some admiration.

So you're this kind of person!

Excellent—so am I!

After chatting more with the Grand Elder, Xiao Fan began summoning great demon gods. Fierce and terrifying.

Each one green-faced with fangs, tiger-backed and bear-waisted, with black-purple scales, sharp claws and long teeth. A cold, violent, and savage aura instantly filled the entire Mystic Gateway Hall.

The Grand Elder's expression changed drastically. He raised his guard, not understanding why such dark, sinister gates had appeared behind the Holy Son.

Xiao Fan merely swept them with a cold gaze, and the nine demon gods he'd summoned prostrated before him respectfully.

In unison, they spoke with utmost reverence: "Master."

The Grand Elder was somewhat frightened. What... Master?

He asked weakly: "Holy Son, who are these people?"

Xiao Fan smiled: "The holy land's guardians."

He pointed a finger, and nine golden lights shot out like swords, piercing straight into their hearts.

"Demon Gods transform—Primordial Angels!"

These were demon gods from the Gates of Hell within the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art. They possessed the genes of Primordial Angels. Activating them would trigger an atavistic transformation into Primordial Angels—avatars of justice.

One good, one evil.

Instantly, great vortexes appeared in the hearts of these nine demon gods, like bottomless abysses. Powerful suction force drew all their violent aura inside.

The Grand Elder's heart pounded. The Holy Son seemed beyond his level of comprehension.

He watched as all the violent, savage aura was swallowed into those heart vortexes—not a drop remained.

The black-purple scales also began transforming, becoming white-gold armor. Demonic energy transformed, taking on a holy radiance.

The hideous, terrifying, green-faced fanged appearances completely vanished, replaced by righteous holiness—like demon-slaying gods of the righteous path.

The light faded. Nine great divine generals knelt respectfully before Xiao Fan.

"From now on, treat the Grand Elder as you would me. No divided loyalties. The Grand Elder's commands are my commands."

"Your task is to protect Supreme Mystery Holy Land. I need Supreme Mystery Holy Land to endure for ten thousand generations."

"We obey the Master's decree." Nine Primordial Angels spoke in unison. Their voices weren't loud but carried divine authority, leaving the Grand Elder somewhat dazed.

"Mm. Transform into nine statues and guard the perimeter of our holy land. Drive away all evil."

"Yes."

With that, the nine Primordial Angels flew out, transforming into nine streaks of holy light, taking positions around Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

After finishing this, Xiao Fan extended his right hand and condensed a golden medallion. On it, he inscribed his own aura.

"Grand Elder, with this, you can summon them to assist in battle."

The Grand Elder accepted the golden medallion, somewhat dazed.

"Holy Son, what is this?"

"Leaving some foundation for the holy land."

The Grand Elder asked no more. As long as there were benefits, that was fine.

But sensing how powerful those Primordial Angels seemed, the Grand Elder couldn't help asking:

"Um, Holy Son, just how strong are those Primordial Angels?"

"Roughly... one of them could solo the entire world without issue."

"Of course, don't think about using them to expand the holy land's territory. Let the disciples handle such things. Don't reveal these trump cards either. Just treat them as foundation—pass them down." Xiao Fan said seriously.

Xiao Fan now had Golden Immortal-level strength. The demon gods he summoned naturally reached Golden Immortal level. These great demon gods each had late-stage Golden Immortal power—any one of them could destroy this entire world.

With Xiao Fan's strength, having Supreme Mystery Holy Land unify the realm would be no problem.

But without opponents, Supreme Mystery Holy Land would definitely decline.

When prosperity reaches its peak, decline follows—that was no joke.

"I understand."

The Grand Elder knew this principle well. They couldn't rest on their predecessors' achievements and coast along.

The best outcome was for Supreme Mystery Holy Land to become a titan of this world, reaping benefits while still having goals, keeping all disciples motivated to improve.

Flowing water strives to be first—but what it strives for is to flow endlessly!

At their parting, the Grand Elder felt some reluctance. He'd lost a kindred spirit to discuss the Dao with. But there was no helping it—this was cultivation. Partings of life and death were the norm.
