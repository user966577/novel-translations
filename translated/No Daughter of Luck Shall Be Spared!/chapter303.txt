One month later, Yaochi Immortal Palace made good on its promise to deploy forces against the foreign cultivators.

However, when people saw the truth of the operation, they were shocked.

Across the Eternal Immortal Domain, Yaochi Immortal Palace's elders and disciples weren't actually fighting. They merely served as guides, leveraging their familiarity with the terrain to lead the strike force against the foreigners.

And that strike force? None other than the Heavenly Demon Tribe—the very same demons who'd attacked the Eternal Immortal Domain years ago.

Many couldn't wrap their heads around it. Wait—the Heavenly Demon Tribe was beaten back by the Palace Master herself. How were these two working together now?

"The world's gone mad. I don't understand it anymore."

"I'd considered the possibility of the Heavenly Demon Tribe swooping in during the chaos, but I never imagined they'd enter the Eternal Immortal Domain like this."

"The Palace and the tribe must have struck some kind of deal."

The Eternal Immortal Domain's cultivators watched with cautious curiosity.

After all, the Heavenly Demons' fearsome reputation preceded them. Even with the tribe hunting foreign cultivators, the local cultivators remained wary.

But as time went on, opinions began to shift.

"Have the demons had a change of heart?"

"They really are only killing foreign cultivators. They haven't touched a hair on any of us."

"Hold on—they've settled down and claimed a huge swath of territory. I've already seen them building fortifications and laying defensive formations."

"Yeah, I noticed too. But the land they've taken was already ransacked by foreign cultivators—looted clean, not a single survivor left."

"With everyone dead, who's going to object to them moving in?"

"What if they refuse to leave later?"

"Tough luck, I guess."

"Deal with it. Yaochi Immortal Palace is openly cooperating with them. If the Palace has given its blessing, you can complain all you want."

"Honestly, the demons are vicious when they go after those foreigners. I'm telling you—I sensed a Primordial Chaos-level powerhouse taking the field the other day."

"Same here. That was the Heavenly Demon Tribe's Primordial Chaos expert—the Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor."

"With a monster like that personally hunting, those foreign cultivators don't stand a chance."

"The Holy Academy organized an alliance but never deployed its leader. Foreign cultivators kept slipping through the cracks no matter how many they killed. Meanwhile, the Blood Emperor leads from the front, and the foreigners are dropping at a visible rate."

"At this point, who even counts as an ally anymore?"

"..."

The Holy Academy built an alliance. The foreign cultivators never seemed to die off. Every time a decisive strike was imminent, the foreigners somehow escaped at the last moment.

The Heavenly Demon Tribe fought alone. The Blood Emperor led every charge. Wherever he passed, foreign cultivators fell like wheat before a scythe.

The cultivators of the Eternal Immortal Domain said nothing aloud, but their hearts held the scales.

When it came to eliminating the foreign threat, the Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor felt more like one of their own than the Academy ever did.

The Blood Emperor's rampage left Zhu Tong's scalp tingling.

Damn it, you really are a bloodthirsty maniac!

Zhu Tong had lost count of how many messages he'd received from Primordial Chaos powerhouses in other realms.

Every single one said the same thing: their genius disciples and core elders had been killed—life tablets shattered, souls extinguished—and they demanded Zhu Tong give them an explanation.

Otherwise, your Academy's disciples and elders will die by our hands.

How could Zhu Tong possibly explain? He couldn't very well step forward now and stop the demons from killing.

The Heavenly Demon Tribe was killing foreign cultivators. If he opposed that, wouldn't that be announcing to the world that he and the foreigners were in the same bed?

So no matter what, Zhu Tong couldn't publicly oppose the Heavenly Demon Tribe—even though the two sides had once been mortal enemies.

With no explanation forthcoming, the foreign Primordial Chaos powerhouses stopped communicating. Fine then—everyone dies together.

And so, the Holy Academy's elders and disciples stationed abroad were mercilessly eliminated.

"Dean! Something terrible has happened!"

An elder burst in, flustered, addressing Zhu Tong.

Zhu Tong recognized him immediately—the elder in charge of the life tablet chamber.

He already had a premonition of what was coming.

Zhu Tong forced himself to appear calm. "Compose yourself. What's with this panic?"

The elder quickly schooled his expression but couldn't help wiping the cold sweat from his brow.

"Go on. What happened?"

The elder said, "Dean, the life tablets in the chamber have been shattering one after another. Over seven thousand elders and disciples are already gone."

"And more tablets are dimming. The casualty count is still rising—the final number could be another two or three thousand on top of that."

His voice quavered as he delivered the report.

It was devastating. That many dead—all of them core elders and elite disciples.

Even for the Holy Academy, this was a crippling blow.

Zhu Tong was momentarily stunned. Despite bracing himself, hearing the actual numbers hit like a physical blow.

Damn it! The loot hasn't even been shipped back and the people are already dead—a total loss!

"Dean, this can't be kept secret. How do we explain this to the rest of the Academy?"

Zhu Tong said gravely, "Life and death are fated. What else can we say? Tell them the truth."

"This was my fault. I acted without sufficient intelligence and sent them out recklessly."

"I made a hasty decision, trusting false reports about an ancient ruin discovered in the western outer stars."

"Wanting to keep it exclusive, I sealed the information and secretly dispatched them. I never expected disaster. I can only blame myself for failing to investigate properly, costing them their lives."

Zhu Tong fabricated his lie, sighing with exaggerated anguish.

The pain! The agony!

All the plundered wealth—gone. And he'd lost ten thousand elite disciples and elders in the bargain. A catastrophic investment.

But even so, he couldn't reveal the truth.

He instructed the elder to notify the entire Academy, framing the incident as an ill-fated expedition into a secret realm.

It was a story everyone could accept. After all, everyone knew exploring ancient ruins carried risks.

Zhu Tong had been meticulous in his dealings—every elder he'd dispatched was a trusted confidant who knew the real story.

Now they were all dead. No one would leak the secret.

The ten thousand disciples had known nothing—they'd believed it was just a training exercise.

The announcement of over ten thousand elite casualties immediately rocked the Academy.

"What? Senior Brother Liu is dead?"

"Elder He too? No way—what happened?"

"Senior Brother Longyang—without you, how am I supposed to go on?! Senior Brother Longyang, wahhh..."

"Seriously? Were you two really that close as sworn brothers?"

"Sworn brothers? We were married, thank you very much."

"Sorry, I just remembered I have somewhere to be. You two... carry on."

"..."

When Miao Xiaoqing learned the news, she felt a chill run down her spine.

Back then, an elder had approached her about a secret mission from the Dean. Complete it, and the rewards would be generous.

Miao Xiaoqing had declined, claiming she needed to go into closed-door cultivation.

She hadn't given it a second thought. Why bother with secret missions when she could be earning her master's favor? When the master called, she needed to be available at a moment's notice.

As long as the master was happy, this kitty could have anything she wanted. The Taiyi Golden Immortal Fruit was proof enough of that.

Besides, she was already a Taiyi Golden Immortal. Whatever "generous rewards" they were offering couldn't compare to what the master gave her.

Miao Xiaoqing was no ordinary cat!

She'd found her purpose in life: devote herself entirely to making the master happy.

"The master truly is my lucky star. Just thinking about him keeps calamity at bay."

"He hasn't called for me in a while. Has he found someone new? Probably—with that gorgeous face, invincible power, and obscene wealth, what kind of woman couldn't he get?!"

At that thought, a sense of crisis crept in.

"No, I need to stay on his radar. If the master forgets about this kitty, what then?!"

"I know—I'll use the intelligence I've gathered recently as an excuse to report in. Perfect."

Miao Xiaoqing's cat ears twitched gently as she smoothed her fluffy tail with her fingers—the tail the master loved to play with most. She grinned proudly:

"Using a report as an excuse to get close to the master... this kitty is simply too clever! Meow~!"
