Chapter 138: Dog Head Mountain—The Paw Patrol Scores Big!

Elder Youxu returned triumphant. In a mere ten days, he'd swept through all the Wu Tribe within human territory—efficiency maxed out.

"Senior Brother, these dogs you sent are absolutely ferocious. When I first saw them, I thought some clan's great demon had escaped."

"Though fighting while leading dogs around looked a bit comical, their combat power was genuinely formidable."

Elder Youxu met with the Grand Elder, laughing heartily.

"I didn't find those. The Holy Son said he picked them up on the road." The Grand Elder spoke evenly. "Return them to the Holy Son when you're done."

Elder Youxu was stunned. What heaven-defying fortune did the Holy Son have to pick up something like this?

"Very well, I'll return them to the Holy Son right away."

However, Elder Youxu's hands were itching—he felt like adopting one.

After all, Grand Ascension realm dogs were too rare. The Holy Son had so many; maybe he could buy one?

With this thought, Elder Youxu led all thousand dogs straight to Xiao Fan's palace.

The moment they met, Elder Youxu stated his purpose.

"Holy Son, thanks to your assistance, we were able to resolve the Wu Tribe crisis so quickly. Here are your dogs—I'm returning them."

Xiao Fan smiled. "Thank you for your efforts, Elder Youxu."

Youxu grinned broadly, quite courteous. "No need for such formalities. It was nothing, truly nothing."

As he collected the demon dogs, his peripheral vision caught Elder Youxu's gaze full of envy. Eh, you want a pet dog too?

Before Xiao Fan could speak, Elder Youxu said:

"Holy Son, with so many demon dogs, won't you have trouble managing them all? I happen to have some spare funds recently and some free time. Do you think you could sell me two—no, one would be enough?"

Elder Youxu rubbed his hands together, face full of ingratiating smiles, completely unlike his cold demeanor from days ago when he'd been cutting down enemies one by one.

Xiao Fan had already guessed as much. He thought for a moment.

The Holy Sovereign is my master and future wife. The Holy Maiden is my lover. And I'm the Holy Son.

Supreme Mystery Holy Land? My holy land!

Building my... no, building Supreme Mystery Holy Land—it's my duty!

Seeing Xiao Fan deep in thought, Elder Youxu's heart tensed.

Xiao Fan nodded and spoke seriously:

"Elder Youxu, how about this."

"I'll have the Holy Sovereign open up a new mountain, and we'll call it Dog Head Mountain. It'll be entirely dedicated to raising these Nether Hounds, and you'll be in charge. How does that sound?"

Elder Youxu had been prepared for rejection when he saw Xiao Fan looking troubled.

He never expected the Holy Son would want to establish Dog Head Mountain!

And personally appoint him as the Dog Head Mountain Elder!

Elder Youxu's face bloomed with joy. He said happily: "This is excellent, excellent. When it comes to raising Nether Hounds, I'm the expert."

"Dog Head Mountain—what a great name. Concise and to the point, low-key yet practical. Holy Son, your naming truly cuts straight to the heart of matters."

Uh, Xiao Fan felt a bit amused. Was flattery a traditional skill of Supreme Mystery Holy Land elders?

With a thousand Nether Hounds in hand, I don't even know how I could lose!

"Damn it, I remember those mongrels from Starlight Holy Land raised a few little kittens and kept yapping at me every day. Watch me unleash the dogs on them this time."

Elder Youxu was already planning to sick the dogs on people.

"Good. Set aside your current duties immediately and go establish Dog Head Mountain. Will these thousand Nether Hounds be enough?" Xiao Fan asked.

"Here, wait a moment."

With that, Xiao Fan walked back into the palace.

Leaving Elder Youxu looking bewildered. A thousand still isn't enough?

The Holy Son, he... Elder Youxu thought of something terrifying.

Half a quarter-hour later, Xiao Fan emerged with a spirit beast pouch in hand.

Elder Youxu's heart lurched. Could there be more?

Xiao Fan handed the spirit beast pouch to Elder Youxu. It was filled with Nether Hounds.

"Elder, there are ten thousand dogs in here. I also picked them up on the road. They're all Grand Ascension realm. As the Dog Head Mountain Elder, how can you manage without a hundred million Nether Hounds or so?"

"This, this, this..."

Elder Youxu's hands trembled as he accepted it.

T-ten thousand Grand Ascension Nether Hounds?

Though he'd never heard of the Nether Hound species, he'd definitely heard of Grand Ascension. Rounding it off—he now had ten thousand Grand Ascension dog-head soldiers.

Elder Youxu was so excited he could barely speak. He immediately pledged his loyalty.

"Holy Son, I always knew you were a dragon among men. Rest assured, I absolutely won't let you down. I'll manage these ten thousand Nether Hounds well for you. In the future, whenever you need me, I'll answer without hesitation."

He spoke with conviction.

Xiao Fan immediately put on a stern face. "What kind of talk is that?"

"It's not that you're useful to me—it's that the holy land's development needs you."

"Everything I do is for the holy land. Your consciousness isn't high enough, Elder Youxu."

"Oh, my mistake. I'll definitely build the Holy Son's holy land. No, I'll definitely build our holy land!" Elder Youxu pledged.

Xiao Fan was satisfied. He dismissed Elder Youxu to select a site and establish Dog Head Mountain.

Of course, he still gave Elder Youxu some guiding suggestions.

Namely, that these things didn't need food or water—they couldn't starve.

Elder Youxu had been worried that so many Nether Hounds would drain the holy land's spiritual energy dry and was planning to build a spiritual energy isolation array. Turns out it wasn't needed. How convenient.

As for those Nether Hounds, Xiao Fan had also planted ten Earth Immortal realm Nether Hounds among them. If any were disobedient, just bite them to death.

Managing ten thousand was too difficult. He only needed to control these ten Nether Hounds.

With the holy land establishment complete, Xiao Fan returned to continue cultivating.

"Already at 480 million dragon elephants. When will some expert come let me beat them to death?"

Xiao Fan mused. Otherwise, he wouldn't know how strong he actually was.

But thinking about it, he found it laughable. What expert would be stupid enough to come court death?

Meanwhile, the Wu Tribe Divine Son appeared near Supreme Mystery Holy Land's mountain gates.

"If I can't destroy your orthodox lineage, I'll kill your Holy Sovereign, eliminate your Holy Son, and cause havoc within your Supreme Mystery Holy Land until you become a laughingstock!" He had his complete plan ready. Everything was in place!

To avoid alerting them, he decided to take a roundabout route.

After half a day of walking, he finally discovered a vulnerable spot.

Construction was underway here, with people moving mountains from afar to build a new peak and erect pavilions.

He concealed his aura, used earth-tunneling arts, and drilled into the stone mountain, his form vanishing from sight.

Who could possibly detect me!

Elder Youxu shouted loudly: "You lot, pick up the pace!"

Indeed, this was the newly established Dog Head Mountain.

Elder Youxu had personally taken charge, becoming the overseer.

By rights, establishing a new mountain peak was something that didn't require his personal involvement.

But thinking of the Holy Son's trust in him—ten thousand Grand Ascension Nether Hounds given just like that.

I cannot betray the Holy Son's trust!

So he personally took the field, striving to build everything to perfection.

At least the dog kennels were already built, housing those ten thousand Nether Hounds.

Hidden in the stone mountain, the Wu Tribe Divine Son infiltrated Supreme Mystery Holy Land without the slightest effort.

With his exquisite concealment techniques, even Human Immortals couldn't detect his trail.

But dogs could see things humans couldn't.

Especially those ten Nether Hounds—Earth Immortal realm!

Add in their keen sense of smell: the stone mountain had been dead matter, yet they detected the vitality of a living person! Though faint, they still sensed it.

Strange, too strange.

The ten Earth Immortal realm Nether Hounds spotted the intruder with a single dog-eye.

Remembering their master's instructions to manage these ten thousand Nether Hounds well and also maintain the holy land's security—wasn't now the perfect opportunity?

Without another word, these ten Earth Immortal realm Nether Hounds charged out like dogs off their leashes, barking incessantly.

They barked wildly at the stone mountain where the Wu Tribe Divine Son was hiding.

"Woof woof woof."

"Woof woof woof."

"Woof woof woof woof."

The Wu Tribe Divine Son was alarmed. They detected me?

Impossible, absolutely impossible!

Though his knowledge was extensive, hell's creatures didn't exist in the immortal realm. Nether Hounds were a specialty of hell, so not recognizing them was normal.

"Maybe there's something else on this stone mountain that caught their attention."

But all that barking irritated him. What kind of rabid fit is this? He couldn't help but curse:

"What the hell are you barking at?"

"Huh, what the hell are you barking at?"

Using the Ten-Directional Voice Transmission technique, his resonant voice descended from all directions, making his position impossible to pinpoint.

Originally, these ten Nether Hounds were just sounding the alarm. They hadn't expected this guy to actually start cursing.

Holy crap, dogs have tempers too, you know!

Ten Nether Hounds, like dogs off their leashes, burst from their kennels and surrounded him from all sides.

Baring their fangs, they circled the stone mountain, wanting nothing more than to rush up and bite it to pieces—but they couldn't, because the master said no destruction.

Only now did the Wu Tribe Divine Son realize his position was exposed.

The Wu Tribe Divine Son had no idea!

With this encirclement, he burst out, terrified of being caught the next second.

One man, ten dogs!

Suddenly appeared at Dog Head Mountain.

Elder Youxu frowned. Who was so reckless as to cause trouble here?

He didn't pay much attention. If these dogs couldn't handle it, neither could he.

The Wu Tribe Divine Son sneered. "So I've been discovered? Fine, I won't hide anymore."

"I am the Wu Tribe Divine Son. I'm showing my hand."

Drawing the Wu God Sword, combined with his current power—even ten Earth Immortals couldn't scare him!

The two sides clashed, fighting intensely. Countless afterimages, golden light radiating everywhere, the collision sounds thundering through the heavens.

When those ten Earth Immortal realm Nether Hounds attacked, he immediately realized his mistake.

"Son of a bitch, you're actually coming at me!"

Ten Earth Immortal realm Nether Hounds against one Grand Ascension Wu Tribe Divine Son—they demonstrated what Earth Immortal power meant.

Swift as wind, illusory as dragons, their speed beyond measure left the Wu Tribe Divine Son unable to fend them off.

Soon, his body was being gnawed. Wounds covered him from head to toe.

The Nether Hounds carried nether ghost fire on their bodies. Beyond the wounds, the burning made him grimace in agony.

His originally spirited appearance was now utterly wretched. His handsome face had been gnawed beyond recognition, his clothes tattered like a beggar's.

"Damn it, you dog bastards have no immortal ethics! What kind of skill is ganging up? If you've got the guts, come at me one on one!"

He gripped the Wu God Sword, cursing at the ten dogs, sounding like a shrew hurling abuse in the streets.

But Earth Immortal realm Nether Hounds—were they so easily provoked?

Without another word, they continued biting!

Scared out of his wits, he fled in panic.

Before the fight: I can take on ten!

After starting: Ganging up is cheating! Fight me one on one if you dare!

"Worthy of an immortal realm orthodox lineage! Fine, very fine! Sending such high-level dogs to guard the place! Today's matter—I, Wu, shall remember this!"

The Wu Tribe Divine Son tried to flee, but his escape route was blocked.

Panicking, he dove headlong into the holy land. Surely they wouldn't destroy their own holy land?

Indeed, it worked! They weren't chasing anymore.

"Hehe, reverse positioning. I'm truly too clever!"

These ten Nether Hounds exchanged glances, not daring to pursue further.

"Uh, why's he rushing to his death?"

"Exactly. Wouldn't dying at our hands be better?"

"Charging toward the master's place—has he never died before?"

The Nether Hounds transmitted to each other.

Whatever, back to the kennels.

The Wu Tribe Divine Son swallowed a pill, stopping his wounds.

He looked up and discovered a large stone tablet reading: Holy Son's Palace.

"Can't destroy the holy land, but killing your Holy Son should be fine, right?"

He sneered coldly. I'll make you pay in blood!

He crept forward, concealing his form, and slipped into the Holy Son's Palace.

The Nether Hound guarding the door had shrunk its form, looking like a small black dog. It raised an eyelid and let out a lazy yawn.

But then its ear twitched, glancing toward the palace before closing its eyes again.

Once bitten by a dog, ten years afraid of barking.

That one bark from a real dog scared him stiff, as if petrified on the spot.

Discovering it was just a dog yawning made him rather annoyed. Why'd you scare me?

He picked up a stone and threw it, hitting Wangcai who yelped in protest.

Why won't the master let me bite him to death? Whatever, pretend I didn't see anything.

...

Xiao Fan, who'd been cultivating in seclusion, was awakened by dog barking. The next second, the system's voice arrived.

[Detected: Child of Fortune whose fortune is dissipating. Please capture promptly.]

[Host's villain points are too high, scaring away his fortune.]

[Fortune dissipating. Fortune downgraded to treasure delivery boy. Please claim your package soon.]

Xiao Fan was somewhat confused. Treasure delivery boy? What the hell?

His divine sense swept out and discovered something creeping around outside his door. Most importantly, it had a golden script floating above its head.

Nice nice nice!

This time, the Paw Patrol really scored big!
