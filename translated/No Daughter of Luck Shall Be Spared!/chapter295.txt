The mighty Killing God Sect crumbled like dry leaves before the demon gods' unstoppable assault, utterly powerless to resist.

If Xiao Fan had thrown open the Gates of Hell completely and linked hell directly to the mortal world—

Well, that might actually be quite entertaining.

Xiao Fan arrived before Killing God Sect's treasure vault.

The entire sect was littered with corpses, the ground scorched and barren.

But the pagoda housing the treasure vault stood pristine and untouched.

The palace remained intact, its opulence and grandeur serving as its calling card.

"Killing God Sect has been plundering for ages. Their vault must be absolutely packed."

Xiao Fan prepared to break down the doors and claim everything inside.

The treasure vault was an eighteen-story pagoda carved with dragons and phoenixes, each floor over three hundred feet tall.

Its footprint was enormous as well—a full sixty miles across, practically a small city unto itself.

From a distance, it looked like a titanic pillar piercing the clouds.

Two stone lions flanked the entrance. The great doors were sealed shut.

Xiao Fan needed only the slightest effort to blast them open.

The moment the doors gave way, a dazzling vista of swirling immortal qi and shimmering golden treasures greeted his eyes.

Mountains of treasures from every conceivable category filled the space, leaving no room to stand.

They were piled haphazardly—like pirate treasure chests, each one brimming with gold and jewels.

Sabers, spears, swords, halberds, immortal pills, precious herbs, cultivation manuals, and all manner of miscellaneous artifacts—everything one could possibly want.

Even Xiao Fan, who had seen the Eternal Holy King's inheritance, couldn't help but marvel.

The Eternal Holy King's inheritance had been generous indeed.

But this vault's inventory was in no way inferior.

Not only that, but the variety of treasures here far exceeded the Holy King's inheritance.

Probably because it was all stolen—more plunder meant more variety.

"As expected, plunder is the fastest path to wealth." Xiao Fan spoke in a calm, neutral tone.

Forget about being civilized—if you could take it, you won.

A shimmering barrier covered the entrance. As Xiao Fan stepped through, it swept across his body, and he detected spatial fluctuations within.

"Spatial fluctuations... Is this a paradise cave dwelling?"

If this was a paradise cave dwelling, the actual interior would be far larger than it appeared from the outside.

He'd guessed correctly.

The instant he crossed the barrier, he entered a vast expanse of heaven and earth.

The space inside was far larger than he'd imagined.

The first floor alone spanned millions of miles.

"So this pagoda is actually a spatial treasure. No wonder the barrier had such peculiar spatial fluctuations."

It wasn't just the enormous space—the treasures inside were piled up like mountains.

Literal mountains of treasure!

Xiao Fan closed his eyes and extended his divine sense, sweeping through the entire first floor in an instant.

He slowly opened his eyes, somewhat stunned.

The lowest-tier items in the vault were gathering dust in a corner.

Specifically, they were sphere-shaped immortal stones the size of small planets, piled into a mountain—and every single one was supreme-grade!

He counted carefully. There were close to a million of those massive supreme-grade immortal stones.

"Holy crap, how did they get this many?" Xiao Fan was taken aback.

It wasn't that immortal stones were particularly precious—it was the sheer quantity that was staggering.

Had they stripped every immortal stone in the entire Killing God Immortal Domain and hoarded them here?

To verify his theory, Xiao Fan asked the system, "Hey System, what's the strongest cultivator in the Killing God Immortal Domain outside of Killing God Sect?"

[Golden Immortal realm.]

[And there are fewer than ten of them.]

"So all these treasures are here because Killing God Sect seized every immortal stone in the domain?"

[That's correct.]

[After all, winner-takes-all is the norm. Killing God Sect was named for killing—pillaging and plundering is perfectly on-brand.]

Xiao Fan was astounded. No wonder Killing God Sect was so arrogant, daring to call themselves the greatest power in the Killing God Immortal Domain.

They'd probably eliminated anyone who refused to submit.

Xiao Fan continued his inspection. After all, those million-odd immortal stones were merely the dusty corner pieces.

There had to be much more valuable things here.

His gaze fell upon a binding formation.

It was restraining over ten thousand immortal veins.

Immortal qi erupted from the veins, wisps and tendrils drifting ethereally. The concentration was so dense it condensed into mist, which gathered into rivers of immortal qi that flowed ceaselessly, eventually pooling into a vast ocean of liquefied immortal energy.

Xiao Fan stared, somewhat dazed.

Collecting a sea of immortal stones wasn't enough—they'd ripped up the very foundations of the Killing God Immortal Domain and brought them here.

Near this ocean of immortal qi lay fields upon fields of spirit herbs, likewise bound by formations.

The herbs had already gained sentience—some had taken human form. There were baby-faced ginseng roots and wizened ancient trees.

They were thriving, and no wonder—the ocean of immortal qi was right next door, so they never lacked for cultivation energy.

The sheer abundance of the vault exceeded his wildest imagination.

This wasn't the 80-20 rule anymore—this was hoarding everything.

As Xiao Fan continued through the colossal vault, he noticed bloodstains on some of the manuals and immortal swords.

He came upon a sword mound bearing marks of battle, filled with countless immortal swords, each one keening in mourning.

He picked up a blood-stained blade. The sword spirit within wailed, grieving its fallen master.

Xiao Fan tried communicating with it, telling the spirit to move on. It had worked hard to develop sentience—no need to throw its life away over a dead man.

The immortal sword mourned, its blade trembling, frigid gleam heavy with sorrow.

And it wasn't alone. Every sword in the mound wept the same way, their collective cries growing rather noisy.

Xiao Fan tried to calm them down.

It didn't work. So he destroyed them.

"You miss your masters so much? Go join them in the afterlife."

Sure enough, once he casually snuffed out the sword spirits, the whole place went quiet.

A sword without its spirit lost some power, but that hardly mattered—a sword could always birth a new spirit.

If you won't be the sword spirit, plenty of others are lining up for the job.

Having toured the first floor, Xiao Fan mused to himself: Truly, everything imaginable and then some.

"Every treasure here is stained with blood. They're all stolen goods. Allow me to purify them."

He solemnly vowed that he absolutely could not allow such tainted goods to circulate through the cultivation world. They'd just have to rot in his possession.

Xiao Fan headed to the second floor, which was no smaller than the first. The variety of treasures was even greater.

Though the quantity was somewhat less.

Naturally—the items here were a tier above the first floor, so fewer was to be expected.

After browsing the second floor, Xiao Fan decided not to continue. Cataloguing all this was mind-numbingly tedious. He'd inventory the rest when he was bored.

Stepping out of the pagoda, Xiao Fan used supreme arts to refine the entire structure, making it portable like his Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda.

At his current Primordial Chaos Grand Luo realm, refining something like this was child's play.

Before long, the cloud-piercing pagoda that had resembled a heavenly pillar shrank into his palm, becoming a miniature tower barely three inches tall.

"Pillage and plunder brings riches untold."

Xiao Fan chuckled to himself.

He pocketed the pagoda and surveyed the scene. Chen Miaoli was still busy refining blood pills.

She tossed the slain Killing God Sect disciples and elders into the Ghost Cauldron, where pale blue ghost fire burned ceaselessly, incinerating the resentment within.

Blood pills emerged one after another. Her eyes gleamed with excitement, those bewitching peach-blossom eyes brimming with fervent delight.

"There's a reason everyone hates her constitution." Xiao Fan shook his head.

Long Ningbing landed gently beside him, quiet and graceful.

"Young Master, everything has been handled per your orders. Not a single person escaped." She smiled as she spoke.

"Mm, well done, Ningbing." Xiao Fan rewarded her.

He gently rubbed her head and pressed a tender kiss to her smooth, jade-like forehead.

Long Ningbing trembled softly, thoroughly pleased, a flush of pink creeping across her delicate cheeks.

"Wait here. I'll wrap things up and we'll leave."

"Mm."

Xiao Fan summoned the Gates of Hell. A tremendous suction force emanated from within, pulling all the released demon gods back inside.

The demon gods were reluctant to go—they'd barely gotten a taste of carnage and wanted to keep killing.

But before the Gates of Hell, they had no power to resist. Icy chains snaked out, shackling them and dragging them back into hell.

There were exceptions, of course. Xiao Fan deliberately kept three Primordial Chaos Grand Luo-realm demon gods and a dozen-odd Grand Luo Golden Immortal-realm demons, then transformed each of them.

Primordial Angels descended upon the world.

All demonic nature purged, they became paragons of holiness—as though they were the most radiant beings in all of creation.

"I promised to transform you into Primordial Angels, and now it's done. You no longer need to worry about hell's chains binding you."

The three Primordial Angels understood the magnitude of this grace. They knelt and bowed reverently: "We kowtow in gratitude for the Divine Elephant Sovereign's boundless mercy."

Three Primordial Chaos Grand Luo-realm beings, kneeling in unison—heaven and earth resonated, and the Great Dao itself trembled.

Xiao Fan nodded in satisfaction.

He continued, "Killing God Immortal Domain will henceforth be governed by you three. Let me give you names."

"We thank the Divine Elephant Sovereign for bestowing names upon us."

"Since this is the Killing God Immortal Domain, your names should relate to killing."

"Tiansha! Disha! Rensha!"

Xiao Fan called out each name in turn.

Golden runes leapt from his lips and embedded themselves in the minds of the three Primordial Angels.

This served both as acknowledgment of their subordinate status and as a means of control.

"I entrust the power of life and death over the Killing God Immortal Domain to you three. I trust you will manage it well. Don't disappoint me."

"We shall never fail the Divine Elephant Sovereign's expectations."

Xiao Fan waved them away.

The Killing God Immortal Domain was now firmly under his control.

He, Chen Miaoli, and Long Ningbing departed through the Two Realms Gate, returning to the Eternal Immortal Domain.

All good things must come to an end. After returning to the Eternal Immortal Domain, Chen Miaoli chose to part ways—she needed to return to the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Xiao Fan offered some parting advice, reminding her to tone down the evil when killing and to keep her murderous impulses in check.

As a farewell gift, he gave her some of the treasures he'd taken from Killing God Sect.

...

The Eternal Immortal Domain.

A divine maiden of immaculate holiness descended gracefully, clad in sacred, luminous robes with a cyan jade sash at her waist. Her flowing skirt concealed long, elegant legs.

A gentle breeze stirred, and the dark strands framing her face drifted in an arc like a crescent moon.

A few stray hairs fell across her sculpted nose, adorning features of devastating beauty.

Gorgeous yet effortlessly natural.

She landed squarely before the gates of Yaochi Immortal Palace, her lovely eyes tinged with confusion.

"Yaochi Immortal Palace? This is clearly a women's sect."

"My husband didn't go to the Xiao family or Supreme Mystery Holy Land's immortal realm branch—what's he doing here?"
