At first, Lingyan and Nana were both stiff and self-conscious.

Nana especially so. Her aunt and herself sharing the same bed, serving the same man—how could that possibly be acceptable?

But Xiao Fan's attitude was unyielding. He said that if Lingyan's enthusiasm wasn't up to par, his support for the tribe might have to be... reduced.

Lingyan immediately declared she could accept anything. Not only that, she would sit down with Nana and explain the full picture.

Everything she'd done was for the Heavenly Demon Tribe's future.

Once Nana learned the truth—that her aunt had done this for the tribe—she felt duty-bound as well. As a princess of the Heavenly Demon Tribe, she too had an obligation to fight for her people's future.

And so, aunt and niece joined forces, determined to give Xiao Fan the time of his life.

Best-case scenario: leave him so satisfied his soul left his body, and he'd hand the Heavenly Demon Tribe a bright future on a silver platter.

With their inhibitions cast aside, the two worked in tandem, and Xiao Fan experienced something entirely new.

Two pure-temptation demonesses attending to him at once. Interesting.

He decided to test his own limits. Come at me, you two little demons—give it everything you've got!

A maiden of sixteen, soft as cream; a demoness's flavor, exotic and sweet; poor Xiao Fan's bones sucked dry and neat.

............

One day outside equaled one year within.

Seven days later in the outside world.

Three people, seven years together—they knew each other inside and out.

At the very least, Xiao Fan had thoroughly come to understand these two women who now belonged to him, from the inside out.

Lingyan and Nana's relationship and standing had shifted during their time with Xiao Fan.

Outside, Lingyan was still Nana's aunt.

Inside, Lingyan was Nana's sister.

Under Xiao Fan's guidance, these two pampered princesses learned what it meant to be devoted and dutiful.

They obediently bathed him and laid out fresh clothes for him to change into.

Lingyan hadn't forgotten the purpose of her visit. "Young Master, you must remember your promise to me."

A cold beauty of noble bearing, royalty of the Heavenly Demon Tribe standing above all others.

Now meekly lowering her eyes and pleading before him—the sight filled Xiao Fan with deep satisfaction.

He gazed at her bewitching face, casually slipping an arm around her supple waist and pulling her into his embrace. Looking into those violet eyes, he said:

"You're one of my women now. I won't shortchange you."

Lingyan felt a flush of embarrassment. She'd already accepted the man who'd taken her as hers.

But hearing such words spoken in front of Nana still made her cheeks burn.

Seeing that blush, he cupped her chin, tilted her face up, and kissed her deeply—tasting nectar and ambrosia.

Jasmine fragrance—like a cup of sweet, refreshing jasmine honey tea.

Nana watched the scene, utterly at a loss.

Xiao Fan, ever the equal-opportunity man, sampled Nana's flavor as well—green apple, tart and sweet, a taste all its own.

Taking Lingyan with him, Xiao Fan prepared to leave.

"What about Nana?" Lingyan asked.

"She'll stay here to keep me company. If you want to see her, just come find me." Xiao Fan replied.

Lingyan's face flushed crimson at that. Would she really be coming just to see Nana?

Xiao Fan said nothing more and led her out.

They'd barely returned to the main hall when they ran into Yu Yue.

"Young Master, you're back." Yu Yue greeted him respectfully.

Her gaze swept over Lingyan, and she spotted a familiar shape on the woman's body. Understanding dawned instantly.

The Young Master had added another woman to his collection.

Under Yu Yue's knowing look, Lingyan shyly lowered her head, feeling like a mistress caught red-handed by the wife.

Xiao Fan reassured her. "Don't be nervous. Yu Yue is like your elder sister from now on. She's wonderful."

Lingyan awkwardly squeezed out a smile and murmured timidly to Yu Yue, "Yu Yue... sister."

Yu Yue gave a slight nod, showing no rejection. Only then did Lingyan's nerves settle.

Xiao Fan asked, "Were you waiting for me? Is something the matter?"

Yu Yue said, "Yes."

She explained her reason for being there. "The Holy Academy sent people over. They want Yaochi Immortal Palace to stay out of the teleportation array affair."

"The Holy Academy guarantees that as long as the cross-realm teleportation array isn't interfered with, Yaochi Immortal Palace won't be harassed by foreign cultivators."

Xiao Fan understood their intent. The Academy apparently assumed Yu Yue was the one who'd destroyed the array.

They'd come to convince her to leave the teleportation array alone.

What they didn't realize was that Xiao Fan was the one who'd destroyed it.

"Young Master, how should we respond?" Yu Yue asked respectfully, deferring the decision to him.

"Respond?"

"If the Holy Academy can't be turned into an obedient dog, then it needs to be put down."

"Besides, from what I know, the Academy has been trading favors with these foreign cultivators. I'd wager the Academy has its own elders and disciples plundering other realms as well."

Before annihilating the Killing God Sect, Xiao Fan had extracted plenty of intelligence from Xing Daorong.

The top powers of different immortal domains had long since carved up trading arrangements in secret, dividing spoils among themselves.

Originally, Xiao Fan hadn't planned to get involved. But the thought of destroying the teleportation array and wiping out every last foreign cultivator—driving those top-tier foreign powers absolutely insane—was too delicious to pass up.

Perhaps those enraged powers would slaughter the Holy Academy's disciples and elders in retaliation.

The strategy crystallized in his mind.

"Tell the Holy Academy that Yaochi Immortal Palace conducts its affairs as it sees fit. The Academy has no right to dictate our actions."

Yu Yue shared the same sentiment. Who did this Holy Academy think it was, trying to give her orders?

Xiao Fan continued:

"If I'm not mistaken, the Academy also organized some kind of alliance to fight the foreign cultivators."

"Here's what we'll do. As a righteous sect of the Eternal Immortal Domain, Yaochi Immortal Palace naturally cannot stand by while its people suffer."

"Yu Yue, assign a few disciples to escort Lingyan back to the Heavenly Demon Tribe. Have her rally the demons and bring them here to exterminate the foreign cultivators in the Eternal Immortal Domain. Leave none alive."

"Of course, we're not doing charity work. We'll need to collect a modest protection fee—earn a little pocket money."

Xiao Fan turned to Lingyan:

"Go call for reinforcements. Whatever territory you can seize out there is yours to keep."

Lingyan's face lit up, blooming into a radiant smile.

"As you command. Thank you for your generosity, Young Master."

Xiao Fan smiled. "This isn't free, mind you. Seventy percent of everything looted from the foreign cultivators goes to Yaochi Immortal Palace. Twenty percent goes to the Heavenly Demon Tribe."

There was a clear hierarchy—Xiao Fan prioritized Yaochi Immortal Palace's interests above all.

Lingyan asked, "What about the remaining ten percent?"

Xiao Fan said, "Slip it into your own pocket, obviously."

Lingyan understood immediately. He was giving her a chance to build personal wealth.

What went into her own pocket and what went into the Heavenly Demon Tribe's treasury were two entirely different things.

Thinking of this, Lingyan gazed at Xiao Fan with gratitude and affection.

He isn't just toying with my body. He actually considers my interests!

Lingyan said to Xiao Fan, "Young Master, I won't let you down. I'll wipe every last foreign cultivator from the Eternal Immortal Domain."

Xiao Fan: "I believe you can."

With business settled, Xiao Fan went to find Lanzhi and the others.

Lingyan, having received Xiao Fan's endorsement, led her escort back to the outer stars to prepare a full tribal relocation.

Yu Yue, meanwhile, rebuffed the Holy Academy and, following Xiao Fan's instructions, issued a public declaration:

[In one month's time, Yaochi Immortal Palace will dispatch a force to hunt down the foreign cultivators and will not stop until every last one has been purged from the Eternal Immortal Domain.]

The announcement set the Eternal Immortal Domain's cultivators ablaze with excitement.

"Wonderful! I knew Yaochi Immortal Palace wouldn't sit idly by."

"The Holy Academy put together an alliance, but they've made zero progress. Those foreign cultivators just never seem to die off."

"Several times we had them cornered, but those foreigners always escaped at the last second—like they had a full map hack. I'm starting to think there's a mole in the alliance."

"Are you suggesting the Academy is the mole?"

"Hey now, don't put words in my mouth. I never said the Academy was the mole."

Some rejoiced, others didn't. Yaochi Immortal Palace's shift from passive avoidance to aggressive action was a seismic change.

Zhu Tong was stunned and furious.

"Damn it! I sent someone to ask her nicely, and she doesn't even give me face!"

"If Yaochi Immortal Palace kills off all the foreign cultivators, the safety of our Academy's elders and disciples in other realms—can anyone guarantee that?"

Was Zhu Tong actually worried about the Academy's elders and disciples?

Not in the slightest.

He was afraid that if they were killed by enraged foreign powers, there'd be no one left to bring the plundered treasures back.

That was all.

"No, I need to think of something."
