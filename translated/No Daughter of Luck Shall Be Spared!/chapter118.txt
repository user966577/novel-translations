Chapter 118: Xiao Fan's Father's Tactics, The Hundred Flowers Holy Master's Past

On the way to meet the Hundred Flowers Holy Master, Xiao Fan felt somewhat uneasy. He had heard she was his father's former flame.

It felt strange.

Of course, he wasn't calling his father an old lecher—after all, he himself was a young lecher.

He just wondered why his father had to play around so close to home instead of finding someone farther away.

"Young Master Xiao, please enter." They arrived before a sea of flowers, and the female elder gestured him forward.

"Thank you."

Xiao Fan looked ahead. Hundreds of exotic flowers competed in brilliant display, as if he had stepped into an ocean of blooms. Colorful butterflies danced about, and fragrant scents filled the air.

"What peculiar flower fragrance—fresh without being overwhelming, and infused with spiritual energy. Cultivating here would yield twice the results with half the effort."

Xiao Fan noted this to himself. Nearby stood a bluish jade stone about ten feet tall, with several characters carved in bold, flowing script: Myriad Flower Garden.

An interesting name.

Walking through a garden of flowers without a single petal clinging to your clothes?

Before Xiao Fan could enter, a dignified woman in a verdant dress descended before him, her long hair dancing in the wind. She was stunningly beautiful, with a faint smile on her lips as she studied him carefully.

A fragrant breeze washed over him, stirring his senses. Without question, this was the Hundred Flowers Holy Master.

"Greetings, Senior Hundred Flowers Holy Master." He clasped his hands in salute.

At the same time, Xiao Fan was carefully observing her. He wanted to see what kind of woman had captured his father's heart.

The Hundred Flowers Holy Master was at Grand Ascension—meaning she wasn't some great power, just an ordinary genius of the lower realms.

But her beauty was anything but ordinary.

Rosy cheeks framed features of exquisite delicacy. Her bright eyes were clear and spirited, her faintly red lips alluring, her willow-leaf eyebrows elegant, and her wind-tossed hair gave her the air of a painted immortal.

Combined with her inherent grace and her impressive figure—tall and slender, yet blessed with two peaks like snow-capped mountains laden with fruit.

Compared to his mother, this Holy Master was slightly less beautiful—lacking his mother's ethereal sanctity—but she possessed a certain liveliness and serenity.

No wonder his father had been smitten. Really, who could blame him?

The Hundred Flowers Holy Master gazed at Xiao Fan, a hint of reminiscence flickering in her beautiful eyes.

"You look so much like him." She wore the tender smile of an elder regarding a junior.

Xiao Fan naturally knew who she meant—she was saying he resembled his father.

But right now, he should pretend not to understand.

Xiao Fan feigned confusion: "Senior, what do you mean?"

The Holy Master smiled: "Nothing, really. Seeing you just reminded me of someone..."

"Never mind. Let's not dwell on that."

"Also, don't call me Senior. My name is An Wen—just call me Aunt An."

Xiao Fan: ...

Did she really think he didn't know anything?

"I couldn't possibly. You are the Hundred Flowers Holy Master—I mustn't breach propriety."

An Wen paused, then smiled lightly: "As you wish."

"If you won't call me Aunt An, may I at least call you Little Fan?"

"Whatever pleases you, Senior."

As for the grudges and entanglements of the previous generation, Xiao Fan had no desire to comment. This was his father's mess—let him deal with it.

Initially, Xiao Fan had felt somewhat resistant toward An Wen. After all, she was his mother's rival—which technically made her his enemy too.

But after chatting with her for a while, he found this woman to be intelligent, gentle, and considerate of others' feelings.

No wonder his father had fallen for her. He'd underestimated the situation.

"By the way, your father... how has Patriarch Xiao been lately? Is he well?"

The conversation suddenly turned to Xiao Fan's father, her voice carrying a hint of anticipation.

Xiao Fan was caught off guard. This...

As if realizing her question was improper, she quickly explained: "Patriarch Xiao and I are old acquaintances. We were friends when we were young."

"Oh, I see." Xiao Fan nodded in understanding. "So Senior and my father knew each other."

"As for my father, he's been in secluded cultivation lately and rarely shows himself. I haven't seen much of him either."

The elder wanted to know about his father? She could go ask him herself.

"I see." An Wen's voice was soft, and the expectation in her tone deflated into faint disappointment.

It was subtle, but noticeable.

With Xiao Fan's years of experience manipulating women's emotions, he could see plainly that An Wen still harbored deep feelings for his father.

Xiao Fan grew curious—what exactly had his father done back then?

"Senior Holy Master, are you close with my father?"

"Fairly close, I suppose. I know his... length, and he knows my... depth." An Wen chuckled softly.

Xiao Fan: ???

Holy shit, the older generation's driving skills were no less than his own!

Who would have thought the Hundred Flowers Holy Master, looking so refined and proper, could floor the accelerator like that?

Seeming to realize she'd misspoken, her cheeks flushed slightly.

"Are you curious about your father's past?" she asked.

"A little." Xiao Fan nodded.

Like father, like son—so his philandering ways were hereditary. This really wasn't his fault!

As they talked, they walked to a small pavilion and sat down.

The Hundred Flowers Holy Master habitually prepared tea, pouring a cup for Xiao Fan. One glance told him something was off.

Her technique was exactly like his father's!

As if carved from the same mold!

She finished brewing, waved her jade hand to summon a light breeze that carried away the steam, leaving the tea at just the right warmth.

Even the temperature control was identical to his father's!

"Drink." She offered the cup.

"Thank you, Senior." Xiao Fan didn't stand on ceremony, but he couldn't help feeling impressed. He still had much to learn from his father—making a woman pine for him for thousands of years.

Even her habits remained unchanged.

"Actually, I've known your father for a very long time." The Hundred Flowers Holy Master lifted her cup and took a small sip.

Xiao Fan remained silent, listening.

Not that he found it particularly interesting—but after hearing this, he could use it to manipulate his father in front of his mother.

An Wen's face took on a reminiscent expression while Xiao Fan played the role of quiet listener.

An Wen had joined Hundred Flowers Holy Land as a child, but her talent was nothing special. Beyond her exceptional beauty that outshone all her peers, she had no particular strengths.

Xiao Fan: ...

Wasn't that already a godly start? Beauty is justice!

An Wen hadn't been happy. Others always said that with her unmatched beauty, men would fall at her feet regardless of her talent.

Several prominent families had offered substantial bride prices to marry her.

But An Wen felt unhappy. She wanted people to notice her for her abilities, not her pretty face.

These things made her feel like nothing more than a vase—useless except for her looks.

So An Wen devoted herself to cultivation. But her talent was truly limited—perhaps heaven had allocated all her gifts to her appearance.

By eighteen, her beauty had become legendary throughout the world, earning her the title of "Most Beautiful Woman Under Heaven." Yet her cultivation was a pitiful Foundation Establishment early stage.

Refusing to accept her fate, An Wen trained desperately. Once, during a mission, she became so focused that she lost track of time and found herself trapped in a beast-infested fog.

"As expected, I'm still too weak." She laughed bitterly at herself.

Ferocious yao beasts roared, their sounds making her soul tremble. Sharp fangs, razor claws, and terrifying faces—every inch of their bodies screamed danger.

An Wen had resigned herself to death. She had no regrets—she could only blame her own inadequacy.

But at her darkest moment, a white-robed young man descended from the heavens, sword in hand. With a single slash, a crescent of crimson sword light swept forth, unstoppable!

One strike, and the world fell silent.

Every yao beast before her was cut to pieces.

That sword-bearing youth in white, his back to her, left an indelible mark on her heart.

She desperately wanted to thank him, but the young man didn't linger. He only asked, "Are you hurt?"

An Wen was at a loss. Her cheeks flushed, her heart raced, and she stammered:

"I—I'm not hurt."

"Good. It's dangerous here—you should leave quickly." With that, he departed without looking back.

That was their first meeting.

Xiao Fan listened and mentally applauded. Incredible!

So this routine was something his father had pioneered. The classic hero-saves-beauty act—a white-robed youth, no less. At his age, still using such tricks to fool innocent young girls.

Xiao Fan silently cursed his father for being shameless—toying with a pure maiden's heart.

No wonder I'm such a playboy. It's definitely inherited from my father!

When An Wen spoke of this, her lips curled into an irrepressible smile. Clearly, this first encounter had left an unforgettable impression.

Xiao Fan shook his head internally. His father truly was the master of layered schemes. Poor Hundred Flowers Holy Master—she never saw through his father's lecherous heart.

She had fallen completely!

Later, at the Sword Sect's Grand Sword Assembly.

An Wen encountered the white-robed youth again. Only then did she learn he was the young master of the Xiao family.

Mustering her courage, she went to thank him.

The young man seemed puzzled, asking who she was.

She excitedly explained that he had saved her life.

The young man finally remembered, flashing a gentle smile: "It was nothing."

An Wen recalled: "Back then, every man who looked at me had desire in their eyes. Only he gazed at me with pure clarity—as if I were just an ordinary person."

At last, An Wen found validation. This man didn't care about her face! He wasn't the type to judge by appearances!

Her favorable impression of him skyrocketed. An Wen gathered her courage and asked him to teach her swordsmanship—she'd be his servant or slave, anything he wanted.

How humble! Too humble!

How shameless! Too shameless!

The man had even feigned youth to deceive young girls. Xiao Fan felt inferior by comparison.

"Everything I've achieved, I owe to your father's guidance." The Hundred Flowers Holy Master smiled, no longer hiding anything.

"He didn't mind my clumsiness. He affirmed my efforts, encouraged me that hard work would be rewarded, taught me swordsmanship hand by hand, found sacred medicines for me, helped me cleanse my marrow and transform my foundation."

"More than that, he supported me and helped me claim the Saintess position. Otherwise, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you."

Xiao Fan silently rated the technique a perfect six. So it was the hand-by-hand teaching approach!

He carefully noted this strategy for future review.

For beautiful women with limited talent:

Don't focus on their appearance—treat them like ordinary people.

Encourage their efforts and watch them grow step by step. During this process, the hand-by-hand teaching creates a deep impression.

But here's the key: you can't be too nice. Create a sense of distance—keep them guessing. Meanwhile, establish yourself as a figure to be admired and looked up to.

Admiration, gratitude, plus love at first sight—combined, these three became an unstoppable technique. No woman could resist this approach.

The cultivation-style girlfriend!

Xiao Fan was thoroughly impressed. When it came to seduction, his father's methods were unmatched.

Though in his memory, his father hadn't been going out much lately. He seemed rather well-behaved now.

Perhaps only his mother could keep that man in check.

"I knew our statuses were worlds apart. In the end, he returned to the Xiao family. Though I had prepared myself, when he told me he was going back for an arranged marriage, I cried my eyes out."

"That night, neither of us slept. We poured out our hearts to each other, and I gave myself to him completely. We became cultivation partners that night. But family obligations couldn't be defied. I didn't want to make things difficult for him, so I let him go."

"That parting lasted a thousand years." The Hundred Flowers Holy Master sighed.

Absolutely incredible!

Playing dirty right in front of me?

He'd toyed with her feelings, taken her primal yin, made her pine for him for a millennium—yet she never came to cause trouble and still remembered him fondly. Xiao Fan couldn't hold a candle to this technique.

Your old man is still your old man!

"Achoo—who's secretly praising my handsomeness now?" Xiao Father rubbed his nose and frowned.

He considered divining who it was, but since it was praise and not criticism, he decided not to bother.

The Hundred Flowers Holy Master smiled: "You have about seven parts of his likeness. I rambled on about old times—just treat it as a story."

Xiao Fan smiled back: "So the Holy Master and my father had history. Lucky him."

"You're quite interesting." The Holy Master laughed, radiant and beautiful.

"I hear your fiancée is Lanzhi?"

"That's correct."

"It seems Hundred Flowers Holy Land and your Xiao family are truly connected by fate. Your father helped me become Holy Master, and now you're supporting Lanzhi."

"Well then, that's enough."

"By the way, when you return, could you give this letter to him?" The Hundred Flowers Holy Master produced an envelope fragrant with flowers.

"No problem!" Xiao Fan agreed without hesitation.

This was evidence!

With this in hand, wouldn't his father have to listen to him? That Purple Orchid Immortal Sword of his—Xiao Fan had been eyeing it for ages!

Hehehe!

The Hundred Flowers Holy Master hadn't expected him to accept so readily. She had thought he might resent her.

"I won't let you run this errand for free. Here's a bottle of Immortal Orchid Spirit Pills. They can give women flower-like beauty and orchid-like elegance."

"Lanzhi should like them."

"Oh?" This generous!

Giving him evidence and gifts too? Hundred Flowers Holy Master, you're truly a wonderful person!

Xiao Fan bid farewell to the Holy Master in high spirits.

Last time, he'd begged and pleaded just to touch his father's Purple Orchid Immortal Sword, only to be refused. This time, he'd make the old man deliver it personally!

[Ding! You directed Xia Huaxuan to use the Fortune-Plundering Sword to kill protagonist Fei Yangyang.]

[Villain Points earned: 88,888.]

Hm? Fei Yangyang was already dead?

As expected, simps don't even deserve screen time.

Excellent!
