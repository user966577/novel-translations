Chapter 150: Ruining My Fun, I'm Really Pissed

Xiao Fan cultivated in the Spacetime Secret Canon. Though only half a year had passed in the outside world, the Spacetime Secret Canon could now achieve tenfold time acceleration.

Converting that, Xiao Fan had cultivated inside for ten years. This was the first time he'd ever cultivated so seriously.

But the benefits were real. He could undergo his tribulation and ascend at any time.

His dragon-elephant body was complete, and he'd practiced the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art to perfection.

His Gates of Hell had reached a new height. The demon gods within—he could activate the primordial angel genes in their bodies, evolving them into Primordial Angels.

One good, one evil—this was what they called: a single thought brings heaven, a single thought brings hell.

The demon gods he could summon had become incomparably powerful. A full tier above Wangcai, reaching the Golden Immortal level.

Moreover, there was no limit to the number he could summon! He could summon as many as he wanted. If he wished, he could throw open the Gates of Hell entirely.

In other words, he already had Golden Immortal-level subordinates—an inexhaustible supply of them.

If it were just external power increasing, that naturally wouldn't be worth celebrating.

What made Xiao Fan cultivate so earnestly was that his own strength had grown.

In hell, he summoned ten True Immortal-level demons to attack him, yet they still weren't his match.

He continued summoning demon gods to spar with, wanting to know what level his strength had reached.

The results were disappointing—he could only one-punch kill an early Golden Immortal.

Mid-stage Golden Immortals he could also defeat, but it took longer.

Late-stage Golden Immortals—he could only fight to a draw. He couldn't kill them.

In other words: with his own strength alone, he was already invincible below Golden Immortal!

With all these cheats I've activated—Righteous Qi Body, plus Divine Demon Body, Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art, Dragon-Elephant Body, plus Yin-Yang Reversal, and using Inverted Lovebirds to dual cultivate hard with seven or eight daughters of luck—one-punching Golden Immortal cultivators to death seems perfectly reasonable.

Walking out of his cultivation chamber, Xiao Fan felt life was looking great.

"Young Master Xiao, you're out." Long Ningbing had been sitting with Xinxi, drinking tea and chatting. Seeing Xiao Fan emerge, she immediately stood up and spoke with surprise.

Xinxi was more composed. She poured a cup of hot tea and handed it to Xiao Fan. "Holy Son."

"Mm."

Xiao Fan took it and sipped. The refreshing fragrance filled his heart. Someone bringing tea the moment he's thirsty—life was truly comfortable.

"Um, Young Master Xiao, you have nine golden dragons behind the mountain. Could you release them?"

"They're quite pitiful, staying in the stable every day without any freedom." Long Ningbing said softly, asking his opinion.

Xiao Fan glanced at her, paused for a moment, then smiled.

"No problem."

Long Ningbing brightened and wanted to thank him on behalf of the nine golden dragons. But his next words caught her off guard.

"But if I release them, I won't have any mounts."

"Will you be my mount?"

"M-mount? You mean me?" Long Ningbing stared at Xiao Fan in bewilderment.

"Of course. I'm even taking a loss here—one little dragon for nine golden dragons means I'm losing eight. No matter how you look at it, you're getting the better deal." Xiao Fan said solemnly.

"B-but, I... I don't know how." Long Ningbing said timidly. She'd never heard such a request before.

"You can learn if you don't know. Nobody's born knowing how." Xiao Fan said casually.

"But..." Long Ningbing seemed troubled.

Over these past six months, she'd gotten along well with these nine dragons. They'd told her many stories about what happened in the heavens. They'd become good friends.

She really did want to give the nine golden dragons their freedom.

"Don't you want them to be free?"

"I do!" she said firmly.

"Then what are you hesitating for?" Xiao Fan asked.

"Alright." She agreed.

Xiao Fan was delighted. Could there really be such a good deal?

"Transform into a dragon first—let me see." Xiao Fan hadn't seen Long Ningbing in dragon form yet. He was curious.

Long Ningbing thought, since she'd have to transform into a dragon to be a mount anyway, transforming now was no big deal.

Thinking this, she transformed, shifting into a slender azure dragon. Her two dragon horns were even more pristine white. Perhaps because she was a female dragon, Xiao Fan saw that her dragon head wasn't fierce or terrifying—rather, it had a gentle quality.

She controlled her size, not making herself very large—only about a hundred feet long. If she revealed her true form, she'd probably be ten thousand feet long.

Long Ningbing didn't know why, but the more she looked at Xiao Fan, the more her heart surged. Such a strange feeling.

As if possessed, she flew to Xiao Fan's side. Her dragon head nuzzled against his face, and her graceful, delicate dragon tail swayed in the wind as if it had nowhere to settle, coiling around his waist like a belt.

"Nice!"

Xiao Fan looked at this verdant azure dragon. Her four dragon claws were also fair as jade. Those timid eyes, even in dragon form, weren't obscured by dragon majesty—still gentle with a hint of timidity.

Very satisfying.

"What are you doing?" Xiao Fan stroked her dragon whiskers—probably equivalent to her hair.

Long Ningbing yelped in surprise at his touch, instantly straightening her body and pulling away from Xiao Fan.

"S-sorry, Young Master Xiao, I... I didn't mean to."

Feeling as though she'd taken liberties with Xiao Fan, a rosy hue actually appeared on her azure dragon body. Long Ningbing herself didn't understand why this was happening.

As someone who had touched her dragon horns, Xiao Fan could naturally sense her feelings. Besides, his Peerless Immortal Presence made it easy to capture women's hearts.

"Hmph, you think a single apology will settle things after teasing me?" Xiao Fan snorted coldly, clearly displeased.

Long Ningbing's guilt deepened. Her gentle face fell, and her two front dragon claws fidgeted restlessly, sometimes clenching, sometimes releasing.

Finally she could only say timidly: "I... I promise there won't be a next time."

Xiao Fan wouldn't let her off that easily. He walked over directly, leaped with both legs, and straddled her dragon head.

Long Ningbing's body went rigid instantly. Her entire mind exploded. For a moment, she lost all composure and couldn't even speak.

"As my mount, shouldn't you take me for a flight?" Xiao Fan said with a half-smile.

Long Ningbing's azure dragon body flushed pink even more noticeably. She couldn't control herself; her whole body trembled uncontrollably.

Xiao Fan was a bit confused. Had she been unconscious so long she'd forgotten how to fly?

Then I'll teach you.

He gripped her dragon horns with both hands. Openly and without shame.

Long Ningbing was truly dumbfounded now. A piercing dragon's roar instantly echoed through the sky as the azure dragon shot straight up, riding the wind and breaking through waves.

"He, he, he..."

Long Ningbing only felt her body becoming strange. She fled skyward as if escaping, seeming shy, and dove straight into the clouds to hide.

After a while, Long Ningbing spoke with tears in her voice: "Young Master Xiao, you... you're a bad person!"

Xiao Fan pretended to know nothing, questioning her instead: "You're my mount. What's wrong with me taking a test ride?"

"B-but, you never said you'd touch my horns." Long Ningbing said.

"Never said you couldn't touch them either." Xiao Fan spread his hands.

Long Ningbing wanted to say that once someone touched a dragon's horns, they either had to marry that person or kill them. But Young Master Xiao had saved her—how could she possibly kill him? Besides, she was already quite interested in him.

But she couldn't very well say "you have to take responsibility for me," could she? That would be too embarrassing!

Xiao Fan descended from her dragon head. Long Ningbing returned to human form.

Only her pretty face was still covered in a rosy flush.

That was enough for now. Xiao Fan walked over and gently embraced Long Ningbing's slender waist, pulling her close to his body.

Before Long Ningbing could react, his advance continued.

Xiao Fan captured her warm, rosy lips, tasting them freely. A sweet fragrance spread through his mouth—could this be what they called dragon musk?

Long Ningbing had never experienced such a test.

She wanted to refuse.

But thinking about how she already liked Xiao Fan...

He made the first move. If I just cooperate with him a little, I shouldn't seem improper, right?

Moreover...

He'd already touched her horns. That made him her husband, didn't it? I, Long Ningbing, acknowledge this marriage!

She convinced herself. In Xiao Fan's passionate kiss, her dragon breath burned hot, her breath fragrant as orchids.

Her azure dragon tail, originally soft as a willow branch swaying in the wind, went rigid—then the next second, it writhed wildly, binding the two of them tightly together.

Even Xiao Fan was caught off guard. You need it this badly? Then I'll help you out.

Just as Xiao Fan was about to bring out the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda, preparing to play dragon rider, someone interrupted.

"Ho ho, how rare. Finding dragon-kind even here."

"Looks like high grade too—at least pure-blooded dragon race."

"Tsk tsk tsk, didn't expect such things to happen in the sky. Mortals certainly have creative ideas."

Several sudden voices rang out.

Xiao Fan didn't care, but Long Ningbing wasn't mature enough mentally. Being spoken of like this, she froze completely, utterly mortified.

She could only cling tightly to Xiao Fan, burying her face in his chest, terrified of being seen in such an embarrassing state.

The extreme nervousness made Long Ningbing's emotions fluctuate violently. The yin-cold qi in her body went berserk. Xiao Fan could clearly feel Long Ningbing's body temperature plummeting rapidly—it was like holding an ice sculpture.

"Ningbing, are you alright?" Xiao Fan asked nervously. She was his woman after all—nothing could happen to her.

"Cold... young master, Ningbing is so cold." Her white teeth chattered from the cold, and her dragon tail curled up tight, all softness gone.

Xinxi also noticed the abnormality. She immediately followed and took Long Ningbing from him, suppressing the cold qi. Long Ningbing's pale face eased somewhat, color gradually returning.

Without a supreme yang treasure, suppressing this required a powerful cultivator's constant presence.

"Holy Son, do you need my help?" Xinxi looked at these female small fry before her without a ripple of emotion. After all, people don't feel killing intent toward ants.

"No need. Just take care of her." Xiao Fan said softly.

"Mm." With that—

Xinxi carried Long Ningbing back to the holy land.

Xiao Fan faced the eleven people before him. All female cultivators, and all Immortal Realm cultivators.

Especially the leading woman—cold and beautiful with an air of superiority. Clearly someone of high status.

The ten female cultivators behind her, though not as beautiful, still had decent looks. They wore matching dark blue Daoist robes, carrying an air of holiness, ethereal like immortals.

The leading woman's beautiful eyes coldly regarded him. Below was Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

She spoke coldly: "Are you the Supreme Mystery Holy Son?"

Xiao Fan heard this—great, probably here for revenge. But he wasn't reckless either.

Those ten female attendants were merely Heavenly Immortals.

Only the leading woman had higher cultivation. But she'd barely reached Golden Immortal level—most likely she'd left seclusion early without stabilizing her realm.

Toward these people who'd ruined his fun, he naturally had no pleasant expression.

Moreover, right now, he was really pissed!

"So what if I am? Right now, I'm really pissed!"
