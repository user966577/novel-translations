Chapter 113: Mistake in the Flower Field

Bai Fengliu was furious, his eyes narrowing coldly as he stared at Xiao Fan.

His entrance had been even more extravagant than mine.

I merely had four flood dragons pulling my carriage, while he had nine five-clawed golden dragons. Did that make my entrance look like a garbage truck?

And this Hundred Flowers Holy Land—their differential treatment was way too obvious. He had come here for such a major event as a proposal, brought over a hundred carriages of betrothal gifts, yet they only sent a Body Integration elder to receive him.

Meanwhile, the other side had just brought a Holy Son who hadn't said a word, yet their Grand Ascension elder—usually as elusive as a dragon showing its head but not its tail—had actually come out personally to welcome him.

No words were needed. The difference in status was immediately apparent. The Shaman God Sect's Holy Son wasn't worth even a fraction of the Supreme Mystery Holy Son.

It wasn't just him thinking this—everyone present shared the same thought.

Moreover, that Body Integration female elder had merely asked Hong Rushuang to escort him.

Yet for Xiao Fan, even though he also had his fiancée Jiang Lanzhi right there, why did that Grand Ascension elder personally lead the way?

Sometimes actions spoke louder than words.

Hong Rushuang was also indignant—she'd been upstaged again. Damn it!

However, she still understood propriety. "Fengliu, these things are nothing but fleeting illusions. As long as I win the Saintess position, what does it matter how capable he is?"

Bai Fengliu calmed down and managed a rare smile. "Of course. The Saintess position is yours, and will only ever be yours."

He spoke loudly, not just for Hong Rushuang's ears, but for Xiao Fan's as well.

However, Xiao Fan didn't seem to care much. Instead, he addressed Bai Fengliu:

"I quite like your betrothal gifts. Lanzhi will eventually become the Saintess, then the Holy Master—so all of this will end up in her hands anyway. But the way you speak—that I don't like."

"On account of the gifts you've sent to my Lanzhi's Holy Land, I'll forgive you this once for your disrespect toward me. Don't let it happen again."

This verbal maneuver was absolutely confrontational.

On the surface, gratitude. Underneath, a direct statement: You're not qualified to compete for the Saintess position.

No one dared speak. They looked at Xiao Fan, then at Bai Fengliu, as if the two might come to blows at any moment.

Bai Fengliu laughed in anger. "Hmph, don't bite off more than you can chew."

"Just wait—I'll show you what cruelty really means."

Xiao Fan shook his head silently. This fellow's temperament was too weak. He didn't even have the potential to become a child of destiny.

Forget it. He hadn't been in the mood for killing lately. Otherwise, taking someone out would mean annihilating their entire clan, which was too troublesome.

Under the Grand Ascension elder's guidance, Xiao Fan and his elders and disciples found their seats, waiting for the selection to begin.

Hundred Flowers Holy Land, Welcoming Guest Peak.

This was where all the cultivators rested. The first round of the Hundred Flowers Saintess selection would be held at the Immortal Arts Stage atop this very peak.

Though called a peak, Welcoming Guest Peak was actually a blessed grotto-heaven. Its entrance simply happened to be located on the peak.

This grotto-heaven was of considerable scale, spanning about nine hundred miles in circumference—practically a small world unto itself. Spiritual qi permeated the air, spiritual plants and spirit beasts were everywhere, creating a harmonious paradise.

The Immortal Arts Stage sat at the center of this grotto-heaven. Around it, tall pavilions and elegant buildings had been constructed for easy viewing, all in a beautiful, tranquil environment.

"How luxurious—using a grotto-heaven as a competition venue."

"Holy Lands are just different. Unlike our Azure Cloud Sect, where grotto-heavens with such dense spiritual qi are reserved only for core disciples and elders."

"Indeed. Hundred Flowers Holy Land has deep foundations if they can bring out a grotto-heaven for their Immortal Arts Stage and guest accommodations."

Disciples and elders from various factions sighed with emotion.

The gap between Holy Lands and ordinary factions wasn't just in strength—it also showed in these hidden grotto-heavens.

Under the Grand Ascension elder's guidance, Supreme Mystery Holy Land's disciples and elders entered the grotto-heaven.

As for Xiao Fan, he wasn't going inside. Of course he would accompany Jiang Lanzhi, strolling through the Holy Land's sea of flowers to relieve their longing.

Jiang Lanzhi, full of tender affection, held his arm intimately as she introduced Hundred Flowers Holy Land to him.

Flying Immortal Flower Lake, Azure Flower Sea, Wonderland Flower Grove—every spot was a place where flowers bloomed magnificently within Hundred Flowers Holy Land. Countless female disciples wandered among them, truly like orioles and swallows, people like flowers, flowers like jade, and jade-like feet everywhere.

After walking for a while, like an intimate young couple, they sat down in a flower field. Watching the setting sun cast golden rays upon the world, adding a brilliant golden hue to this sea of flowers.

Jiang Lanzhi held his arm and rested her head on his shoulder, her face full of sweet smiles. She asked curiously:

"How did you come up with that? Creating a whole seven-colored cloud bridge—so flashy."

Xiao Fan answered honestly. "It wasn't my idea. Those elders came up with it themselves. You know me—I'm very low-key."

Jiang Lanzhi laughed charmingly, utterly enchanting.

She said: "Your elders are quite romantic."

Xiao Fan thought about it. That made sense. It was probably the Grand Elder's bad influence. When those at the top weren't proper, those below followed suit—surely the Grand Elder had started it.

He nodded in agreement. "You don't know these elders' true faces. On the surface they look like immortal sages, all dignified and proper. But behind closed doors, who knows how many people are doing group cultivation?"

"Group cultivation? What does that mean?" Jiang Lanzhi asked, confused.

"You know, frolicking together? Like one dragon with multiple phoenixes."

When Jiang Lanzhi heard this, her confusion vanished completely, replaced by a crimson blush. She pouted: "Always talking nonsense. Can't you be serious for once?"

Xiao Fan tilted her chin up and grinned mischievously. "Nonsense? I'll let you experience it someday—then you'll know if I'm talking nonsense."

Jiang Lanzhi pinched him hard. You actually want to play those kinds of games with me? You're too fickle!

"Ow, that hurts!" Xiao Fan yelped.

Jiang Lanzhi immediately let go, anxiously checking on him while saying remorsefully: "It's my fault. I'm sorry. Let me see—did I hurt you?"

Xiao Fan had been faking. Pain? Him? Seeing no one around, he suddenly pushed Jiang Lanzhi down.

"Ah!" Jiang Lanzhi let out a startled cry but didn't resist. Her limpid peach-blossom eyes shimmered with endless spring, carrying a coy, inviting allure.

Surrounded by the intoxicating fragrance of flowers, with a beauty in his arms, a gentle breeze swept past, blowing Jiang Lanzhi's hair across her delicate face like a dancing veil. She looked like an immortal from a painting—flawlessly perfect.

Unless he were impotent, no man could resist such temptation.

Xiao Fan said nothing, simply gazing at her—at Jiang Lanzhi lying in the flower field, flowers pressed beneath her. Like appreciating an exquisite work of art, naturally formed.

Cherry lips glistening, dainty nose upturned, peach-blossom eyes full of spring with delicate brows dancing—paired with her slightly baby-fat cheeks, crystal-clear and flawless. This sudden confrontation brought a shy blush to her pretty face.

"You're so mean, pretending to be hurt just to trick me," Jiang Lanzhi pouted coquettishly—more like being playfully spoiled.

Her hands were gently pinned to the ground by Xiao Fan. She could easily break free with just a bit of effort, but she didn't.

After that brief protest, she seemed to feel it sounded like coquetry, so she turned her head away in embarrassment, not letting Xiao Fan see the guilt in her eyes.

Xiao Fan propped himself up with one hand, covering Jiang Lanzhi beneath him. His other hand brushed aside her wind-blown hair, tucking it behind her ear so it wouldn't obstruct his view of her beauty.

After that, he gently caressed her face, tenderly turning her averted head back to face him.

Their eyes met, exchanging unspoken affection. In Jiang Lanzhi's beautiful eyes, a tide of spring had risen, but as a woman newly awakened to desire, she couldn't bring herself to speak it.

Xiao Fan smiled softly. "Lanzhi, you're so beautiful."

"Bad boy, always teasing me," Jiang Lanzhi said bashfully, her delicate brows trembling.

Xiao Fan had his own rhythm.

Jiang Lanzhi whispered shyly: "Not here—people are always coming and going."

Xiao Fan didn't mind, but he also didn't want his woman seen by others.

With a wave of his hand, he brought them both into the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda.

"No problems now, right?"

"Mm."

Jiang Lanzhi's soft hands traced upward, hooking around Xiao Fan's neck, climbing to his ear and giving it a playful bite.

"You're so bad, always playing with me."

Seeing Jiang Lanzhi so full of desire—

Absence makes the heart grow fonder. As a new bride, Jiang Lanzhi craved his affection, her peach-blossom eyes overflowing with longing.

Jiang Lanzhi's breathing grew heavy, her pretty face beaded with crystalline perspiration. Her originally straight hair was now somewhat disheveled, clinging to her face. Combined with the flush of passion, she was even more captivating.

Her gaze was somewhat unfocused, clearly still immersed in the recent pleasure—more satisfying than ascending to immortality. That soul-shaking ecstasy was utterly addictive. Was this what it meant to feel like one was floating among the clouds?

Xiao Fan gazed at Jiang Lanzhi's lovely face as she exhaled fragrantly, her breath warm against his face, reigniting his fire.

At this moment, the song "Mistake in the Flower Field" seemed rather fitting.

Making a mistake in the flower field...
