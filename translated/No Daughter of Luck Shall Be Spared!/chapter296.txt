Standing outside the gates of Yaochi Immortal Palace, the woman of peerless sanctity was none other than Jiang Lanzhi.

She had followed Xiao Fan's trail, and after many twists and turns, had finally tracked him down.

"Yaochi Immortal Palace."

The more Jiang Lanzhi looked, the more puzzled she became. After a moment's thought, she decided to knock.

Before she could make a move, a dashing young man in snow-white robes descended before her, a gentle smile on his lips and longing in his eyes.

Jiang Lanzhi's red lips parted, delight and surprise rendering her momentarily at a loss. Her jade hands rose instinctively to cover her mouth.

The tender affection in her peach-blossom eyes bloomed in full.

"Husband."

Unable to contain her excitement, Jiang Lanzhi took quick, delicate steps and threw herself into Xiao Fan's arms like a returning swallow.

Her face was exquisite, her figure graceful, her refined features alight with joy. Her fair, porcelain-smooth cheeks were flushed with warmth.

Like a fairy among flowers—brows arched elegantly, trailing fragrant wind—she was soft as water as she fell into his embrace.

Xiao Fan's expression was equally tender. He gently wrapped his arm around her slender waist.

The two held each other close. No saccharine words were needed—silence spoke louder than any declaration.

After a long while, Jiang Lanzhi reluctantly pulled away from his arms, her cheeks crimson.

"It's been so long, Lanzhi." Xiao Fan caressed her face, his voice soft.

"Husband, Lanzhi missed you so much too."

Jiang Lanzhi was a little embarrassed. Before coming, she'd imagined countless reunion scenarios and rehearsed all sorts of sweet nothings to tell him.

But the moment she saw him, joy overwhelmed her mind. All those prepared words became superfluous—nothing compared to being held in his arms in wordless, tender silence.

"Come on, let me take you inside." Xiao Fan took Jiang Lanzhi's hand—slim, warm, intimately laced with his—and led her into Yaochi Immortal Palace.

Jiang Lanzhi thought nothing of it and followed his lead.

Within the palace grounds, Xiao Fan had a private courtyard of his own.

He brought Jiang Lanzhi there. Streams murmured softly, birds sang among fragrant flowers—a picture of serene elegance.

A beauty by his side, longing etched deep in their bones, the two drew ever closer.

In a pavilion at the center of a lake, they sat on stone chairs, watching the water. Lotus blossoms perfumed the air, fish darted lazily beneath the surface—the very image of a scholar and his beloved amid a garden paradise.

A gentle breeze carried the fragrance of lotus. Pad pressed against pad, swaying softly. It was pure bliss.

Jiang Lanzhi clung to Xiao Fan's arm, her head resting softly against his shoulder, beautiful eyes closed as she savored this moment of peace and warmth.

Xiao Fan let nature take its course, gently cradling the beauty's waist and letting her nestle into his embrace.

"Husband." Jiang Lanzhi suddenly spoke.

"Hm?" Xiao Fan replied.

Her voice was tender with laughter. "Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice."

Xiao Fan chuckled. "Oh? You dare tease me?"

He tickled her belly lightly, knowing full well that this was her weak spot.

Sure enough, Jiang Lanzhi doubled over with laughter, begging for mercy: "Husband, Lanzhi... knows she was... haha... wrong!"

Xiao Fan showed no mercy, not stopping until her face was thoroughly flushed.

Jiang Lanzhi clung to his waist, utterly drained.

She pouted at him, eyes full of reproach. "Hmph, you're terrible. You know exactly where I'm ticklish and you target it on purpose."

Xiao Fan grinned. "Learned your lesson? That's what you get for teasing me."

Jiang Lanzhi's cheeks reddened even further. Was that really teasing?

No—what am I thinking?!

As my husband's woman, how can I have such improper thoughts?

Will he think I'm indecent?!

Through the bond of One Heart Same Body, Xiao Fan could feel Jiang Lanzhi's emotions. I haven't even started anything suggestive, and her mind is already racing there?!

Unaware that her thoughts had been exposed, Jiang Lanzhi hurried to change the subject. "Husband, I have so many things I want to tell you. Do you want to hear them?"

Sensing the shifts in her heart, Xiao Fan found her endearingly adorable. Even a divine maiden of pristine beauty could have very human urges in his presence.

Not that he could blame her.

"Of course I want to hear. I want to know how my Lanzhi has been all these years." Xiao Fan gazed at the beauty in his arms and slowly lowered his head.

Jiang Lanzhi closed her eyes in anticipation, her eyelashes trembling.

Mm—!

This man just loves taking advantage of me. I haven't even started talking and he's already sealing my lips!

She fumed inwardly: You won't let me speak? Then neither of us gets to!

She reached up and hooked her arms around Xiao Fan's neck, presenting her clove-scented tongue to him, offering herself freely. In return, she savored the tenderness and affection he poured into every moment.

A long while later, their lips parted.

Jiang Lanzhi whipped her head away, too flustered to meet his gaze. The blush on her face was impossible to hide—how mortifying!

She scrambled to fill the silence, her deflection clumsy, her words rushed.

"Husband, let me tell you about what I've been through these years."

"Sure."

In soft, gentle tones, Jiang Lanzhi recounted her experiences.

After Xiao Fan had ascended, the One Heart Same Body bond had also elevated her to Grand Ascension realm.

With her cultivation experience from a previous life, ascending to immortality wasn't difficult. She only needed a decade or two of quiet cultivation to stabilize her realm.

Then another three to five years to prepare tribulation materials and pills—within twenty years, she could ascend.

For an unrivaled genius, leaping from Grand Ascension to immortality in twenty years was practically the blink of an eye.

She'd assumed it would be over twenty years before she could ascend and reunite with Xiao Fan.

Yet thanks to One Heart Same Body, barely a few years had passed before she was ready to ascend.

"Husband, you must have been adventuring through uncharted secret realms constantly, pushing yourself so hard. My cultivation would sometimes spike unexpectedly—that was all because of your efforts, wasn't it?"

Jiang Lanzhi gazed at Xiao Fan with eyes brimming with tender affection, at this man she thought of day and night, who haunted her dreams.

Her heart was sweet as honey.

In her eyes, Xiao Fan was incredibly talented, strikingly handsome, extraordinarily diligent in cultivation, and knew how to cherish her.

Simply put—the perfect partner.

Xiao Fan listened to her account, and his expression shifted.

He knew his own cultivation history better than anyone. Aside from the final Primordial Chaos Grand Luo Fruit that elevated his realm—

Every other sudden spike in cultivation was the result of... dual cultivation sessions with two or three partners.

That was a truth he absolutely could not reveal.

His love for Jiang Lanzhi was real. His concealment was also real. Everything was real.

Xiao Fan could only laugh at himself and say:

"What choice did I have? We share One Heart Same Body. If I don't push myself, how can you grow quickly?"

"If you can't ascend sooner, how can I see you sooner?"

"And if I can't see you, the longing eats me alive. I'm afraid my heart would break from missing you."

"I cultivated so hard solely to see you again as soon as possible."

His eyes were full of warmth, his face a portrait of tenderness as he gazed at the beauty in his arms.

But then he quickly turned away, ears reddening with apparent bashfulness—the image of a prodigy gone, replaced by a lovesick young man.

This rare display of shyness from Xiao Fan made Jiang Lanzhi feel as though she'd discovered a new world.

He... he said he missed me?!

He said he cultivated so hard just to see me sooner, to be reunited?!

Jiang Lanzhi's heart overflowed with tenderness like the Milky Way breaching its banks, impossible to contain.

"Husband, you're blushing." She laughed, voice sweet as bells.

Xiao Fan put on a straight face and denied it, fooling absolutely no one.

This only excited Jiang Lanzhi more—wasn't this proof of his love?!

She felt certain she'd chosen the right man. He was the one she'd been waiting for.

Emotions running high, impossible to suppress any longer, Jiang Lanzhi's body began to react—a rising heat.

Her exquisite face took on an unusual flush, her voice growing languid and entwined with feeling. She wasn't trying to be seductive, yet her natural allure was devastating.

"Husband... your wife misses you so much."

Why were such words escaping her lips?

Xiao Fan lowered his gaze to the beauty in his arms.

In her peach-blossom eyes, he saw desire.

Desire like fire, consuming her inch by inch, burning so fiercely it threatened to devour her whole.

This fire needed to be quenched.

Xiao Fan's arms tightened, pressing her close, never to let go.

Mandarin ducks nuzzled in the lake below.

In the pavilion above, flowers bloomed and withered.
