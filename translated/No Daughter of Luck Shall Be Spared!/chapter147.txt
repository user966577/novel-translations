Chapter 147: All For Sister

With Li Yutong's cooperation, Xiao Fan plucked another red plum blossom.

Similar faces, completely different sensations.

Li Yuxian had just stepped out to calm herself. When she returned, she found her fears had come true.

Though she'd guessed what would happen, actually seeing it was still hard to accept.

Creak—

She pushed open the thatched cottage door. What met her eyes was an image she'd never forget.

"Yutong, you!" Li Yuxian exclaimed in shock.

Xiao Fan said coldly: "To save you, she chose to sacrifice herself and become my woman."

"You're free now."

Li Yuxian was jealous. Well played, you schemer. So this was your plan all along.

Though she knew he was playing the villain for her sake, what woman would be generous enough to share her man with someone else?

Yet watching the two of them intertwined, a strange feeling arose in her heart.

You love acting, do you? I'll let you act.

Under Li Yutong's astonished gaze, Li Yuxian...

"You're too much! Didn't you say you wouldn't touch my sister?"

"Am I not enough?"

"What do you think?" He said excitedly—actually speaking for Li Yutong to hear.

He transmitted secretly: "Enough. But thinking about how your sister looks exactly like you, and how one day she might marry someone else—it pains me, as if you were marrying another man. I won't allow such a thing to happen."

"I can only suppress my anguish and keep her by my side. Trust me—I only love her body because it resembles yours."

"As I've always said, I'm someone who values inner substance greatly. Everything about you—even mere resemblance—I refuse to let go."

"I had no choice but to resort to this. 'If love is meant to last, need it be together day and night?'"

Li Yuxian, who'd been somewhat annoyed, heard his words and her heart softened again. He just loves me too much. That's why he's like this.

Fine. I wouldn't be at ease if my sister ended up with someone else anyway. Having her by my side, I can still look after her.

She understood, really. Her sister wouldn't let go of her. The only solution was for them to share.

But doing this means you'll be an irredeemable villain in my sister's eyes.

"Aren't you afraid of her revenge?"

"Hmph. I, Xiao Fan, need not explain my actions to anyone."

The two conversed. Li Yutong couldn't understand, but she could roughly guess the meaning.

Her sister wanted to sacrifice herself so she could go free!

No way. Her sister had to be the one who went free!

And so, Li Yutong tried to drive Li Yuxian away.

"Sister, I'll save you and get you out. Will you leave first?"

"Sister, don't I also want to save you?"

...

Happy times always pass too quickly.

One month later.

Xiao Fan lay in the middle, embracing both sides.

Now they really were as close as sisters.

Li Yuxian had also come to terms with it. Her sister's personality would never let her find a man. The current balance was already the best outcome.

The Wu Tribe truly deserved their reputation for powerful physiques—able to endure for so long. Fortunately, Xiao Fan was no weakling either. The Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art had already entered the Dragon-Elephant stage, and his physical body had undergone a qualitative transformation.

Plus he'd obtained that precious pill. After refining and absorbing it, he'd grown even stronger.

Li Yutong faced reality: "Enough talk. Hurry up and let my sister go."

"Really? But it seems like you need Yuxian more than I do." Xiao Fan said with his trademark half-smile.

"Shut up!" She said weakly.

"I was just protecting my sister."

Xiao Fan didn't argue. Let her make her excuses—what did it matter?

"Fine. A day as husband and wife means a hundred days of grace. You're both my women now. I'll grant you both your freedom."

Xiao Fan planted a gentle kiss on Li Yuxian's forehead, tender as water.

"Hmph. Don't even think about it. Who's your woman?" Li Yutong snorted.

"Oh, you won't admit it? Next time Yuxian and I play, we won't invite you."

"No matter what, you're both mine now. That's an unchangeable fact."

Xiao Fan let them leave. Though the Wu God Blood had been refined by him, that ugly Wu God Sword and the Wu God Legacy were still in his hands.

He gave the Wu God Sword and the legacy to Li Yuxian—deliberately not giving them to Li Yutong.

Li Yuxian was a Confucian cultivator who dealt in literary arts, not martial weapons. So she gave the sword to Li Yutong.

Of course, she asked Xiao Fan first and got his permission.

Xiao Fan was quite pleased. This woman was obedient and knew to consider his feelings.

Xiao Fan nodded: "Those are your things. Give them to whoever you want."

"You're so good to me." Li Yuxian hooked her arm through his and leaned against his shoulder, utterly sweet.

Li Yutong was a bit jealous. Well, if not for him, she wouldn't have been able to claim her sister either. Maybe they'd have to share in the future.

She gladly accepted the Wu God Sword that her sister Li Yuxian gave her.

With this Wu God Sword and the Wu God Legacy, even without collecting all the Wu God Blood, she could still report back successfully.

However, when Li Yutong saw the Wu God Legacy, her expression shifted:

"With this legacy, I'm essentially halfway to the position of Wu Tribe Lord."

"Oh, that's nice. So when I visit your Wu Tribe in the future, I'll be half a host." Xiao Fan laughed.

Li Yutong said nothing in response.

Because this legacy was truly important. With it, her status in the tribe would rise dramatically.

Plus Wu Chen was already dead—one less competitor. As long as she made no mistakes, the position of Wu Tribe Lord was practically guaranteed!

Li Yuxian was also happy for her. Though she'd joined another sect, she was still Wu Tribe. Seeing her sister's bright future, she felt quite proud.

After leaving the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda, Li Yuxian and Li Yutong concealed their forms and departed Supreme Mystery Holy Land. Ordinary cultivators couldn't detect them at all.

Before they left, Xiao Fan asked them for a favor.

"Wipe out that Wu God Sect, along with all the Wu Tribe in this realm."

"No problem." Before Li Yutong could speak, Li Yuxian had already agreed.

Li Yutong said nothing, only pouted. Sister treats him even better than she treats me. Not happy.

As for the Wu Tribe Divine Maiden's infiltration—

Those who could see chose to either indulge or spoil Xiao Fan, not interfering.

Xiao Fan also felt that in this session of three-way intimacy, he'd claimed two more maidenhoods.

And they were maidenhoods of the same origin. His cultivation surged, reaching late-stage Grand Ascension. Ascension to immortality was imminent.

Li Yutong and Li Yuxian returned to the Dark Abyss.

The mortal realm's Wu Tribe ants meant nothing to them. Exterminating a tribe? Nothing special.

Especially for Li Yutong, who'd been in the lower realm for years. Such things were as common as meals.

The first day after the two departed, the Wu God Sect was struck by an unprecedented meteor shower. Enormous rocks brought curtains of fire falling from the sky.

The smallest one was five miles across. With no warning whatsoever, they appeared out of nowhere and descended upon the Wu God Sect with thunderous force.

Heaven-destroying, earth-shattering explosions echoed through the firmament. The Wu God Sect's mountain-protecting grand formation hadn't even activated before it was destroyed. All that awaited them was despair and agony.

Everything within a 40,000-mile radius was reduced to scorched earth. Not a blade of grass survived.

As for those Body Integration and Grand Ascension cultivators, along with the lucky few who somehow survived—someone would go around finishing them off one by one.

That same day, in the Dark Abyss, violent spatial fluctuations swept through the entire Wu Tribe like a tempest.

They had nowhere to run. The spatial rift that had been their hiding place was both a sturdy fortress and a solid prison.

A massive explosion within a sealed fortress—countless Wu Tribe members tried to flee, but the attack came too suddenly. No one escaped alive.

The remnants of the Wu Tribe in this realm were annihilated.

No one knew what had happened there. People only knew that blood qi soared to the heavens from that direction. Quite a few must have died.

...

Xiao Fan walked through his palace. Xinxi saw him looking pleased with himself, still carrying the scent of women. No need to guess what had happened.

"Holy Son." Xinxi approached and greeted him respectfully.

"Oh, Xinxi. What brings you here? The weather's lovely today. How about we go outside for some air and sunshine?"

People were in high spirits during happy occasions. Xiao Fan's cultivation had increased significantly—mainly because he'd had in-depth exchanges with the Li sisters.

Mortal emperors with power kept three palaces, six courts, and seventy-two consorts. As a cultivator with a powerful background, exceptional talent, and a Desolate Primordial Kidney Body, how could he lose to a mortal in this regard?

"Sure. Wherever the Holy Son wants to go, Xinxi will follow." She smiled sweetly.

"Oh, and this is for you, Holy Son." Xinxi handed Xiao Fan a dark purple gourd.

Xiao Fan opened it and found it filled with tiny pills—dark purple, unlabeled. He'd just call them little dark purple pills for now.

"What's this?"

"You asked me to deal with the person inside that Wu Tribe Divine Son's body. I discovered he was actually the remnant soul of a Grand Luo Golden Immortal. Killing him outright seemed wasteful."

"So I refined him, erased his consciousness, shattered his divine soul into soul fragments, and refined them into this gourd of Soul-Nourishing Pills."

"A Grand Luo Golden Immortal's soul will greatly benefit your divine soul cultivation." Xinxi said.

Seemed wasteful to just kill him, so she recycled him?

Not bad. You understand conservation.

Xiao Fan accepted it, but seemed to remember something.

"Xinxi, can this treat divine soul injuries?"

"Yes. As long as the cultivation doesn't exceed Golden Immortal, it can have healing effects."

"Good. You really are my thoughtful little treasure. I love you to death." Xiao Fan excitedly embraced Xinxi and planted a kiss on her.

"Holy Son, you... you..."

How could Xinxi handle such stimulation? This happiness came too suddenly!

Looking at Xinxi's flushed face and slightly trembling body, Xiao Fan felt he might have gone a bit too far.

He pinched Xinxi's pretty cheek and smiled: "My Xinxi really is the most thoughtful."

He'd never forgotten—there was still a dragon girl in the Myriad Dragon Nest.

He'd been busy with other matters before and hadn't had time. Now that he was free, Xinxi had delivered these soul-healing pills. If that wasn't thoughtful, what was?

In boys' dreams, "dragon knight" was usually one of the options—in every sense of the word.
