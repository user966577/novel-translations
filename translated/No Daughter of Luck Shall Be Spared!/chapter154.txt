Chapter 154: Xiao Fan's Motivation for Cultivation

Time with Su Yiyun was joyful and sweet. Her unique first-love flavor let Xiao Fan feel both love and tenderness.

He was preparing to bid farewell to Master Yu'er, then make a trip home. But then, the system's voice rang out.

"Two Realms Gate? Don't tell me it's something that lets you travel between realms?" Xiao Fan guessed.

[Yes, you guessed correctly.]

[For the Host's convenience in traveling, this system has specially prepared a Two Realms Gate.

Two Realms Gate: Allows the Host to freely travel between the mortal and immortal realms. If the Host doesn't want to run back and forth, you can also use the Two Realms Gate to bring your people up to the immortal realm, sparing them the hardship of tribulation.]

[This is how we cheaters cultivate—one person becomes immortal, the whole family ascends. No, the whole clan ascends!]

"This..."

Xiao Fan understood. Wasn't this just smuggling into the immortal realm?

Oh, I'm doing the smuggling? Then it's fine.

With this Two Realms Gate, Xiao Fan didn't really need to say goodbye anymore.

Still, he should visit Master Yu'er.

He walked to the Holy Lord's Mountain, heading straight for Qingyu's palace. Qingyu seemed to know he was coming—she stood waiting at the palace entrance beforehand.

Her smile was radiant, her vermilion face lovely, her crescent brows showing tender spring feelings.

Today she wore a light red dress, quite unlike her usual style. Her lips seemed redder and more lustrous than usual too, as if she'd deliberately applied rouge. Her delicate face wore a light layer of makeup, making her extraordinarily enchanting.

Without any makeup, she was already a world-class beauty. Today's light makeup made her even more stunningly peerless.

But as always, her delicate jade feet remained bare under the swaying red dress, flashing a strange luster—like a pair of treasures.

Xiao Fan stared, somewhat dazed. Master, you're dressed far too alluringly today.

"What, you come looking for me but won't speak? What's wrong with you!" Qingyu suppressed her smile, keeping a straight face.

Xiao Fan smiled. What was Master Yu'er up to? Playing the stern master today?

"No laughing. Be serious, understand?" Qingyu said, trying to stay serious.

But she couldn't keep up the act either.

"Fine, fine, I'll be serious."

"Come on, just cooperate with me, will you?" Qingyu's face fell—still excessively beautiful, just with a different flavor.

"Alright, alright, I'll cooperate." Xiao Fan said with a smile.

"Forget it. I can't pull off the cold act. Never mind." With that, Qingyu walked over with a smile, taking his arm and leading him to a nearby seat.

Xiao Fan shook his head inwardly. I haven't even started my rebellious-disciple-violating-master routine, and you're already doing the master-violating-disciple thing.

Qingyu chatted animatedly with him, her gestures very intimate. If outsiders saw this, who would believe they were master and disciple?

But when Su Yiyun came up, Qingyu said somewhat sourly: "Quite impressive of you, even shielding Yiyun through her tribulation."

Xiao Fan said: "I was just doing what I could. Besides, Yiyun is your disciple too. Why are you jealous of your own disciple?"

"Tch, who's jealous? What nonsense are you spouting?" Qingyu turned her head away, ignoring him.

Xiao Fan cupped her face and kissed her. At first Qingyu wanted to resist, but it was only token resistance—she pushed a few times before actively hooking her arms around Xiao Fan's neck.

Tenderness and sweetness instantly bloomed in Qingyu's heart. This rebellious disciple was getting more and more outrageous—actually daring to put his hands on me!

No, I can't lose to him!

Of course Qingyu wouldn't lose to Xiao Fan. Fortunately, Xiao Fan's stamina wasn't weak either, allowing him to match her.

After a long while, their lips parted. Qingyu's face was covered in rosy blush, exceptionally alluring.

"Rebellious disciple!" she scolded coquettishly.

Xiao Fan simply pulled her into his embrace. Though Qingyu said this, her heart was quite fond of this feeling. Her jade hands unconsciously climbed around his waist, holding this rebellious disciple tight.

The two spent a good while in tender intimacy. Xiao Fan chatted with her about many things, talking freely. Qingyu learned that Xiao Fan would soon ascend to the immortal realm.

She took out a treasure she'd prepared in advance and gave it to Xiao Fan.

"Master, what's this?"

What Qingyu gave him was an unremarkable golden pearl, about the size of a lychee. Strange symbols were carved on its surface. When Xiao Fan's divine sense probed it, he found hundreds of millions of symbols carved on this tiny pearl's surface.

Moreover, they weren't ordinary symbols. These symbols flowed and linked inside, as if possessing sentience—sometimes forming flowers, sometimes growing dense as a forest, or perhaps sweeping like wind, ever-changing.

"This is the Myriad Wishes Pearl I made for you. It can transform into various immortal artifacts according to your wishes. Common weapons like sabers, spears, swords, and halberds have over a hundred forms."

"I carved hundreds of millions of formation patterns into it. Whatever immortal artifact you can imagine, it can produce. Not only that, it has self-learning capabilities. You can have it imitate other immortal artifacts, and eventually it will evolve on its own, memorizing everything about that artifact—color, size, even structure and power."

"This took me quite a while to make, and its grade isn't low either—minimum third-grade immortal artifact."

Qingyu thought proudly to herself. Watching Xiao Fan's shocked expression, her heart couldn't be happier.

Xiao Fan was stunned. According to the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art, there was a grade classification for immortal artifact treasures.

Immortal artifacts had nine grades, with ninth being lowest and first being best.

Above immortal artifacts were sacred artifacts—things used by Saints, beyond the scope of immortals.

And Qingyu had directly created this Myriad Wishes Pearl. It must have taken her eight or ten thousand years.

Xiao Fan accepted it without saying much, only repaying this affection through action.

Qingyu was lifted into Xiao Fan's arms, somewhat dazed. What was he going to do? Wait, what could he do?

From confusion to shock to delighted moaning—Qingyu's two exquisite, petite, crystalline jade feet tensed, all five jade toes curling, the fair insteps straightening, her soles arching into crescent moons.

Her two straight, beautiful legs also tensed.

Qingyu's eyes misted with tears as she looked at Xiao Fan, her heart's sweetness completely blooming.

"Re... rebellious disciple! Always messing around." Qingyu chided, though without much force behind it—even carrying a hint of charm.

Xiao Fan didn't mind. This counted as having a proper exchange with his master.

A glint of mischief flashed in Qingyu's eyes. Making him bully her like this—she'd show him by treating him the same way.

Xiao Fan was pushed down by Qingyu. Under his startled gaze, Master's mouth... "Mm."

...

The wonderful pleasure with his master made Xiao Fan even more determined in his motivation for cultivation. No matter what, he'd aim to become a Saint within a hundred years.

No—ten years to Sainthood!

With his goal set, Xiao Fan returned to his own palace to pack, preparing to go home.

He'd tell his parents, then immediately become an immortal.

He didn't want to be a mortal for another day.

"Xinxi, let's go."

"Go? Where are we going, Holy Son?"

"Home. Then, becoming immortal." Xiao Fan said solemnly.

"Alright."

"Where's Ningbing? She should come home with me too." Xiao Fan figured he'd bring her along, planning to take her and Long Aotian up to heaven together.

Hearing Xiao Fan's call, Long Ningbing came over. But she spoke timidly:

"This soon? Meeting the parents already?"

"Do I need to prepare something?"
