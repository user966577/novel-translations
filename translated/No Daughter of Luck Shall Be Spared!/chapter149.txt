Chapter 149: Xiao Fan's Cultivation, Wu Chen's Sister

Setting aside his thoughts, Xiao Fan returned to his palace's cultivation chamber.

He began nurturing his dragon-elephant particles.

His cultivation had already peaked, but his strength still had room for growth.

The dragon-elephant particles hadn't fully awakened yet. Now was the perfect opportunity to fully awaken them all and use his immortal ascension tribulation to transform them into primordial elephants.

Another transformation!

The pill Master Yu'er had given him had been crafted from countless precious medicines and divine materials, using the heart blood of the five primordial elemental divine beasts as a catalyst. The energy contained within was enough to cultivate Xiao Fan all the way to Grand Luo.

He didn't need external resources now. He only needed to draw medicinal power from that pill.

And so.

Xiao Fan calmed his mind and began drawing upon the divine pill hidden in his sea of consciousness. But this time, he discovered something extraordinary about the pill.

The space around it was incredibly stable, yet had eight gates opening outward, controlling the release of medicinal power within.

Xiao Fan's divine sense entered through one of the gates. What met his eyes was an endless starry sky. Billions of stars glittered, with five positioned at the center. The five elemental powers flowed endlessly, accompanied by dense blood qi.

That must be the heart blood of the five elemental divine beasts.

The more Xiao Fan looked, the more astonished he became. The pill's interior was actually a world—a grand world filled with billions of stars. Only instead of celestial bodies, it contained an ocean of precious medicines and divine materials as numerous as the stars.

"A dust-mote world. A single speck of dust can contain an entire grand world. Has Yu'er Master's realm really reached such terrifying heights?"

Xiao Fan was moved. A pill the size of a dragon's eye contained a world of boundless size. Such methods were unfathomable.

When would he ever be able to claim Master Yu'er?

"System, what exactly is Yu'er Master's strength? What realm has she reached?"

[The Sacred Realm above the Immortal Realm. Moreover, she's a powerhouse among Sacred Realm experts. Already transcendent. Figure it out yourself.]

Xiao Fan fell silent. Sacred Realm? The lowest was a Saint?

"What about Xinxi?"

[Primordial Grand Luo Golden Immortal. Only one step away from the Sacred Realm. But becoming a Saint means being bound by the Immortal Realm's Heavenly Dao, unable to descend to the mortal world at will.

To transcend the Immortal Realm's Heavenly Dao would take who knows how many years. She's unwilling to leave your side and has been delaying her breakthrough, just to stay with you.]

Xiao Fan had some understanding now. Words were unnecessary. Become immortal!

I never let any woman down.

He began drawing medicinal power, channeling it into his giant elephant particles. A single particle instantly received massive medicinal energy—supreme power containing the mysteries of creation.

The elephant particle, nourished by the pure medicinal power, immediately began to expand.

At a certain critical point—crack!

The giant elephant shattered, shedding its old shell. An even more majestic, dignified, handsome and divine creature emerged—mighty as a barbarian elephant, bodied like a divine dragon. A dragon-elephant broke free from its cocoon.

This was just one particle.

One particle after another shattered. Simultaneously, tens of millions of particles awakened.

Time ticked by. More and more dragon-elephant particles awakened.

Thirty million dragon-elephants...

Eighty million dragon-elephants...

One hundred thirty million dragon-elephants...

One hundred eighty million dragon-elephants...

Over three months, Xiao Fan transformed every giant elephant particle in his body into dragon-elephants. He now possessed a dragon-elephant body.

Momentum like a dragon, might like an elephant!

With his dragon-elephant body complete, Xiao Fan continued cultivating the techniques beyond the Gates of Hell.

Sovereign Body—a method for creating divine elephants. Absorb all damage and convert it into one's own energy. Open the Sovereign Eye at the brow center to see through all illusions, leaving nothing hidden.

This technique was extremely powerful. Once mastered, illusions would have no effect on him—he would perceive all.

After that came the Divine Domain of the Gods.

Comprehend the laws of time and space. Using himself as the center, forge a domain called the Divine Domain.

Within the Divine Domain, Xiao Fan would become impervious to all techniques, banishing evil, eternally free—a god.

Once mastered, all attacks could be converted into his own power. True absolute defense.

Xiao Fan cultivated with focused mind, comprehending these two techniques. It took two and a half months to master them both.

A vertical eye opened at his brow center. Normally, there was no trace of it. But when needed, it would radiate golden divine light, sweeping away all illusions. This was the Sovereign Eye.

Beyond this, his Divine Domain of the Gods had achieved minor completion. The domain wasn't large yet—only able to transform an area of about fifty miles into his territory.

Legend said the Divine Domain of the Gods, when mastered to great completion, could envelop an entire world, becoming a truly eternal and free god.

But he was satisfied. A fifty-mile invincible zone with his Divine Domain of the Gods added another life-saving trump card.

Beyond this, his cultivation of Yin-Yang Reversal couldn't fall behind either. This was a supreme technique that could absorb damage and reflect it back—also a pinnacle art.

Without distraction, Xiao Fan continued his cultivation.

On the Holy Son's Mountain.

The dragon girl Long Ningbing was being looked after by Xinxi. Without a supreme yang treasure for protection, if her pure yin energy went berserk, her life could be in danger.

Long Ningbing was very obedient. She didn't wander around, only playing on the Holy Son's Mountain. However, in the Holy Son's Mountain's stables—

She discovered five-clawed golden dragons.

Nine of them.

Seeing no one around, she curiously approached and carefully examined these nine golden dragons.

Meeting her own kind, some curiosity was natural.

"Why are you all here?" Long Ningbing asked curiously.

The dragon majesty emanating from Long Ningbing wasn't deliberately hidden or released. Yet that aura of noble bloodline constantly shook the nine golden dragons' spirits.

"This princess, where do you come from? Why does your bloodline feel so noble?" one golden dragon asked respectfully.

Clearly, it didn't recognize Long Ningbing. After all, a little dragon princess from over thirty thousand years ago—the time gap was too large. Not recognizing her was normal.

They were all new-generation dragons. The oldest wasn't even a thousand years old. Because of their outstanding talent, they'd been selected by the clan to serve as a young master's mounts.

The clan had specifically instructed them to behave once there. Anyone who misbehaved or acted arrogantly would have their dragon tendons stripped first.

Of course, if they performed well, once the young master grew powerful, their futures would be limitless.

That was the clan's message. They were curious—who was the young master?

But they were told not to ask what they shouldn't ask. Just obey orders.

"Princess?" She pointed at her dragon horns and said: "I'm just an ordinary little dragon, not whatever princess you're talking about."

She smiled as she spoke, not revealing her identity.

The golden dragons weren't stupid. The dragon race valued bloodline above all.

Your bloodline is this strong—even we five-clawed golden dragons can't compare. Even if you're not a princess now, you're definitely a future princess who's fallen into the mortal world.

But since she wasn't saying, these golden dragons didn't press.

Having rarely met her own kind, and five-clawed golden dragons at that, Long Ningbing's floodgates opened. She asked them about their backgrounds.

These five-clawed golden dragons had never met such a noble yet gentle dragon princess. They were happy to answer.

They each shared their stories.

Long Ningbing listened attentively, nodding from time to time.

She suddenly realized: "You're also dragons from the heavens?"

"Yes. So why'd you say 'also'—what do you mean?" One golden dragon caught the slip. The others nodded in agreement. Definitely a princess.

Long Ningbing was tongue-tied. How did I give myself away?

"You heard nothing, and I said nothing, okay?" Long Ningbing whispered conspiratorially.

The nine golden dragons exchanged glances, bewildered.

"Fine. We don't know you're a princess. Happy now?"

"Yes, thank you for keeping my secret." Long Ningbing said gratefully.

For a moment, the nine golden dragons felt this princess might not be very clever.

Still, they were happy to chat with Long Ningbing. Sitting in stables all day with nothing to do was quite boring.

Immortal Realm.

Wu Tribe territory, Northern Divine Region.

Li Yutong had returned to the Wu Tribe. Because she'd brought back the Wu God Sword and obtained the Wu God Legacy, even without collecting all the Wu God Blood—

Her status in the tribe had risen dramatically.

Returning with the Wu God Sword, she'd even alerted the Wu Tribe Ancestor from his seclusion. After confirming it was genuine—the legacy left by the Wu God—she was immediately groomed as the next Wu Tribe Lord.

She entered the Wu Tribe ancestral grounds for cultivation, with powerful protectors guarding her safety.

However, whenever Li Yutong looked at the Wu God Sword, she thought of her intimate days with her sister—except for Xiao Fan mixed in there, which annoyed her.

"Hmph. Once I'm stronger, I'll definitely kick you out of our trio." She snorted coldly in her heart.

The next moment, she became infinitely gentle, saying dreamily: "Only I can have sister."

Exclusive? Who knows if Xiao Fan would discipline her if he heard that thought.

At the same time, in the Mystic Woman Palace, Wu Chen's sister had just emerged from seclusion and learned of his death. Pain filled her heart.

Though this younger brother wasn't particularly outstanding, they shared blood. Losing a blood relative left her heartbroken.

"Young lady, our condolences." An old woman standing beside her said.

She took a deep breath, trying to calm her emotions.

"How did my brother die?"

The old woman said: "While collecting Wu God Blood in the lower realm, he was killed by a Holy Son from a mortal holy land."

"Killed by someone from the lower realm? Impossible. My brother was invincible under heaven. How could he possibly die at a mortal's hands?"

"Indeed. With the young master's strength, how could mortals possibly kill him? I believe one of his enemies must have assumed the Holy Son's identity, killed him, and framed the Holy Son." The old woman said.

"This is well-reasoned, because the clan elders tried to divine the killer but suffered backlash. This indicates that person has significant karmic ties." The old woman continued.

Wu Chen's sister was stunningly beautiful. Her tender jade hands clenched into fists.

"Which holy land in the lower realm?"

"Supreme Mystery Holy Land."

"Give me the location. I'll investigate personally."

"Young lady, you mustn't! Forcing your way out of seclusion was already a grave mistake. You should stabilize your realm first before making plans."

"Just get it."

The old woman couldn't dissuade her. She could only provide the information.

Soon, over a dozen graceful figures flew out from the Mystic Woman Palace.
