Chapter 126: Xiao Fan's Methods—Why Explain to Others?

The newcomer descended upon Hundred Flowers Holy Land with aggressive momentum.

His arrival immediately caused an uproar throughout the Holy Land.

Princess?

The only person who went by that title and had recently met with misfortune was Hong Rushuang.

"Holy shit, they came this fast?"

"Definitely not here on friendly terms."

"This guy's aura is insanely strong—even stronger than those three from before."

The elders of Hundred Flowers Holy Land immediately stepped forward to block the intruder.

"Who are you? Why are you causing a disturbance in our Holy Land?"

"Cut the crap. I want to see our Princess."

As he spoke, an invisible pressure burst forth, crashing against the entire Hundred Flowers Holy Land. Fortunately, the Holy Land had its foundations and was protected by defensive formations.

Grand Ascension pressure slammed against the formation, sending ripples spreading outward. Without the formation's barrier, that pressure alone would have injured countless disciples.

This newcomer was truly unreasonable!

"Holy crap, he attacks at the slightest disagreement? Is Hong Rushuang's family really this arrogant?"

"Completely disregarding Hundred Flowers Holy Land's dignity."

"I just felt threatened. If that pressure had hit me directly, I'd probably be unconscious by now." Some lower-cultivation disciples spoke fearfully.

"Exactly, same here."

Everyone looked at him with apprehension.

This newcomer had no manners—violence from the moment he arrived.

Moreover, his aura was strange. It felt powerful yet somehow transcendent—stronger than any Grand Ascension cultivator they'd ever encountered.

He wore black robes, his face cold, even tinged with an ashen hue. He wasn't human-shaped—a pair of wings extended from his back. Though currently folded, it was obvious this fellow was some kind of birdman.

His gaze was sharp and cold, his nose hooked like a beak. Ashen-colored feathers, like blades, gleamed with cold light.

The commotion drew out those inside. They emerged to investigate.

The Hundred Flowers Holy Land elders especially couldn't tolerate such provocation.

In an instant, two Grand Ascension elders mobilized, confronting the intruder.

"Fellow Daoist, what are you trying to do?"

"I told you, I want to see our Princess. Her name is Hong Rushuang."

The two Hundred Flowers Grand Ascension elders exchanged glances, naturally understanding what this was about.

Hong Rushuang had broken the rules and was at fault first. The Holy Master had been present and hadn't intervened, which meant tacit approval.

"Rushuang committed an offense and is currently being punished."

"Offense? Our Princess is never wrong. The only problem is you people failing to cooperate with her!" the hook-nosed man declared.

"I'll count to three. Let me see the Princess, or I'll level your Holy Land today."

"Such boasting. Then let me experience your 'techniques.'"

"Flower Rain Sword Formation!"

The Hundred Flowers elder attacked immediately. Countless flower petals drifted down, and where they landed, endless vines sprouted. The vines swayed, growing into towering trees in the blink of an eye.

Massive vines whipped about, their sharp branches soft yet blindingly fast—thousands of vines in motion, like thousands of swords dancing through the air.

"Interesting."

The hook-nosed man showed no fear. He simply spread his wings and beat them powerfully, creating a violent gale.

Within the wind swirled white light—those lights were actually swords condensed from wind. Thousands of wind blades mixed within the gale, clashing against the vines.

The wind blades were sharp; the vines were supple. Where they collided, the wind blades dissipated while the vines were completely severed, scattering across the ground.

This exchange ended in a draw, but both sides now had their measure of each other.

"What a formidable Grand Ascension cultivator. So this is the pinnacle of human strength?"

"He's not a Grand Ascension cultivator! No—more accurately, he's not human."

Ordinary people might not spot his strangeness, but the Hundred Flowers Grand Ascension elder had lived for ten thousand years. With her vast experience, she saw through his peculiarity at a glance.

"You're not human!" the Hundred Flowers Grand Ascension elder suddenly declared.

"What's it to you? I want to see the Princess. Be smart and bring her out quickly."

Their exchange instantly spread throughout the Holy Land.

"Not human? I knew that—he's got wings, obviously not human."

"Bullshit. If it were an ordinary cultivator, the elder wouldn't be surprised with her discernment."

"Right. The elder's surprise means she's never seen this person before—or rather, never seen this type of being. Does anyone recognize him? Or is there some royal house named Hong among humans?"

"Never heard of one."

The commotion was loud enough to draw out even Xiao Fan from the rear.

But wasn't he looking for the Princess?

Xiao Fan brought Hong Rushuang along, though in rather peculiar fashion.

Around her neck hung a black dog collar, and he led her out by the leash.

"What's all the noise? Can't you see I'm walking my dog?"

Xiao Fan dragged Hong Rushuang out, giving no face whatsoever.

His sudden appearance, along with Hong Rushuang on a leash—the spectacle shocked everyone the moment they stepped into view.

"This... this..."

"Damn, you can do that?"

"My brain is short-circuiting. Is no one going to stop him?"

Even the Hundred Flowers elders couldn't bear to watch.

"Holy Son, what is the meaning of this?"

After all, Hong Rushuang was still a Hundred Flowers disciple. Making her serve Jiang Lanzhi as a maid was an internal sect matter.

But you, Xiao Fan, treating her like a dog?

That was insulting Hundred Flowers Holy Land.

"Elders, I mean no disrespect to the Holy Land. You simply don't know the circumstances."

Xiao Fan spoke with certainty.

"Circumstances?"

The two elders exchanged glances, not entirely believing him. This concerned Hundred Flowers Holy Land's reputation. Without a proper explanation, they would absolutely demand answers from Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

"I hope the Holy Son can explain these circumstances. Otherwise, this matter won't be easily resolved."

Before Xiao Fan could respond, the hook-nosed man's eyes bulged, veins throbbing at his temples.

"Princess!"

"Such audacity! How dare you treat our Princess this way!"

The hook-nosed man was about to attack when Xiao Fan's hand shot to Hong Rushuang's throat, his voice cold with threat:

"One more step closer—she dies."

Silent thunder struck. Everyone stared at Xiao Fan in shock. What? He was using Hong Rushuang's life as a threat?

And it didn't look like a bluff.

Hong Rushuang's eyes were vacant, her spirit broken, like a walking corpse.

Under the crushing pressure, she helplessly clawed at Xiao Fan's hand, struggling, trying to break free—but to no avail.

The excessive force made her face flush crimson. She began coughing violently, though the grip was so tight she couldn't even cough properly.

No one had expected Xiao Fan to pull something like this. Was this how a Holy Son of the righteous path should behave?

Everyone felt a hint of fear. The Holy Son seemed to have split personalities—extremely gentle when gentle, unreasonably violent when violent.

Strange looks were cast his way, but he didn't care about his image. Whatever.

"Stop!"

The hook-nosed man roared, not daring any rash moves. He'd seen genuine killing intent in Xiao Fan's eyes.

"You tell me to stop and I stop? Wouldn't that make me look weak?" As he spoke, he squeezed harder. Hong Rushuang's neck made cracking sounds.

Her once-cold, beautiful face turned pale, even somewhat twisted.

The hook-nosed man wanted to speak, but the last time he'd called out, Xiao Fan had immediately increased the pressure. If he made another wrong move, the Princess would die!

When that happened, the Witch-Yao King's wrath would fall on him—and he wouldn't escape blame!

Just as he racked his brain for something to say, Xiao Fan suddenly released his grip. Hong Rushuang collapsed to the ground, her face showing the relief of someone who'd just escaped death.

She gasped for air, completely without the nobility and elegance befitting a princess—even showing some joy. She was still alive. She was still alive!

Looking at Xiao Fan, her gaze carried a hint of fear, and also... gratitude?

Gratitude that he hadn't killed her!

Xiao Fan noticed the strangeness too. Something was psychologically wrong with this woman.

No matter—now wasn't the time for that.

"Holy Son, do you understand what you're doing?" the Hundred Flowers elder demanded.

Xiao Fan replied without mercy: "I, Xiao Fan, have never needed to explain my actions to anyone!"

"Where are my sect's Grand Ascension elders?"

"Here, Holy Son."

Three Grand Ascension elders from Supreme Mystery Holy Land stepped forward, positioning themselves before Xiao Fan and facing off against the two Hundred Flowers Grand Ascension elders.

The atmosphere grew tense, like swords drawn and bows bent.

"I am never wrong. Just watch," he said coolly to the two Hundred Flowers elders.

"You—!"

Arrogant—arrogant beyond measure!

An Wen emerged at the right moment. She too had witnessed Xiao Fan's methods but said nothing, only sending a mental message instructing the two elders to stand down.

With the Holy Master's word, the two elders dared not object and chose to look the other way.

"Good. Now that no one's interfering, you can reveal your identity," Xiao Fan said to the hook-nosed man.

"Identity? What identity?" The hook-nosed man grew wary.

"Shall I help you with a Great Memory Recovery Technique?" Xiao Fan's right hand manifested a sword hilt, pressing it directly against Hong Rushuang's neck.

The sharp blade drew a line on her neck, sending chills through her body.

Hong Rushuang was terrified. She begged, "Don't—don't kill me. I'll do anything. Please don't kill me."

She wept and wailed, a great beauty kneeling at his feet, all composure gone, clutching his leg and crying out.

Seeing him unmoved, she commanded the man: "Answer his question! Say it!"

"Princess!"

The hook-nosed man was frightened. If the Princess died, the matter of the Heavenly Destiny Witch's descent would be ruined. The Wu Tribe's rise would lose a major asset.

"I'll talk, I'll talk."

The hook-nosed man spoke with bitter reluctance. He believed himself powerful—strong enough to defeat everyone present combined.

But he had a weakness: fear of something happening to Hong Rushuang.

Otherwise, why would he submit to Xiao Fan's threats?

"Ask away. What do you want to know?" The hook-nosed man capitulated.

"Very cooperative of you." Xiao Fan eased the pressure of the sword hilt.

Giving her a bit of hope—and giving this hook-nosed man a bit of sweetness too.

Xiao Fan: "State your identity."

"Left Protector under the Witch-Yao King: Left Wu."

"Simple name."

"State your race. Human, Yao, Demon, or...?" Xiao Fan asked with a knowing smile.

At this, the hook-nosed man's expression changed instantly.

His pupils contracted. He could sense the confidence behind Xiao Fan's question—he knows my identity!

The various factions present felt thoroughly confused. The Witch-Yao King was mysterious, sure—plenty of reclusive powers existed.

But asking about race? What was that supposed to mean?

And Yao and Demon were one thing, but what was with the trailing ellipsis?

Something was definitely off!

The hook-nosed man hesitated, not daring to speak for a long time. The Wu Tribe's resurgence was supposed to be top secret. If exposed, humans would be on guard—then what resurgence could there be?

Everyone watched with curious eyes, staring at the hook-nosed man. The more he held back, the more it proved something was wrong.

"Not talking?"

"You answer!" Xiao Fan snapped coldly at Hong Rushuang.

"Don't—don't kill me. I'll talk, I'll talk!"

"I am the daughter of the Witch-Yao King, daughter of the Wu Tribe's supreme lord. I am a chess piece for the Wu Tribe's resurgence."

The moment those words left her mouth, the entire crowd erupted.

The Wu Tribe!
