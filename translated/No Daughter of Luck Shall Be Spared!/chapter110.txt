Chapter 110: No Fires Allowed in the Harem!

The two women sat on either side of Xiao Fan, exchanging glances. No matter how they looked at it, something felt off.

How were they supposed to sort out their positions going forward?

"Holy Master, um, Sister, Holy Master Sister, Xiao Fan—what should I call her?" Su Yiyun said helplessly.

She had figured it out by now. This old lecher had used some unknown method to capture the Holy Master's heart.

She herself had already given her body to him and fallen for him too. Now their relationship was rather complicated.

After all, Qingyu was the Holy Master and she was the Saintess—in the future, she would even need to take Qingyu as her master.

Master? Sister? Holy Master?

Qingyu was also troubled. Although she and Xiao Fan had known each other longer, when it came to actual physical intimacy, she ranked behind Su Yiyun. If they were going by that...

Wouldn't my position be lower than hers?

"Xiao Fan, how should we handle this matter of seniority with Yiyun?"

Would Xiao Fan find this difficult? Of course not!

"Is this even a problem?"

"You each address each other however is appropriate. In public, Yiyun will still call you Master. You're still the Holy Master, she's still the Saintess. In private, you can treat each other as sisters."

"Huh?" Both women spoke in unison, staring at him blankly.

They could do it that way?

"Master is gentle and considerate, sensible and reasonable—you can be the elder sister. Yiyun, your cultivation is lower, so you should learn more from Master Qingyu." With that, he planted a gentle kiss on each of their lovely faces.

Two was one thing, but doing such intimate gestures with three people present was quite embarrassing for the two women.

Finally, Xiao Fan spoke seriously: "Most importantly, you two absolutely cannot set my harem on fire. If anyone tries to form factions, I will turn hostile in an instant."

Xiao Fan established ground rules for them first, to prevent future harem conflicts.

Both women sensed Xiao Fan's seriousness.

Su Yiyun didn't dare say much. In her heart, Xiao Fan might be a bit of a scoundrel, but he was certainly capable. It was normal for a capable man to have three or four wives.

Other women are just Xiao Fan's playthings. Do I, as one of the main women, really need to compete with playthings?

Xiao Fan: ?

If you don't want to earn rewards, just say so directly. No need to brush me off like this.

And rewarding me with black stockings? This system is really an insult to my pure character!

"By the way, how many pairs are in this batch?" he muttered to himself.

[Unlimited quantity. Refreshes when depleted.]

Well, the reward was passable.

"Oh right, Yiyun, you said you brought me a jade slip?"

"It's here." Su Yiyun handed it to Xiao Fan.

Xiao Fan took the jade slip and extended his divine sense into it.

[Husband, the Saintess competition is about to begin. Will you come to observe?]

[I received the letter from Mother. She says she'll fully support me. Although I've lost my heart, a mysterious power has emerged from where it used to be. I feel like I could kill a Body Integration cultivator with a single punch now.

I remember that under "One Heart, Same Body," the stronger you become, the stronger I become too. Have you been secretly cultivating? Has your strength increased dramatically?]

[Thank you, husband. I will definitely win the Saintess position and not disappoint you—Lanzhi.]

Oh ho, another Saintess. It seemed he was destined to be entangled with Saintesses for the rest of his life.

Speaking of which, if he put Su Yiyun, Jiang Lanzhi, and Ji Qingxue together someday and formed a group, with all three being Saintesses, could they be called the Three Holy Mothers?

"Xiao Fan, what does it say?" Qingyu asked curiously.

Xiao Fan didn't hide anything:

"This is from my fiancée. She's a disciple of Hundred Flowers Holy Land and is competing for the Saintess position."

"She's the woman who carved out her own heart to save me."

Qingyu was moved. If it were any other woman, she might have been displeased. But knowing that Lanzhi had saved Xiao Fan's life, she could only think this woman was worth befriending.

Su Yiyun understood her own position.

In terms of official status, she couldn't compare to the engaged Jiang Lanzhi.

In terms of strength and seniority, she couldn't compare to Holy Master Qingyu.

She couldn't possibly have Xiao Fan all to herself. She could only provide him with support and demonstrate her usefulness to earn some affection in return.

"Xiao Fan, I know about the Hundred Flowers Saintess position. Hundred Flowers Holy Land has always been famous for political marriages. To win the Saintess position, besides strength, you need backing."

"Should we support her?"

Su Yiyun's words made Xiao Fan feel his efforts hadn't been in vain—the harem wasn't on fire!

"Yiyun, you're so thoughtful." Xiao Fan smiled, tasting her red lips—sweet, smooth, and warm, leaving him wanting more.

"Stop it, we're discussing serious matters here!" Su Yiyun scolded playfully, not angry but infinitely bashful.

Xiao Fan spoke seriously: "Yes, I want to help Lanzhi ascend to the Saintess position."

"Is there anything I can do?" Su Yiyun's beautiful eyes fixed directly on him.

"No need. I have my own plans. Just focus on cultivating your techniques well—that's the greatest help you can give me."

...

After Xiao Fan sorted out the relationships and positions for the two women, he departed from Supreme Mystery Holy Land for Hundred Flowers Holy Land.

However, the entourage of elders he brought was considerable.

He took three Grand Ascension realm elders, ten Body Integration realm elders, over thirty Soul Transformation stewards, and countless Nascent Soul core disciples.

The Void Refining elders held important positions and needed to manage the Holy Land, so he didn't bring any of them.

Nothing special about it—just making an impression.

If they encountered anyone who didn't know better, they could dispatch them on the spot without him lifting a finger.

"Holy Son, everything is ready. Shall we depart now?" a Grand Ascension elder asked respectfully.

He had originally been in seclusion cultivating when he suddenly heard the Holy Master's summons, ordering him to accompany the Holy Son to Hundred Flowers Holy Land to support the Holy Son's fiancée in becoming the Hundred Flowers Saintess.

He was furious the moment he heard this!

What a joke. He was a dignified Grand Ascension cultivator—if they called him out to vanquish demons and protect the righteous path, he would naturally answer without hesitation.

But calling him out to be the Holy Son's chaperone? Didn't he have any face to maintain?

So what if you're the Holy Master? Does that mean you alone have the final say in this Holy Land?

He was about to refuse.

Then Holy Master Qingyu tossed him a Triple Refined Origin Restoration Pill as payment.

Hiss! The words he was about to say became stuck in his throat.

The Triple Refined Origin Restoration Pill—when consumed by a Grand Ascension cultivator, it could increase a thousand years of cultivation power.

More importantly, it could elevate one's aptitude to become more attuned to the Heavenly Dao.

After fully refining the pill's medicinal power, even a Grand Ascension cultivator with the worst foundation would have a fifty percent chance of surviving the Immortal Ascension Tribulation!

With this pill, even if he couldn't guarantee one hundred percent success in transcending the tribulation, he could count on at least ninety-eight percent.

I admit I was a bit impulsive just now. He immediately pledged his loyalty to the Holy Master.

"Rest assured, Holy Master. On this journey, I will protect the Holy Son with my life, assisting his fiancée in winning the Hundred Flowers Saintess position."

"Anyone who dares block us—I will personally tear them to pieces and scatter their ashes!"

The Holy Master said nothing, merely nodding slightly.

This Grand Ascension elder's heart burned with passion. Slaying demons and protecting the righteous was unpaid volunteer work, but a single outing earned him an immortal pill.

Please, give me more assignments like this in the future!

The other two Grand Ascension elders felt similarly, their respect for Xiao Fan plain to see.

If they made a good impression on the Holy Son, perhaps they could land another easy, high-paying assignment like this one.

With all three Grand Ascension elders showing such deference, the disciples and elders below watched with endless envy.

"That attitude—they're practically treating the Holy Son as the future Holy Master."

"Everyone stay sharp. Maybe if the Holy Son is pleased, he'll let us serve as attendants or something."

"If we really got that opportunity, we'd be set for life."

Xiao Fan surveyed the orderly formation before him—the bright banners bearing Supreme Mystery's insignia, the imposing Supreme Mystery robes.

The Grand Ascension cultivators were unfathomably powerful. Even a wisp of their aura was enough to shake the soul. Ordinary low-level cultivators didn't even have the courage to look directly at them.

Body Integration cultivators were also great masters, though they didn't count for much within Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

But take any single one outside, and they were powerful enough to establish their own faction.

In the mortal realm, mobilizing so many great masters just to back up one woman was rather extravagant.

But Xiao Fan didn't care. He wanted the full display of power!

Uncle Jiang drove the Nine Golden Dragon Carriage. Xiao Fan stood atop the carriage with Xinxi by his side, attending to him.

His voice rang out clearly: "Move out! Destination: Hundred Flowers Holy Land."

Instantly, nine dragon roars sounded in unison as they soared into the sky with overwhelming might.

Ahead of the dragon carriage flew rows of orderly flying arks, each carrying ranks of Supreme Mystery disciples to clear the path.

One Grand Ascension elder took position at the front, while the other two flanked the rear, placing Xiao Fan's carriage firmly in the center. The importance they placed on him was self-evident.

Wherever they passed, cultivators on the ground looked up at this magnificent procession. Soul Transformation cultivators, rarely seen on ordinary days, served merely as guards.

Body Integration and Grand Ascension cultivators, elusive as dragons who showed their heads but not their tails, could only serve as personal attendants. Everyone who witnessed this formation wore expressions of shock.

"What's going on here?"
