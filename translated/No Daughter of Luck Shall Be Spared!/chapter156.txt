Chapter 156: Three Supreme Treasures

Xiao Fan felt he was a two-faced person.

In front of his father, he acted like a scoundrel, constantly milking him for swords and treasure. But in front of his mother, he was the well-behaved, obedient child—a natural good boy.

He put away the swords and headed toward his mother's palace.

Xiao Fan's mother liked tranquility. Her palace was situated by a lake behind the mountain. A gentle breeze came, and the lake's surface glittered with rippling light under the sun, carrying a special sense of peaceful serenity.

Willows lined the lakeside. The breeze made the soft branches sway, like Master Yu'er's supple waist, or like Long Ningbing's tender dragon tail.

At least, that's what Xiao Fan thought.

"Damn, what am I thinking? I really am too perverted!"

"Young Master."

Xiao Fan arrived at the palace entrance. The two maids there saw him and bowed respectfully.

"Where's my mother?" Xiao Fan asked.

"Madam is teaching Miss Yuhong Dao techniques. She said if Young Master comes, just go straight in."

"Mm, I understand." Xiao Fan pushed open the door and entered.

Xiao Fan's mother's palace was simply decorated. The courtyard held two red-leafed maple trees, their flowers perpetually blooming without bearing fruit—unclear whether it was a variety issue.

"Mother, I'm back." Xiao Fan called out loudly, his voice carrying obedience.

Yes, obedience!

He knew all too well. In front of his mother, he had to maintain the good-boy image.

In a certain courtyard, Lan Yuhong was deep in meditation when she sensed something. Her beautiful eyes' lashes trembled lightly. When she heard that familiar voice, her heart filled with joy.

"Brother Xiao Fan is back!"

"Mother, that's Brother Xiao Fan's voice." Lan Yuhong said excitedly to Xiao Fan's mother.

Xiao Fan's mother was dignified and poised. Her peerlessly beautiful face also showed a trace of a smile, though she quickly composed herself and said mildly:

"Why? So eager. Didn't you say you'd cultivate diligently, grow stronger, and help him? Why are you still cultivating?"

Xiao Fan's mother sat serenely on a cushion, treasure light swirling around her, Dao rhythms flowing. Her entire being seemed to merge heart and body, body and heaven—her every expression carrying a vast, ethereal quality beyond her beauty.

Lan Yuhong immediately fell silent. She only knew her mother-in-law was extremely powerful and strict with her, but also exceptionally kind, giving her the best cultivation resources—even more loving than her own mother.

Xiao Fan's mother knew of her relationship with Xiao Fan and treated her as a daughter-in-law, so the closeness was natural.

Xiao Fan didn't want to cultivate, and his mother didn't force him.

But Lan Yuhong not cultivating? Unacceptable! If you don't get stronger, how will you protect my son?!

You two are a couple. You'll need to stay by his side and look after him in the future. Cultivate hard—cultivate fiercely!

Perhaps... all mothers are like this?

Seeing Lan Yuhong's speechless state, Xiao Fan's mother suddenly felt she was being like an evil mother-in-law, bullying her daughter-in-law. Was she being too strict?

Lan Yuhong was quite likable—resilient, gentle, and optimistic. She was already beautiful, and with all these positive traits, Xiao Fan's mother was quite fond of her.

"Fine, I know you don't want to cultivate. You have one day off."

"Hehe, thank you, Mother."

Lan Yuhong immediately withdrew her technique. The seven-colored, treasure-light-radiating sundial behind her that had enveloped her gradually dimmed, and the time flow around her quickened considerably. A time-type treasure.

In that instant, Lan Yuhong's Body Integration cultivation was revealed.

Yes, with Xiao Fan's mother's help, Lan Yuhong's constitution had been optimally developed. Her ice-spirit constitution had been adjusted, and she'd received ice-attribute pills, ice-attribute treasures, and ice-attribute cultivation methods.

Anything suited to her, Xiao Fan's mother could always procure.

Without another word, Lan Yuhong's figure flickered, leaving only a fragrant breeze as she rushed out the door.

"Youth is wonderful." Xiao Fan's mother rose, sighing softly.

Xiao Fan had just pushed open the door and taken a few steps when a graceful figure came rushing toward him on the fragrant wind.

A light blue dress, ethereal immortal aura drifting, a face that was youthful yet refined—so full of vitality.

Lan Yuhong was overjoyed. Descending from above like a fairy, she wore a beautiful, faint smile as she appeared before Xiao Fan. She was somewhat reserved, not daring to make any big movements.

She just stood with her hands clasped before her, excitement mixed with shyness and longing.

"Brother Xiao Fan, you're back." The corners of her mouth couldn't stop rising. Her bright, spirited eyes seemed to glow, sparkling.

"Yuhong, it's been a while." Xiao Fan said with a smile.

A girl transforms dramatically as she matures. Two years had completed Lan Yuhong's transformation. Before, she'd been youthful with a tender quality.

Now the youthfulness was gradually fading, replaced by sweetness and vivacity on her pretty face.

Lan Yuhong's long dark hair cascaded down, the loose strands at her temples slightly covering her cheeks, giving her a shy, timid look. A blue jade phoenix hairpin held up her soft dark hair.

A light blue dress covered her graceful figure, perfectly showcasing her form. Her chest wasn't very prominent, but it was tender with an alluring quality.

She'd grown taller, her straight jade legs slender and lovely. Her feet were wrapped in a pair of Cloud Spirit boots—mainly white, embroidered with a blue floral pattern and something resembling a red evening cloud.

Lan Yuhong was beautiful, more beautiful than most. But Xiao Fan was never short of beautiful women around him. What she had was the refreshing feeling of the girl-next-door—that sweet shyness, like a delicate flower. A modest beauty.

This was extremely charming, and since they'd always addressed each other as (adopted) siblings, this attribute made her even more attractive to Xiao Fan.

Xiao Fan smiled and opened his arms. Lan Yuhong's smile grew brighter, her face flushing crimson. Though she'd been intimate with Xiao Fan before, such things still made her somewhat shy.

Still, she couldn't contain her feelings. She threw herself into Xiao Fan's embrace, her soft, boneless white lotus arms holding him tight.

At the same time, eager yet nostalgic, she buried her pretty face in his chest, as if this could hide her blushing face.

Lan Yuhong murmured tenderly: "Brother Xiao Fan."

Xiao Fan's thoughts wandered. Lan Yuhong had grown up. Her tender body pressed tightly against him, the faint fragrance on her refreshing to the spirit—like a newly bloomed delicate flower, enchanting and fragrant.

He placed his hand on Lan Yuhong's back, gently stroking it, smoothing her hair, lightly brushing her rosy pretty face: "That eager?"

"Not at all. I just wanted Brother Xiao Fan to feel how much Yuhong has missed you." Her voice grew softer and softer, until it was barely audible.

Her delicate, boneless hands held Xiao Fan even tighter, as if to ease her nervousness.

In this moment, warmth and innocence combined. The two just stood there quietly, like a couple newly fallen in love.

A light breeze passed, scattering the loose hair at Lan Yuhong's temples. Graceful and charming.

Ahem!

A soft cough broke the scene of their reunion.

A dignified, elegant, noble beauty stood there, a warm smile playing at her lips as she watched them.

Hearing the sound, Lan Yuhong startled like a frightened kitten, fur bristling. She couldn't help but push Xiao Fan away.

Then she stood obediently to the side, hands fidgeting with the hem of her dress, head bowed low, afraid to let anyone see her embarrassed state.

"How could I do such a thing? Mother was still inside." Lan Yuhong felt she'd lost her mind, not considering the actual situation at all.

But Xiao Fan whispered in her ear: "Leave first. I'll come find you later."

"Mm." Lan Yuhong said softly.

She nodded to Xiao Fan's mother, then whooshed away in an instant.

Clearly, she was quite nervous.

"Mother, your son is back. Did you miss me?" Xiao Fan walked over with a grin, like an obedient son, and began massaging her shoulders.

Xiao Fan's mother just humphed: "Got yourself a wife and forgot your mother. Coming here and not even greeting me first—just getting cozy with Yuhong. You're not here for me—you're clearly here for Yuhong."

This was the first time his mother had shown displeasure in front of him. Xiao Fan didn't argue, just said with a chuckle:

"How could that be? There's only one mother, but plenty of women. In my heart, Mother is forever the most beautiful, most gentle."

Hearing these words, Xiao Fan's mother's brow furrowed even deeper:

"One Yuhong already makes you forget your own mother. You want even more women?"

Xiao Fan paused. Were women's thoughts really this peculiar?

"Oh, I was just using exaggeration to emphasize how Mother is the most beautiful, most gentle, most dignified, most virtuous, most graceful. Don't mind the details." Xiao Fan said, taking her arm.

Hearing Xiao Fan's words, though they were somewhat slick, her heart was still quite happy.

Though she said sons grow up and don't listen to their mothers, her concern for Xiao Fan had never diminished. She began checking his cultivation.

Her beautiful eyes sparkled with starlight as she scanned Xiao Fan's cultivation and constitution, somewhat surprised.

It wasn't the cultivation level—after all, she'd watched every one of Xiao Fan's tribulation breakthroughs. It was that Xiao Fan's constitution was very powerful.

His body seemed composed of countless powerful particles. This "powerful" was relative to normal people—to her, it wasn't much.

"Xiao Fan, do you have a body-refining technique? Why is your body strong as a barbarian elephant, your momentum like a dragon? Your blood energy is like a humanoid beast."

"Hehe, pretty strong right? That shows whose son I am. Your son has to be strong." He said proudly.

"I thought your breakthroughs were too fast and would weaken your foundation. Seems I worried for nothing." She laughed.

Xiao Fan quite enjoyed spending time with his mother. After all, she always doted on him unconditionally. When Xiao Fan was young and lazy, not wanting to cultivate, she hadn't said anything—just let him grow as he wished.

When he wanted to work hard and cultivate diligently, his mother would pave the cultivation path for him, arrange teachers—gentle and virtuous wasn't just talk.

Xiao Fan's mother was also somewhat emotional. Her son suddenly returning to say he was about to ascend caught her off guard.

The son she hadn't seen in so long had suddenly grown up, about to ascend. This left her both gratified and melancholy.

After her son grew up, would he grow distant from her?

Such sentimental thoughts. But she just smiled kindly at Xiao Fan, saying nothing else, afraid of adding to his psychological burden.

Xiao Fan sensed something. He could feel his mother's concern for him. A mother worries when her child travels far—that was probably what this meant.

Finally, as Xiao Fan prepared to leave, his mother called out to him.

"Mother, is there something else?" Xiao Fan asked.

"No, just thinking about you becoming immortal. Mother is genuinely happy. I prepared some things for you—they might be useful later."

His mother took out a storage ring and a brand-new little booklet, speaking gently:

"Inside are things I prepared for you long ago. One hundred and eight items total.

"There are too many. I was afraid you couldn't remember them all, so I wrote this little booklet with detailed instructions for everything."

"But I was worried you'd be too lazy to read it, so let me highlight a few key items for you."

With that, her jade finger pointed, and three points of light burst from the storage ring. Three treasure-light-wreathed immortal artifacts appeared before Xiao Fan.

One hundred and eight items?
