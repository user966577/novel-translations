Chapter 127: Oh No, I've Become a Paragon of Righteousness

Some younger cultivators, lacking experience, weren't familiar with the Wu Tribe's history.

But the older, more powerful cultivators—upon hearing the Wu Tribe's name—grew solemn.

Even the two Hundred Flowers Grand Ascension elders were especially shocked. They said gravely:

"Rushuang, do you understand what you're saying?"

"This is not something to joke about."

Hong Rushuang hadn't wanted to tell the truth, but she knew the man before her wouldn't permit lies.

She didn't dare gamble—she could only speak truthfully.

Hong Rushuang cried out, "Elder, I truly am the daughter of the Witch-Yao King of the Wu Tribe. I'm not deceiving you."

"Holy Son, considering that I've told the truth, will you spare my life?" she pleaded, no longer showing any trace of her former pride and coldness.

Xiao Fan was pleased. He gently helped her up. Hong Rushuang reacted instinctively, flinching backward.

But meeting Xiao Fan's gaze, she startled again and froze, not daring to move. Her whole body trembled, like a mouse before a cat.

Xiao Fan helped Hong Rushuang to her feet, smiling as he smoothed her disheveled hair. "Your task is complete. You may live."

"Thank you, thank you, Master."

Hong Rushuang spoke with tearful gratitude, her voice tinged with joy. She'd survived!

"Find somewhere to hide. Don't leave my sight. Otherwise, the first thing I do when I have time will be to kill you," Xiao Fan said with a smile.

Hong Rushuang didn't argue, simply standing quietly to the side.

No one knew what ordeal she'd endured.

People only knew that she'd disappeared for a few days, and when she emerged, she'd become this—weak, timid, humbly obedient, like she'd been thoroughly trained.

"Holy Son, this old one was too hasty. Might you hand Hong Rushuang over to our Holy Land for us to deal with?" one of the Hundred Flowers Grand Ascension elders asked.

"She is my spoils of war, my private property. You have no right to deal with her," Xiao Fan said flatly.

"Very well."

The observers from other factions noted everything.

Earlier, when the Holy Son had seemed ready to kill her, the Hundred Flowers people had been somewhat disdainful but still tried to intervene.

Now, when Xiao Fan openly declared he'd kill her if she disobeyed, the Hundred Flowers elders had dropped their previous objections.

It seemed that secretly, the Hundred Flowers elders all wanted Hong Rushuang dead.

If not for Xiao Fan's presence, Hong Rushuang might already be dead the next second.

Hong Rushuang felt grateful in her heart. He's protecting me. She'd completely forgotten that just moments ago, Xiao Fan had nearly killed her. Perhaps it was some kind of psychological condition.

"Why do I feel like the Hundred Flowers elders now want to kill Hong Rushuang?"

"You're not imagining things. I noticed it too."

"What exactly is the Wu Tribe that everyone's expression changed the moment it was mentioned?"

"You're all too young to understand how terrifying the Wu Tribe is."

"Elder, is the Wu Tribe very powerful?"

"Powerful?" The elder gave a thin smile. "Indeed, very powerful. The Wu Tribe was once the ruler of all heaven and earth."

At this, everyone understood—things were not simple.

That elder, having seen much in his years, explained:

"In the primordial era, countless races vied for supremacy. Back then, the human race was small and weak. At that time, the Wu Tribe was the master of this world."

"The Wu Tribe were natural-born powerhouses. From birth, they possessed tremendous strength. A three-year-old child could command the force of ten thousand pounds—splitting mountains and shattering boulders was child's play."

"Holy shit, ten thousand pounds of force at three years old?"

Many cultivators felt their scalps tingle. Weren't these natural-born warriors?

"You think that's all?" The elder seemed to know more secrets. He shook his head. "In the primordial era, humans hadn't yet developed the Dao. All living beings simply competed over who had the stronger body, the greater strength. Whoever was mightiest ruled heaven and earth."

"Back then, the immortal path wasn't established. I've heard that cultivation in those times focused on martial dao, because the Wu Tribe excelled at martial dao. They could cultivate it to strengthen their physical bodies, rising above all other beings."

"The Wu Tribe were naturally divine in strength. Combined with martial dao's perfect compatibility with their physical forms, the Wu Tribe's power was unstoppable. A three-year-old Wu child had the strength of ten thousand pounds; by around twenty, a member of the Wu Tribe could move mountains, fill seas, and shatter the void with a single punch."

"The Wu Tribe were heaven and earth's first chosen. Their martial dao flourished to its absolute pinnacle. Their cultivation path was to strengthen the physical body, aspiring to transcend through the flesh alone—to achieve immortality."

"Put it this way: back then, any random Wu Tribe expert could sweep across the world. No one could match them."

Hearing these secrets, the young cultivators present were all shocked. That powerful?

Any random expert could sweep across the world's cultivators—that was terrifying.

"Elder, if the Wu Tribe was so powerful, why did they decline? To the point where we've never even heard their name?"

The elder said calmly, "Yin and yang alternate, sun and moon revolve. Nothing is eternal and unchanging. Even the strong can be replaced."

"The Wu Tribe was indeed mighty. The glory of their single tribe was enough to overshadow all beings under heaven. The three great races of today—Yao, Demon, and Human—combined wouldn't have been enough for one of their hands back then."

"But the Wu Tribe's martial dao could only strengthen the physical body. It couldn't grant transcendence, much less immortality."

"The Wu Tribe's patriarch, seeking to continue his tribe's glory, set his sights on transcendence—on immortality. To achieve this, he decided to sacrifice all beings in heaven and earth as an offering, praying for the method of eternal life."

"Strange as it sounds, regarding the legends of that era—what I know is that the Wu Tribe truly obtained the method of immortality: using the blood of all beings to pave the Wu Tribe's path to eternal life."

"The specifics of how it worked are unknown, but the Wu Tribe truly went to extremes, capturing living beings en masse and constructing a massive sacrificial altar spanning hundreds of miles."

"That was an era of darkness, filled with blood and fire, with resistance to the death. Even facing death, they fought the Wu Tribe to the bitter end. Perhaps it moved the heavens—a human powerhouse achieved enlightenment in a dream, comprehending the immortal path's cultivation method."

"Not just the human race—the Yao and Demon races also developed similar cultivation methods. Yao beasts began cultivating demon cores, demons began cultivating devil cores. From that point, the immortal path began to flourish."

"The immortal path values innate talent but emphasizes comprehension even more—perfectly suited for humans, more than for Yao or Demons."

"The Wu Tribe also captured cultivators and extracted cultivation methods from them, but they disdained the immortal path's slow progress, its gradual power growth. Far inferior to martial dao's obvious improvements. They paid it no mind."

"As time passed and cultivators grew stronger, the gap between the immortal path and martial dao became increasingly apparent. That's when people discovered that the immortal path contained the marvel of eternal life—and even methods of transcendence!"

"By the time the Wu Tribe wanted to switch to the immortal path, it was too late. The myriad races' cultivators had grown powerful. The Wu Tribe's oppression of all beings had bred bone-deep hatred. The first thing the newly powerful beings did was exterminate the Wu Tribe down to the last member!"

"This wasn't merely a war between races—it was a clash between the immortal path and martial dao. Though the Wu Tribe had deep foundations, they'd fallen too far behind in immortal path cultivation. In the end, they were jointly slaughtered by all beings."

"From then on, the Wu Tribe vanished without a trace. Martial dao declined. The immortal path began to flourish."

Damn, that really was a blood feud!

After hearing the elder's account, all the cultivators present became vigilant.

If the Wu Tribe was emerging again, did that mean they were returning for vengeance?

"I understand now."

"What did you understand this time?"

"The Holy Son! Don't you see? The Holy Son's attitude toward Hong Rushuang—like she's his blood enemy. Obviously he knew her identity, which is why he treated her so harshly."

"When you put it that way, it does make sense."

"I knew it. The Holy Son couldn't possibly be that kind of brutal person. He's actually very gentle."

"Right. Because that Wu Tribe woman is the enemy, the Holy Son used any means necessary. After all, showing mercy to enemies is cruelty to oneself."

Recalling Xiao Fan's encouragement of that young Hundred Flowers disciple, how could he be anything but a positive figure?

A Holy Son of the righteous path absolutely couldn't be brutal!

They'd almost misunderstood the Holy Son.

"Holy Son, why didn't you explain?" a Hundred Flowers female disciple asked, sounding somewhat hurt—as if feeling wronged on his behalf.

Xiao Fan was utterly baffled. This could be connected to him too?

Couldn't be bothered explaining to them.

"This Holy Son's actions require no explanation to anyone."

Just give them some bullshit.

His tone was detached, proud and arrogant, even somewhat dismissive.

But in their eyes, they saw Xiao Fan as someone not good with words, someone who simply did what needed to be done.

"Holy Son, you are truly a paragon of righteousness—never caring what outsiders think, simply following your heart."

"Holy Son, your heart is so broad. We misunderstood you so badly, yet you don't hold it against us."

Xiao Fan was speechless. I'm the villain here! Why are you treating me like some savior?

[Ding! Host is sanctimonious, yet in others' eyes appears righteous and dignified. You are somewhat perverted, yet in their eyes, this is normal behavior for the righteous path.

In summary: you are a pervert and a villain, and also a sanctimonious hypocrite. Villain Points earned: 10,000.]

Xiao Fan: ???

Holy shit, this works too?

After a moment's thought, Xiao Fan said solemnly:

"Fame is not my desire; the righteous path lives in my heart. I, Xiao Fan, have only ever acted to vanquish evil and defend the Dao. What do the cold stares of the world matter to me? Merely passing storms."

The moment these words left his mouth, Xiao Fan's image soared to immeasurable heights in their minds.

"Holy Son, you bear too much."

"What is righteousness? What is the greater good? The Holy Son is righteousness incarnate, the greater good given form!"

[Ding! You deceive and swindle, hoodwinking the masses. Truly unconscionable—your conscience has been devoured by dogs.

You have no conscience. Villain Points earned: 30,000.]

Xiao Fan was ecstatic. This was truly a win-win situation!

Reputation gained, Villain Points earned. Win-win! Winning twice!

"Looks like I can harvest another wave." Xiao Fan turned his gaze toward Left Wu.

Perhaps a theatrical takedown—earning their trust, then pretending to struggle heroically before a stunning reversal. Maximum spectacle.

"System, if I do this, how many Villain Points could I get?"

[Unknown. Depends on your performance.]

It was workable.

He could earn Villain Points!

Xiao Fan's eyes gleamed. Can't let you die too quickly—I'm truly wicked, killing while squeezing out every last bit of value.
