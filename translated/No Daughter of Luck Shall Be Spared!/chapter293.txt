Chapter 293: Opening Wide the Gates of Hell

Swords drawn, arrows nocked!

The guardians at Killing God Sect's mountain gate gripped their immortal artifacts, coldly regarding the three people before them.

"Who are you? Why are you causing trouble at my Killing God Sect's gate?" one demanded.

"Surrender obediently and apologize."

The two guards spouted their routine threats, despite being unable to see through the cultivation of Xiao Fan's group.

But not being able to see through them wasn't a big deal. So what if they were stronger?

We're the dogs guarding Killing God Sect's gate—outsiders have to bow and scrape when they see us.

Such was the power of Killing God Sect.

"You're being really noisy, you know."

Xiao Fan shook his head.

He raised his hand in a casual sweep. It looked soft and powerless on the surface, but endless astral wind surged forth, condensing into storm blades that howled through the air. The entire space trembled under the cutting wind.

With just that light wave, ten thousand wind blades flew from his hand, striking the two guards dead-center.

Before they could even react, their bodies burst apart with a crack, reduced to piles of mangled flesh that splattered across the ground.

Blood rained down from the azure sky—crimson and cruel.

The whole world fell silent.

"This is my first time exterminating an entire sect. I don't have much experience, so if I overlook anything, please go ahead and die first."

Xiao Fan observed a moment of silence for the pile of meat on the ground—roughly one second.

Then he smiled at Long Ningbing and Chen Miaoli. "You two hold down the perimeter. Make sure no small fry escape."

"Alright." Both women nodded.

Chen Miaoli in particular—at the mention of killing, her eyes lit up with barely contained excitement, dark energy swirling around her body.

The celestial maiden who had been pure as morning clouds transformed in an instant. Her pupils turned black and purple, her fair brows darkened to deep violet, and her innocent features became bewitchingly sinister.

She morphed into a dark silhouette wreathed in black mist, as if draped in an ebony cloak.

A blood-scythe with an eye set in its blade, and a grayish-bronze cauldron forged from white bones—these were all her treasures.

The cauldron's two handles were each fashioned from skulls. The inner skulls had hollow eyes that flickered with pale blue ghostfire.

Their mouths could spew azure flames that incinerated everything at the cauldron's base.

Xiao Fan couldn't help but ask, "Where did you get these evil artifacts?"

Chen Miaoli explained, "They've always been with me. They've been hidden in my spiritual sea since the day I was born."

"One is the Blood Scythe, one is the Ghost Cauldron. One drains blood, one burns flesh.

"The Ghost Cauldron can convert any blood and flesh placed inside into blood pills, and it can also burn away resentment.

"Otherwise, if I consumed them one by one before my constitution fully matured, the resentment within would backlash and destroy me."

Xiao Fan eyed her equipment. Powerful stuff.

So her constitution came with companion treasures designed for killing. No wonder people hated her physique so much.

Xiao Fan waved her off—go kill whoever you want.

He himself prepared to bulldoze straight through!

The slaughter of the gate guardians quickly drew Killing God Sect's attention.

It was far too brazen—as if Killing God Sect didn't even exist in their eyes.

From within the sect, more than a dozen Taiyi Golden Immortal-level enforcers flew out, surrounding Xiao Fan.

"You've got nerve, killing our disciples right at our gate!"

"You've never died before, have you?"

"Damn you, just wait to be dismembered into ten thousand pieces!"

"..."

A whole crowd shouted threats but didn't dare approach.

Because none of them could see through the person before them.

His aura was faint and flickering, seemingly strong yet weak—an eerie sensation they'd never experienced before.

People fear the unknown.

Being surrounded like this, Xiao Fan felt rather insecure.

He needed to call in a few hundred million helpers.

"I'll use you all as rewards to feed my hell demon gods."

Within Xiao Fan's body, the Divine Elephant surged, its boundless roar erupting forth.

The Divine Elephant's might, spanning infinite cosmos, exploded from him in full force.

That overwhelming aura and profound fluctuation sent the dozen-plus Taiyi Golden Immortals stumbling backward, completely unable to stand their ground.

Their eyes filled with terror. What kind of power was this?

With aura alone, he'd forced back over a dozen Taiyi Golden Immortals—without even deliberately directing his presence.

"He..."

"Quick, go summon the Sect Master! This is something we cannot oppose!"

Someone immediately tried to go fetch reinforcements, but it was no longer necessary. The Killing God Sect's master had already sensed the arrival of death.

Ying Wusha, Sect Master of Killing God Sect, flew out.

His eyes were full of wariness as he looked at Xiao Fan.

He was at late-stage Grand Luo Golden Immortal, yet he couldn't even muster the courage to face this person directly.

Ying Wusha suppressed his urge to retreat and steadied his nerves as best he could, asking in a low voice:

"Who are you, sir? Why do you harm people before my Killing God Sect?"

Xiao Fan ignored Ying Wusha. Without a few hundred million demon gods standing behind him, he didn't feel secure.

"You like ganging up on people, huh?"

"Then let's see who has more numbers." Xiao Fan said flatly.

His white robes billowed without wind, loose strands of hair dancing elegantly, brushing against his clean features as his garments snapped in the breeze.

The next second, dark energy coiled around him—a hundred times more menacing than Chen Miaoli's dark form.

BOOM!

Behind him appeared an enormous gate: bronze doors painted black, carved with countless asura ghost-shadows.

From beyond the infinite Maha Hell, crossing hundreds of millions of miles through the void, a gate towering a hundred miles high and ten thousand zhang wide—like pillars holding up heaven itself—materialized abruptly within the Killing God Immortal Domain.

Xiao Fan's voice thundered:

"Gates of Hell—OPEN!"

With a tremendous creak, the previously sealed Gates of Hell slowly parted, revealing a sliver of darkness.

Bone-chilling howls, winds cold enough to freeze the soul, came pouring out—cold enough to ice over one's very spirit.

Countless pairs of pale blue eyes peered through the doorway at the world beyond, fixing on a dark silhouette.

The Divine Elephant's aura radiating from Xiao Fan kept the demon gods in hell from acting rashly.

After all, they had been ruthlessly trampled and imprisoned in hell by the Divine Elephant. The demon gods knew all too well how terrifying it was—savage and vicious, cold and brutal.

But Xiao Fan's next words ignited the killing intent of every demon god in hell.

The carnival had arrived!

"Come forth."

"I'm sure you've starved in that barren hell for hundreds of millions of years."

"The blood food here has been prepared for you. The only question is how much you can devour."

"Whoever kills the most will have the chance to be transformed into a Primordial Angel and remain in this realm. Surely you don't want to stay in that barren, freezing hell forever?"

"Go—slaughter them all!"

The demon gods' eyes blazed with madness.

The Divine Elephant's aura filled them with dread.

But the words of the Divine Elephant's spokesperson filled them with excitement.

Escape hell, escape hell, escape hell!

This was every demon god's deepest desire.

The moment Xiao Fan finished speaking, a beam of black light dozens of miles wide shot out from the Gates of Hell.

This wasn't light—it was demon gods scrambling over each other to escape hell, so densely packed they formed a massive dark shadow, each terrified of falling behind.

From Xiao Fan summoning the Gates of Hell to the demon gods' near-insane frenzy—

All of it happened in the blink of an eye.

In an instant, all of Killing God Sect descended into chaos. Wails, formation fluctuations, and omnipresent terror spread silently.

Ying Wusha's breathing grew ragged. His pupils contracted, his hands and feet went cold, and cold sweat poured down his body.

What was this?

One...

Ten...

A hundred...

Over a hundred Grand Luo-realm demon gods were rampaging through Killing God Sect.

His Killing God Sect only had seven or eight Grand Luo Golden Immortal elders in total.

And that wasn't all. The Taiyi-realm demons numbered in the tens of thousands. How could there be so many powerhouses?

What kind of force was this? Ying Wusha's mind went blank.

A hundred Grand Luo, tens of thousands of Taiyi, and demon gods below Taiyi numbering over a million!

Not to mention, among these demon gods, three had cultivation even higher than his own.

"It's over. It's all over."

Ying Wusha's face drained of color. His only option was to retreat to the restricted area behind Killing God Sect's mountain and activate their final protective formation.

As for the elders and disciples of the inner and outer sects—he was powerless to help them. He could only watch as they were torn apart and devoured by those demon gods.

The stench of blood rose to the heavens. Wails, resentment, unwillingness, regret, confusion...

In mere moments, not a single low-level disciple of Killing God Sect remained alive.

Ying Wusha immediately entered the ancestral grounds and called out to the ancestor.

"My Killing God Sect faces annihilation! I beseech the Patriarch to take action!"
