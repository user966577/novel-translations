Chapter 115: The Holy Son's Lofty Standards, An Old Acquaintance Visits

Watching Xia Huaxuan's departing figure, Xiao Fan shook his head silently. This woman's intentions were too obvious—only useful as a tool.

At most, when his fire was running high, she could serve as a cup of cooling tea.

Inside the grotto-heaven at Welcoming Guest Peak, Xiao Fan returned to where Supreme Mystery Holy Land was stationed.

"Holy Son."

Outside the main hall, two disciples standing guard bowed to Xiao Fan upon his return.

"No need for formalities." Xiao Fan waved his hand.

He noticed that only a small number of elders and disciples remained at Supreme Mystery Holy Land's rest area. Everyone else had vanished.

The two disciples seemed to notice his confusion and explained: "Well, they all went out to explore Hundred Flowers Holy Land—looking for Dao companions."

"Mm." Xiao Fan nodded.

People had desires, and he understood. After all, he had actively sought out Jiang Lanzhi to play.

Among all the Holy Lands, Hundred Flowers Holy Land might not rank highest in strength, but the quality of its female disciples far surpassed the others.

This was because Hundred Flowers Holy Land's recruitment considered not only aptitude but also appearance. Female cultivators who weren't... obviously attractive enough wouldn't be accepted as disciples.

Such was human nature. Xiao Fan didn't see the need to restrain them.

But why had only one Grand Ascension elder stayed behind?

Moreover, something seemed off with him. His gaze was fixed on the distance, somewhat lost in thought.

Xiao Fan approached and asked: "Elder, where are the two elders who came with you?"

His words instantly pulled the Grand Ascension elder back from his reverie. Seeing it was Xiao Fan, he quickly replied:

"Oh, those two? Those old fogeys both have old flames at Hundred Flowers Holy Land. I'd guess they've gone off to tour the mountains with their Dao companions and have some... in-depth discussions."

This sudden risqué comment ran right over Xiao Fan's face, completely unexpected.

"You might not know, Holy Son, but our Supreme Mystery Holy Land and Hundred Flowers Holy Land actually have quite good private relations. Disciples from both sides often collaborate, and occasionally even hold joint Dao cultivation courses where disciples from both sects can study together."

"When we were young, because our cultivation aptitude was decent and our comprehension passable, we were selected to study alongside fellow cultivators from Hundred Flowers Holy Land."

"Young people, you know—and the disciples from Hundred Flowers Holy Land were all quite beautiful. One thing led to another, meeting, knowing each other, understanding each other... until they became Dao companions."

As he spoke, the elder seemed to recall something, a faint smile appearing at the corner of his lips.

This elder was someone with a story.

However, not all relationships sailed smoothly to the end. Somehow, the elder became more talkative and started sharing his past.

Xiao Fan found himself drawn in. Though he had many Dao companions, he had never tasted the bitter waters of love—he had gone straight to home base, missing the whole process.

Listening to the elder's story, rounding it off, was like experiencing those bitter waters himself.

Xiao Fan listened attentively to the elder's love story.

It seemed they were all more or less the same.

Innocent meeting, love at first sight, passionate romance, gradually cooling ardor, emerging conflicts, various disagreements, silent cold wars, relationships nearly shattered, yet somehow mending through twists and turns.

The elder took about an hour to recount his emotional journey to Xiao Fan—complex, joyful, bittersweet, with a touch of pain.

Though memories tended to be rose-tinted, after hearing the elder's words, Xiao Fan felt that not having to endure love's bitter waters meant missing out on some romance.

"If nothing unexpected happened, I would have married her and together we would have pursued the immortal path of longevity."

"Unfortunately, heaven had other plans." The elder suddenly heaved a long sigh, his gaze drifting toward the sky, somewhat lost.

Damn—the first half was all sweet, and now you're hitting me with a twist?

Xiao Fan had a bad feeling.

All the other elders had gone to find women, while this one sat here alone, lost in thought. Could it be...?

As if reading Xiao Fan's confusion, the elder nodded and said:

"Yes, she left me."

"During an expedition to a secret realm, a group of demonic cultivators ambushed us along the way. She didn't escape—she perished."

As he spoke, the elder fell silent, as if reminiscing about times long past.

Xiao Fan's scalp tingled and his chest felt tight. I'm such an idiot!

I knew there would be heartbreak, yet I still listened. I asked for this.

"Haha, that's what happens when you get old. Holy Son, just consider my little story a passing amusement."

The elder laughed heartily, though his voice lacked the cheerfulness of his laughter—there was sorrow in it.

"Elder, my condolences." Xiao Fan said.

First time hearing a cultivation world love story, and I get stabbed. Life is hard.

Xiao Fan asked curiously: "Elder, have you never considered finding another Dao companion?"

"I've thought about it, but once some people are gone, they're gone. Even if you find someone else, you can't recapture that feeling. I've come to terms with it—I'll just let fate decide."

"All these years, no one has been able to compare to her. No one can replace her."

Having come out on this trip, he had received a Triple Refined Origin Restoration Pill, which should have been a happy occasion. But revisiting old haunts had stirred up old memories, making him more talkative than usual.

This declaration of devotion left Xiao Fan speechless. This...

However, he did think more highly of the elder now. He, Xiao Fan, officially acknowledged him as the second most devoted man in Supreme Mystery Holy Land. As for the first? That was obviously himself!

Indeed, if you converted it, Supreme Mystery Holy Land was roughly equivalent to one of the five superpowers on Earth.

A Grand Ascension elder, rounded off, was like a regional lord among those superpowers. An elder of this level, if he was willing to speak up, would definitely have women thrown at him.

They wouldn't even ask to become Dao companions—just being a serving maid would be an honor.

"Elder, your devotion truly humbles this disciple." Xiao Fan spoke sincerely.

Since he couldn't be the most devoted, he would be the most fickle!

Either way, he had to be first!

"Enough, let's not dwell on such unhappy matters," the elder laughed.

Seeing no one around, he whispered: "Actually, the Grand Elder also has a past, though few know about it."

Xiao Fan was taken aback. Oh? That old lecher, the Grand Elder, had some unknown history?

"Tell me more."

The elder began:

"Actually, the Grand Elder had it even worse than me. He once had a Dao companion—his first love, I believe. That woman treated him extremely well, gentle and sweet. They often traveled together, inseparable."

"But who could have known—she was actually a spy from the demonic path, getting close to the Grand Elder only to steal his bone structure. The Grand Elder trusted her completely and was harmed by her.

The Grand Elder originally had exceptional bone structure. It was because of that incident that his foundation was damaged. Otherwise, he probably would have ascended to the immortal realm a thousand years ago.

After that, the Grand Elder was depressed for quite a long time—about five hundred years."

"Actually, the Grand Elder was initially a very pure person. He was the perfect, gentle senior brother in everyone's eyes—immortal bearing, strong sense of justice, always with a smile that made people feel at ease.

After being depressed for a while, though he pulled himself together and cultivated even harder than before, often taking missions to slay evil and eliminate demons, the smiles on his face gradually decreased. He was no longer as pure as before, becoming somewhat... uninhibited."

"From perfect senior brother to carefree wanderer—compared to the Grand Elder, my experience seems rather fortunate."

"You might think the Grand Elder is a bit improper now, but back then, he was the most perfect, flawless genius disciple in our Holy Land."

Holy shit! The Grand Elder had such a past?

Xiao Fan was genuinely shocked. He had thought everyone was born an old lecher, but it turned out the Grand Elder was once a pure-hearted youth?

This completely overturned Xiao Fan's imagination. A pure young man, beaten down by love, transformed into an old lecher who regularly invited female elders for group cultivation. Talk about a complete reversal.

Seeing Xiao Fan's shocked expression, the elder wasn't surprised. He actually admired the Grand Elder—to walk out of such betrayal by his beloved, to keep cultivating despite damaged foundations until reaching Grand Ascension level.

Truly someone of exceptional caliber.

The more Xiao Fan heard, the more alarmed he became. No one in Supreme Mystery Holy Land was simple.

After returning to Supreme Mystery Holy Land's quarters, quite a few people from various factions came calling. They were all representatives of fairly powerful local forces.

None could match Supreme Mystery Holy Land, of course.

These factions normally had no opportunity to approach Xiao Fan—their levels were too different. Now that such a rare chance had presented itself, they all came to visit Xiao Fan, trying to build connections.

Quite a few factions employed the tried-and-true beauty strategy.

While visiting, they would introduce to Xiao Fan their dynasty's princesses, their sect master's daughters, or some noble family's heiress—a dazzling array.

Any more and they'd be dragging in their dynasty's imperial consorts or sect master's Dao companions.

They claimed young people should interact more, so they'd have connections in the future.

As for those women—not exactly devastating beauties, but certainly flawless. The only problem was their intentions were too obvious, practically writing "transaction" on their foreheads.

Having lived two lives, Xiao Fan understood these things perfectly.

The higher the position, the more obvious the exchanges.

And Xiao Fan handled it all perfectly. He was quite friendly, but always steered conversations toward irrelevant topics—the kind you'd forget immediately.

As for those women—sorry, not interested!

He didn't actually need to do much. As someone of superior status, as someone being courted, as long as he appeared slightly humble, slightly amiable, people would think him approachable.

So elegant, so un-overbearing.

That was the difference status made.

Xia Huaxuan from earlier, and now these factions sending women—remarkably similar tactics.

Before, staying mostly at home and in the Holy Land without venturing out much, he hadn't noticed. Just one day out had made him realize how attractive his status and position truly were.

Finding it tiresome, Xiao Fan simply used cultivation retreat as an excuse to decline all visitors.

The Grand Ascension elder watched all this and raised his opinion of Xiao Fan considerably: The Holy Son has lofty standards—he's not interested in beauty.

These vulgar honey traps couldn't stir even half the Holy Son's interest. If the Holy Son became Holy Master in the future, he would certainly be a wise leader.

Knock, knock, knock...

A knocking sound woke Xiao Fan from his rest in the bedchamber. His contest with Jiang Lanzhi had drained some of his energy—he needed to recuperate.

Xiao Fan: "What is it?"

"Holy Son, there's a woman outside who says she has urgent business with you."

A woman?

Probably another direct approach since the obvious methods hadn't worked—sending someone to warm his bed?

"I don't really feel like seeing anyone. Tell her to leave."

"Holy Son, but she says she's had... in-depth exchanges with you before. She's been practicing her techniques lately and has reached a masterful level—she'd like to discuss them with you further."

"Oh, she also said her surname is Ji."

In-depth exchanges? Cultivation techniques? Ji?

A figure vaguely appeared in his mind. What did she want with him? Some AI perhaps?

(Note: AI, meaning artificial intelligence.)
