Chapter 142: Layers Upon Layers of Schemes!! A Man Three Parts Drunk, Acts Until You Cry

A butterfly flapped its wings, and the gears of fate began to turn.

Li Yutong, who thought she had everything under control, flew into Xiao Fan's inner chamber, unaware of what consequences awaited her.

Xiao Fan had prepared everything.

There wasn't really much to prepare. Though these two were strong, they couldn't compare to the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda. The moment Li Yutong entered, Xiao Fan used the pagoda to capture her.

The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda radiated five-colored divine light, forming a powerful invisible vortex that could draw anything inside.

Bad!

Li Yutong knew something was wrong. But she was prepared. She immediately pulled an immortal talisman from her sleeve, intending to escape.

However, the immortal talisman barely glowed before dimming. It didn't teleport her away as she'd hoped.

"Such powerful divine light—it actually swallowed my Seven Mystery Realm-Breaking Talisman."

This Seven Mystery Realm-Breaking Talisman was her trump card, capable of escaping a Golden Immortal's encirclement. Never did she expect this five-colored divine light to be even stronger than a Golden Immortal's techniques.

What the hell.

Without any ability to resist, Li Yutong, along with her sister Li Yuxian, was captured into the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda.

Xiao Fan was mentally connected to the pagoda. Everything happening inside couldn't escape his eyes.

He'd already changed into a clean white robe, somewhat plain yet elegant. He held a scripture in his hands, reciting poetry.

To better fit the scholar image, he'd dressed himself to look like a weakling with no strength to truss a chicken.

The very image of a Confucian scholar!

Everything was going according to plan. First capture the older sister Li Yuxian, then use her to control Li Yutong. A threesome!

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but reveal a lewd smile. Hehehehe...

[Your thoughts are filthy. Pleasuring yourself—truly a villain's model. Obtained exclusive title: Lustful Worm on the Brain!]

The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda, alternate name: Five Elements Exquisite Express Hotel.

Inside the pagoda, no matter how Li Yutong attacked the walls, she couldn't cause any damage.

Not only that, the pagoda's five elemental powers circulated endlessly. All her attacks were absorbed by the structure—a zero-sum game!

"This won't work. Even with pills and spirit stones, blindly expending energy will eventually trap me to death."

"Can't brute force this. Need to use wits!"

Li Yutong began searching for an exit. The inside of the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda was incredibly vast, with no fixed shape. It could manifest whatever the user desired.

With a thought, Xiao Fan immediately transformed Li Yutong's surroundings.

Ancient trees towered. Vines covered the ground. Thick fog shrouded heaven and earth, obscuring all sense of direction. Li Yutong found herself in a misty forest, unable to find her way out.

"Bad! How did I wander in here?" Li Yutong knew things were wrong.

Just then, the scroll in her sleeve flew out.

The scroll slowly unfurled. A woman with bright eyes, elegant bearing, and celestial grace stepped out from within, wearing a long dress.

Her appearance was gentle and beautiful. In her serenity was the air of a noble lady. The light purple gown outlined her entire presence—like poetry, like a painting. Her eyes were full of gentleness. Just standing there, she radiated the essence of "filled with poetry, naturally refined."

Li Yutong's eyes went straight. The sister she'd yearned for day and night had finally emerged!

All anxiety from being trapped vanished, replaced by pure excitement and infatuation. She dreamily approached and took Li Yuxian's delicate hand. Her peach-blossom eyes shimmered with sparkling light, moist and lovely.

She rested her head against Li Yuxian's fragrant shoulder, greedily breathing in her unique scent.

Not flirtatious or seductive. Not the typical feminine fragrance, but a faint ink scent that refreshed the soul.

"Sister, you're finally out. All this time you've been away, I've missed you so much."

Li Yutong closed her beautiful eyes, resting peacefully against Li Yuxian's shoulder. Growing bolder, her pale hands wandered downward, wrapping around Li Yuxian's slender waist, as if wanting to press her sister into her own body.

"Sister, hehe..."

"Sister, hehehehe..."

A blush rose on her face, and her hands grew even bolder.

Li Yuxian sighed helplessly, her jade hand lightly tapping Li Yutong's head. Li Yutong winced, clutching her head and pouting: "Sis, why'd you hit me?"

Her eyes were misty, tears threatening to fall.

Li Yuxian spoke evenly: "No being naughty!"

"Sis~"

"No means no." Li Yuxian was stern and cold.

Li Yutong hesitated, staring at her. After a long moment, she lowered her head dejectedly, quietly sniffling.

Li Yuxian sighed deeply. Why was her sister so strange? She couldn't bear to see Li Yutong sad.

She could only say softly: "A little naughty is fine."

Li Yutong's dim eyes immediately lit up. A smile spread across her lips. With lightning speed, she cupped Li Yuxian's lovely face and planted a kiss on those luscious, glistening red lips.

She even tried to slip in her tongue, but seeing Li Yuxian's stern look, she giggled and pulled back.

This was already major progress. Before, her sister only let her kiss her cheek.

Little by little, each day. Today the lips, tomorrow the tongue, the day after... push her sister down. Hehe, hehehehe...

Outside the pagoda, Xiao Fan could see everything clearly thanks to their mental connection.

Their intimate contact, even Li Yutong's silly giggling—he saw it all perfectly. This...

This was really something. Very interesting!

Moreover, to be honest, Li Yuxian gave Xiao Fan a very special feeling. Her beauty went without saying.

More importantly, it was her temperament—that well-read, scholarly air. It was hard to believe this emanated from such a stunning woman.

"A talented woman indeed! Lives up to the reputation!"

The more unique and rare her attributes, the more interested Xiao Fan became.

Back inside the pagoda.

Li Yutong wanted to cuddle with Li Yuxian but was mercilessly refused.

Li Yuxian asked: "Where is this? How did you end up in such a place?"

Under the suppression of the five elemental powers, even Li Yuxian's Celestial Immortal divine sense couldn't see more than a hundred meters.

Add the pervasive fog, and visibility was under thirty feet.

Li Yutong said weakly: "Well, I was originally investigating to recover the Wu God Blood. Then I got careless, just a tiny bit careless, and got captured into this pagoda."

"The whole story?"

No choice—Li Yutong had to explain everything from beginning to end.

Li Yuxian said calmly: "So we're trapped, is that it?"

"Don't worry, sister. We'll get out eventually. Even if we can't, it's no big deal. I'll keep you company." She spoke cheerfully, not worried at all.

As long as she could be with her sister, anywhere was paradise.

Looking at Li Yutong's silly smile, Li Yuxian felt considerable pressure. Could her sister really... not be straightened out?

"Sister, what do we do now?"

As she spoke, Li Yutong sidled up again, trying to get close to Li Yuxian.

But Li Yuxian saw through her little scheme. A jade finger tapped her forehead, pushing her back.

She produced two yin-yang fish, one black and one white, giving the black one to her sister and keeping the white one.

"This yin-yang twin fish—one for each of us. Split up and find a way out. Contact me when you find something."

Li Yutong accepted it reluctantly, still unwilling: "Sister, I'm afraid of the dark. Can we go together?"

"No, you're not." Li Yuxian said with a gentle smile.

Li Yutong realized her pursuit of her sister had been too aggressive. If she got pushed away, she'd be the one losing out.

No choice—she could only reluctantly, longingly part from Li Yuxian, each searching for an exit.

Seeing them separate, Xiao Fan knew it was time for his performance.

With a thought, he invisibly altered the terrain inside the pagoda. On Li Yuxian's path, he conjured a peach grove. Within the grove stood a thatched cottage, surrounded by a bamboo fence.

Inside the fence, a few chickens and ducks pecked at the dusty ground, searching for worms.

Xiao Fan transformed into a poor scholar, sitting by the cottage window, completely absorbed in reading, occasionally writing poems with brush in hand.

Formation set!

To prevent interference and also drain Li Yutong's energy, he placed various obstacles along her path.

He also used the five elemental powers to seal off heaven and earth, trapping her inside, unable to escape.

Everything was ready. Just waiting for the fish to bite.

Li Yuxian traveled alone, cautious and alert the entire way, fearing danger might strike.

If fierce beasts had appeared to attack her, she might have relaxed somewhat. But after walking about a third of a mile—

The fog cleared. The path widened. Smooth sailing ahead.

This was too strange.

So her guard strengthened—stronger than ever before.

Walking on, she came upon a peach grove. Within it sat a thatched cottage, surrounded by a fence. Inside the fence, a few chickens and ducks played about.

Outside the door stood two trees. One was a peach tree. The other was also a peach tree.

Pink blossoms were in full bloom, petals drifting on the wind like floral rain, carrying waves of fragrance.

The scent was pleasant, serene and elegant. The feeling of a rural hermitage immediately arose—exactly what Li Yuxian had always sought.

She entered the courtyard and found inside the thatched cottage a thin, refined scholar earnestly studying and reciting poetry.

"In the Peach Blossom Land, the Peach Blossom Temple. In the Peach Blossom Temple, the Peach Blossom Immortal. The Peach Blossom Immortal plants peach trees, picks peach blossoms for wine money."

"Sobering, I sit among the flowers. Drunk, I sleep beneath them still..."

Xiao Fan was immersed in his own world, oblivious to everything else—of course, he was pretending.

He'd known long ago that Li Yuxian had approached and was watching him from outside.

But he had to pretend. Scholars loved to flaunt their elegance. That's called scholarly spirit.

Li Yuxian was a Confucian cultivator. Hearing someone reciting poetry immediately caught her attention.

She paused to watch. Xiao Fan's voice reached her ears.

"In the Peach Blossom Land, the Peach Blossom Temple..."

"Picks peach blossoms for wine money..."

She murmured to herself, light blooming in her eyes.

Her guard remained, but her curiosity grew stronger. She suspected this might be a trap, yet walked forward regardless.

Xiao Fan was "startled" by her. He set down his poem and looked out the window. A graceful, perfect jade beauty was walking into his cottage with light steps.

He showed no surprise. Instead, he smiled at her in greeting and walked out.

"I presume you're the daoist friend who came to my chambers looking for trouble?"

He pretended not to know these two were twins.

Li Yuxian was also taken aback. She'd expected him to spin some lie to deceive her. Instead, he was completely straightforward.

Xiao Fan also knew lies would be seen through.

But using truth to weave lies—that wouldn't leave any openings. Especially nine truths to one lie.

Sorry, wrong reference. Especially nine truths to one lie—that was the highest realm of deception.

Xiao Fan, using truth to craft lies!

Recalling Li Yutong's experience, Li Yuxian instantly understood the situation.

"He's mistaken me for Yutong."

However, Li Yuxian didn't explain. She simply said: "Daoist friend, I mean you no harm. I only came because you have a treasure of my tribe. If you return it, we'll leave immediately and never trouble you again."

"Of course, I don't enjoy killing. That killing earlier was unavoidable. Compared to fighting and killing, I prefer sitting here reading, cultivating my mind."

Hearing words like reading and cultivating the mind, Li Yuxian found Xiao Fan rather pleasing to the eye. You have good taste.

Xiao Fan tossed the Wu God Sword to Li Yuxian, continuing: "That person challenged me that day. I accidentally killed him. This is something he dropped. I'm returning it to you."

With that, he threw the Wu God Sword out like tossing garbage, without a moment's hesitation.

Li Yuxian was shocked when she clearly saw the sword.

This was the Wu God Sword! The Wu God's life-bound treasure!

Being well-read, she naturally recognized it. Especially that aura commanding all Wu Tribe to submit—further proof. Definitely authentic.

"Even if you don't recognize this, you should understand it's a supreme treasure?"

"I don't enjoy fighting and killing. A precious sword is useless to me. If it can buy me peace, that's its greatest use."

With that, Xiao Fan opened an exit leading directly to his cave dwelling.

"I've returned your item. Leave now. Don't disturb me again."

He ignored her, returning to recite his poems.

Li Yuxian clearly sensed he had no regrets. The passage was real—she could leave right now.

What exactly was he after?

Xiao Fan was shrewd. He'd given her so much without any conditions. Was he really not worried about her?

No—because her sister was still in the pagoda. Given how much she doted on her sister, she absolutely wouldn't leave alone.

Gotcha!!

Before she could think further, Xiao Fan added fuel to the fire. "Immersed" in his own world, he seemingly recited poetry but actually interrupted Li Yuxian's thoughts.

"Along Chang'an's great roads and narrow lanes, blue oxen and white horses pull incense carriages. Jade palanquins crisscross past princely homes, golden whips stream toward marquis estates."

"Ask who plays the flute amid purple mist—she once learned to dance through fragrant years. To become mandarin ducks, who would fear death? Rather be paired ducks than envy immortals."

Li Yuxian had been hesitating, but found her attention completely captured. She couldn't even think about leaving.

"Rather be paired ducks than envy immortals..." Her eyes grew brighter, as if she'd found a kindred spirit.

After he finished, she asked curiously: "Are you a Confucian cultivator?"

Her eyes were full of anticipation.

Xiao Fan looked at her with disdain: "I only cultivate the heart. Don't box me in with your labels and categories."

"So-called Confucian cultivators are just pedantic scholars. My cultivation is shallow, my knowledge limited. I dare not presume."

Simultaneously, he gave Li Yuxian a contemptuous look.

"How rude of you. I return your sword, give you the chance to leave, yet you won't go. Must you disturb me?"

Li Yuxian was momentarily stunned. He had a point.

He wasn't making things difficult for her. He returned the sword, offered her a way out. Her behavior seemed rather excessive.

She quickly said: "My apologies. I was just impressed by your literary talent and got overexcited. Truth be told, I'm a Confucian cultivator myself."

"But I rarely find anyone to exchange ideas with. Meeting a kindred spirit is exciting. Please don't take offense, sir."

She spoke with an apologetic smile.

Xiao Fan regarded her coldly, clearly displeased that she'd disrupted his peace.

He said: "This is a pagoda I picked up. It can only open once every three days. The exit just closed. If you want to leave, wait three days."

With that, he returned to his room and shut the door.

No intention of paying her any attention.

Playing hard to get!

Li Yuxian certainly wouldn't leave—her sister was still in the pagoda. Besides, she'd finally met such a cultured person. She had to exchange ideas with him.

She didn't leave. Instead, she set up a small pavilion outside his door, sitting outside, listening to Xiao Fan recite poetry. Over the three days, she'd lost count of how many poems Xiao Fan had written. Every emotion was in them.

The classic unappreciated genius. The classic patriot without a cause. The classic homesickness. The classic lovesick man and woman. Everything.

How could he have such rich emotional experiences? Li Yuxian was incredibly curious.

Curiosity was good. Curiosity was the beginning of falling.

Three days passed in a blink.

Xiao Fan didn't acknowledge her. When the time came, he immediately opened the passage:

"Please leave."

Then returned inside.

Continuing to be immersed in his own world.

Li Yuxian wouldn't leave. She loved the poems he recited too much. She was too curious whether he'd written them himself. Her curiosity grew and grew.

Three days, then three more, then three more. Days slipped away.

Meanwhile, Li Yutong was getting beaten up. Endless five-element beasts were draining her energy.

She also used the yin-yang fish to call her sister for help.

Li Yuxian received the call but didn't go. Because this had happened too many times before. Li Yutong always did this.

Just wanting to trick her into coming over, saying she missed her, then sister cuddles. No way—must straighten her out.

Hmph, I won't be fooled by you. Don't bother me!

Thinking this, she cut off the yin-yang fish connection, leaving Li Yutong unable to call for help.

Finally, after half a month, Xiao Fan "lost his patience" and said angrily:

"Don't push your luck! I've returned the sword and let you leave. Why are you still refusing to go?"

Li Yuxian maintained proper composure, simply smiling: "Sir, your talent truly impresses me."

"However, there's something I'd like to ask. Would sir be willing to answer?"

She'd been calling him "daoist friend" before. Now it was "sir."

Xiao Fan heard this. Outwardly, he remained unmoved. Inwardly, he was blooming with joy.

Mm, it's working.

"And if I answer, will you leave?"

"Of course."

"Fine. Ask away."

Li Yuxian asked all her questions at once.

Xiao Fan answered coldly. His tone was distant, but his answers were detailed.

Especially when she asked why he could write so many different emotions—homesickness, patriotism without a cause, unappreciated genius.

Of course I wrote them myself! He said shamelessly:

"Heh heh. I sealed my own powers and experienced mortal life. I spent a thousand years among mortals—as emperor, as civil or military official, as street beggar, as common folk."

"True artistic creation—if you don't personally immerse yourself in experience, how can you write anything worthwhile?"

Personal experience!

Those few words were like an epiphany for Li Yuxian. She'd always called herself well-read. Now she saw she was just a frog in a well, resting on her laurels.

"Personal experience. Sir speaks truly." She answered respectfully, like an eager student.

Soon, the passage closed.

Xiao Fan sighed: "The exit closed again. Are you leaving or not?"

Li Yuxian felt somewhat guilty. She'd never intended to leave—earlier she'd just been deceiving Xiao Fan to get answers.

Yes, she felt guilty.

Xiao Fan knew about her guilt. He was deliberately digging himself in.

A true deceiver meets a fake deceiver. Things get complicated.

Xiao Fan saw he couldn't drive her away. Seeing how eager she was to learn, his attitude toward her softened somewhat. He invited her into the courtyard for tea and conversation.

The two grew more compatible as they talked. Of course, one was genuinely compatible while the other was faking it.

Especially when Xiao Fan plastered every famous story onto himself—embodying all those tales of unappreciated genius, patriotism without a cause, the pain of it all—he sounded exactly like the person who'd lived through it!

Especially since he possessed righteous vital energy. This was what Confucian cultivators dreamed of!

This made Li Yuxian believe him even more. Someone with righteous vital energy was surely upright and honest—that's why he'd suffered so much hardship.

She couldn't help but sympathize with Xiao Fan. You sealed your powers for a thousand years, experiencing mortal life, yet still maintained such a serene and elegant temperament. She felt ashamed.

Women admired strength. But strength manifested in many ways. Being good at seduction, being good at lying—those were also strengths!

Clearly, Xiao Fan was excessively strong in these areas.

Li Yuxian's curiosity kept growing. This treasury of talent left her amazed and enthralled.

It made her want to understand everything about him.

"What about the lovesick poems? Also from personal experience?" Asking this, a strange feeling flickered through her heart. Sigh—a man who could write so many love poems must have had rich romantic experiences.

In other words, he'd probably... had many women already.

Somehow, thinking of this made her uncomfortable.

Xiao Fan first froze at her question, then fell into a rare silence.

Li Yuxian knew she might have touched a sore spot. She immediately tried to change the subject.

But Xiao Fan stopped her.

"Want to hear about it?" He smiled faintly, with hints of melancholy and longing.

"Just a bit curious." Li Yuxian said.

"Very well. Since we get along so well, I'll share it as conversation. Just don't laugh at me." He spoke self-deprecatingly.

Tea could no longer satisfy him. He produced a jug of wine and began drinking.

Turning up the heat.

"That year, snowflakes fell, plum blossoms bloomed on branches..."

"That life, my name was Liang Shanbo. The identity I chose was a poor scholar. I met a girl disguised as a boy, also entering the academy to study..."

He adapted the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai with simple substitutions, speaking with sorrow and regret.

Soon, Li Yuxian was drawn in.

Xiao Fan drank as he spoke. Especially when reaching the part where Liang Shanbo died and Zhu Yingtai took her own life to follow him.

"If I'd chosen to restore my powers and save her, she wouldn't have died. But I couldn't. My goal was to experience mortal life. I couldn't let one woman ruin my plan."

"I made my choice. I didn't save her. This became my eternal pain."

By now, he was weeping as he spoke, face full of sorrow. Regret and reluctance, pain and remorse, filled his heart.

His face was flushed, tipsy, looking drunk. He forced out a silly smile: "S-sorry, lost my composure. Made you laugh."

Li Yuxian was moved. In her ten thousand years of life, she'd never heard such a love story. Her life had only been cultivation and reading, and books never contained such feelings.

She was deeply shaken by their love.

She too felt her eyes redden, heart aching.

Yet she also felt somewhat happy. If that woman were still alive, she herself would have no chance.

Why am I thinking about chances? Li Yuxian's heart fluttered, her mind growing unclear.

Xiao Fan was already drunk, swaying unsteadily, about to fall backward.

Seeing this, Li Yuxian hurried to support him.

She collected herself. A strange feeling arose as she held him in her arms. Happy?

"Sir, you're drunk. Let me make you some sobering tea."

"I-I'm not drunk. In all the world, I-I'm the most clear-headed. I can still drink. C-come on... fill it up."

Though his hand could no longer lift, flailing about, he mistook her jade hand for a wine cup and brought it to his lips.

"Ptooey ptooey ptooey. H-how come this dish is so fragrant and tender, but has no flavor? Did someone forget the salt?"

Li Yuxian's face flushed crimson. Though she knew sir was drunk, such sudden intimacy still flustered her.

"What am I thinking?"

She helped Xiao Fan back to the bedroom and covered him with a blanket. Looking at this simple room, Li Yuxian was somewhat surprised.

On the desk lay a long essay.

A variant of Record of Xiang Ji Xuan! Names changed, titles altered, substituted with Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai.

Li Yuxian picked it up and was immediately absorbed. Especially when she reached: "The tree my wife planted the year she died now stands tall as a canopy." She was left speechless.

She could feel that sir must have truly loved her back then. Sigh, poor sir, trapped by love.

Suddenly, a pair of strong arms embraced her from behind. It was Xiao Fan, mumbling nonsense. "Yingtai, you're back?"

"This isn't a dream, is it?"

He smiled contentedly, greedily nuzzling against Li Yuxian's jade-soft, incomparably beautiful face.

Li Yuxian started and pushed him away.

Caught off guard, Xiao Fan fell to the floor, looking at her with confused, wounded eyes:

"I'm sorry, Yingtai. I should have saved you back then. I'm sorry..."

"You hate me too, that's fair. I deceived you. I don't deserve you. Heh heh..."

He broke into tears as he spoke, sobbing like a child.

Only now did Li Yuxian realize she might have overreacted. She immediately went to help Xiao Fan up, trying to get him back on the bed.

Li Yuxian hadn't realized the severity of the situation. A man three parts drunk will act until you cry.

Xiao Fan seized every opportunity, clutching her tightly: "Yingtai, I miss you so much."

Li Yuxian was moved. Though she was being mistaken for someone else, she wouldn't take advantage of him. She still said: "I'm not Yingtai."

Xiao Fan didn't listen. He was certain she was!

Then, cupping her face, he studied her expression with his drunken gaze.

Li Yuxian's cheeks were flushed. She offered no resistance. Instead, she closed her eyes.

Yes. Li Yuxian's feelings for Xiao Fan had transformed—from wariness to curiosity, from curiosity to admiration, from admiration to affection—so quickly she probably couldn't even understand what was happening to her.

A treasury of knowledge, righteous vital energy, the deep love persona maxed out. Plus, he was already devastatingly handsome, and he'd lost his love. This made her sympathize even more. All these emotions combined were why she didn't resist.

You could say she also wanted to taste the bitterness of love, even if it meant taking advantage of him.

Holy crap, she even closed her eyes. Isn't that an invitation?

Xiao Fan leaned in for the kiss. Li Yuxian stiffened. Her jade hands didn't know where to go. She clenched them into fists, wanting to wrap them around his waist but afraid to.

Swift as a blade through tangled hemp!

He didn't know what she was thinking, but he knew exactly what he wanted. Wasn't it just carnal desire? Yes, he was crude. That crude! A pure old lecher.

Xiao Fan pushed her onto the bed, pressing heavily upon her, murmuring: "I'll never let you leave me again."

Li Yuxian's mental defenses crumbled. Fine. Though obtaining sir this way was shameful, even if the means were base, I must have you!
