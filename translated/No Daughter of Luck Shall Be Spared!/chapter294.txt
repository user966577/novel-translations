The disciples of Killing God Sect were drowning in a cacophony of death.

Cruel, blood-soaked, and insatiably ravenous, the demon gods rampaged through their ranks like crazed reapers harvesting a field of crimson.

It was a carnival of blood.

Killing God Sect disciples tried to flee, yet couldn't even escape the demon gods' grasp.

The rare few who slipped through the cracks were promptly swatted down by Long Ningbing.

Or reaped without mercy by Chen Miaoli's Blood Scythe and tossed into the Ghost Cauldron, rendered into glistening blood-red pills.

The frenzied, uncontrollable demon gods cared only for collecting heads.

They'd killed so many they'd gone mad—even turning on each other.

"Back off, that's my kill!"

"Get lost! Stop stealing my kills!"

"What do you mean yours? That was clearly my prey!"

"..."

Chaos. Anarchy. These hell demon gods had transformed Killing God Sect into a living hell on earth.

Killing God Sect, restricted grounds behind the mountain.

Ying Wusha knelt before a mountain peak and slammed his forehead into the ground three times with resounding thuds.

"I beg the Patriarchs to come forth!"

A tremendous boom shook the heavens and earth. The mountain before Ying Wusha exploded, and two figures shot out from within.

Time and light swirled around them—one sat upon a lotus platform, the other reclined lazily inside a gourd.

Their faces were impossible to look at directly; one could only vaguely perceive their existence.

"Why have you summoned us?"

"Didn't I tell you? I'm pursuing the opportunity for sainthood. Nothing must go wrong. Unless it concerns a sainthood opportunity, do not disturb me for any reason."

One of them spoke.

Ying Wusha immediately said, "Patriarchs, someone has attacked us! Killing God Sect faces total annihilation! I beseech the Patriarchs to take action and suppress the invading enemy!"

The two Patriarchs of Killing God Sect could hardly believe their ears.

Total annihilation?

"What are you talking about?"

"Patriarchs, see for yourselves."

The two cast their gazes outward. Endless demon gods were rampaging through Killing God Sect.

Hundreds of Grand Luo Golden Immortals.

Thousands of Taiyi Golden Immortals.

Tens of thousands of Taiyi True Immortals!

And three beings whose auras were chaotic and unfathomable, cold as killing gods themselves—entities at their own level, watching the restricted grounds with predatory intent.

The two Patriarchs of Killing God Sect exchanged glances, each seeing the gravity reflected in the other's eyes.

These visitors meant business.

Together, they emerged from the protective formation and spotted Xiao Fan outside, casually observing the slaughter.

"Who are you, sir? Has our Killing God Sect offended you in some way?" one of them asked.

Xiao Fan glanced at the pair without a word.

He simply waved his hand. The three Primordial Chaos demon gods understood instantly and charged straight at them.

The two Patriarchs hadn't expected Xiao Fan to attack so directly—without the slightest interest in communication.

Three against two, same realm!

The pair didn't stand a chance.

What's more, Xiao Fan played dirty. While the two were focused on fighting his demon gods, he crept up from behind.

He pulled out the axe he'd seized from Xing Daorong and swung it at the back of their heads.

Already struggling against three opponents, the two Patriarchs had no attention to spare for a sneak attack from behind.

In their frantic dodging, dozens of wounds were carved across their backs.

There was nothing they could do—that was just how Xiao Fan operated. The moment their attention split, he'd suddenly swing the axe.

The two Patriarchs were absolutely livid. Damn it all.

We're all Primordial Chaos cultivators here—why are you fighting like a street thug?

Sneak attacks, no less—skulking behind them and striking without warning.

Who could possibly defend against that?

The two Patriarchs were beaten badly, their backs a mess of axe wounds splitting flesh and bone.

In less than fifteen minutes of fighting, each had at least a thousand gashes on their back.

Never in their lives had they fought such a low-class battle!

With no other option, they hastily retreated into their mountain-protecting formation, barely clinging to life.

"You—what kind of person are you?"

"Is this how you fight?!"

The two cursed furiously. They'd lived through multiple epochs.

This was the first time they'd ever encountered such a shameless opponent!

Xiao Fan felt no shame whatsoever. "I just wanted to test whether you had any life-saving tricks. After all, the longer you've lived, the more afraid of dying you become. Can't have you running away."

The more casually he spoke, the more terrified those inside the formation became.

Clearly, this was a death sentence with no room for appeal.

The two Patriarchs were utterly bewildered.

They had no idea where this grudge had come from.

They dragged Ying Wusha over and demanded, "What kind of trouble did you bring down on our sect?"

Of course Ying Wusha had no idea.

He never could have imagined that a insignificant little immortal dynasty like the Grand Vista Immortal Court had such a massive force behind it.

Ying Wusha said, "Patriarchs, you know my character better than anyone."

"I've always bullied the weak and feared the strong. I only pick soft targets—I'd never kick an iron wall."

"Forget about you two—even I have no idea why he wants to destroy our sect."

His voice trembled as he spoke.

Having cultivated for multiple epochs to late-stage Grand Luo Golden Immortal, this was the first time he'd ever been this terrified.

The two exchanged a look. He didn't seem to be lying.

Besides, bullying the weak and fearing the strong wasn't just Ying Wusha's specialty—it was something they'd taught him.

After a moment's thought, one of them decided to try communicating again.

"Friend, might there be some misunderstanding? We have no quarrel with your people."

"Or perhaps someone has deceived you into having our two factions fight each other?"

Even now, they still couldn't fathom why they were being attacked.

Xiao Fan said, "Simple. You sent people to attack my woman's territory."

The two Patriarchs turned to glare at Ying Wusha with murderous fury.

You attacked someone without even checking their background first?!

"Patriarchs, I swear I didn't know!" Ying Wusha said.

Now wasn't the time to assign blame.

One of the Patriarchs forced a smile through his pain and said:

"Friend, allow me to offer my sincerest apologies."

"Whatever losses we've caused, Killing God Sect will compensate in full."

"Let us each take a step back and avoid further bloodshed, yes?"

He begged for peace with the utmost respect.

But Xiao Fan sneered. "If apologies actually worked, then what did I build all this power for?"

"You don't actually think you're in the wrong. You just realized you picked a fight with someone you shouldn't have, and now you want to sweep it under the rug."

One sentence sealed every exit.

Xiao Fan's sneer deepened. "Unless I kill every last one of you, I won't feel satisfied!"

The Patriarch's expression turned vicious as he threatened, "Friend, do you want mutual destruction?!"

Xiao Fan's gaze sharpened, his voice like ice:

"Two little minnows, and you dare run your mouths?"

"Attention, all demon gods—kill these two, and I'll transform you into Primordial Angels."

"You'll be freed from hell and given dominion over this entire Killing God Immortal Domain."

The three Primordial Chaos demon gods perked up instantly.

Not only would they be freed from hell's bondage, they could transform and become rulers of an entire immortal domain.

The offer was simply irresistible.

The three hell demon gods threw themselves at the protective formation like rabid beasts, hammering it with everything they had.

The formation was strong, but against three Primordial Chaos-realm demon gods, it began to crumble.

And then Xiao Fan added his own power, shattering the formation entirely.

"Life-Death Annihilation Divine Thunder—Deathly Silence Lightning!"

"Fall!"

"With lightning—shatter the darkness!!"

A crackling barrage of thunder obliterated the teetering formation. Waves of lightning surged like a roaring tide, engulfing everyone inside.

Xiao Fan struck with full force.

At his current Primordial Chaos Grand Luo realm, aside from the two Patriarchs, not a single member of Killing God Sect survived.

Ying Wusha couldn't even escape—he was annihilated by the lightning on the spot.

As for the two Patriarchs, they fared little better. Deathly Silence Lightning carried the very essence of death.

The thunder of death fell upon them, leaving them grievously wounded and on the brink.

"Friend, spare my life!"

"Friend, it was all the juniors' fault—it has nothing to do with us! We're willing to serve you as master! Please, spare us!"

Xiao Fan sneered and intensified the lightning.

The three Primordial Chaos demon gods also went all out, finally tearing the Patriarchs to shreds.

And devouring them whole!

To make absolutely certain the two were dead, Xiao Fan dug out their cultivation sanctum and flooded it with endless lightning until the ground was scorched black.

But he still wasn't done—he needed confirmation of death.

"System, are those two dead?"

[You unleashed the Deathly Silence Lightning from your Life-Death Annihilation Divine Thunder. Who could possibly survive that?]

"Good that they're dead. Good that they're dead."

With both Patriarchs slain, the remaining disciples lost all will to resist upon witnessing their ancestors' fate. They were dispatched with ease.

Killing God Sect—annihilated without mercy!

Afterward, as the hell demon gods cleaned up the battlefield, they unearthed a treasure vault.

"Master, we found a treasure vault here."

"Bring it over. Let me have a look."
