Chapter 111: Bai Fengliu of the Shaman God Sect

Hundred Flowers Holy Land was named after flowers, and naturally its scenery was inseparable from them.

Throughout the entire Holy Land, wherever disciples lived and cultivated, spiritual flowers radiating divine light and extraordinary colors were planted, making Hundred Flowers Holy Land a riot of colors, like an ocean of flowers.

The floral fragrance drifted gently on the breeze, reaching into the hearts of every disciple and elder. The air was permeated with the sweet scent of flowers, mingled with spiritual energy.

The foundational cultivation methods practiced by Hundred Flowers Holy Land's female disciples were all related to flowers—techniques like "Step by Step Lotus Bloom," "Heavenly Maiden Scatters Flowers," and "A Single Thought, Flowers Bloom."

Cultivating such methods would give women an aura of delicate beauty, sacred and noble. With every smile and frown, it was as if a hundred flowers were blooming, their fragrance intoxicating—literally breathing out orchid-like fragrance.

The only drawback was that these techniques lacked offensive power.

But they were devastatingly effective against male cultivators. When two cultivators clashed intensely, the male cultivator would surrender his weapon quite quickly.

However, they didn't really need offensive power—forming marriage alliances was enough. After all, every Holy Land had its own survival strategy; they couldn't all be judged by the same standard.

Regardless, Hundred Flowers Holy Land was absolutely a paradise for male cultivators. It was filled entirely with female disciples. If that wasn't enough, one could always find a female elder and be taken care of directly.

The news of Hundred Flowers Holy Land's Saintess selection had spread throughout the land. Many had come to observe the ceremony—of course, the vast majority were male cultivators.

Observing the ceremony was real; selecting a Dao companion was also real.

Two birds with one stone!

On the day of the Hundred Flowers Saintess selection, quite a few influential factions had arrived: Dao Unity Sect, Azure Cloud Sect, Feathered Ascension Gate, the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty, reclusive ancient families, immortal sects with legacies spanning tens of thousands of years—too many to count.

A dark mass of people, impossible to enumerate.

These factions all had significant backgrounds, with one thing in common: they all had Grand Ascension cultivators overseeing them. After all, those without a Grand Ascension cultivator to back them weren't qualified to attend this grand gathering.

Of course, aside from the major factions, there were also some talented cultivators.

Everyone knew the importance of natural talent.

As long as your talent was exceptional enough to pass the three tests set by Hundred Flowers Holy Land—

Even without any factional backing, you could enter Hundred Flowers Holy Land to observe the ceremony, form a bond with one of the Holy Land's disciples, and take a beauty home with you.

Though your seating might not be as good as those from major factions, at least you'd gotten your foot in the door.

These three tests from Hundred Flowers Holy Land didn't require fighting for your life—they appeared extremely simple.

Yet within that simplicity lay profound principles.

The three tests were: spiritual root aptitude assessment, heart-nature illusion realm, and cultivation level.

Spiritual root aptitude went without saying—you had to have superior-grade spiritual roots at minimum. This was the baseline, and this test alone eliminated quite a few people.

The heart-nature illusion realm examined temperament. Those who were violent, impatient, or unable to stay calm in a crisis would be excluded. This test filtered out many more.

Most important was cultivation level. No matter how good your aptitude, what did it matter if your cultivation was low? Without power, your words carried no weight. These so-called geniuses had to either form a Nascent Soul before age one hundred,

Or reach Soul Transformation before age one thousand.

In other words, those who could enter without factional backing, or with only weak backing, needed at minimum Nascent Soul cultivation to even start.

After these three layers of screening, only a handful of cultivators could pass.

This was Hundred Flowers Holy Land's survival strategy: form marriage alliances with major faction members, and befriend talented cultivators of humble origin—who knew, they might have bright futures ahead!

"Fellow Daoist Liu, it's been five hundred years! Your cultivation has improved again. It seems you've gained much."

"Not at all—I've merely put in the effort, trading time for cultivation progress."

"Too modest. You've already reached late-stage Void Refining. Perhaps in another thousand years, you could break through to Body Integration and become a great master."

"Body Integration isn't that simple. Which Body Integration cultivator isn't a dragon among men? I'm still far from that level."

"Too modest. Everyone knows of Fellow Daoist Liu's talent—with your capabilities, immortal ascension is surely in your future. With such diligence, that day isn't far off."

"Ah, it's just weathering some hardships along the way."

Besides bringing their sect disciples to observe the ceremony and arrange marriages, the various major factions had another important reason for coming: to gather all the major powers in one place while they had this opportunity.

It served as a chance for exchange.

At this moment, Hundred Flowers Holy Land was filled with both the sounds of feminine voices and the bustle of crowds—quite lively.

Before long, two groups of female disciples in magnificent attire, beautiful as celestial maidens, walked out with smiles on their faces.

Leading them was a Body Integration elder. Though she had preserved her youthful appearance through secret arts and didn't look old, she appeared as a middle-aged beauty. Time hadn't left many traces on her—instead, it had added a mature charm that came only with years.

This made her all the more alluring. The moment she appeared, she drew countless gazes.

"Fellow Daoists, welcome to Hundred Flowers Holy Land to observe our Saintess selection."

"The selection is about to begin. Please follow us to our Holy Land's Hundred Flowers Contest Stage."

Her voice was like silver bells, pleasant and melodious, giving listeners a sense of delight.

"You all, lead the way for our esteemed guests."

The beautiful woman addressed the female disciples behind her—it was both a task and an opportunity for them to present themselves.

"Yes."

These graceful female disciples immediately split into two groups: one to guide the faction members, and one to guide the talented cultivators of lesser standing, arranging their seating.

Having beautiful women accompany them as guides, these guests quickly fell into formation and followed them inside.

The beautiful elder was long accustomed to such scenes. The vast majority of the Holy Land's female disciples would eventually be married off as others' Dao companions.

Only those with exceptional talent who could reach Void Refining or Body Integration were allowed to stay.

Only with strength did one have the right to choose whether to stay or leave. The weak were married off.

Just as everyone was about to enter, a mighty procession came thundering through the distant sky like wind and lightning.

An overwhelming aura swept across the heavens, reaching Hundred Flowers Holy Land and instantly shaking every cultivator present.

Everyone involuntarily looked up, wanting to see who had arrived. Whose forces were these!

At the vanguard was actually a late-stage Void Refining cultivator.

Behind him were over a hundred pitch-black steel war chariots, each flying a dark banner.

Upon them were written three characters: Shaman God Sect!

"What kind of formation is this?"

"Those black war chariots look familiar. I feel like I've seen them somewhere."

"I remember now—that's the recently risen power: the Shaman God Sect."

"They've been at war with the demon race lately, killing several Body Integration demon cultivators. They're riding high right now."

"Shaman God Sect, huh? That name sounds pretty impressive."

"Wait, wait, wait—a Void Refining cultivator clearing the path, over a hundred Shaman God war chariots thundering together, two Body Integration cultivators escorting from behind, and what's that chariot to the side? The aura inside is vast and boundless, with a sense of ascending to the heavens—even a Grand Ascension cultivator is here?"

Quite a few people were dumbstruck. This was absolutely ridiculous.

Over a hundred Shaman God war chariots, two Body Integration cultivators, one Grand Ascension cultivator, charging toward Hundred Flowers Holy Land with overwhelming momentum—were they here to start a war?

Granted, the factions attending Hundred Flowers Holy Land's ceremony all had Grand Ascension cultivator backing, but no one would actually summon their family's Grand Ascension ancestor to the Holy Land itself.

They didn't have that kind of pull, nor that kind of audacity.

Let alone Grand Ascension cultivators—even the Body Integration cultivators who came to observe could be counted on one hand.

Only a few major factions had Body Integration elders leading their delegations to attend the ceremony.

Most factions had Void Refining cultivators leading the way.

Where had this Shaman God Sect come from? How could they command a Grand Ascension cultivator to make an appearance?

The Body Integration beauty from Hundred Flowers Holy Land soared into the sky, blocking the path of this large group.

She spoke with a smile, her spiritual power carrying her voice for miles: "Halt, travelers."

Behind her smile lay seriousness. Her eyes scanned the group—one Grand Ascension, two Body Integration, twelve Void Refining cultivators, plus countless Nascent Soul and Soul Transformation members.

At least a thousand people!

Such a massive force—friend or foe was unclear. After all, they hadn't invited this Shaman God Sect.

"Halt!"

From the very center of this procession, from the most prominent position—a dark, lustrous treasure carriage pulled by four Void Refining flood dragons—came a languid voice.

Yet no one dared question it. The order was obeyed instantly, and the entire group stopped.

From the black-gleaming, mysteriously unknown carriage emerged a pale-skinned young man dressed entirely in white. His attire clashed completely with this dark-clad army.

His face had a sickly pallor, with dark circles under his eyes as if he'd overexerted himself, but his cultivation was not to be underestimated.

He had actually reached the terrifying level of early-stage Soul Transformation!

"This junior is Bai Fengliu, Holy Son of the Shaman God Sect. Hearing that Hundred Flowers Holy Land is selecting a Saintess, I've come specifically to offer congratulations—and incidentally, to support my woman."

He spoke with a smile, his voice somewhat effeminate and rather unsettling.

One shouldn't strike someone who comes bearing a smile. The Body Integration female elder replied:

"Oh, you know one of our Holy Land's disciples?"

"Naturally."

Bai Fengliu's gaze drifted toward the Holy Land. Following the direction of his eyes, a cold and beautiful woman in red robes was flying toward him, her face blooming with joy.

She landed precisely in Bai Fengliu's embrace.

"Fengliu, you came." Her eyes were seductive, her voice like tinkling bells.

"Of course. Today, I'm here to witness you claim the Saintess position."

The two immediately began whispering sweet nothings to each other, completely disregarding everyone else present.

The Body Integration female elder's eyes narrowed. This red-robed woman was none other than one of the Saintess candidates: Hong Rushuang.

Hong Rushuang, Hong Rushuang—a beauty cold as frost.

This Hong Rushuang, participating in the Saintess selection, obviously had exceptional talent. Moreover, her background was mysterious—a Grand Ascension cultivator had personally sent her to Hundred Flowers Holy Land.

"Rushuang, is this your Dao companion?" the Body Integration female elder asked.

Hong Rushuang composed herself and addressed the elder: "Indeed. Elder, things happened rather quickly, and I didn't have time to notify you. Fengliu has already arrived—might he be allowed to enter?"

The female elder naturally had nothing more to say. As long as Hong Rushuang could bring in support, that was fine. The Saintess position was always about the people backing you—nothing wrong with that.

The female elder smiled. "Since he's Rushuang's Dao companion, then Rushuang, you may lead them inside."

"As you command."

This magnificent entrance had attracted countless gazes—surprise, envy, shock. Many female disciples looked on with endless envy. Who would have thought Hong Rushuang had such a Dao companion?

Hong Rushuang was quite pleased. A sense of certain victory welled up within her.

From the corner of her eye, she glanced toward one of the Holy Land's immortal peaks—the very location of Jiang Lanzhi's cultivation cave. Her expression was full of pride.

"The Saintess position isn't meant for you."
