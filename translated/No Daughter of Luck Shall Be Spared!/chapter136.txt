Chapter 136: West Talisman Prefecture's Crisis—Humans Are Truly Devious!

That divine pill remained in Xiao Fan's abdomen. Its powerful medicinal force ceaselessly nourished the dragon-elephant particles in his body.

Never stopping!!

He hadn't deliberately cultivated, yet dragon elephants continued awakening endlessly. Every day, tens of millions of dragon elephants awakened.

When Master Yu'er helped him refine the divine pill and controlled the medicinal power, he'd awakened 360 million. Only 480 million remained to reach 840 million.

At this rate, all dragon-elephant particles would awaken in about forty days. Then he'd spend some time filling his body with power before he could continue breaking through to primordial elephants!

"When I transformed the first dragon elephant, I felt my body undergo a metamorphosis—a transcendence of life's very level. My strength leaped as well."

He clenched his fist tightly.

"Can an immortal withstand one punch from me?"

He was rather curious. When would an immortal come serve as his punching bag? One he could beat up without consequence.

West Talisman Prefecture.

Currently on full alert, everyone a soldier.

Because the nearby city had become a living hell, rivers of blood flowing.

The mastermind behind it still hadn't stopped, continuing to harvest the blood of living beings.

"How is it? Has news of our great calamity spread? Is anyone coming to save us?"

Atop the towering walls, a man with a resolute face wore thick armor, a treasured sword at his waist, addressing the messenger.

West Talisman Prefecture was located in the borderlands, a frontier city of the human race. Their strongest was merely at Soul Transformation, though the place had defensive arrays that could hold off a Body Integration cultivator's assault for three days—a reasonably fortified city.

"Yes. Supreme Mystery Holy Land says they'll arrive soon and asks us to wait."

The man waited for more, but no further report came.

"Is there more?"

"No, that's all. Only Supreme Mystery Holy Land."

The city lord was stunned. That's it?

With so many human holy lands, only one Supreme Mystery Holy Land was willing to help?

"What about the sects and schools, noble families and dynasties below the holy lands?"

"None. Only Supreme Mystery Holy Land is willing to come save West Talisman Prefecture."

"Sigh."

The city lord couldn't help but sigh. He was rather helpless.

West Talisman Prefecture's location was remote and not fertile. The spiritual energy here was rather sparse, and few major powers were willing to extend their influence this far.

What West Talisman Prefecture could rely on was the Firmament Sect above them. For protection, West Talisman Prefecture submitted seventy percent of its annual tax revenue to the Firmament Sect.

So the first thing they'd done was seek aid from the Firmament Sect—only to receive no response.

Not only that, the Firmament Sect had immediately transferred all its disciples and assets out of West Talisman Prefecture.

"Eating more than anyone, running faster than anyone—damn that Firmament Sect!"

The West Talisman Prefecture city lord cursed. But he could only vent his anger—it wouldn't help.

The messenger said: "City Lord, why sigh? Supreme Mystery Holy Land is one of our human race's righteous holy lands—powerful and strong. With Supreme Mystery Holy Land coming to save us, West Talisman Prefecture need not worry."

The West Talisman Prefecture city lord sighed: "Times have changed, hearts have changed. Look at all these holy lands—not even a gesture from any of them."

"Supreme Mystery Holy Land has no direct affiliation with West Talisman Prefecture. Coming from so far to help is already a great kindness. Do you expect them to mobilize their whole army?"

"This calamity—we'll have to rely on ourselves." He spoke gravely.

"Report, City Lord." A Golden Core cultivator rushed over, breaking through the wind, in a tremendous hurry.

"What's with all the fuss? Speak."

"City Lord, the people from Supreme Mystery Holy Land have arrived."

"Three people came—all Body Integration realm great cultivators." The Golden Core cultivator was especially excited.

Body Integration cultivators—he'd never seen such people before!

The West Talisman Prefecture city lord was overjoyed: "What? Body Integration cultivators, three of them?"

He thought he'd misheard.

"Yes. But they seemed somewhat dissatisfied, saying our teleportation array was too shabby—could only transport a few people. Then they went back."

"Said they needed to repair the array and went back to get some teleportation array treasures."

The city lord had been excited for barely two minutes before cold water was thrown on him.

"City Lord, with Body Integration cultivators helping, aren't you happy?"

"Three Body Integration cultivators still aren't enough? Now they're going back—probably just going through the motions."

"Forget it. Let's pray for luck."

During this time, not a single faction's people came.

Instead, many rogue cultivators trickled in—some Golden Core, some Nascent Soul, even two or three Soul Transformation cultivators.

There would always be some who put life and death aside, but such people were too few.

Looking at these rogue cultivators, the city lord felt moved, his heart a mix of emotions.

"Thank you, fellow Daoists, for lending your aid in West Talisman Prefecture's time of crisis."

"If—if the city falls in the end, fellow Daoists need not blame yourselves. Beneath my city lord's manor is a small teleportation array. Take my token and escape from there."

The rogue cultivators laughed heartily:

"City Lord, we were born in West Talisman Prefecture. Now that it faces danger, how can we stand by?"

"Exactly. Some seek power for eternal life; I seek the Dao only to protect what I care about. The city lord must feel the same, yes?"

"Kindred spirits."

These rogue cultivators joked, showing not a trace of fear.

Though in their hearts, they already understood the consequences of standing firm.

"Death is just death. If I can't even protect what I want, what's the point of cultivating?"

"Thank you all." The West Talisman Prefecture city lord bowed sincerely. In adversity, one sees true hearts—this was probably what it meant.

Time was pressing. He dispensed with formalities and directly assigned tasks.

Soon, on the distant horizon, a mass of black clouds swept toward them—the prelude to a violent storm.

Black clouds pressing down on the city, threatening to crush it!

"They're here!"

"Activate the city defense array. Hold West Talisman Prefecture."

"Fellow Daoists, hold this line. If West Talisman Prefecture falls, vast territories behind us will be lost. Countless humans will die. West Talisman Prefecture must not fall!"

"Understood."

The leader of the Wu Tribe was merely a late Body Integration cultivator. Such a cultivator leading the attack showed considerable importance.

After all, cultivators of deep power mostly had detached natures.

Time's erosion made many Grand Ascension cultivators forget their temperaments. Eternal life was their only goal.

So there was no need to worry about Grand Ascension cultivators.

Indeed, as the Wu Tribe expected, even after half a day of killing, not a single Grand Ascension cultivator appeared.

"Master, why are we so blatantly slaughtering yet no one comes to stop us?" The Body Integration cultivator's disciple asked.

"Humans are like this. On the surface they're powerful, but their hearts are complicated. Everyone has their own agenda—they can't unite."

"I once infiltrated human society and cultivated among them for a time. The deepest impression was that every one of them was clever. This is both a strength and a weakness."

"They always think: I won't stick my neck out—someone else will. And if I stick my neck out too soon, what if someone's waiting in the wings? What if the early bird gets shot?"

"In the end, not a single person sticks their neck out."

The Body Integration Wu Tribe cultivator smiled. What good was cleverness when they couldn't unite? Just scattered sand.

Then he addressed the Wu Tribe disciples behind him: "When you kill, remember to leave an opening. Don't surround them too tightly—fish fighting for their lives get desperate. I'll be waiting at the exit."

"Understood."

An old trick—leave an escape route so they won't resist to the death.

This Body Integration Wu Tribe cultivator had clearly not wasted his years among humans—he understood human nature deeply.

Closer and closer!

250 miles...

150 miles...

100 miles...

The enemy was at the gates!

"Array, activate!"

The West Talisman Prefecture array activated. A mysterious, solid pillar of light shot from the city center straight into the clouds, then spread outward like a canopy, covering all of West Talisman Prefecture in a sturdy barrier.

Outside the city, the Wu Tribe cultivators floated silently in the air.

Facing off against those in the city.

"Another defensive array. Turtling up, are we? Watch me smash your shell."

He raised his hand and summoned a massive hammer. The hammer left his hands, flew high, and transformed into a thousand-foot iron hammer that crashed straight down.

Boom!

The entire defensive array rippled like calm water struck by a boulder.

But the array had some power—it wasn't smashed through. Still, it looked precarious. Without reinforcements, it wouldn't hold long.

The severity went beyond this.

The cultivators stationed at eight positions to anchor the formation's corners were struck by this hammer. Though it didn't hit them directly, the tremendous force transmitted through left each one's heart sinking, heads spinning.

A few more strikes like that—even if the array held, they'd be shaken to death by the aftershocks.

"Let's see how many strikes you can take." The Body Integration Wu Tribe cultivator smiled. Too easy.

Hammer after hammer fell. The array's fluctuations grew more obvious, as if it might shatter any moment.

The West Talisman Prefecture city lord sighed inwardly. Was heaven truly bent on destroying West Talisman Prefecture?

The Body Integration Wu Tribe cultivator struck again. The thousand-foot hammer grew into a mountain ten thousand feet tall.

This blow could flatten all of West Talisman Prefecture.

The hammer descended closer and closer, pressing against the defensive array. The array shattered with a roar—no more protection!

Not just the city lord—everyone watching that enormous shadow above them felt certain death was upon them.

But they couldn't give up.

"Damn it—at worst, we die! Fight!"

Some cultivators, resolved to die, were about to activate forbidden techniques.

"Where'd this hammer come from? Making it this big—trying to kill people?"

"Have you no sense of public decency?!"

Just as everyone sank into despair, an angry shout rang out.

Then an invisible giant hand shot up from the city center, seizing the ten-thousand-foot hammer and pulling it down.

The hammer shrank smaller and smaller, finally becoming an ordinary-sized hammer. Everyone stared in dumbfounded shock.

They turned to look behind them.

There stood a middle-aged man in green robes with long hair, sword-like brows and star-bright eyes, casually weighing a hammer in his hand.

"Who is this? So powerful."

"What senior is this?"

The West Talisman Prefecture city lord's sharp eyes immediately recognized his robes: Supreme Mystery Holy Land!

Elder Youxu hefted the hammer, saw the array wasn't broken, and nodded approvingly:

"No casualties. Not bad."

The Body Integration Wu Tribe cultivator's pupils contracted. There were masters?

Can't disrupt the plan. First see if we can negotiate—Grand Ascension cultivators are emotionally detached. Offer him some benefits and he probably won't interfere.

Thinking this, he spoke respectfully:

"Fellow Daoist? I am of the Wu Tribe..."

A whooshing sound. That little hammer actually flew out, fast as lightning.

"Wu my ass!"

"So you're the one called Wu Tribe!"

The Body Integration elder's soul nearly left his body. Before he could react, his hammer flew back at him, brimming with killing intent.

Thud!

The hammer struck squarely on his head—one strike, instant death. The boundless killing intent invaded his body, annihilating his divine soul along with his life force!

A headless corpse fell heavily to the ground.

Hiss—that powerful? One hammer and he's gone!

The West Talisman Prefecture cultivators now had confidence. With such a senior here, what was there to fear?

With their leader dead, the remaining Wu Tribe members didn't panic. Some even shouted:

"Quick! That man's a Grand Ascension cultivator—we can't escape! Scatter and charge into the city!"

"Take the human cultivators hostage! Otherwise we all die here!"

Quick thinking—these Wu Tribe members even knew mixed-battle tactics. So what if there's a Grand Ascension cultivator?

We'll blend in with the humans. Surely you won't kill us all?

Impossible. Absolutely impossible!

This was actually viable. Besides the Body Integration cultivator, there were several Void Refining, dozens of Soul Transformation, and countless Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators among the Wu Tribe.

This group numbered over ten thousand!

At this cry, West Talisman Prefecture's people immediately tensed. Grand Ascension cultivators were strong, but they were weak!

If these people charged in, surely the Grand Ascension senior couldn't protect everyone?

"Fall back! Retreat to the inner city for defense!"

Elder Youxu was surprised. Huh, not running? Still launching an attack?

Well, that made things easier!

"All units, attention."

Behind Elder Youxu, tens of thousands of Supreme Mystery disciples rose into the air.

The Wu Tribe, having charged halfway, found themselves in a dilemma.

What—what was this?

"Humans are so damned cunning! Hiding this many people yet still using tricks."

"Quick—run!"

From attack to retreat in one second flat!

The Supreme Mystery Holy Land disciples' eyes gleamed with bloodlust.

Just this many people? Not enough to kill!

Some clever disciples immediately took off at maximum speed. These weren't Wu Tribe members—these were their future wives' dowries!
