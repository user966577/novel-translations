Yaochi Immortal Palace.

Lingyan had been staying here for over a year now.

A year ago, she'd finally waited for the man who could make decisions to return, thinking her chance had come.

Only for that man to stride right past her without a glance and head straight out the gates.

He hadn't shown his face for over a year!

She waited and waited, approaching Yu Yue several times to ask when he might make himself available.

But Yu Yue wouldn't entertain her. Her answer was always the same: "The Young Master does what he wishes. When he decides the time is right, he'll come out naturally. Just be patient."

Lingyan couldn't help but wonder.

What kind of man could make Yu Yue this devoted?

She remembered clearly—Yu Yue, Palace Master of Yaochi Immortal Palace, had once carved half the body off her brother. And yet this very woman had given her heart to a man.

It was hard to fathom.

She resolved to wait it out. A year or two was nothing to cultivators like them—barely a blink.

Xiao Fan led Jiang Lanzhi by the hand, the picture-perfect couple walking side by side as they entered Yu Yue's palace.

They happened to run into Lingyan, who had come to see Yu Yue.

Xiao Fan's gaze swept over Lingyan, and alongside his admiration came a strange sense of familiarity—as if he'd seen that face somewhere before.

Lingyan studied Xiao Fan in return. Even she couldn't help but marvel at his peerless beauty.

What a handsome young man. Was the Palace Master really so shallow as to fall for a pretty face? Lingyan mused. He is quite easy on the eyes, though.

Yu Yue spotted Xiao Fan and immediately stepped forward with a smile. "Young Master, you're here."

Her gaze went straight to him, but from the corner of her eye she noticed Jiang Lanzhi holding his arm with unmistakable intimacy.

More importantly, she carried Xiao Fan's scent—unmistakably so.

As one of Xiao Fan's women, Yu Yue knew exactly what that meant.

Curious as she was, she didn't ask. Listening to the Young Master was enough.

Xiao Fan said, "Are you busy?"

"No." Yu Yue shook her head.

"Call Xinxi, Ling'er, and Ningbing over. I have something to discuss with all of you."

"Of course." Yu Yue answered respectfully and went to fetch them.

At the same time, she addressed Lingyan: "Whatever you need can wait. The Young Master isn't available right now."

Lingyan said nothing and smiled as she took her leave.

She had no choice—her position didn't allow otherwise.

In front of any other faction, she only had to mention being the Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor's sister, and everyone would treat her as an honored guest.

But at Yaochi Immortal Palace, that card didn't play.

Watching Lingyan's retreating figure, Xiao Fan felt that nagging familiarity intensify. That back view... he'd definitely seen it somewhere.

Once everyone else had gone, Jiang Lanzhi smiled and said:

"Husband, didn't you say the two Palace Masters of Yaochi Immortal Palace are your women?"

"But just now, it seems like you called three women's names. Add the one who left to deliver the message, and that's four."

Jiang Lanzhi knew he was a flirt, but she hadn't expected him to be this prolific.

You've got four women stashed in a single palace?!

Four? Only because he hadn't called Su Jinxiu—otherwise it would have been five.

To this question, Xiao Fan answered honestly: "Lanzhi, I won't hide it from you. They're all my wings. We fly together."

"I can't in good conscience claim I don't love them—that would make me irresponsible. But I can tell you with absolute certainty: you are the irreplaceable woman in my life."

He placed both hands on Jiang Lanzhi's shoulders, leaned slightly forward, looked her directly in the eyes, and spoke with unwavering conviction:

"Lanzhi, they are part of my life too, just as you are. If I lost any of them, my life would be incomplete."

Jiang Lanzhi listened to these words. He was clearly a heartbreaker—so why did it somehow sound so deeply romantic?

Before she could process it, Xiao Fan cupped her face.

Jiang Lanzhi's red lips parted in a slight pout. She knew perfectly well what was coming, yet every time, her nerves got the better of her.

Xiao Fan intensified, making her lose all rational thought.

His large hands traced along her jade-smooth back, occasionally grazing lower, sending heat surging through Jiang Lanzhi's body and crashing her mind.

After a long, breathless moment, their lips parted, a translucent thread stretching between them—still connected.

Xiao Fan gazed at her with deep tenderness and asked softly:

"You'll understand me... right?"

Jiang Lanzhi's fragrant breath came in waves, her face still flushed, lingering in the afterglow. She had clearly enjoyed every second.

Hearing his words, her throat bobbed.

"Fine," she murmured. "I won't pry into your personal affairs. Happy now?"

"Thank you, Lanzhi. You really are the most gentle, virtuous, beautiful, dignified, understanding, considerate, and lovely woman in the world."

He pulled her into his arms and kissed her forehead softly.

How was Jiang Lanzhi supposed to withstand such a barrage of sweet talk?

Am I really that wonderful?

Or is he just flattering me?

If you're going to talk like that—keep going!

Jiang Lanzhi said, "Fine. But let's get one thing straight—I am the principal wife!"

"Naturally. We're formally engaged. You've met both my parents. No one can rival you there." Xiao Fan confirmed without hesitation.

Before long, Yu Yue returned with the others.

Yu Yue, Xinxi, Ningbing, and Zhao Ling'er—the four women lit up at the sight of Xiao Fan.

But they were curious about the woman at his side.

Zhao Ling'er especially, the most imaginative of the group.

"Xiao Fan, who is she?" Zhao Ling'er asked.

Before Xiao Fan could reply, Jiang Lanzhi answered for herself: "Hello, sisters. I'm my husband's formally betrothed fiancée. In terms of seniority, I'm your older sister."

Zhao Ling'er's mouth formed a little "oh" of surprise.

"When did you get engaged? How come I didn't know?"

"That was before my ascension."

Xiao Fan introduced her to the group. "Lanzhi, my fiancée."

"In the days ahead, you may need to fight side by side. Make sure to get along."

Side by side.

Simple enough words, yet coming from Xiao Fan, the women detected an oddly loaded meaning.

Ningbing, Zhao Ling'er, Yu Yue, and Xinxi in particular all thought simultaneously of the last Five Elements Fusion session, and turned red in silence.

Jiang Lanzhi thought this was rather strange. It's just an introduction—what's there to be embarrassed about?

Yu Yue and Xinxi operated with Xiao Fan as their center of gravity, obeying his every command without making things difficult. They quickly accepted Jiang Lanzhi's seniority as eldest sister.

Zhao Ling'er followed her two masters' lead without objection.

But the thought of sharing Xiao Fan's affection made her maiden heart anxious. Lose something, gain something—the eternal dilemma.

So she mustered the courage to stand beside Xiao Fan and take his arm.

Just... be a little closer to him.

Long Ningbing was the most unbothered. She'd never cared about such things. Her obedience to Xiao Fan, in some ways, exceeded even Yu Yue's and Xinxi's.

Under Xiao Fan's guidance, the women gradually warmed up to one another.

Then Xiao Fan asked, "Yu Yue, who was that woman earlier?"

"The Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor's sister. She came seeking an alliance."

"I was actually about to discuss it with you."

Understanding clicked for Xiao Fan.

The Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor's sister.

That made her Nana's aunt.

No wonder she seemed so familiar—that's why her silhouette reminded him of someone.

"What did she want?"

Yu Yue explained everything.

"Nothing major. She said the Heavenly Demon Tribe wants to serve as guards for Yaochi Immortal Palace. Their price is permission to settle on a patch of land in the Eternal Immortal Domain."

Yu Yue continued, "I didn't make a decision. I defer to you, Young Master."

Although Nana was merely one of Xiao Fan's playthings, they did have some connection.

Letting the tribe relocate wasn't out of the question. On Nana's behalf, he could offer a small favor.
