Chapter 153: Helping Su Yiyun Get Revenge, Two Realms Gate

Xiao Fan bid farewell to the Grand Elder and went to Su Yiyun's palace.

As Xiao Fan's first woman, Su Yiyun always carried a hint of first love.

Xiao Fan walked in openly. The maids at the door tactfully departed.

Su Yiyun hadn't been in closed-door cultivation lately, so her cultivation progress had been limited. Even with Xiao Fan's special attention, she was only at Nascent Soul stage now.

Master Qingyu had always been hands-off, but after Su Yiyun took over holy land affairs—though she delegated most matters to the Grand Elder—she still needed to handle things personally if she wanted to truly take charge of Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

When Xiao Fan entered the palace, Su Yiyun was sitting at her desk, processing the mountain of jade slips piled before her.

"West Dust Mountain has a spirit vein emerging—which elders should I send?"

"Recently, demons have been running rampant in the Snow Moon Mountains. Apparently many mortals have died. I need to dispatch people to handle that too."

"The next Holy Land Immortal Dao Grand Tournament begins in three years. If we're participating, it's about time to select disciples."

Su Yiyun's pretty face was full of concentration, handling holy land affairs meticulously.

She didn't even notice Xiao Fan swagger into the palace.

Not until Xiao Fan walked to her side and waved his hand in front of her peach-blossom eyes did she react.

"You're here." Su Yiyun said with delighted surprise, abruptly standing up. Her delicate hands hooked around Xiao Fan's neck as she offered her sweet kiss.

Xiao Fan was caught off guard. It had only been a few days—why did she seem ready to devour him?

Still, he responded gently to Su Yiyun's boldness, until finally she couldn't catch her breath, and he let her go.

Su Yiyun's soft arms held him tight, her smiling face beautiful beyond words as she buried her pretty face in his embrace, savoring this moment of tenderness.

Seeing how attached she was to him, Xiao Fan felt somewhat guilty.

He was constantly switching between women, while Su Yiyun stayed alone in an empty room. Though cultivators could control their desires better than mortals, when those desires did erupt, they were far more intense.

Come to think of it, ever since their first intimate moment, he hadn't had any alone time with Su Yiyun.

"You're that eager? I haven't even made a move, and you threw yourself at me." Xiao Fan chuckled, his right arm around her soft waist, his left hand stroking her fair, smooth cheek.

Su Yiyun's face reddened as she pouted: "Hmph, it's all your fault for corrupting me."

Despite her words, Su Yiyun held Xiao Fan even tighter, savoring his tenderness.

Su Yiyun had long since given her heart to Xiao Fan. Whether in status, appearance, talent, or reputation, Xiao Fan was impeccable. Having such a man left her deeply content.

He was just a bit fickle. And somewhat perverted.

Xiao Fan was past the age for sweet talk—he preferred to prove himself through action.

"My fault." Xiao Fan said, yielding.

"Ah!" Su Yiyun felt a surge of strength beneath her. She was lifted into Xiao Fan's arms like a princess.

Su Yiyun's peach-blossom eyes overflowed with tenderness. She wasn't very bold about such matters and couldn't bring herself to speak of them.

But the fire in her eyes was incredibly alluring.

Xiao Fan smiled. The Spacetime Secret Canon flew out, and carrying Su Yiyun, he entered it.

Xiao Fan activated the Spacetime Secret Canon's twelve-fold time acceleration. The two of them spent quality time together.

...

One month later, Su Yiyun and Xiao Fan emerged from the Spacetime Secret Canon.

At twelve-fold acceleration, a year had passed inside the book.

Xiao Fan hadn't only been enjoying himself—he'd also worked hard to boost Su Yiyun's cultivation.

The gap between their cultivations was too large. Su Yiyun couldn't reciprocate and boost his cultivation; he could only help her. But he didn't mind—helping his own woman was only natural.

When Su Yiyun entered, she'd only been at late Nascent Soul. When she emerged, she'd reached late Void Refining, on the verge of Body Integration.

A year of diligent cultivation, combined with Xiao Fan's persistent efforts, had sent her cultivation soaring.

"I'll help you through your tribulation." Xiao Fan said softly.

"Mm." Su Yiyun's jade face flushed with spring warmth. She felt cultivation wasn't so dreary after all—rather, it was endlessly delightful.

The two tidied their appearances. Xiao Fan took Su Yiyun's delicate hand, and in an instant, they traveled a thousand miles, arriving at the Ascension Platform in the blink of an eye.

Finding an empty Ascension Platform, Xiao Fan flew straight in.

"Don't worry. I'm right here." Xiao Fan stood beside her, not moving an inch.

The Heavenly Dao couldn't do anything to him anyway.

"Alright." Su Yiyun smiled sweetly and began releasing her aura. Instantly, her late Void Refining aura was revealed in full, and thick tribulation clouds began to gather.

Su Yiyun trusted Xiao Fan unconditionally. She hadn't yet undergone her Soul Transformation tribulation or her Void Refining tribulation.

Now facing her Body Integration tribulation, she'd have to endure all three tribulations she'd skipped—a triple tribulation!

Soon, tribulation clouds swirled.

At first, the disciples watching from outside were curious. Who was undergoing a Soul Transformation tribulation at the Body Integration Ascension Platform? Did they come to the wrong place?

But soon, they realized they were the ones who felt out of place.

"Wait, what's going on? Why are there two people?"

"That's not the point—the point is, why does she have three layers of tribulation clouds?"

"That's the Holy Maiden!"

"The one standing next to her is the Holy Son."

"Holy Son and Holy Maiden, a perfect match made in heaven. But do they even have to undergo tribulation together?"

No one could understand it. But then, ten-zhang-thick tribulation clouds descended, carrying immense heavenly might.

A purple lightning pillar struck down. Su Yiyun's expression showed pain—she clearly couldn't quite handle it.

Xiao Fan looked coldly at the sky. Striking with such powerful lightning—was it trying to kill his woman?

Damn thieving heaven.

Xiao Fan deployed his Divine Domain of the Gods, enveloping Su Yiyun within. With his current Golden Immortal-level strength, a mere Body Integration tribulation couldn't possibly break through the Divine Domain's absolute defense.

He allowed only a small amount of lightning through, striking Su Yiyun with just enough to produce a tingling sensation, never painful.

Su Yiyun smiled at Xiao Fan, feeling completely safe. As expected of her man—he could even toy with heavenly tribulations.

"Husband, won't doing this with the tribulation harm you?" Su Yiyun asked seriously.

If it was a burden on him, she felt she should handle it herself.

Xiao Fan laughed: "If heaven has a problem with it, let her come fight me one-on-one. I'm not afraid of her now."

"As long as it's no burden, that's fine."

The system had said before that the mortal realm's Heavenly Dao was only at Heavenly Immortal level. With his current strength, he had nothing to fear.

As for why Xiao Fan was protecting Su Yiyun—his women didn't need to suffer tribulation hardships. Tribulation was just a formality. If heaven disagreed, let her come to him.

In Xiao Fan's view, his women just needed high cultivation and immortal longevity. Fighting and killing, building strength—that was his own business.

Undergoing three tribulations simultaneously was already mocking the Heavenly Dao. Reducing the tribulation lightning's power on top of that—did the Heavenly Dao have no face to save?

Thus, lightning poured down more terrifying than even immortal ascension tribulations, as if feeling violated.

But no matter how fierce the Heavenly Dao's lightning became, it couldn't break through his Divine Domain of the Gods. Even how much tribulation lightning entered the domain was up to Xiao Fan.

After striking for half a day and finding it pointless, the tribulation simply dispersed, like a frost-bitten eggplant—wilted and dejected.

Outside the Ascension Platform, the Supreme Mystery Holy Land disciples watching this operation exchanged bewildered glances, feeling their worldview had been devastated.

"Can tribulations really be passed like this?"

"Wait, three layers of tribulation lightning and it only took half a day? Isn't this too casual?"

"Damn, why do I get the feeling heaven just gave up?"

"I think so too."

"The Holy Son alone made the tribulation clouds retreat—is this really the Holy Son's strength?"

Just how strong was the Holy Son?!

Su Yiyun was overjoyed. This Body Integration tribulation felt easier than Core Formation.

She spent half a day stabilizing her aura, then immediately turned to Xiao Fan, planting a kiss on his cheek, speaking with tender affection: "Thank you, husband."

"Haha, the knowledge you've learned is the best thanks you could give me." Xiao Fan laughed, taking Su Yiyun's jade hand and flying out of Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

He looked up at the sky, his gaze blazing.

"Dared to strike hard at my woman—remember this. I'll repay you well!"

Xiao Fan departed with Su Yiyun in style. Their appearance as an immortal couple made many female disciples envious.

Being the Holy Son's woman seemed far too blissful. But they didn't dare think too much—after all, they could only look up to the Holy Son's status.

Out of reach.

"Husband, aren't we going back?" Su Yiyun clung to Xiao Fan adoringly, like a little wife.

The two flew through the clouds, racing onward without pause.

"Didn't you say you'd found out who your enemy was? I'm taking you to kill them." Xiao Fan patted her head.

Su Yiyun froze, looking up at him with emotion, then smiled sweetly: "Thank you."

"Thank me for what? You're my woman. Your business is my business." Xiao Fan said, gently stroking her hair.

"Mm."

Su Yiyun had long since discovered who was responsible, but the enemy was powerful—a demonic holy land. Though not as strong as Supreme Mystery Holy Land, it was still a top-tier force.

Though she was the Holy Maiden, she couldn't start a war with another holy land over personal grudges.

So she'd buried the matter in her heart. It was only when Xiao Fan spent time alone with her and brought it up, pressing her for details, that she finally explained the situation.

She'd never intended for Xiao Fan to act on her behalf—she'd planned to slowly accumulate strength and move when the time was right.

But now that they knew who was responsible, things were simple.

Before ascending, he'd wipe out this enemy for Su Yiyun, giving her one less thing to worry about.

After some maneuvering, they soon arrived above the demonic holy land: Blood Spirit Holy Land.

This Blood Spirit Holy Land presented an immortal paradise—ancient trees reaching toward the sky, cranes flying in unison, mist swirling, spiritual energy dense. Even the disciples' robes were pure white.

But no matter how well the exterior was disguised, Xiao Fan could still see the bloody, baleful aura rising to the heavens from above this Blood Spirit Holy Land. It was just well-concealed.

"What should we do?" Su Yiyun asked.

She now trusted Xiao Fan unconditionally. She didn't doubt his methods at all—if he could toy with heavenly tribulations, would he fear this Blood Spirit Holy Land?

"Watch."

Xiao Fan gestured, and the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda flew out, hanging silently in the sky above Blood Spirit Holy Land. The inch-sized pagoda instantly expanded to ten thousand zhang, its five-colored radiance cascading down to envelop the entire Blood Spirit Holy Land.

Blood Spirit Holy Land's main territory spanned ten thousand miles, yet under the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda's divine light, it seemed incomparably tiny.

Locked down!

The sudden change terrified the elders and disciples of the holy land.

A Body Integration elder charged out, glaring furiously at the two of them, wanting to attack but unable to break through the five-colored barrier. Helpless.

Xiao Fan remained unmoved, simply continuing his methods.

His right hand gestured, and the void trembled, then shattered inch by inch, revealing the dark, incomparably cold gateway within.

"Gates of Hell, open!"

"Everyone inside is your food. Eat as much as you can."

"But bring those few old Grand Ascension bastards out to me. I have questions. Once I'm done asking, you can eat them however you like."

As his words fell, countless dark shadows rushed out from that cold gateway.

In the blink of an eye, the entire Blood Spirit Holy Land was plunged into darkness. They couldn't see their hands in front of their faces. Cold winds howled, and wails echoed everywhere.

"Ah, who—what the hell is this? Get away from me!"

"Run—ah, my arm!" Some disciples watched their bodies disappear inch by inch, terrified beyond measure.

Wailing, slaughter, terror—it instantly filled all of Blood Spirit Holy Land.

Where the dark shadows passed, not even bones remained. The only evidence of the deaths that occurred here were scattered drops of blood.

Su Yiyun wasn't surprised. No matter how great his abilities, she considered it normal. My man is just that excellent!

The demon gods from hell normally couldn't even see a soul, but now millions of lives lay before them. They went mad, frantically harvesting their food.

From appearance to disappearance, barely ten breaths passed.

The entire Blood Spirit Holy Land went from quiet to sudden chaos, then back to silence. There was no resistance—they didn't even know who was killing them.

"Finished harvesting? Get back inside before I harvest you!"

Seeing the demon gods' eager gazes toward the outside world, Xiao Fan spoke coldly. Truly steeped in demonic nature—just a bit of blood qi triggered their killing intent.

Hearing Xiao Fan's cold snort, all the demon gods wilted, scrambling back into the Gates of Hell.

The only ones remaining were the demon gods restraining Blood Spirit Holy Land's Grand Ascension cultivators.

The Blood Spirit Holy Lord and Blood Spirit Holy Land's Grand Ascension elders were all shaken. They didn't understand where these beings had come from. Their painstakingly built holy land, passed down through countless generations, had turned to ash in the blink of an eye.

When they saw Xiao Fan's face, they felt no calm whatsoever—only timidly said: "Senior, we don't know how our holy land offended you. Please tell us and we'll certainly change."

"Die. Too much nonsense!" Xiao Fan placed his hand on the man's head. Soul Search Technique!

These people couldn't resist under the demon gods' suppression. They could only let him do as he pleased.

Anything connected to an Immortal King had to involve forces beyond the mortal realm—no need to ask. There was definitely someone behind this.

But Su Yiyun didn't know. Xiao Fan didn't want her to know either—it would only add pressure.

The Holy Lord's mouth twitched, his eyes rolled back. His soul was being ruthlessly torn by Xiao Fan, all his memories laid bare.

"Blood Spirit Holy Land—the orthodox lineage of the Immortal Realm's Blood Soul Sect."

"Received orders from the upper realm. Learned the location of the Remnant Soul Immortal King's enemy. Ordered to kill."

The situation was roughly as Xiao Fan had guessed.

An Immortal King was hunted by enemies, clinging to his last breath as he entered the lower realm, where a child of destiny found him—which then led to the massacre of an entire clan.

The child of destiny escaped, eventually ascended, and ultimately grew powerful enough to help the Remnant Soul Immortal King take revenge and rebuild his physical body, reaching even greater heights.

But Su Yiyun's family suffered undeserved disaster.

Seeing Xiao Fan silent, Su Yiyun asked curiously:

"Is something wrong?"

"Nothing. Just killed them too fast—no satisfaction." Xiao Fan said. "Do you want to do it yourself?"

Su Yiyun shook her head: "Forget it. Having my revenge completed is enough for me."

"Alright."

"They're yours to dispose of." Xiao Fan told the demon gods.

The demon gods beamed with joy—though their green faces and fangs made their smiles rather terrifying.

Crunch, crunch. Howls and crisp snapping sounds, then soon silence. The demon gods returned, the Gates of Hell closed.

In the Holy Maiden's palace, ten holy, radiant Primordial Female Angels now stood guard, answering to Su Yiyun's command.

They stood respectfully outside the palace.

And Su Yiyun watched Xiao Fan's departing figure, her gaze somewhat infatuated, murmuring: "Even his walk is so handsome. I'm so blessed."

[Ding! Host killed without batting an eye—and your eyes didn't even get dry. Exterminated an entire sect. Truly a murder maniac.]

[You really are a killing demon, a natural-born villain.]

[Reward received: Two Realms Gate.]
