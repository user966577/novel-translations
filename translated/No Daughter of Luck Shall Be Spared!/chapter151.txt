Chapter 151: Do You Still Hate Me?

"Answer my question and I may spare your life."

The leading Golden Immortal woman said.

Xiao Fan couldn't stand being threatened. I hate it most when people threaten me—and when they don't accept my threats.

"Spare my life? You ruined my fun and even scared my woman into illness."

"Let's see who spares whom!"

Xiao Fan wasted no more words. He brought out the Nine Luminaries Heavenly Emperor Cauldron, which he hadn't used in ages.

He'd pondered this Nine Luminaries Heavenly Emperor Cauldron for a long time without fully understanding it. But one ability was unique to this cauldron.

That was its crowd control capability.

"Cauldron Fixes Heaven and Earth!"

The Nine Luminaries Heavenly Emperor Cauldron flew out silently, fixing itself in the sky. Instantly, the area within a hundred miles seemed to congeal, becoming incredibly solid.

These Mystic Woman Palace disciples were initially disdainful. A Holy Son from a mortal world's holy land dared to speak so arrogantly?

But when the Nine Luminaries Heavenly Emperor Cauldron appeared, their expressions immediately turned serious.

"You have some skill." The leading woman's face showed a hint of seriousness.

"It seems you definitely know something about my brother's death."

Xiao Fan ignored her, instead quickening his own pace. Brother's death? Among those he'd killed who could have a sister like this immortal, only Wu Chen came to mind.

"You're Wu Chen's sister?"

"So you do know!" Wu Chen's sister's gaze focused. Her slender jade finger pointed out, instantly shooting seven-colored radiance straight at Xiao Fan's heart.

"Petty tricks, and you dare show them off!"

When Xiao Fan summoned the Heavenly Emperor Cauldron, he'd also deployed the Divine Domain of the Gods that he'd cultivated over the past six months.

"Divine Domain of the Gods. Within my divine domain, you shall only be judged."

He seemed like a god descending to earth. A deep shout emerged from his mouth, echoing like the sound of heaven and earth, the great Dao flowing.

Hum!!

The Heavenly Emperor Cauldron seemed to respond to his call, emitting a soul-shaking sound. That seven-colored radiance was actually dispersed just like that.

Within Supreme Mystery Holy Land, countless disciples watched the sky above, exchanging glances.

"That's the Holy Son, isn't it?"

"Someone without eyes must have provoked him."

"Three seconds of silence."

They'd long since acknowledged Xiao Fan's strength.

What the Holy Son couldn't handle, the elders probably couldn't either. What the Holy Son could handle, the elders were useless for anyway.

Best to just focus on their own matters.

Though the Divine Domain of the Gods wasn't large, it overlapped with the Nine Luminaries Heavenly Emperor Cauldron's range. But it was solid. With the two combined, his crowd control was invincible.

Seeing her attack neutralized, Wu Chen's sister's eyes revealed killing intent.

That strike just now was enough to kill an Earth Immortal.

Yet this person had blocked it effortlessly. With such strength, killing her brother would have been child's play.

"You're the one who killed my brother!"

"Killing? I handle that situationally. Ugly ones I kill. Pretty ones like you—I have another way of dealing with!"

The old pervert's words were always so blunt.

Xiao Fan knew to mind his image. Though I'm a pervert, I can't lose my righteous gentleman image in front of outsiders.

So—come out, Five Elements Exquisite Express Hotel!

The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda flew from his chest, growing enormous and sucking the entire hundred-mile area inside.

These Mystic Woman Palace disciples also understood their opponent was no pushover. They had to use real techniques.

They each displayed their skills, all manner of divine lights dancing and floating, immortal artifacts crisscrossing, bombarding the Heavenly Emperor Cauldron, trying to create even the smallest opening to escape.

Unfortunately, these were all treasures that once belonged to children of destiny. Their grade was extraordinarily high—not something a few Heavenly Immortal small fry could resist.

Wu Chen's sister also understood she had to use her real abilities. She summoned a golden lotus platform that actually made the Heavenly Emperor Cauldron shake.

The surrounding space rippled along with it.

"Some skill." Xiao Fan smiled.

But it was too late. The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda descended, capturing all twelve people inside.

Heavenly Emperor Cauldron, inside the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda, plus the Divine Domain of the Gods—three home-field advantages completely stacked together.

These eleven people were nothing but lambs to slaughter, cabbage waiting to be stir-fried.

The eleven were captured inside some unknown pagoda. They raised their guard to full alert, warily watching everything around them.

"Divine Maiden, this..."

"This man isn't simple, Divine Maiden."

"What do we do?"

Her disciples were already panicking.

"Form the Ten Directions Celestial Maiden Formation. Don't be afraid. He's just a Grand Ascension cultivator borrowing some external power from treasures. He can't hold out long."

Wu Chen's sister commanded loudly.

It must be said—to maintain composure under such adversity, those who could become Divine Maidens were indeed extraordinary.

But Xiao Fan was no ordinary person.

Xiao Fan stood right before them.

"You ruined my fun, so my temper is running hot. Helping me cool down seems reasonable, doesn't it?"

Xiao Fan said coldly.

Before she could answer, multicolored chains shot from the pagoda's body. Under Xiao Fan's control, they moved like spirit snakes, winding and coiling, binding the slender waists of all eleven women.

The Ten Directions Celestial Maiden Formation collapsed without being attacked.

Wu Chen's sister's pupils contracted sharply. She already knew this immortal artifact's grade. What shocked her was how a Grand Ascension cultivator could control an artifact of this level.

But she had no options left.

Because the chains flying toward her had arrived.

She tried to dodge, but Xiao Fan gave her no chance.

The Heavenly Emperor Cauldron activated again. With a hum, the cauldron's might shook her spirit, preventing her from concentrating. The Divine Domain of the Gods contracted, trapping her firmly, preventing any movement.

No retreat left. The multicolored chains bound her limbs.

Like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

"I'm sick of talking about feelings every day. This time I'll go without feelings."

Xiao Fan smiled lewdly.

"You... what do you want?"

"Want you."

Bound hand and foot, unable to move, she had never felt such a lascivious gaze—eyes of pure desire, blazing lust burning endlessly, wanting to devour her.

No one had ever dared look at her this way.

Who was she? The Divine Maiden of Mystic Woman Palace, a proud daughter of the Wu Tribe, destined to rule an immortal domain and command her own territory. How could she possibly be scanned so brazenly?

Chains coiled around her limbs. The power of the five elements continuously poured into her body. Xiao Fan wouldn't risk himself.

First he'd seal away her entire cultivation—that would make things easier.

Wu Chen's sister felt her cultivation being suppressed by the five elements power. She couldn't exert any strength.

She struggled desperately to resist, but it was futile.

Once he confirmed it was safe, Xiao Fan gave a gentle tug. The Divine Maiden's immortal body, miraculous beyond words, was revealed before his eyes.

"Hmph, ruining my fun—let me show you what cruelty means!"

"No, don't, don't come near me!" Wu Chen's sister's eyes filled with shock. She'd never imagined this outcome.

Xiao Fan's sword had long been hungry and impatient.

"Mm!"

Pain appeared on Wu Chen's sister's face, disbelief filling her—I... I was taken by a mortal ant?

Three days later, Xiao Fan looked at Wu Chen's sister lying on the bed, dead inside, and felt a sense of satisfaction.

No talking about feelings. No paying. No taking responsibility.

And no need to care about her feelings either. Was there a more perfect toy in the world?

Wu Chen's sister glared at him with hatred. Xiao Fan didn't care, merely smiling: "Do you hate me?"

"Don't ever fall into my hands, or I'll show you what it means to wish you were dead." She spoke with venom.

"Still daring to threaten me?" Xiao Fan said coldly.

He acted again, showing her what cruelty meant.

Ten days later, her throat was sore.

She felt she was beyond saving. There wasn't a single intact spot on her body. Before this man, she had no secrets left.

"Do you still hate me?"

"I..." She gasped for breath, towering hatred radiating from her.

"Seems you have quite a lot of complaints about me."

More cruelty!

Xiao Fan lost count of how many times she'd talked back.

Every time she showed even a hint of resistance, Xiao Fan would show her what cruelty meant.

Now, the moment she saw Xiao Fan, her whole body trembled. She didn't dare say a single word.

"Do you still hate me now?"

Her eyes were evasive, like a wounded puppy. Her entire body trembled. She didn't dare speak at all.

"Help me bathe." Xiao Fan said casually, his tone brooking no argument.

She forced herself through her exhaustion to stand, following Xiao Fan to the bathroom.

She had no power to resist. Whatever Xiao Fan said, she did.

Xiao Fan lay in the bathtub while Wu Chen's sister timidly helped him bathe. Gone was any trace of the Divine Maiden's cold elegance. Xiao Fan truly was cruel. She really couldn't take it anymore.

Xiao Fan took her delicate hand and pulled her over.

He scooped warm water with a basin, helping wash away the traces he'd left on her. She was terrified but didn't dare resist—she could only stand there trembling, not daring to move.

Xiao Fan was very thorough... washing everything clean.

The comfort made her moan involuntarily.

Xiao Fan raised an eyebrow, smiled slightly, and continued.

Wu Chen's sister didn't dare meet his gaze. She lowered her head in fear, but a strange feeling arose in her heart.

"When he's not being cruel... he's actually quite gentle."

[Ding! Your gentleness has made Wu Lingyun develop a hint of fondness toward you.]

Xiao Fan sneered inwardly. Though this method was quite twisted, it was what she deserved. Who told her to ruin his fun?

Xiao Fan cleaned her up properly. He'd been too focused on venting his anger these past days to look at her face carefully. She truly was stunningly beautiful—crescent brows and alluring eyes, bright gaze and white teeth. Most importantly, her temperament.

Cold enough! Those beautiful eyes, cold as frost!

"Quite the cold little beauty, aren't you?" Xiao Fan said with a smile.

She didn't dare speak, afraid that saying something to displease him would earn her another round of cruelty.

"Don't think about leaving. From now on, this is your new home."

Before she could respond, Xiao Fan left the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda. As for her cultivation—naturally it remained sealed.

[Ding! You forced yourself on Wu Lingyun, the daughter of luck, without reason. Forcing the issue like a tyrant.]

[Quite twisted indeed. But you were already twisted anyway. Reward: 99,999 Villain Points.]

[You forcefully took the Mystic Woman Palace's Divine Maiden. If Wu Lingyun's mother finds out, she'll definitely make you regret it!]

Xiao Fan was fearless. Come one and I'll be cruel to one. Come two and I'll be cruel to both.
