Chapter 155: Holy Crap, This Little Brat Even Schemes Against His Own Father!

"Meeting the parents?"

Xiao Fan paused, looking at Long Ningbing's flushed face. He instantly understood what was happening.

She'd cast herself in the role of Xiao Fan's partner. This trip home—wasn't that meeting the parents?

Seeing her like this, Xiao Fan found it amusing.

"Oh right, right. Don't you need to prepare? Maybe do your makeup or something?" he said with a light laugh.

Long Ningbing's slender azure dragon tail swayed aimlessly, sometimes going rigid, sometimes coiling around her waist. She was so anxious she grabbed her tail with her hands.

"B-but I never learned. I don't know how to do any of that." She lowered her head weakly, feeling like she was useless garbage who couldn't do anything.

This wasn't her fault. After all, she was the Ancestral Dragon's daughter, living a life where everything was provided. Dressing and grooming—she had dedicated maids for all of that.

Seeing her like this, Xiao Fan decided not to tease her further. He simply told her the truth.

"Relax, I was just messing with you."

"I'm going home to undergo tribulation and become immortal. Also to reunite you with your brother Long Aotian."

Long Ningbing's little mouth hung open, dumbfounded. This wasn't what she'd expected at all?

"I misunderstood?"

Xiao Fan: "You could say that."

Long Ningbing's already flushed face instantly turned so red it looked ready to drip blood. She forced a smile, hands tightly gripping the hem of her dress, trying to speak as calmly as possible:

"I'm sorry. Please excuse me."

With that, Long Ningbing covered her face with both hands and fled as if escaping, her embarrassment making her dragon tail go stiff.

Watching Long Ningbing run away, Xiao Fan smiled knowingly. So innocent.

"Holy Son, everything's packed." Xinxi was efficient—in the time it took to speak, she'd already gathered Xiao Fan's belongings.

There wasn't much anyway. Cultivators weren't like mortals—they didn't need bedding, weren't dragging along family, and they had storage rings to use.

"Good, let's go."

Xiao Fan put Wangcai in a spirit beast pouch. Though he wasn't useful in fights, he could still guard the house.

"Mm."

Xinxi was also delighted. The Holy Son truly was a genius—joining the holy land for just two years and already able to undergo tribulation and become immortal.

As for the mount, that was naturally Long Ningbing.

Those nine golden dragons—Xiao Fan had promised Long Ningbing he'd release them. He wouldn't go back on his word.

As for Long Ningbing, being a mount... though she was still somewhat shy, Xiao Fan was doing this deliberately. He specifically sat on her dragon head, both hands gripping her dragon horns.

It felt like holding a steering wheel.

Long Ningbing was about to cry. She asked Xiao Fan to let go of her hands. She was already serving as his mount—if he had to hold her horns, couldn't he at least not do it in public?

Couldn't they play this way in private?

Such a pure dragon girl—Xiao Fan really couldn't bear to tease her anymore. Fine then.

Halfway there, Xiao Fan had her transform back into human form. The three walked side by side, but Long Ningbing's face still burned. She stayed next to Xinxi, not daring to approach Xiao Fan, afraid he'd do something outrageous again.

Under the blue sky and white clouds, the three traveled on the wind. Below them, mountains, rivers, and lakes continuously receded. The breeze blowing against them felt particularly gentle.

Vast grasslands, rolling mountains, and many people below who looked like tiny ants, rushing about their business.

A different sort of feeling welled up in his heart. Mortals really were busy—working an entire year without knowing what for, then the year ends and it's time to prepare for next year's affairs.

Was it living 365 different days in a year, or repeating the same day 365 times in a cycle?

Long Ningbing didn't have such complicated thoughts. She just gazed at everything below with great interest, occasionally letting out an exclamation of surprise.

"Sister Xinxi, why are those two groups fighting? It seems like their leaders share blood resonance."

In a certain imperial city, two princes were competing for the throne, swords and blades clashing.

Xinxi smiled: "That's quite normal. For mortals, the allure of an imperial throne is probably about the same as a Saint's throne for cultivators. Brothers turning on each other is nothing—patricide, fratricide, killing wives and children, even massacring their own clans—it all happens."

Hearing this, Long Ningbing's face went pale. Clearly her experience was too limited. She found it hard to understand—was a throne really that attractive?

Xiao Fan watched her frightened expression. Pure young girls really were fun—both physically and mentally.

With Xiao Fan's Grand Ascension cultivation, returning to the Xiao family took less than half a day.

Long Aotian seemed to sense something, standing at the gate waiting early. Beside him stood a fourteen or fifteen-year-old youth.

It was Xiao Fan's nineteenth uncle.

He'd lost much of his childishness, but his youthful look remained.

"You said your sister is coming back. Are you sure you didn't sense wrong?"

"How could I be wrong? We dragon-kind have secret techniques for sensing our own. And that's my sister—I wouldn't sense wrong." Long Aotian said decisively.

"Alright then."

Over the years, the two had become playmates.

Though Long Aotian's cultivation was higher, that was innate. His mental age was only about eight, roughly matching the then-twelve-year-old Xiao An's temperament.

With Xiao Fan's permission, Long Aotian had lived quite comfortably in the Xiao household. The cultivation resources couldn't compare, but in terms of freedom, the Xiao household was definitely more comfortable.

"Hey, when are you going back up to heaven?" Xiao An asked curiously.

"Back to what heaven? What's so fun up there? I'd rate it lower than here." Long Aotian didn't miss home at all. If possible, he wouldn't mind staying permanently.

"Heaven's not fun?" Xiao An asked doubtfully.

"Nope. Can't go here, can't go there, and the people up there are all scheming." Long Aotian spoke with distaste.

"I see." Xiao An took note.

He also knew Long Aotian's background was extraordinary. He was just curious about what the immortal realm looked like.

Xiao An was fourteen now, having just formed his golden core. It would be another thousand years or so before he became immortal. Some curiosity was natural.

"They're here!" Long Aotian looked at the sky. A group of three, and especially seeing Long Ningbing, he couldn't contain his excitement and flew out.

"Sis! I'm here!" He bounded over eagerly.

Long Ningbing had been chatting happily with Xinxi when suddenly she heard a familiar shout—though the appearance was somewhat unfamiliar.

She turned to look at the child charging toward her. Familiar, but she couldn't place who.

After all, he'd changed bodies. Not recognizing him was normal.

"You are?" Long Ningbing's beautiful eyes blinked as she examined him carefully.

"It's me, I'm Aotian." He said excitedly.

Long Ningbing suddenly understood, looking at him with surprise and delight.

"Aotian, why do you look like a different person?" Long Ningbing said excitedly.

"It's a long story. My previous body was destroyed." Long Aotian scratched his head.

"That's wonderful. I thought something had happened to you. I'm so glad you're alright." Long Ningbing laughed.

Long Aotian looked at Xiao Fan, his face full of gratitude: "Big Brother Xiao, from now on, if you ever need anything, just ask. Whatever I can do, I'll do it for you."

Help with things? How about introducing your other unmarried sisters?

He couldn't say that out loud, of course. Xiao Fan simply said: "Mm, if I need anything, I'll definitely come to you."

Long Ningbing and Long Aotian were siblings reunited. Having been apart so long, they naturally had much to talk about.

Xiao An also flew up, looking at Xiao Fan and nodding with satisfaction: "Without me looking after you, seems like you've been doing pretty well."

Xiao Fan: ??

"Nineteenth Uncle, want to rephrase that?"

"Fine. You're finally back. Those Gundam puppets you gave me—I'm bored of them all. When are you getting me some new toys?" Xiao An flew to his side, enthusiastically massaging his shoulders.

A face full of flattery.

Xiao Fan hadn't expected this. He knew how to butter people up now. Growing up, was he?

"Kids play with toys. Us adults play with women." Xiao Fan's words were shocking. Xiao An frowned at this.

Was it really appropriate to say such things to a pure young man like him?

"Real men should compete for supremacy, stir up the world's winds and clouds, use all living beings as chess pieces. Playing with toys is idle amusement—it'll ruin you. No more playing from now on." Xiao Fan spoke in an adult's tone.

"Huh? But I'm only fourteen, still early-stage Golden Core. Isn't that a bit too advanced?" Xiao An was confused.

"Start from childhood, understand?" Xiao Fan said.

"Not really."

"You will eventually."

With that, Xiao Fan made an excuse and rushed toward his father's palace.

Heh heh heh, old man, I've had my eye on your Purple Orchid Immortal Sword for a while now.

In his hand was a personal letter from the Hundred Flowers Holy Lord, meant to be delivered to his father. Was this really a letter? It was clearly an exchange voucher for his Purple Orchid Immortal Sword!

Xiao Fan's father had sensed Xiao Fan's presence from the start. There was a vague feeling of ill intent.

Could it be? Was his son really that rebellious?

Strange, very strange. This kid had always run to his mother whenever anything happened. When had he ever come straight to his palace like this?

Definitely something fishy!

While Xiao Fan's father was still wondering what trick this kid was up to, Xiao Fan had already appeared before him, all smiles as he greeted:

"Good morning, Father."

Such a sweet mouth? Something's wrong!

Xiao Fan's father was looking at a sword manual, keeping a straight face. He set down the manual, glanced at Xiao Fan, and said indifferently:

"What do you want?"

"Can't I come see you for no reason?" Xiao Fan walked right over and started rummaging through the sword case behind him for the Purple Orchid Immortal Sword.

He remembered clearly—it was a purple sword. Every strike of sword qi was like an orchid blooming, flowers bursting with life while carrying bone-chilling killing intent.

That feeling of life and death merged as one appealed to Xiao Fan, and it wasn't too bloody either. Those killed by this sword would decompose into fertilizer, and orchids would grow from their corpses.

Not the most powerful, but the most unique attribute—it solved the problem of disposing of bodies.

"What are you doing?!" Xiao Fan's father put away the sword case, treating it like treasure.

No wonder this kid came to him—he'd set his sights on his swords.

"Father, can you give me your Purple Orchid Immortal Sword?"

Xiao Fan's direct request caught him off guard.

"No." His father put away the sword case, not giving Xiao Fan any chance to touch it.

Xiao Fan said with a grin: "Father, don't refuse so quickly."

With that, he pulled out the Hundred Flowers Holy Lord's letter and waved it in front of his father's face.

At first, Xiao Fan's father wasn't concerned. Hmph, don't think you can get my Purple Orchid Immortal Sword.

But when he saw the familiar, delicate handwriting on that letter, his pupils contracted sharply. Holy crap, how did you get this?!

"Ahem, well, what's this about? It's just the Purple Orchid Immortal Sword. Giving it to you isn't impossible. Let me verify if it's real first."

Xiao Fan said nothing, just handed the letter to his father. At the same time, he used a recording stone to capture his father's expression while reading the letter.

Preserving evidence!!

Soon, a reminiscing look appeared on his father's face—sweet yet wistful—as if recalling his lost youth.

Xiao Fan was curious. How old was he anyway? The Hundred Flowers Holy Lord was only a few thousand years old. How old was his father, to be making that nostalgic-for-youth expression?

After reading, his father sighed, his gaze distant.

Looking toward... Hundred Flowers Holy Land. Then his expression turned melancholy as he carefully, reverently stored the letter like a precious treasure.

Holy crap, so sentimental.

"That's enough. Hand it over." Xiao Fan didn't stand on ceremony, interrupting his reverie.

But his father kept a straight face, pretending nothing had happened, continuing to read his sword manual.

Holy crap, so heartless.

"Father, I gave you the letter. At least give me the Purple Orchid Immortal Sword." Xiao Fan said with a grin.

But his father spoke solemnly: "What? I didn't receive anything."

Xiao Fan's expression froze. He'd planned to deal with him as an ordinary person, but now he was forced to expose his hand.

"Father, you can't be like this. I gave you the letter—shouldn't you give me compensation?"

"What letter? Don't make things up. I'm the devoted type who only loves your mother. I would never be unfaithful."

He spoke with perfect seriousness, completely throwing Xiao Fan off.

Fine, fine, playing that game?

Xiao Fan used his traditional skill—copy!

Sigh, embarrassing to admit, but he'd actually planned to scheme against his father from the start. He'd definitely have many women in the future, and keepsakes would need to be given to each one.

What to give? His father's sword case supposedly held hundreds of millions of immortal swords. Fleecing him for a few hundred wouldn't be a problem, right?

Xiao Fan pulled out over a hundred letters, identical to the previous one. His father froze on the spot.

Holy crap, scheming against his own father.

"Father, you wouldn't want Mother to know about you and the Hundred Flowers Holy Lord, would you?"

Xiao Fan walked out smiling.

In his hand, he toyed with the Purple Orchid Immortal Sword. His storage ring also held 888 additional immortal swords—five-element attributes, light attribute, dark attribute, lightning attribute, wind attribute, and so on. All kinds of elemental swords.

Made a killing!

He should visit the Hundred Flowers Holy Lord more often to build rapport and extract more useful information.

His father's heart bled. Damn, what a little brat—scheming against his own father.

"The Purple Orchid Immortal Sword... sigh. If Little Purple finds out I gave this sword away, will she discover I faked my death?"

"Sigh, hopefully not."

Indeed, this was another keepsake sword from a dalliance with an immortal maiden.

Moreover, to escape the Purple Orchid Immortal Sword's original owner, he'd even faked his own death. Now it had all been for nothing. He could only pray she wouldn't find out.

So Xiao Fan being such an old pervert—it was definitely inherited from his father.

As for the story behind the Purple Orchid Immortal Sword, Xiao Fan didn't know. Even if he did, it wouldn't matter—just more evidence to keep milking swords from his old man!
