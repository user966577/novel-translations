Chapter 157: Preparing for Ascension

Before Xiao Fan could recover from his shock, his mother had already brought out three treasures custom-made for him.

She pointed to a thin, gossamer-like armor that contained the radiance of a sea of stars, and explained:

"This is the Vast Sea Stellar Heaven Mystery Armor. I gathered the stars of all heavens... ah, stellar power, and forged this protective treasure for you. Mother tested it—even your father couldn't cut through it. The defensive power is extremely strong."

"It can merge perfectly with your skin. Don't worry about wearing it. And you don't need to worry about activating it either—it contains endless stellar power that will keep you safe."

With a wave of her jade hand, the stellar soft armor shifted from palm-sized to human height, wrapping Xiao Fan completely from head to toe. Then it slowly seeped into his flesh, merging as one.

From head to toe, it fit seamlessly. Even his eyeballs were covered, yet it didn't affect him at all. Truly miraculous.

Xiao Fan examined this treasure armor. Its aura was far stronger than the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda—meaning this treasure's defensive power far exceeded the pagoda's.

Xiao Fan had a feeling his mother had let something slip.

Stellar power? More likely forged from the actual stars of all heavens. It felt very powerful, but Xiao Fan didn't press further, since his mother clearly didn't want to explain.

"This second item is called the Primordial Boundless Lu Yu Shuttle."

"There's a mortal saying: 'The steed runs swift as Lu.' This treasure shuttle can make you travel faster than others."

She cast a seal, covering the shuttle's spiritual glow, making it look ordinary—like a common flying boat.

His mother... did she think he'd never heard of immortal realm cultivation levels?

Using the name "Primordial Boundless"... him, a newly ascended lowly Human Immortal, using something like this—was that really okay?

He silently accepted it. Don't misunderstand—he just didn't want his mother's efforts to go to waste.

Seeing Xiao Fan take note, she continued:

"This third item is called the Seven Treasures Purple Gourd. This gourd doesn't have many major effects, but its defensive capabilities are exceptional. Inside, whenever enough stellar power accumulates, it will condense into a Seven Treasures Immortal Pill. The Seven Treasures Immortal Pill can aid your cultivation, temper your constitution, refine your divine soul—it has many effects. Whatever you can think of, it can do."

Xiao Fan accepted the Seven Treasures Purple Gourd, staring blankly at his mother. This...

Fine, all very powerful treasures.

"It's just—why are they all life-saving items? Don't you have anything more... deadly?" Xiao Fan asked.

Xiao Fan's mother's expression shifted, but she spoke earnestly: "What are you cultivating for? Isn't it for longevity?"

Xiao Fan: "That's true, but Mother, your protection is too strong. With such powerful things protecting me, aren't you worried I'll cultivate into a waste?"

"Without danger, I won't feel fear. Without fear, I won't develop a strong warrior's heart. Isn't this like me being protected by you, like a flower in a greenhouse?"

His mother nodded, but simply said: "What's wrong with being a greenhouse flower?"

"I've cultivated hard for so many years. If my son still has to suffer, what's the point of my cultivation?"

This counter-question left Xiao Fan somewhat speechless. It seemed... to make some sense.

She hung the Seven Treasures Purple Gourd at Xiao Fan's waist, likewise casting a technique to conceal its treasure glow.

"Mother doesn't ask that you achieve great things. As long as you live well, that's the best repayment to Mother." She lovingly stroked Xiao Fan's head.

Xiao Fan felt somewhat pained. Damn Temple, making his mother worry so much. If he didn't uproot them completely, he'd be failing his mother.

He put away the booklet, pretending to know nothing.

"Mother, don't worry. I'll take care of myself."

"Mm, Mother believes in you."

"Now go on. Yuhong is probably getting anxious waiting. Go ahead." She smiled.

"Mm."

After Xiao Fan left the palace, his father's figure slowly materialized beside his mother, gently drawing her into his embrace.

"Giving him so many things—is that really wise? Aren't you overthinking this?"

His mother humphed: "You're one to talk. All you do is look at your sword manuals all day. Don't even know to care about your son. He's so naive—if I don't prepare more treasures for his protection, how can I rest easy?"

Naive?

This kid really was... so well-behaved in front of his mother, but in front of him it was nothing but extortion and blackmail.

Unbelievable.

His mother sighed: "Now that our son has grown up, I can't help but feel reluctant."

"What's there to be reluctant about? I can't wait for him to hurry up and grow."

His mother ignored his words. Why did it seem like there was friction between father and son?

Watching Xiao Fan's departing figure, she suddenly said: "Now that our son has grown up, it's about time to settle accounts with the Temple."

His father's expression also turned solemn: "I've just mastered a new Universal Ten-Kill Sword Formation. Perfect to test it out on the Temple."

The two seemed to reach a tacit understanding, planning how to deal with the Temple.

...

Walking out of the palace, Xiao Fan asked the system in his mind:

"System, what level are these three treasures?"

[Very high level. About three or four stories tall.]

"I'm asking about the grade!"

[Three sacred artifacts. Of the remaining 105 items, all are first-grade immortal artifacts.]

[Among the three sacred artifacts, besides the Seven Treasures Purple Gourd which is relatively lower-grade and barely counts as a Great Dao Sacred Artifact, the other two are outstanding among Great Dao Sacred Artifacts—their power immeasurable.]

[Envious, Host, having such a powerful mother. Unlike this system—naturally powerful from birth.]

Xiao Fan: ...

Really wanted to slap him to death, if only he could.

"So I haven't even gone up yet, and already no one in heaven can kill me?"

[That's roughly the idea.]

Life was truly lonely as snow.

Good thing he had cultivation motivation—the Membrane-Breaking Blade!

Stepping out of the palace, Lan Yuhong hadn't left. She'd been standing outside waiting the whole time.

The moment she saw Xiao Fan emerge, she immediately came forward, her smile like flowers.

"Brother Xiao Fan, you're out."

She hesitated, but still reached out to hold Xiao Fan's arm, humming a little tune with a sweet smile, turning her head away as if afraid to show her shyness.

"Why are you still waiting here? If I hadn't come out, would you have just kept standing there?"

"Of course. It wasn't that long anyway. It's nice waiting for Brother Xiao Fan to walk together." She smiled sweetly.

Xiao Fan and she chatted as they walked. Lan Yuhong loved this feeling—like a couple on a secret date. She nestled in Xiao Fan's embrace, savoring this moment of tenderness.

The Xiao household was vast. The two just walked and talked through it, time slipping quietly through their fingers. A day passed quickly.

"Brother Xiao Fan, I should probably head back. Mother only gave me one day off." Lan Yuhong said reluctantly.

"Head back? Back to what?"

Xiao Fan chuckled, taking Lan Yuhong's hand and leading her to his own Young Lord's palace.

Lan Yuhong's face flushed crimson, so red it seemed about to drip blood. She knew what was about to happen—both anticipating and nervous.

As for cultivation... dual-cultivating together with Brother Xiao Fan was also cultivation.

On the bed, Lan Yuhong sat quietly, hands tightly clasped, sometimes clenching into fists, sometimes gripping the hem of her dress. Her excessive nervousness made her breathing quicken. She kept her head bowed, letting the loose hair at her temples cover her flushed face.

Xiao Fan took her hand—warm with a hint of nervous perspiration.

Sharing favor evenly. Before ascending, Xiao Fan planned to properly comfort Lan Yuhong's longing for him. He didn't rush to act, instead talking with her, tender words easing her nervousness.

Lan Yuhong was all tenderness, feeling Xiao Fan's gentleness. Her tense body gradually relaxed, melting like soft spring water.

The atmosphere heated step by step. Xiao Fan gently cupped Lan Yuhong's pretty face, making her look at him. The silky smoothness from his hands made Xiao Fan's heart burn.

He kissed her. Lan Yuhong also mustered her courage, extending her delicate hands to hook around his neck. The Brother Xiao Fan she'd dreamed of day and night was right before her. Lan Yuhong couldn't contain her feelings.

She matched Xiao Fan.

Everything flowed naturally. Everything succeeded smoothly.

Their long-separated longing made Lan Yuhong yearn for everything about Xiao Fan. She wanted Brother Xiao Fan to remember her tenderness.

Xiao Fan was also very loving toward Lan Yuhong, bringing her joy.

Wanting to spend more time with her, Xiao Fan brought Lan Yuhong into the Spacetime Secret Canon, activating twelve-fold time acceleration.

The story began with Lan Yuhong's yearning call of "Brother Xiao Fan" and ended with her satisfied, blissful moan.

...

One month later.

A year had passed inside the book.

The youthfulness on Lan Yuhong's face had faded somewhat, replaced by a bit more charm and tenderness.

"Brother Xiao Fan, you really are a genius. You even thought of using it this way. Mother has a time-accelerating sundial too, but it's only ever used for cultivation."

"For me to reach Body Integration so quickly was all because Mother gave me hundred-fold time acceleration."

Lan Yuhong was still quite innocent. A cultivation-use acceleration feature being used like this...

He truly was a genius!!

She helped Xiao Fan bathe and dress, speaking with a gentle smile.

Xiao Fan just smiled without comment.

I'm an old pervert—I can't be compared to an innocent young girl like you.

"Brother Xiao Fan, Yuhong will cultivate hard and become immortal as soon as possible to reunite with you."

"Mm, I know. Yuhong can do it."

After finishing everything, Lan Yuhong returned to Xiao Fan's mother to continue her bitter cultivation.

Work hard at cultivation. Strive to reunite with Brother Xiao Fan as soon as possible.

And Xiao Fan had also prepared sufficiently. He was ready to ascend and become immortal.
