Chapter 140: Body Integration? I'm Going Straight to Grand Ascension! Do You Choose to Defy Heaven or... Hao?

Showed off and ran—damn, that's thrilling.

Xiao Fan glanced back at Wu Chen's script. Could survive three moves against an Earth Immortal.

Yet he couldn't take a single move from me. Does that mean I'm even more impressive than an Earth Immortal?

Entirely possible.

He now had a new understanding of his own power: not saying I could destroy an Earth Immortal, but at least I could probably fight them evenly.

Returning to his palace, Xiao Fan took out the Dark Mask.

He examined it closely. It wasn't even black—rather, it was pure white.

Yet there was a faintly discernible quality about it. He touched it lightly and found it caused no ripples whatsoever. Under his divine sense scan, this thing was completely invisible, as if it had never existed.

Interesting!

Without overthinking, he placed the Dark Mask directly on his face. The mask merged into his features and vanished completely. He looked in a mirror—no different from before.

[This is merely an attribute bonus. It won't affect the host's handsome appearance or slow down your progress with women. Rest assured.]

Holy crap, good stuff!

They'd even thought of that.

Xiao Fan opened his fate panel.

What appeared inside was quite peculiar—just a single short line.

[Fate when divined face-to-face: Utterly ordinary nobody. A handsome guy who will definitely not take flight.]

[Fate when divined from behind: Unfathomably dark and powerful. Anyone who dares divine will suffer backlash—minor spitting blood, major severe injuries near death.]

True invisibility wasn't others not seeing you—it was standing right in front of them while they remained oblivious!

No matter how they divined, they'd only see him as an unremarkable handsome guy.

Meanwhile, Xinxi brought him the Wu God Blood and Wu God Sword that the Divine Son had carried. Xiao Fan played with them briefly before tossing them aside.

Still couldn't compare to the Purple Orchid Immortal Sword in his father's hands. Plus, this Wu God Sword was rather ugly—its surface all grimy and uneven, with zero style.

As for the Wu God Blood, Xiao Fan fed it to his Demon God Body. Felt pretty good—both divine and demonic natures were growing.

Xiao Fan was moved. Wu Chen really was a good person, sending fortune and Wu God Blood.

When would another person like this come along?

Refining this Wu Blood, Xiao Fan felt his cultivation surge to the edge of breakthrough. Thinking it over, he packed up a hundred million spirit stones, plus tens of thousands of barrels of pills—all Spiritual Nurturing Pills to increase spiritual energy.

Breaking through one level? I'm going straight to Grand Ascension!

He flew directly to the Ascending Platform and asked an elder to clear everyone out while he underwent tribulation.

The Ascending Platform elder naturally had no objections. He'd already heard about Xiao Fan punching out Grand Ascension cultivators at Hundred Flowers Holy Land. After this tribulation, his power would rise another level.

Perhaps even a descending immortal couldn't withstand a punch from the Holy Son?

The Ascending Platform elder immediately cleared the area. Fortunately, no one was undergoing tribulation today, so he canceled all reservations.

"Very good. Which way for Body Integration to Grand Ascension?"

"This way. But Holy Son, aren't you going from Void Refining to Body Integration?"

"Short on time. I'll do both at once."

With that, Xiao Fan vanished, leaving a gust of wind and the Ascending Platform elder standing there, bewildered.

"Both at once? Can that even work?"

The Ascending Platform closed, going on lockdown. Disciples who'd come to undergo tribulation looked confused.

"I've never heard of the Ascending Platform closing."

"Exactly. Doesn't the Ascending Platform have two elders taking turns?"

"Look, there's an announcement by the door."

"Let's go see what's happening."

The group went over. The announcement above read:

[The Holy Son says he's undergoing two tribulations consecutively—from Void Refining to Body Integration, then Body Integration to Grand Ascension. Everyone stand back. Come again after he's done.]

They didn't find the rule unreasonable. After all, he was the Holy Son—having some privileges was normal.

What they found strange was that this tribulation seemed a bit abnormal.

Two consecutive tribulations, sprinting from Void Refining directly to Grand Ascension.

Impressive.

"Outrageous. I'm going to watch and learn."

"I also want to see how exactly one undergoes two tribulations consecutively."

While they were still talking, tribulation clouds began gathering in the sky.

Clear skies for ten thousand miles suddenly became covered with dark clouds.

Lightning churned within the cloud sea, like dragons lurking in the deep—fierce and domineering.

Above, Xiao Fan didn't bother with formalities and simply began his tribulation.

The first tribulation lightning fell. He tested it lightly—just a slight tingle in his flesh, then nothing else.

He released his mind. He couldn't be struck to death anyway, so no need to worry. Just take the lightning.

With his current body of 480 million dragon-elephant particles, he had long transcended mortal levels. This mortal tribulation lightning was basically just a tickle.

Time was pressing. He threw out a hundred million supreme-grade spirit stones. The entire sky seemed to produce an ocean of spirit stones.

And Xiao Fan was swimming through them.

That wasn't all. He also threw out all the Spiritual Nurturing Pills he'd brought—tens of millions of them.

All suspended in the air together.

This staggering wealth would be gone after the tribulation.

Below, the watching disciples were dumbfounded.

"The Holy Son is... ignoring the tribulation lightning?"

"I saw it too. The tribulation lightning hitting him seems to have no effect."

"More than that—he's directly cultivating, refining spiritual energy."

"Holy crap, that many spirit stones?"

"Is he planning to refine all of them?"

Looking at those hundreds of millions of supreme-grade spirit stones and tens of millions of Spiritual Nurturing Pills, everyone's brains seemed to short-circuit. Wasn't this... a bit too difficult?

Xiao Fan didn't know their thoughts. His gaze focused, his aura exploded. All those spirit stones and pills detonated at once.

Spiritual energy and medicinal power merged. Under Xiao Fan's guidance, they formed a five-colored auspicious cloud of pure medicinal power and dense spiritual energy. The leftover pill dregs, toxins, and spirit stone fragments all fell away.

He inhaled sharply. The originally massive cloud of spiritual energy and medicinal power was instantly drawn into threads that drilled into his body.

The medicinal power and spiritual energy were being refined at visible speed.

This was Xiao Fan's trump card. The dragon-elephant particles were essentially small giant elephants, each capable of independently refining spiritual energy and medicinal power. With 480 million dragon-elephant particles, each could refine several supreme-grade spirit stones.

In other words—he had 480 million helpers for refining spiritual energy!

In merely an hour, all that medicinal power in the sky had vanished. Xiao Fan's cultivation was visibly climbing.

Late-stage Void Refining...

Early-stage Body Integration...

Mid-stage Body Integration...

Late-stage Body Integration...

Everyone was dumbfounded.

This actually worked?

Xiao Fan continued cultivating, producing another hundred million supreme-grade spirit stones and pills, repeating the process.

The dragon-elephant particles helped him refine—a divine skill.

After passing the Body Integration tribulation, the Heavenly Dao prepared to disperse the clouds and reveal clear skies. Never expected this person would be so shameless and keep going with another tribulation!

Didn't he know the Heavenly Dao was off work today?

Making me work overtime? I'll strike you dead. Watch me strike this bastard dead!

Bolt after bolt of black lightning, like dragons and tigers, filled with towering rage, momentum like a rainbow, charging like a wild bull, descended without restraint.

This black lightning struck Xiao Fan's body, making his hair stand on end—literally standing upright from the strike.

But there wasn't much pain. Just a bit more tingling than before. Everything else stayed the same.

"Hm? Why does today's tribulation lightning seem so angry? The power's also stronger."

"Makes sense though. Grand Ascension tribulation should be stronger than Body Integration tribulation. A bit more tingling is reasonable."

Xiao Fan figured this was normal. Since it couldn't harm him, he didn't pay much attention.

This tribulation.

From start to finish, took a full two and a half months.

Xiao Fan's cultivation had also reached early Grand Ascension.

"What level am I at now?" Xiao Fan walked out of the Ascending Platform, clenching his fist.

At Void Refining, he'd had Earth Immortal power.

Now he was Grand Ascension—two major realms higher.

Following the hierarchy of Human Immortal, Earth Immortal, Mystic Immortal, and Celestial Immortal—Earth Immortal plus two levels equaled Celestial Immortal. So I probably have Celestial Immortal power now?

Being conservative, immortal cultivation was difficult with huge power gaps between levels. So knock one level off. Punching a Mystic Immortal to death should be no problem.

"When's a Mystic Immortal coming?" Xiao Fan was eager to try.

[Ding, the Heavenly Dao was off work today. Your consecutive tribulations left the Heavenly Dao with no vacation. She bears a grudge against you and sent down black world-ending divine lightning.]

"Hm?"

Wait, bears a grudge? She?

What does that mean?

[The Heavenly Dao also has vacation time. Host's consecutive tribulations disturbed the Heavenly Dao, making her come back to conduct the tribulation. The Heavenly Dao is angry and resents you, wishing she could strike you dead with one bolt.]

[This Heavenly Dao is truly willful. Activating side quest. You have two choices:

One: Defy Heaven.

Two: Hao Heaven.]

Xiao Fan: ???

What the hell is this?

Xiao Fan looked troubled, hesitant to speak. After a while, he finally said earnestly: "If you don't give me a picture of what this Heavenly Dao looks like, it's really hard to choose."

[Already sent to your brain. Please check.]

As expected of the system—it truly understands me!

Xiao Fan closed his eyes. A lovely face appeared in his mind. Hiss.

Loli height, mature woman's aura, plus that illegal ball-handling.

A pair of beautiful eyes, cold and emotionless. Dark brows, cold and proud. Somewhat arrogant, yet making one want to get to know her better. Delicate nose, crystalline red lips. A cool, emotionless face.

Hmph, how dare you harbor killing intent toward this lord? You've found your way to bed-warming!

However, heaven birthed all things to nourish mankind, yet mankind has nothing to offer heaven in return. Defying heaven wasn't absolutely necessary.

Forget it. Just give her a good beating and call it a day.

Only Children of Fortune defy heaven. We villains absolutely never defy heaven!!

"System, how can I meet this emotionless Heavenly Dao?"

[Very soon. System guarantees. Your current power is approaching the Heavenly Dao's level. When you can handle her, this system will snatch her over to warm your bed.]

Good, I trust you! Hehehehe...

Under the worshipful gazes of countless disciples, Xiao Fan left the Ascending Platform with a perfectly serious expression.

Some rejoiced while others worried.

The moment the Wu Tribe Divine Son died, the Wu Tribe powerhouses in the upper realm learned of it through his life tablet and were furious!

They tried to divine who was responsible, but all they saw was a black, cold mask. That dark mask's pupils glowed faintly, releasing an eerie light that made the Wu Tribe powerhouse conducting the divination cough up black blood.

"Someone is blocking heaven's secrets!"

"Not just blocking—there's backlash too. Could an supreme power have intervened?"

There's an expert!

The Wu Tribe higher-ups had mixed thoughts. For someone to cause their divination expert to suffer backlash, this person was no small matter.

"Should we investigate?"

"I think we should at least look into it. After all, Wu Chen was our tribe's Divine Son. Not investigating would be hard to explain to the clan."

"The clan isn't really the concern. He wasn't that talented—300 years old and still not an immortal. The clan says he's a late bloomer, but this late bloomer shattered before blooming.

This Wu Chen was just someone with connections. But his identity is complicated."

"Right. His older sister is the Divine Maiden of the Mystic Woman Palace. She's currently in seclusion breaking through. Word is that after she emerges, even the current palace master will step back and let her take charge."

"That's not all. His mother is also extraordinary. Though born of our Wu Tribe, she's already cultivated a Dao body, transcending the level of living beings. Achieving Grand Luo is only a matter of time."

"Then... investigate a little?"

"Yes. Let the Divine Maiden look into it, put on a show. When they ask later, we'll have an answer."

"Let's do that!"

Originally in a palace within the Dark Abyss, sitting in her chambers, hands cupping her cheeks, sitting on a jade stool with her feet swinging in the air, gazing dreamily at a painting of her sister on the wall—the Wu Tribe Divine Maiden.

Was awakened by the guards outside her door.

Her dreamy smile vanished, replaced by cold indifference.

"What is it?"

The guard outside spoke:

"Divine Maiden, terrible news."

The guard explained the situation clearly.

Wu Chen had gone to Supreme Mystery Holy Land seeking revenge on his own, only to be killed. The Wu Tribe higher-ups in the upper realm were shocked. They'd passed down orders for her to thoroughly investigate and find the killer.

The orders were resolute—the mastermind behind this must be found and killed!

"Divine Maiden, what we currently know is that the Divine Son died at Supreme Mystery Holy Land. Killed by Supreme Mystery Holy Land's Holy Son with a single sword strike."

"Furthermore, the Divine Son was carrying over 300 drops of Wu God Blood on him. That's probably lost too."

Hearing this, the Wu Tribe Divine Maiden's cold face showed a flash of irritation. Damn.

"He deserved it. Serves him right!"

"Even in death he drags me down. You deserve to die ten thousand times!"

She spoke coldly: "Understood. I'll investigate."

Though she despised Wu Chen, his power was real. That he couldn't even escape meant this mortal realm's Supreme Mystery Holy Land was no pushover.

She'd need to plan carefully.

Suddenly, she had an idea. If she captured the Supreme Mystery Holy Son, she could use him as leverage to get the Wu God Blood back.

As for methods of leverage—she had plenty.

Though she despised men, she'd still learned seduction techniques—to use on her sister.

She looked somewhat guilty at that painting. The woman depicted had bright eyes and white teeth, beautiful as a celestial maiden, with three thousand black silks cascading down like a natural ink painting.

Whenever she looked at this, longing filled her eyes. Sister, when will you come out?

She was just reluctant to use seduction techniques on a man. But there was no choice—Wu Chen, that waste, had to make trouble for her.

Sister, trust me. You're the only one in my heart, forever!

Supreme Mystery Holy Son? Hmph, besides sister, no one will see my seduction. You're the first man, and the last—because the price of seeing my seduction is death!
