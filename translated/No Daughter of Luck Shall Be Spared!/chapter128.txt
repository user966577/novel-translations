Chapter 128: No One Understands the Holy Son Better Than Me!

After hearing this secret history, all the young cultivators present understood the full context.

Instantly, they glared furiously at the hook-nosed birdman before them.

Left Wu's expression turned ugly. He'd only wanted to bring the Princess back, but now that seemed impossible.

"Kid, I can give you whatever you want. Just let me take the Princess back."

Left Wu spoke as calmly as he could manage, without losing his temper—proof enough of his patience.

"What do I want? I want your life. Will you give me that?" Xiao Fan spread his hands and walked forward step by step.

Left Wu's pupils narrowed. He tried to conceal his killing intent. It had been a long time since he'd seen someone this arrogant.

"Holy Son, you mustn't."

A Grand Ascension elder from Supreme Mystery Holy Land stepped in to block him, fearing he might be taken hostage. After all, the opponent was a Grand Ascension cultivator—having some strange treasures would be perfectly normal.

"It's fine. I know what I'm doing."

Xiao Fan smiled lightly and stepped forward, rising into the air.

He showed no fear whatsoever, standing directly before Left Wu.

Countless thoughts flashed through Left Wu's mind. The most direct would be to seize this person and use him as a hostage to force them to release the Princess.

However, a sense of crisis arose in his heart—as if the moment he made a move, his life would end.

When cultivating to this level, besides strength, intuition was especially important.

This wasn't baseless paranoia. The higher one's realm, the more one could perceive heaven and earth. Body merging with heaven, one could vaguely sense the will of the heavens in the dark.

In the end, Left Wu didn't make his move.

Even so, everyone watching couldn't quite understand.

"What is the Holy Son doing?"

"Isn't the Holy Son afraid of him?"

"I don't get it."

Xiao Fan approached because he feared Left Wu might escape. Playing weak would make him lower his guard.

With his equipment, just the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda alone—even standing still and letting the enemy attack, they couldn't break through.

"I said I want your life. Will you give it to me?" Xiao Fan smiled.

"Kid, I'm seriously trying to negotiate with you. Don't be unreasonable." Left Wu was angered, but he still spoke calmly.

This impressed Xiao Fan. Usually, people this patient were villains.

After all, Children of Destiny and the like would explode at the slightest provocation.

As a fellow villain, that meant he should die even more.

"Everything I've said is true."

Xiao Fan's smile vanished. The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda at his chest radiated precious light and flew out.

The two were separated by only about ten feet. The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda easily enveloped them both.

Left Wu had been on guard the whole time. His pair of wings could make him fast as lightning, traversing the mortal world.

He saw Xiao Fan make his move. He could have dodged but didn't.

Because he couldn't understand it!

If Xiao Fan wanted to subdue him with a treasure, there was no need to trap himself inside as well.

"What kind of trick are you playing?"

"I told you—I want your life."

With those words, Xiao Fan attacked without hesitation. Hundreds of Nether God Spears condensed behind him, their cold gleam flashing at his back, killing intent boiling.

Left Wu's face turned ashen. This guy's brain must have short-circuited.

Even if there was danger, he couldn't hold back any longer.

The Nether God Spears shot out, striking directly at Left Wu's vital points.

Left Wu didn't take it seriously. He blocked earnestly, thinking that a mere Void Refining cultivator daring to attack him was already the height of disrespect.

As for the power—how strong could it be? He was blocking seriously; surely it couldn't hurt him?

Impossible. Absolutely impossible!

But he discovered he was wrong. The moment he received the Nether God Spears, the profound darkness they carried made his mind and soul tremble.

So strong!

He'd been careless! He hadn't dodged!

The Nether God Spears easily pierced through his hand, spilling crimson blood. The spears still carried ghostly flames that corroded bone and pierced heart.

Moreover, the fire couldn't be extinguished. If it continued burning, his entire hand might be destroyed.

Left Wu made a decisive choice. His right hand condensed into a spiritual energy dagger, and he sliced hard at the wound on his left arm.

Crimson flesh flew out along with the ghost fire. The next second, it all turned to ash. Any slower and his entire arm might have been lost.

"Your strength is impressive."

Left Wu spoke without changing expression. He swallowed a pill to stop the bleeding, and his wound miraculously began to heal.

Xiao Fan felt somewhat disappointed. He'd thought he could directly play the pig to eat the tiger, using his newly refined ghost fire to kill him. He hadn't expected this person to be so decisive, willing to cut off his own flesh.

"You're not bad either. Very clever."

"I think you're courting death!" Left Wu couldn't endure it anymore. He'd beat this guy half to death first.

Left Wu attacked fiercely. He spread both wings, his entire form transforming into a birdman. His wingspan stretched about ten feet, and combined with his powerful aura, he was like the king of all birds!

"Let me show you my true strength."

"Whatever you've got—with those wings, you're still just a bird."

Xiao Fan showed no fear whatsoever and fought with him.

Choosing to fight inside the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda served two purposes beyond being able to suppress Left Wu at any moment.

More importantly, the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda combined with his Five Elements Spirit Body meant he would never exhaust his energy.

Home field advantage, plus infinite stamina buff, plus the ability to end the match at any time—I don't even know how to lose this exhibition match.

Intense collisions created visible spatial ripples that crashed against the pagoda's barrier.

Though there was no visible disturbance, the power within radiated an intangible pressure that made onlookers' hearts tighten.

"Holy Son!"

"Why is the Holy Son fighting him?"

"I don't understand. This is too dangerous. The Holy Son is powerful, but he's still just a Void Refining cultivator. The opponent is a genuine Grand Ascension!"

"Holy shit, he's even revealed his true form. Can the Holy Son beat him?"

Among Hundred Flowers Holy Land, many sweated for Xiao Fan.

A Void Refining challenging a Grand Ascension—you couldn't say it was unprecedented, only that it was suicide.

"Holy Son, please stay safe!" Some Hundred Flowers female disciples said nervously—likely Xiao Fan's fangirls.

Suddenly, amid the chorus of worried voices, one voice stood out distinctly.

"Your realms are simply too low. You can't see what the Holy Son is truly pursuing."

Everyone turned to look. A perceptive young man lightly waved his fan.

"Pursuing? What can you see?"

"Exactly. I think you're just showing off."

"He's just attention-seeking, trying to stand out and show how different he is."

"I think so too."

Many sneered at him dismissively.

This perceptive young man flicked his fan forward and began speaking.

He smoothed his hair and simply said: "No one understands the Holy Son better than me!"
