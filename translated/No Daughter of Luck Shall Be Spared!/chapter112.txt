Chapter 112: Xiao Fan's Arrival

Bai Fengliu wore a humble expression, though his heart swelled with arrogance. Every faction present wasn't worth half a hair of his Shaman God Sect.

Even this Hundred Flowers Holy Land couldn't match a third of the Shaman God Sect's true strength.

The Shaman God Sect simply hadn't revealed its full power yet. Starting with this grand gathering, the Shaman God Sect's name would shake the entire world.

Hong Rushuang smiled coquettishly. "Fengliu, what are all those things you brought?"

She pointed at the dark war chariots, her face full of curiosity.

She wasn't the only one—every cultivator present was equally curious. Could they really just be for show?

Bai Fengliu spoke solemnly. "I was planning to tell you after you won the Saintess position, but since you've asked, I'll just say it now."

"These are all betrothal gifts—over a hundred carriages of treasures, all prepared for you."

The moment he said this, the entire venue erupted.

All of this was filled with betrothal gifts?

Setting aside what was inside, just this formation alone was dazzling beyond belief.

Hong Rushuang's face bloomed with joy at his words.

Being publicly confessed to in front of everyone, showered with lavish gifts—the feeling was absolutely intoxicating.

Hong Rushuang's eyes curved seductively as she giggled. "How thoughtful of you."

But Bai Fengliu pulled her into his embrace and announced to everyone present: "On this auspicious occasion, let all of you witness the love between Rushuang and me."

"Bring forth the betrothal gifts!"

The cultivators behind him immediately began pushing forward the dark war chariots one by one.

Right there, in front of everyone, they opened them.

Every cultivator present was curious. Proposing on the very day of the Saintess selection—that certainly carried a deeper meaning. He was clearly declaring his support for Hong Rushuang.

The female disciples of Hundred Flowers Holy Land felt the competitive tension most acutely.

Last time, Xiao Fan had publicly declared that no one but Jiang Lanzhi deserved the Saintess position.

Today, this Bai Fengliu had brought a hundred carriages of betrothal gifts to propose—there was definitely a sense of direct confrontation.

However, what everyone was most curious about was what these carriages actually contained.

The Shaman God Sect's people immediately opened the gifts, pushing them forward carriage by carriage as they announced:

"Shaman God Sect's Holy Son, Bai Fengliu, hereby takes this opportunity of the Saintess selection to propose to the disciple of your Holy Land, Hong Rushuang. The betrothal gifts are as follows:"

"First: Five carriages of top-grade spirit stones, each carriage containing eighty million stones.

Top-grade spirit stones of five elemental attributes—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—one carriage each, with eighty million stones per carriage.

Ten carriages of top-grade spirit stones, totaling eight hundred million."

The moment this first gift was announced, every cultivator present felt their minds go blank.

Wait, this was a betrothal? Were they sure he didn't just have too many spirit stones with nowhere to spend them?

Was the demon abyss studded with diamonds or something? How could it be this extravagant!

This gift was simply too generous. Top-grade spirit stones were the highest quality spirit stones in this world, used by Grand Ascension cultivators for their cultivation.

For a Grand Ascension cultivator to progress from early stage to late-stage perfection, calculating just spiritual energy consumption alone, they would use at most ten million top-grade spirit stones.

Even with exceptional bone structure and extraordinary physique, double that amount—twenty million top-grade spirit stones. By that calculation, this was enough for at least forty Grand Ascension cultivators to cultivate.

Moreover, single-attribute top-grade spirit stones were even more precious. This gift was simply too valuable!

Just the first betrothal gift had shocked everyone to their core.

Not just these cultivators—even that Body Integration female elder was stunned by all this.

"This..."

Rushuang, what kind of man did you find?

Bai Fengliu was quite pleased with the reactions. This appetizer alone had shocked them this much. If they kept going, wouldn't they faint?

"Second betrothal gift: Ten top-grade spiritual veins."

As he spoke, ten more carriages were pushed forward, their covers removed to reveal the spiritual veins within.

Top-grade spiritual veins produced top-grade spirit stones. They could gather the scattered energy between heaven and earth, continuously generating spirit stones and releasing spiritual qi.

These ten top-grade spiritual veins were worth far more than those eight hundred million top-grade spirit stones.

Everyone present wondered if the Shaman God Sect had lost their minds.

These items would be more than enough to cultivate a major faction. Using them for betrothal gifts seemed like complete overkill.

The Body Integration female elder was somewhat dazed. Young people these days were truly terrifying. Had he really brought out his entire family treasury?

"Third betrothal gift: One thousand treasure artifacts, one hundred low-grade Dao artifacts, ten high-grade Dao artifacts."

"Fourth betrothal gift: One hundred Body Integration-level combat puppets, ten Grand Ascension-level combat puppets."

"Fifth betrothal gift: ..."

"Sixth..."

Every single item was a priceless treasure—things money couldn't necessarily buy—yet all of these rare items were being given away.

Everyone thought Bai Fengliu had gone mad.

If he wasn't mad, then he was definitely a prodigal son. No matter how deep his family's coffers were, they couldn't withstand this kind of spending.

Especially when that person announced the final, most important gift—the entire venue fell silent.

You could hear a pin drop.

"Final betrothal gift: Three Triple Refined Origin Restoration Pills."

Hiss—any cultivator with even a bit of knowledge had heard of the Triple Refined Origin Restoration Pill's legendary reputation. This was a medicinal pill that could increase a Grand Ascension cultivator's chances of ascending to immortality.

Calling it an immortal pill wouldn't be an exaggeration!

And he was just giving them away? Three at once!

Madness. Absolute madness.

"Young Master Bai, I think I qualify too. Although I'm male, my preferences are also male—don't be so strict about gender."

"Holy shit, impressive!"

"Get lost, you dragon-chaser! Young Hero Bai, I can perform gender-change arts. Whatever type you want, I can satisfy you."

"This one's even more hardcore!"

In the face of such generous gifts, some male cultivators couldn't stay composed anymore. They decided to step up boldly!

As for the female cultivators, they were equally frantically expressing their affection.

However, Bai Fengliu heard none of it. He simply held Hong Rushuang by her slender waist and addressed the Body Integration female elder:

"I didn't have time to prepare more on such short notice. On the day of our wedding, I'll definitely have several more modest gifts prepared."

Bai Fengliu spoke with a hint of apology, still putting on airs.

Though he did indeed have the capital for it.

The Body Integration female elder also greeted him with a smile, speaking joyfully: "Since Holy Son Bai has traveled so far, please proceed to the VIP seating. Rushuang, take Holy Son Bai there—don't neglect your manners."

Hong Rushuang replied respectfully: "As you command."

But inwardly, she was incredibly smug. Let you show off, declaring in front of everyone that the Saintess position could only be Jiang Lanzhi's.

I'm going to seize this Saintess position and make you lose face.

Just as she was about to flaunt herself in front of Jiang Lanzhi, Jiang Lanzhi appeared right before her eyes.

"Isn't this Junior Sister Jiang? How come—"

But before she could finish speaking, Jiang Lanzhi swept past her in a fragrant breeze, heading straight toward the distance.

Leaving her alone, the rest of her words stuck in her throat.

Jiang Lanzhi had never felt she had any competitors, including Hong Rushuang—she had never considered her a rival.

Having been reborn, and now sharing one heart and one body with Xiao Fan, she could clearly feel a surging power welling up within her.

With her former cultivation as an Empress, she could clearly sense that killing a Body Integration cultivator with a single punch wouldn't be a problem.

With such monstrous strength, where would she find an opponent?

Through their connected hearts, Jiang Lanzhi easily sensed Xiao Fan's arrival.

"He's here!" Joy overflowed from Jiang Lanzhi's face as she gazed into the distance.

Her delicate hands gripped her skirt hem tightly, her longing clearly written on her face.

She kept checking herself, adjusting her dress.

Feeling the wind was a bit strong, blowing her hair into disarray, she gently brushed it aside, wanting to present her best appearance to him.

Everyone also noticed Jiang Lanzhi rushing out of the Holy Land, waiting expectantly at the mountain gate.

Ever since Xiao Fan had escorted Jiang Lanzhi back last time and declared that only she could be the Saintess, she had become a celebrity within the Holy Land. Everyone in Hundred Flowers Holy Land knew her name.

How high the status of this Bai Fengliu as Shaman God Sect's Holy Son was, they didn't know for certain.

But the power of Xiao Family's heir combined with Supreme Mystery Holy Land's Holy Son—this dual identity—they understood well.

Each title alone was a height they could never hope to reach.

"Isn't that Senior Sister Jiang?"

"Indeed, it's Senior Sister Lanzhi."

"What's she doing there? She seems a bit nervous."

"No, that's clearly the joy of longing. Well, I suppose."

Soon enough, everyone understood what Jiang Lanzhi was looking toward.

A figure with an aura vast and boundless, carrying an indescribable sense of ascending to the heavens, was clearing the path ahead.

With just a casual wave of his hand, a rainbow cloud bridge appeared in the previously empty sky, a hundred zhang wide.

Around the bridge, spiritual birds flew and colors flowed brilliantly, with auspicious clouds and radiant colors appearing as omens.

With every step forward, the cloud bridge extended another half kilometer ahead. At the front of the bridge, two white divine beasts billowed mist and clouds, never ceasing.

This Grand Ascension elder feared it wasn't flashy enough and wanted to add more flourishes, but Xiao Fan called a halt—this was enough.

Only then did the Grand Ascension elder stop.

This wasn't Xiao Fan's idea—it was something the elders had come up with on their own.

Having received a Triple Refined Origin Restoration Pill, simply accompanying him felt like they hadn't earned it.

What if the Holy Master discovered they weren't useful and didn't call on them next time? No, they had to make the Holy Master feel those three pills were money well spent!

Didn't the Holy Son want a grand display?

Then they would give him something special—show him what a professional team could do.

Thus, the three Grand Ascension elders put their heads together and decided to simply construct a cloud bridge.

Let the world see what it meant to arrive riding seven-colored auspicious clouds.

Indeed, the moment those seven-colored auspicious clouds and heavenly omens appeared, the entire world was illuminated.

Instantly capturing everyone's attention.

"I thought the Shaman God Sect's entrance was impressive enough, but it turns out there's someone even bolder."

"Whose forces are these?"

Upon the cloud bridge, the Nine Golden Dragon Carriage rode through the clouds, followed by neatly arranged rows of Supreme Mystery Nascent Soul disciples and Soul Transformation stewards, their presence spreading for thousands of miles.

Especially those nine golden dragons—each with a body spanning nearly ten thousand zhang, their aura ethereal yet vast. Even without roaring, their mere dragon's breath conveyed overwhelming majesty.

This was already under extreme restraint. If Xiao Fan let them cut loose, they would instantly soar through the nine heavens.

Within the treasure carriage, Xiao Fan emerged. He too had sensed Jiang Lanzhi's presence.

At the same time, he had the Nine Golden Dragon Carriage shrink down, reducing each dragon to about a hundred zhang in length, suppressing their presence.

Even so, those nine golden dragons were still too eye-catching.

"Am I seeing things? Are those... five-clawed golden dragons?"

"I don't think I'm mistaken. Those are indeed five-clawed golden dragons."

"Damn! Nine five-clawed golden dragons—is this supposed to represent 'nine-five supreme'?"

"So extravagant. Not only five-clawed golden dragons, but all of them at the Grand Ascension realm, and they're just pulling a carriage? Poverty limits my imagination."

"What's the background of this Supreme Mystery Holy Son?"

Many people didn't know Xiao Fan's true identity and background. They were from different worlds, and Xiao Fan usually kept a low profile, so his reputation wasn't widespread.

Except for those in high positions, few recognized him.

"It's Young Lord Xiao!" The female disciples of Hundred Flowers Holy Land recognized him immediately.

He had appeared the same way last time. The image of that Nine Golden Dragon Carriage was deeply etched in everyone's mind.

Quite a few female disciples thought: if only I were the one up there. Unfortunately, he was a young lord from a great family and also the Supreme Mystery Holy Son—surely someone of pure heart, upright and dignified.

Publicly declaring Jiang Lanzhi's name—he was clearly a deeply devoted man who valued love and loyalty. Simply perfect.

Xiao Fan flew out of the treasure carriage alone, heading toward Hundred Flowers Holy Land's mountain gate.

Jiang Lanzhi's eyes were soft as water. The man she had been longing for had arrived.

She couldn't wait any longer. Transforming into a streak of holy light, she threw herself into Xiao Fan's arms.

"You came." Jiang Lanzhi spoke with tender affection.

"Of course. You're my fiancée—how could I not come support you?" Xiao Fan held Jiang Lanzhi by her slender waist and smiled.

The moment Supreme Mystery Holy Land's people arrived, a Grand Ascension elder immediately came out to greet them.

"So you're the Supreme Mystery Holy Son. So young and already so impressive—your future is truly limitless." She praised him with a smile.

Seeing the affection between Xiao Fan and Jiang Lanzhi, she understood something. Xiao Fan was definitely a great asset for Hundred Flowers Holy Land.

One of their own!

Xiao Fan replied: "Senior flatters me. I've merely been lucky enough to gain some opportunities and advance my cultivation."

"Having come from so far, we failed to provide a proper welcome. Please follow me inside to rest."

"Thank you for your trouble."

Xiao Fan's divine sense was sharp. He could feel a pair of jealous eyes staring at Jiang Lanzhi.

There was also a cold gaze fixed on himself.

He turned to look—it was Bai Fengliu and Hong Rushuang.

"Do I have some grudge with those two?" Xiao Fan asked.

Jiang Lanzhi nodded. "Perhaps not before, but now you do."

Jiang Lanzhi explained the situation to him—the hundred carriages of betrothal gifts, the public proposal, and the declaration that Hong Rushuang would win the Saintess position.

Wasn't this going directly against him, Xiao Fan?

It seemed this Saintess competition would prove entertaining.
