With the tedious affairs handled and no need to cultivate, Xiao Fan could carve out time to spend with Lanzhi.

He couldn't quite explain why—perhaps it was their engagement, the fact that she was his fiancée, or perhaps it was the influence of One Heart Same Body.

Whatever the reason, being with Lanzhi always made his heart flutter.

This wasn't the thrill of novelty. Watching Lanzhi's every smile and frown, his heart was perpetually stirred.

A beauty at his side, flowers before them and moonlight above—Xiao Fan sat with Lanzhi in a field of blossoms within Yaochi Immortal Palace.

It felt like those days at Hundred Flowers Holy Land all over again.

Jiang Lanzhi held Xiao Fan's arm, her adorable head resting against his shoulder.

A gentle breeze drifted past. The evening wind carried the scent of flowers, lifting the dark strands that fell naturally at her temples—a picture of serenity, beauty, and grace.

"Husband, aren't you going to explain yourself?" Lanzhi said with a smile.

"Explain what?" The sudden question caught Xiao Fan off guard.

"That woman from the Heavenly Demon Tribe—why were you inside with her for seven days?" Lanzhi asked softly.

"And why does she carry your scent?"

Jiang Lanzhi stared at Xiao Fan, perfectly serious.

She said seven days, but she knew the truth. She'd experienced time acceleration herself—she just chose not to say "seven years" out loud.

"That's what you want to know?" Xiao Fan understood immediately.

Lanzhi: "I'm just a little curious."

Xiao Fan didn't hide it. He told her the truth directly—he no longer needed to resort to deception.

"It's about what you're thinking. She's become one of my women too."

Jiang Lanzhi shot him a look, exasperated but helpless. Who told her to love this man?

"Are you angry?" Xiao Fan asked.

"No. Don't I know you well enough by now? Even if I said something, you wouldn't change." Jiang Lanzhi yielded.

"But remember this—I am your fiancée. I don't care how many women you have out there, but at most, they can only be your concubines or mistresses!" Jiang Lanzhi's beautiful eyes were deadly serious, boring straight into his.

"Truly, no matter how many?"

Jiang Lanzhi glared at him and turned away, refusing to look at him anymore.

But her jade hand, still linked through his arm, betrayed her—she gripped tighter, as if terrified he might slip away.

Xiao Fan smiled, drew her close by the waist, and settled her against his chest. Warm and fragrant, she melted into his arms—and best of all, she could accept him as he was.

A wife like this—what more could a man ask for?

"I won't interfere with you. I'm just afraid you'll grow tired of me. Those women out there—they'll do anything to please you, whispering in your ear at night.

What if one of them steals your heart away? What if they badmouth me and you start neglecting me?"

Jiang Lanzhi said it with a forced smile, but her eyes were full of longing, her voice lacking its usual confidence—as if she dreaded hearing certain answers.

She was even more anxious than Zhao Ling'er!

Xiao Fan's heart ached for this foolish woman. Lanzhi, who'd fallen so deeply, made concession after concession, tolerating everything he did.

And all of it, just because she was afraid he'd neglect her.

His heart trembled in a way it never had before. He'd never wanted so desperately to give a woman a sense of security.

"Never. You are the only one. No one can replace you."

No flowery words, no sweet nothings—he said it plainly and with absolute sincerity.

Lanzhi's anxious heart finally settled. A smile bloomed across her face, tears of emotion glistening in her eyes as she nodded.

"Mm."

She nestled into his arms, her fair, tender arms wrapped tightly around his waist, surrendering to his warmth with complete, unguarded trust.

Xiao Fan gently patted her back, letting her enjoy this moment of peace. He found himself equally content in their solitude—it was soothing.

After a long while, Xiao Fan said, "Lanzhi, I need your help with something."

Lanzhi smiled. "Go ahead. You know I'll never refuse you."

Xiao Fan: "I need to break through to the next realm, and I may need your assistance."

Lanzhi froze, her pretty face flooding with color.

She lowered her head shyly. "Why... why would you bring that up so suddenly?"

She gazed at the flower field and remembered their passionate nights at Hundred Flowers Holy Land—her body going soft against him involuntarily.

The embarrassment was real—another outdoor setting.

With practiced ease, she moved to undress him, then began untying her own sash.

Xiao Fan watched her movements and expressions and realized she'd gotten the wrong idea.

He caught her hand. Lanzhi looked up at him, confused. "What is it?"

"Uh, this cultivation isn't quite what you're imagining." Xiao Fan laughed.

He produced the Primordial Chaos Grand Luo Fruit—the last one, deliberately saved for Lanzhi.

Lanzhi's expression froze. Oh. This?

Does he think I'm not modest enough? That I'm some kind of shameless woman?

Through One Heart Same Body, Xiao Fan could sense her thoughts. He pinched her cheek and said, "My Lanzhi is the most gentle, virtuous, beautiful, dignified, understanding, and considerate woman in the world. Don't overthink it."

Despite his reassurance, the mortification still clung to her. Too awkward.

Xiao Fan explained: "This time, it's legitimate cultivation. Absolutely legitimate."

He told her how, through One Heart Same Body, her advancement would feed back into his own.

"If you eat this Primordial Chaos Grand Luo Fruit, you'll reach the Primordial Chaos Grand Luo realm. Through One Heart Same Body, that cultivation will feed back to me, and I'll benefit too—breaking through beyond Primordial Chaos Grand Luo to become a Saint!"

Jiang Lanzhi was stunned. There was actually such a method?

"Husband, is there really such a path to Sainthood?"

"There is. But it only works for the two of us."

"It won't have any side effects on you, will it?" Jiang Lanzhi asked worriedly. It sounded almost too good to be true, and she feared consequences.

"It won't." He spoke with absolute certainty.

"Then alright. As long as it makes you stronger, I'll do whatever it takes." Jiang Lanzhi smiled sweetly and pressed a light kiss to his cheek.

That little provocation, combined with what she'd nearly done moments ago, lit a spark in Xiao Fan.

"Oh? Sneak attacks, is it?"

"I'll just have to punish you right here and now!"

A barrier descended, sealing off their corner of heaven and earth.

Meanwhile, Lingyan returned to the Heavenly Demon Tribe's domain in the outer stars.

The Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor had been waiting anxiously in the palace.

"Lingyan, what took you so long? How did the talks with Yaochi Immortal Palace go? Did they agree?"

Lingyan smiled. "Brother, we'll never have to stay in this barren wasteland again."

The Blood Emperor's eyes lit up with wild joy.

"Really?" he asked, barely containing his excitement.

Lingyan said, "Not only that—I secured even more benefits."

"All those no-man's-lands where the foreign cultivators massacred the original inhabitants? As long as we can seize them, they're ours."

"No restrictions. Whatever we can take is ours to keep."

The Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor was stunned.

He'd expected the worst. He'd previously attacked the Eternal Immortal Domain and crossed swords with the Yaochi Palace Master.

Sure, he'd been one-sidedly thrashed, but there was still bad blood.

He'd fully anticipated being squeezed for everything he was worth. Yet the deal had been this simple.

And there were even unexpected bonuses!

A pleasant surprise—an absolute pleasant surprise!

"Lingyan, how did you convince the Palace Master?" the Blood Emperor asked excitedly.

Lingyan's expression flickered with discomfort. She hadn't exactly convinced the Palace Master. She and Nana had tag-teamed their way into the Palace Master's man's bed.

"Brother, does it really matter?"

"Let's just hurry and get ready."

The Blood Emperor understood what mattered. The process was irrelevant—results were everything.

He immediately issued orders, following Lingyan's instructions.

Lingyan briefed him on the details, particularly the loot distribution, making everything crystal clear since her personal share was at stake.

The Blood Emperor was ecstatic. Wait—twenty percent of the spoils went to the tribe? That was pure profit!

Thinking of this, the Blood Emperor worked even harder.

"Out of my way—I'll handle this personally. Otherwise I won't feel right about taking these riches."
