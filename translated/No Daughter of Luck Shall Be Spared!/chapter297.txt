Stirred by emotion, Jiang Lanzhi unveiled a honeyed tenderness uniquely her own.

A single smile launched a hundred enchantments. Her slightly pouted red lips were like sweet cherries, tempting Xiao Fan to take them between his own.

Her face was fair and rosy, carrying the faintest hint of baby fat, and fragrant breath escaped her parted lips.

Breath like orchids, intoxicating to the soul.

The sounds she made were like music from heaven itself.

Jiang Lanzhi was a born songstress—within a few words, she had Xiao Fan burning with desire.

Her jade fingers traced patterns against his body, stoking his passion.

Her dark brows arched prettily, long lashes fluttering up and down—each blink of those luminous, enchanting eyes deepened her allure.

Xiao Fan smiled and caught her slender jade fingers, fair and tender, caressing them gently.

As she watched in confusion, he brought those fingers to his lips and kissed them softly.

Jiang Lanzhi's mind went blank. Her graceful body froze like a jade statue.

But soon, a tingling warmth spread through her entire body, and her face turned scarlet in an instant.

She didn't dare meet his eyes and quickly turned away.

Her breathing grew rapid. She fought to contain her excitement, letting out only the occasional soft murmur.

Xiao Fan gently lifted her. Jiang Lanzhi felt her feet leave the ground, the sudden weightlessness making her gasp.

Her delicate hands instinctively wrapped around his neck.

In those limpid peach-blossom eyes burned a smoldering gaze.

Xiao Fan lowered his head and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead.

Then he rose, carrying the beauty in his arms, and walked into the palace.

The great doors slowly closed.

What followed belonged to the two of them alone.

Jiang Lanzhi had ached with longing. Every waking moment, she'd thought of nothing but being reunited with Xiao Fan.

And now, her wish was fulfilled.

Under Xiao Fan's lead, Jiang Lanzhi gradually let down her guard. Her flowing skirt took flight, sent soaring to the nine heavens as she was finally reunited with her husband.

Xiao Fan ran his fingers through Jiang Lanzhi's dark hair, plucking at her heartstrings like a master musician. What had been merely a glimmer in her eyes now spread like wildfire through her entire being.

Her face, her body, her legs—every inch of Jiang Lanzhi's perfect, jade-like form blazed with heat.

Her natural, peerless voice gradually rose into a transcendent symphony.

"Mm... husband."

Her flushed face burned like sunset clouds. Jiang Lanzhi could resist no longer. Those captivating peach-blossom eyes fixed unwaveringly on Xiao Fan.

He cradled her face and kissed her deeply.

Jiang Lanzhi's beautiful eyes flickered with a trace of pain, though far more with joy.

She finally had Xiao Fan again.

365x time acceleration—activated!

Jiang Lanzhi: "Husband, aren't you tired?"

Xiao Fan: "What's wrong?"

Jiang Lanzhi: "Why don't you lie down and rest?"

Xiao Fan: "Sure."

One year later.

Thoroughly content, Jiang Lanzhi attended to Xiao Fan like a devoted young wife—bathing him, her jade fingers deftly working a silk cloth to dry his body.

She fetched clean robes and helped him dress.

Despite her unfamiliarity with the task, the love in her eyes and the tenderness of her movements left Xiao Fan feeling utterly at ease.

"Husband, why aren't you at Supreme Mystery Holy Land's immortal realm branch or the Xiao family estate? Why are you at this Yaochi Immortal Palace?"

As she helped him dress, Jiang Lanzhi voiced the question that had been nagging her.

Xiao Fan's expression remained unchanged. "Why do you think I'm here?"

Jiang Lanzhi shook her head. "I don't know. But whatever the reason, you must have your own logic. I'll follow your lead."

She spoke softly, standing before him, adjusting his robes and tying the sash at his waist.

Xiao Fan considered for a moment, then said gently, "Do you want to know the truth? I don't want to hide anything from you."

Jiang Lanzhi tilted her face up, meeting his gaze directly, and smiled. "If you want to tell me, I'll listen. If you don't, I won't ask."

This woman was almost too accommodating.

Xiao Fan couldn't bear to keep her in the dark. "The two Palace Masters of Yaochi Immortal Palace are also my women—just like you."

How would Lanzhi react? Surprise? Shock? Would she feel betrayed?

She didn't yet know that beyond her, he had other women.

To his surprise, Jiang Lanzhi seemed to have expected this.

She smiled and asked, "Are they as good as me?"

Not angry? She was even smiling?

Xiao Fan asked softly, "Lanzhi, aren't you upset with me?"

"Why would I be upset? As long as I'm in your heart, that's all that matters."

She finished adjusting his clothes, then wrapped her arms around his waist and buried her face in his chest, speaking in a voice soft as silk:

"It's perfectly normal for a man to have several wives. And you're such a perfect man—any woman with eyes would be drawn to you."

These words moved Xiao Fan deeply.

"Lanzhi, thank you for understanding."

Jiang Lanzhi gave a little huff. "What choice do I have when I've fallen for someone like you?"

Xiao Fan immediately declared, "Lanzhi, your position is beyond compare. You know that you've always been the one I love most."

Hearing these honeyed words, Jiang Lanzhi's heart melted like sugar. He was being honest with her—she was still in his heart!

Still, she harbored some wariness toward these other women.

"I don't care how many women you take," she said, "but you need to remember—I must be your principal wife."

Xiao Fan answered solemnly, "Of course."

"You're the woman my mother personally chose. We've had a formal engagement. In that regard, your status surpasses all of theirs."

Hearing this, Jiang Lanzhi's heart finally settled.

Right—none of the others had met his mother. She was the only one.

His mother even adored her. The other women couldn't begin to compare.

With this thought, the weight she'd been carrying finally lifted. I am Xiao Fan's wife. The others are concubines at best!

"Husband, I'd like to meet them. Consider it getting to know my younger sisters." Jiang Lanzhi spoke up.

"You really want to meet them?" Xiao Fan asked.

"We'll have to get acquainted sooner or later. Might as well do it now."

"Alright, I'll introduce you."

Xiao Fan said it lightly, but he knew well enough that managing the relationships between his women was a delicate and complicated affair.

Through his masterful romantic skills, he'd made each woman devoted to him.

But the dynamics between women were fiendishly complex. Give four women a shared dormitory and they'd somehow create a dozen group chats.

A woman's heart is a needle at the bottom of the ocean—the ancients knew their stuff.

The Eternal Immortal Domain.

Ever since Xiao Fan had dismantled the Great Teleportation Array, the foreign cultivators had become a stranded army—kill one and they stayed dead.

The Eternal Immortal Domain's Holy Academy had also noticed something wrong with the array.

At this rate, the foreign cultivators would eventually be wiped out entirely.

When that happened, the Academy would lose its pretext for rallying forces under the banner of "united resistance against foreign invaders."

Without an alliance, the Academy would have no justification to squeeze money and manpower from the various factions. How would they skim profits then?

Unacceptable!

Therefore, Academy elder Zhu Tong retrieved a mirror and cast a secret art to contact someone beyond the realm.

The moment the connection opened, a torrent of cursing flooded through:

"What the hell is going on in your Eternal Immortal Domain? Didn't we agree not to destroy each other's teleportation arrays?"

"Our people are suffering catastrophic losses—their life tablets are shattering left and right—while your Academy's cultivators in our domain are completely unharmed!"

"If this is how you conduct business, I have no problem destroying your array too. And killing every last one of your Academy disciples in our domain."

The person on the other side of the mirror was the Primordial Chaos cultivator who'd been dealing with Zhu Tong in secret.

The terms of their arrangement were:

Externally—each side would harvest the other domain's factions and lower-level cultivators.

Internally—each would position themselves as the leader of a resistance movement, forming a military force to put up a token fight.

This way, they could control the resistance, monitor every development, and prevent anyone from actually destroying the teleportation arrays.

It had been a perfect scheme—reaping gains both internally and externally while building a heroic image as leaders of the anti-invasion effort.

But the most critical element—the Great Teleportation Array—had somehow been destroyed by someone.

And this array didn't connect to just the Killing God Immortal Domain.

Several other immortal domains also used it as their gateway into the Eternal Immortal Domain.

Zhu Tong explained, "Friend, I swear on my Dao heart—this was absolutely not our doing."

He was just as baffled. Logically speaking, even if he'd wanted to destroy the array's outer defenses, it would have caused an earth-shaking commotion.

And it would have taken days.

Yet somehow, without his knowledge, the array had been destroyed.

He couldn't figure out how, no matter how hard he tried.

The Primordial Chaos cultivator on the other end said, "I don't care what method you use. Repair the array and protect our people."

"Otherwise, I can't guarantee the safety of your Academy disciples."

The image in the mirror vanished.

Zhu Tong seethed with barely contained fury.

The great catastrophe was approaching, and before he'd even finished lining his pockets, trouble had come knocking.

There was only one person with the guts and the ability to destroy the teleportation array.

That woman!

Yes—only someone with the power to thrash him could have pulled it off.

"Ruining my plans—you've got nerve!" Zhu Tong spat through gritted teeth.

"Fine—I'll just warn them to stay away from your precious Yaochi Immortal Palace."

"No, that's not secure enough. I'd better go talk to her first... and negotiate a... peaceful coexistence."
