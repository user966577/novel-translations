Chapter 132: Summoning the Gates of Hell—Immortal Realm Classifications

Learning about the heavenly Wu Tribe's descent, Xiao Fan didn't pay it much mind.

First priority was improving his own strength.

The 840 million giant elephants were still transforming. Evolving into dragon elephants would take some time.

But his comprehension of the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art had reached a new level.

"Let's try condensing the Gates of Hell."

This was the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art's great summoning technique.

Summoning the Gates of Hell in the mortal world, connecting to the Maha Hell, calling forth the demon gods within to serve under his command.

This was a wondrous summoning art that could call endless subordinates. All demon gods he summoned would be bound by curse seals, taking his life as their highest priority. Any who dared disobey would dissolve into nothingness.

This was the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art's tyranny: forced loyalty, control over life and death, achieving absolute supremacy.

Precisely because the Gates of Hell summoning existed, he didn't need followers—didn't even need subordinates.

Subordinates could have selfish motives, but summoned demon gods would not.

Moreover, if he wanted to destroy the world, he could simply throw open the Gates of Hell and let the demon gods from hell's depths descend upon the mortal realm!

Could save the world, could destroy it. Truly a single thought between god and devil.

Xiao Fan sat in meditation. His body began radiating golden light.

But soon the golden light dispersed. After scattering, the golden radiance transformed into points of black light, continuously gathering behind him.

First condensing into a black cloud. Under Xiao Fan's guidance, the cloud spread across the ground into a mysterious formation, covered in strange tadpole-like characters. The characters flowed ceaselessly, ancient and eternal.

Suddenly, all the characters froze in place, moving no more.

Xiao Fan, who had been sitting still, grew increasingly powerful in presence, levitating into the air.

His form hadn't changed at all, yet the impression he gave was one of boundless, immeasurable grandeur. In one moment, this infinite feeling condensed into his body.

The illusory sensation began solidifying. An incomparably massive elephant shadow appeared behind him.

A heaven-shaking elephant trumpet could make the stars in the sky tremble. This roar caused rippling waves to appear in the originally illusory space.

Behind those ripples, a gate of dark, ghostly light spanned the ages, rushing forth from an infinitely distant place!

"Moo!"

The divine elephant trumpeted again, moving like thunder, charging at the Gates of Hell with momentum like a rainbow.

Creak!

The divine elephant's strength was boundless. This impact directly pushed open the Gates of Hell.

At that moment, Xiao Fan opened his eyes. His pupils radiated ghostly light as he intoned softly:

"Gates of Hell—open!"

The Maha Infinite Hell—gates from the remote depths manifested in the mortal world.

Upon the gates were carved demon god shadows impossible to gaze upon or fathom, chaotic and misty. A violent yet frigid aura surged forth.

The gates, originally open just a crack, gradually widened. From the other side came gusts of nether wind, accompanied by countless spine-chilling roars. Imprisoned within were supreme demon gods!

Xiao Fan clearly sensed that the aura emanating from his Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art, when transmitted into hell, made those demon gods unable to face him directly.

As if meeting a supreme being, they could only submit.

"System, that demon god cowering at the very back, shaped like a giant rat—it looks very weak. Is it afraid of me?"

Xiao Fan asked, puzzled.

[It's not afraid of you. It's afraid of the divine elephant.]

[You cultivate the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art, protected by the ancient primordial divine elephant. The elephant's might can sever star rivers. Every demon god in there, without exception, was suppressed by the divine elephant.]

[To these demon gods, the divine elephant is vicious beyond measure—loves killing, savage. If any demon god displeased it even slightly, down came an elephant trunk sweep, smashing them all to pieces, souls included, reduced to ash.]

[To these demon gods, the moment they see the divine elephant, if they don't die, they're crippled.]

"That badass? What realm is that rat at?"

Xiao Fan pointed at the giant rat hiding behind countless demon gods deep within the Gates of Hell. It didn't look fierce, and among all the savage beasts and terrifying demons, it seemed almost cute. Plus it didn't even have sharp fangs—probably not that powerful.

[That is a demon god from the boundless chaos, titled the Gnawing Demon God. Claimed to be able to break through any defense. Its pair of demon-gnawing teeth could slaughter Grand Luo Golden Immortals.]

"Holy shit, don't lie to my face. Where are its teeth?"

Xiao Fan could see clearly—apart from a few uneven broken stubs, most of its teeth were gone.

[The divine elephant thought its teeth were too ugly and stomped them to pieces.]

Xiao Fan: ???

What do you mean, stomped them to pieces?

That vicious?

"What about that black rabbit? It has a pair of long fangs, and its expression is quite fierce. It must be pretty strong, right?"

Xiao Fan pointed at another large rabbit. Its red eyes were somewhat evasive. Seeing Xiao Fan point at it, it immediately buried its head, terrified of being noticed.

So timid. Probably just looked fierce, so no one dared attack it.

[Life-Devouring Demon God. Loves consuming life force. Any place teeming with vitality is its hunting ground. Animal spirits, plant spirits—even the undead, as long as they have the slightest life force, it devours them all.]

Holy shit, another freak!

[Host can rest assured. This little rabbit's attack power isn't strong, but its defense is impressive. The divine elephant stomped it three times and it still clung to life. After countless ages, its complexion has improved a bit.]

Huh? Improved?

But in Xiao Fan's eyes, this rabbit's ears drooped, its legs limped—only its front legs were intact. This was called improved?

[Back then, a single stomp from the divine elephant crushed it completely. Three stomps and it was just a blob of mangled flesh. The fact that it can now maintain its original form is already quite impressive.]

Little system, your way of giving compliments is rather unique.

He pointed out a few more. Without exception, they were all supremely vicious creatures.

Hearing this, Xiao Fan understood. Without some real power, the divine elephant wouldn't bother with them.

Speaking of which, just how insane was this divine elephant?

He'd thought that a single trumpet collapsing stars was its limit. Turns out that was just an appetizer.

Cultivating this technique was definitely worth it!

Though all the demon gods inside feared the aura on Xiao Fan's body, as long as they didn't come out, there was nothing he could do.

Xiao Fan tried commanding the rat—the Gnawing Demon God—to come out, but it went crazy and ran the other way.

Gave Xiao Fan no chance at all.

With his current strength, he couldn't command these powerful demon gods. He kept lowering his summoning threshold—if he couldn't summon supreme demon gods, surely a few minor ones would work.

After tremendous effort, Xiao Fan summoned over a thousand Nether Hounds from the Gates of Hell.

These Nether Hounds had blue-green faces and fangs, ghostly flames flickering atop their heads. Though clearly flames, they radiated bone-chilling cold.

A thousand Nether Hounds, each over thirty feet tall, their blue eyes gleaming with wisps of cold.

Such fearsome demon beasts, yet before Xiao Fan, they lay prostrate in respect, lowering their proud heads, barking incessantly:

"Woof woof woof, Master."

Looking at this pack of dogs—literally dogs—Xiao Fan fell into contemplation.

Their auras were immensely powerful. The weakest had Grand Ascension cultivation; the leader's aura was ethereal and lofty, several realms above Grand Ascension!

Clearly very strong, yet he felt somewhat unsatisfied.

He'd originally wanted to summon a powerful mount. Instead, he'd summoned a pack of dogs.

Dog my life.

"You stay. The rest of you, get back." He pointed at the lead Nether Hound.

"Woof woof woof, rolling back now, Master."

Xiao Fan rubbed his forehead helplessly. Sigh, first summoning—some mistakes were normal. Maybe next time he'd summon a female demon god.

In the vast palace, only one Nether Hound remained.

Xiao Fan: "What's your name?"

The Nether Hound answered: "Replying to Master, this subordinate has no name. I was born from a wisp of nether ghost fire in the boundless hell. I've existed for a hundred thousand years and still have no name."

"You weren't suppressed?"

The Nether Hound said: "Replying to Master, only those mighty beings who dominated entire star regions could be suppressed by Lord Divine Elephant. This subordinate is merely a demon spawn born from a flame dropped by one of those mighty beings, which developed sentience over ten thousand years."

"One could barely call me a native hell demon god."

A fierce appearance, yet addressing him as Master with every breath, speaking with utmost respect, body prostrate—it looked quite awkward.

"What's your cultivation level?"

"In Master's immortal path terms, my current cultivation would be around True Immortal."

Holy shit, that strong? Just randomly summoning a dog from hell got him a True Immortal.

According to the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art's records, immortal path realms from low to high were:

Human Immortal, Earth Immortal, Profound Immortal, Heavenly Immortal.

True Immortal, Golden Immortal.

Grand Unity True Immortal, Grand Unity Golden Immortal.

Grand Luo Golden Immortal, Primordial Grand Luo Golden Immortal.

Each immortal realm was further divided into Early, Middle, and Late stages.

Upon reaching Grand Luo Golden Immortal, one was a king among immortals, honored as Immortal King.

Upon reaching Primordial Grand Luo Golden Immortal, one was an emperor among immortals, honored as Immortal Emperor.

Below Grand Luo, there were Three Calamities and Five Tribulations. Failing to pass meant death.

Only upon reaching Grand Luo could one be free from tribulation's suffering, forging an indestructible body immune to all calamities, truly sharing longevity with heaven and earth.

So this True Immortal-level Nether Hound was already far ahead of mortals.

Xiao Fan couldn't help but reassess the Nether Hound.

Though it looked a bit ugly, with a cold, eerie aura, lacking any domineering feel, and nothing like a noble five-clawed golden dragon, plus being an evil demonic creature despised by the righteous path...

But Xiao Fan was someone who valued inner qualities. Looking a bit ugly didn't matter—being strong was enough.

What did righteous or demonic matter? As long as your strength was domineering enough, you were the best.

Thinking this way, Xiao Fan found the Nether Hound increasingly pleasing to the eye. The only regret was he couldn't use it as a mount. After all, riding a dog—what would that make him?

"Since you're a True Immortal and a Nether Hound, from now on you'll be called 'Truly a Dog.' Truly a Dog."

"I don't usually like using your full name. From now on, you'll be called Wangcai."

"Daoist title: Truly a Dog. Nickname: Wangcai."

The Nether Hound didn't dare resist. It prostrated and said: "Thank you, Master, for bestowing a name."

The moment the name was bestowed, Xiao Fan instantly felt he had seized control of Truly a Dog—that feeling of controlling life and death with a single thought. He could even control its thoughts, turning it into a puppet when necessary.

That was how domineering it was.

"You're too big. Shrink down."

"Yes."

Wangcai's thirty-foot-tall form, its fierce appearance, and its ghostly spear-tip-sharp fur all shrank.

The savage face disappeared, replaced by a harmless little black dog.

Xiao Fan reached out, pinching it by the scruff, examining it carefully. Not bad—you truly are a dog.

Meanwhile, two cultivators in dark black robes with powerful auras walked through a mortal city in the human world.

One male, one female.

The man was handsome; the woman was devastatingly beautiful. Walking side by side, outsiders would think them a heavenly couple.

Behind them followed eight attendants, silently trailing, utterly respectful.

The man walked beside the woman, speaking in a refined and amiable manner, quite the conversationalist.

However, the woman was cold and proud, completely ignoring him, walking her own path.

The man didn't seem to mind. But when he tried some little trick to get closer to her—

She warned him: "Get any closer and I'll chop off your dick."

Those words made his lower body go cold. But thinking that even if chopped off it would grow back, his courage returned.

Still, he didn't dare try any more tricks.

Suddenly, the woman sensed something—felt a great terror descend upon the world.

Though it lasted only an instant, the opening and closing of a gate, it couldn't escape her keen perception.

"Divine Maiden, what is it?" an attendant behind her asked.

"Nothing. Perhaps I sensed wrong."

"Let's go. Hurry to the Dark Abyss. Don't delay our plan."

"Yes."
