Chapter 131: The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden

Inside the palace.

Xiao Fan took out the intelligence on the Wu Tribe and studied it carefully.

[Wu Tribe: Essentially the jocks of the myriad races. Their thing is all muscle, no brains. When the immortal path flourished, they stubbornly clung to martial dao, lacking ambition, only wanting martial dao to endure.

When the immortal path prospered and completely crushed martial dao, they were driven from the stage of the myriad races. Only then did they painfully reflect, dormant for ten thousand years, finally succeeding in switching to cultivating techniques.]

[However, the Wu Tribe started cultivating techniques far too late. Formations, alchemy, artifact refining, talisman crafting—they lag behind the Human, Yao, and Demon races in all of these. And as time passes, the gap only widens.]

[Not only that, but all spirit veins and spirit springs in the world have already been divided between the Human and Yao races. The demon-miasma-filled lands naturally suited to demonic qi have been claimed by the Demon race. The Wu Tribe holds no advantage whatsoever.]

[To reverse this situation and achieve a true Wu Tribe resurgence, they've sent their children into major powers, striving to reach high positions. Sleeper agents. Cuckoos in the nest. Completing a resurrection through borrowed corpses.]

[Hong Rushuang is one of them.]

[Currently, the Wu Tribe is recuperating and conserving strength. Once they obtain cultivation resources and more cultivation techniques, perfecting their alchemy, artifact refining, formations, and talisman crafting systems, that will be when they emerge again.]

Sounds familiar.

Isn't this basically the cultivation world's version of a cuckoo?

Laying their eggs in other birds' nests, then pushing the original eggs out. Holy shit, their scheming is impressive.

As for why the Wu Tribe stubbornly clung to martial dao while dismissing the rising immortal path, Xiao Fan could understand that too.

In the beginning, all races were primitives who didn't know how to use techniques. They could only use the most convenient tools available.

Like fists.

After all, everything develops from low to high, gradually growing and transforming. It couldn't be that someone comprehended the immortal path right from the start.

Gradual progress. Very reasonable.

The Wu Tribe's powerful bodies let them reap all the benefits of the martial dao era. But as wisdom developed, more and more sages appeared.

Their understanding of the Dao deepened. The immortal path naturally emerged.

In its early stages, the immortal path—especially for low-level cultivators—didn't noticeably increase lifespan or power, and required comprehension ability. Without brains, you couldn't grasp it.

Martial dao was different. As long as you had big enough muscles and a strong enough body, even without martial talent, you could reach considerable heights through sheer strength.

Comparing the two, the immortal path had a slow start, low early returns, and high mental requirements. By all measures, it was the weaker option in the early game.

In the eyes of the Wu Tribe back then, martial dao clearly seemed superior.

What immortal path? Just tricks to fool people!

From this, Xiao Fan roughly deduced that he was in the peak era of world development.

Because once the age of declining law arrived, spiritual energy would gradually deplete.

When heaven and earth no longer had spiritual treasures, martial dao would rise again. Just another cycle.

Reasonable.

[Current Wu Tribe location: Dark Abyss.]

Dark Abyss? Never heard of it.

[Dark Abyss: Not a traditional abyss, but an isolated island hidden in the void. This island exists within a spatial rift, hence the name Dark Abyss.]

Xiao Fan said nothing, reading silently.

Hong Rushuang knelt on the ground, trembling, terrified Xiao Fan would kill her.

This man was too frightening. The technique he cultivated was supremely domineering. Her divine soul had been strengthened by tribal elders to be incredibly powerful.

Yet before this man, it was fragile as paper, mercilessly torn apart and extracted by him.

Just remembering that day—the bone-deep, soul-rending pain of having her soul sliced—made her shudder.

"I have two questions for you." Suddenly, Xiao Fan spoke.

"How many of your people have infiltrated our human territories?"

"Huh?" Hong Rushuang froze, her gaze somewhat blank.

"How many people like you have been planted inside human powers?" Xiao Fan asked.

Hong Rushuang was shocked. Such a secret matter—how did he know?

But she didn't dare hide anything. She answered: "Replying to the Holy Son, I only know that every major power has someone from our tribe planted inside."

"They've also considered this situation. To prevent exposure and total annihilation, we don't know each other's identities. Each person is an independent unit."

Hong Rushuang answered respectfully, not daring to show the slightest negligence.

So they knew not to let agents meet—their security awareness was quite good.

"Tell me—how did you infiltrate here?"

"This body isn't a Wu Tribe body, is it?"

After killing Left Wu, Xiao Fan had gained a certain understanding of Wu Tribe bodies. The Wu Tribe's constitution was powerful; their physical structure differed from humans.

It was easy to spot.

Hundred Flowers Holy Land was one of humanity's great Holy Lands. They couldn't possibly make such a basic mistake.

"Replying to the Holy Son, we considered this situation too. Before coming out, we first search the mortal world among humans for those with powerful constitutions but no background."

"In the mortal world, those with spiritual roots are extremely rare, but mortals are numerous. With many people, there are always a few geniuses."

"Our elders... the Wu Tribe elders destroy their divine souls, leaving only the bodies for us to possess."

"As you can see, my current body is my substitute. My original body has been preserved in the royal palace since I was fifteen."

Xiao Fan sneered: "You've certainly thought of many tricks."

Not afraid of direct confrontation, but afraid of sneaky schemes.

Though the Wu Tribe was currently insignificant, if they wanted to cause trouble, there was nothing you could do about it.

Troublesome.

Seeing Xiao Fan's troubled expression, Hong Rushuang thought her information had displeased him.

She racked her brain, trying to think of something to say, hoping to ease his worries so he wouldn't take it out on her.

Hong Rushuang remembered something. She said:

"Right, Holy Son, I just remembered—we've contacted the Wu God of the immortal realm. Soon, the Wu God will send down a Divine Son and Divine Maiden. When they descend, they'll lead our Wu Tribe to rise again."

"Hm? What maiden?" Xiao Fan's eyebrow rose with interest.

Selectively ignoring the unimportant parts, seizing the key point!

Hong Rushuang was delighted. The Holy Son seemed very interested in this.

She explained in full detail:

"The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden—we just learned that our Wu Tribe in this realm is a branch of the heavenly Wu Tribe. Because no one has ascended for too long, someone came down from above to assess the situation.

After understanding our circumstances, the upper realm's Wu Tribe decided to send down a Divine Son and Divine Maiden to help us."

So that was it.

Heh, he didn't buy it for a second.

Not that he didn't believe there was a Wu Tribe in the heavens—he just didn't believe they'd come down to help.

Immortals looking at mortals was probably like normal people looking at ants. Would you care about ants' feelings?

Something was fishy. Definitely fishy!

Probably using them as cannon fodder, Xiao Fan guessed.

But what did this have to do with him?

The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden—what kind of being was she exactly?

Interesting!
