Chapter 116: Ji Qingxue's Cultivation, The Origins of the Shaman God Sect

Xiao Fan had the visitor shown in. As expected, it was Ji Qingxue.

But what puzzled him was that Ji Qingxue had covered her face with a purple veil and had disguised herself, making her features difficult to recognize.

She looked like an undercover agent making a secret rendezvous.

"What's with this getup?" Xiao Fan asked, confused.

Ji Qingxue waved her jade hand, and her entire appearance transformed. The veil vanished, revealing her elegant true face. Those beautiful eyes remained as calm as still water.

But something seemed different.

Allure! Yes, that was it—the kind of seductive charm that was elegant in public yet bewitching in private!

She still wore a plain, unadorned long dress that didn't compete for attention, yet couldn't conceal her impressive figure. Long, slender jade legs, fair and flawless form—though her attire wasn't the least bit revealing, she was more tempting than anything risqué.

"You said I should report to you. I've gathered information and wanted to report, but had no way to contact you."

Xiao Fan had saved her Ji family—she owed him. Offering herself and serving as a spy was her mission.

If she hadn't mentioned it, Xiao Fan would have forgotten.

Did Xiao Fan care about Starlight Holy Land? No. Back then, he had just been giving Ji Qingxue an excuse to make it easier to claim her.

Otherwise, why wouldn't he have even left a way to contact him?

However, since she had taken the initiative to come report, he might as well hear what she had to say.

Xiao Fan said: "Go ahead."

Ji Qingxue broke into a smile. Without saying anything, she sat down at the edge of Xiao Fan's bed, her jade hands helping him dress.

This rather startled Xiao Fan. Wait—was this how she reported?

"Hey, what are you doing?!" Xiao Fan grabbed her soft hands with one hand and pushed her down with the other. The atmosphere became rather suggestive.

"I want my work reward?" She smiled seductively, pressing close to Xiao Fan—all her usual elegance gone, replaced by pure allure.

Holy—!

Could he resist this?

Xiao Fan didn't bother thinking twice. He simply gave her the reward.

"Woman, you're playing with fire!"

Ji Qingxue giggled flirtatiously. "Do you like it?"

"I'm burning up right now!"

"Mm, I know—mmph... I know."

Ji Qingxue hadn't slacked off. These past days, she had diligently practiced the Phoenix-and-Dragon technique, mastering all one hundred and eight positions before demonstrating them on Xiao Fan.

She was truly worthy of being a reincarnated great power. Her learning speed was astonishing. If Xiao Fan hadn't had extensive practical experience, he really might have lost to her.

Xiao Fan had saved her entire family. She was someone who repaid kindness—she understood the principle of repaying a drop of water with a gushing spring.

Three days later, Xiao Fan exhaled deeply. Looking at Ji Qingxue—her jade body sprawled across the bed, glistening with fragrant perspiration, her dark hair clinging to her fair back as she lay on the couch—she was intoxicatingly alluring.

Her eyes were misty with satisfaction, her pretty face still flushed with the afterglow of passion. There was a sense of having survived an ordeal.

He had finally defeated her. Xiao Fan had also expended considerable yang energy to barely subdue this enchantress.

"Your reporting method is quite... unique?" Xiao Fan remarked casually.

Ji Qingxue gazed at the glazed jade tiles on the ceiling, reminiscing about those moments of ecstasy. She laughed: "Isn't this what you wanted?"

A wisp of dragon qi manifested on her body.

Xiao Fan looked at it and instantly understood what had happened.

Dragons are lustful by nature! And Ji Qingxue, having refined that dragon qi, was naturally affected by it.

Thinking about it, this was really his doing.

"You noticed?" he chuckled.

"I'm merely catering to your preferences." Ji Qingxue sat up languorously, attending to Xiao Fan's bath and dressing him with utmost gentleness—the perfect companion.

Xiao Fan shrugged with a smile. This wasn't unexpected.

After all, she harbored two powerful beings within her. If they couldn't detect something this obvious, that would be strange.

If only he could summon the other two as well—then they could play mahjong together.

Ji Qingxue cleaned him up meticulously. Seeing him lost in thought, she asked: "What are you thinking about?"

"Nothing much. I was just wondering—you usually seem so proper. Why so forward all of a sudden?"

"Me?" Ji Qingxue smiled radiantly. Between her bright eyes and white teeth, her lovely brows and peach-blossom eyes carried the lingering traces of passion—infinitely enchanting.

She gave Xiao Fan a conflicted feeling: seductive yet not vulgar, refined yet not wanton. And she only revealed this side of herself to him.

"You should know—I told you the first time we were together. The physical body is merely a vessel for the soul. Carnal pleasure can bring me ecstasy, but that's not what I pursue."

Xiao Fan was taken aback. Oh?

"That's not right. You were more eager than me—you even bit me." Xiao Fan looked at her moist cherry lips. She had nearly finished him off.

"That? I told you—these are just methods to please you."

"Otherwise, how would you cooperate with my cultivation practice?"

"Ah!"

Xiao Fan was stunned. Cultivation practice?

"Yes, though I don't know where you obtained this Phoenix-and-Dragon technique, the essence within it has given me great insights."

"Look!"

Ji Qingxue said with a charming smile.

A powerful aura emanated from her body.

Mid-stage Soul Transformation!

Holy—!

Last time they met, she had just been at Nascent Soul, hadn't she?

Now she was already at mid-stage?

How long had it been? Even with the two beings from her previous life—one virtuous and one wicked—you couldn't progress this fast!

"It's all thanks to your efforts." Ji Qingxue finished wiping him down and dressed him in fresh clothes.

"The first time, though I gave you my primal yin, I also received yang energy from you. The intermingling of yin and yang, combined with this Phoenix-and-Dragon technique, allowed me to advance my cultivation significantly."

She explained patiently while combing his hair.

"In the Myriad Dragon Nest, you helped me refine that wisp of dragon qi—a tremendous supplement. Successfully forming my Nascent Soul and reaching Soul Transformation—it's all because of you."

Ji Qingxue spoke softly, with a hint of gratitude in her voice.

"Just now, cultivating with you again pushed my cultivation up another level. Rather than saying I've become lustful, it's more accurate to say I've been cultivating diligently."

She spoke each word clearly, leaving Xiao Fan dumbfounded.

"So you've been using me as a cultivation tool?"

"Don't you like it? I thought you would, which is why I refined all the dragon qi without removing its lustful nature."

This explanation completely floored Xiao Fan.

Now he understood. This woman only cared about cultivation. Even that kind of activity was just a means to cultivate. No wonder she was so eager—pushing him down the moment she arrived.

Seeing Xiao Fan's prolonged silence, she said hesitantly:

"If you don't like it, I'll change."

Xiao Fan immediately refused. He said: "No—whenever you want to practice this kind of cultivation, just leave it to me. I'm always happy to help."

Ji Qingxue smiled demurely, captivatingly beautiful.

"I thought you wouldn't like it."

Honestly, Xiao Fan had once thought women of such elegant temperament would be the hardest to pursue. Reality had completely subverted his expectations.

He didn't even need to try—Ji Qingxue would throw herself at him, having mastered all one hundred and eight positions of the Phoenix-and-Dragon technique.

"Since you're working so hard, I'll definitely help you cultivate." Xiao Fan said seriously.

After Ji Qingxue finished tidying him up, she changed into fresh clothes herself and formally began reporting the intelligence she had gathered.

Things like how many geniuses at Starlight Holy Land had recently broken through, how many elders had advanced, how many spirit stones had been mined recently, the yield from the spiritual herb fields—every detail, reported one by one to Xiao Fan.

Being able to stand equal with Supreme Mystery Holy Land, Starlight Holy Land's strength was certainly not to be underestimated.

But Xiao Fan didn't pay much attention. Honestly, he had no desire to destroy Starlight Holy Land. Supreme Mystery Holy Land needed a powerful external enemy to maintain vitality and continuous growth.

The Supreme Mystery Ancestor's vision had been too limited—he had merely stolen Starlight Holy Master's childhood sweetheart.

If it were Xiao Fan, he would have gone for a complete takeover—installing his own woman as Starlight Holy Master.

For example, making Ji Qingxue the Starlight Holy Master.

And at Supreme Mystery Holy Land, he could have Su Yiyun become Holy Master.

While he controlled everything from behind the scenes. Both Holy Masters would be his women. Just thinking about it made him happy, heheheh...

"By the way, Starlight Holy Land recently received some visiting cultivators." Ji Qingxue suddenly mentioned.

"Is there a problem?" Xiao Fan asked.

Receiving guests was normal for Supreme Mystery Holy Land too—nothing unusual.

Ji Qingxue said seriously: "There is a problem."

Her rare seriousness made Xiao Fan slightly curious.

"Tell me more."

Ji Qingxue shot him a look. Again? Still, to please this man, she resigned herself to it.

She lowered her head.

Seeing something was off, Xiao Fan said: "What are you doing?"

"Isn't that your order?" Ji Qingxue pouted.

Xiao Fan rubbed his forehead helplessly. "I meant tell me the details. Elaborate. Understand?"

Ji Qingxue's cheeks flushed slightly. She had misunderstood.

She said: "True, receiving cultivators is perfectly normal. I didn't pay much attention either."

"But just now, at Hundred Flowers Holy Land, I saw the person who visited Starlight Holy Land."

"Hm?" Xiao Fan didn't understand what was strange about that.

"That person was mixed in with the Shaman God Sect's group."

Xiao Fan fell silent. Though he didn't particularly care about the Shaman God Sect, he always maintained some wariness toward suddenly rising powers.

"Do you know what both parties discussed during their meeting?"

"I don't. The Holy Master personally received them, accompanied only by core elders. Any faction that warrants a personal audience with the Holy Master must be significant. Seeing that person in the Shaman God Sect's ranks today, I thought I should mention it to you."

Ji Qingxue was quite thorough. She had even gathered intelligence on the Shaman God Sect's origins.

"Shaman God Sect—I searched through every ancient text in Starlight Holy Land's scripture pavilion but found no related records. However, I did find some clues."

"In primordial times, this land was home to a tribe called the Wu Tribe. Like the human, yao, and demon races, they had their own territory and domain."

"The Wu Tribe possessed powerful physical bodies—you could say they were born with divine strength. Initially, they didn't cultivate Dao arts, only physical bodies. At first, relying on their powerful physiques, the Wu Tribe dominated the region as the strongest race."

"But as time passed, Dao arts grew increasingly powerful among humans. Even the yao and demon races with their strong physical bodies began cultivating Dao arts. Yet the Wu Tribe continued pursuing physical perfection, neglecting Dao cultivation."

"Eventually, the Wu Tribe fell in this struggle, surrounded and slaughtered by the human, yao, and demon races. They vanished without a trace."

Wasn't this just a classic case of only building muscle without developing brains?

Stuck in their ways, refusing to understand that Dao arts were the future—time taught them a lesson.

"You're suggesting the Shaman God Sect is connected to the Wu Tribe?"

"Possibly. The names are quite similar, after all." Ji Qingxue said.

Wu Tribe, Shaman God Sect...

Xiao Fan made a mental note. He wondered how his current physical body would compare to the Wu Tribe's.

As for the Wu Tribe wanting to make a comeback and rise again—he wasn't worried. If they had any sense, they wouldn't have been eliminated in the first place.

After seeing Ji Qingxue off, Xiao Fan waited quietly for the selection to begin.

Hundred Flowers Holy Land worked quickly, completing all preparations within just a few days.

The contest for the Hundred Flowers Saintess was about to begin.
