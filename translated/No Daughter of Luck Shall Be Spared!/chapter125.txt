Chapter 125: Conquering Xia Huaxuan—Another Fearless Fool Arrives

Xia Huaxuan lay limply against Xiao Fan's body, utterly drained.

Her once-neat black dress had long since been tossed who-knows-where, leaving her completely bare. Her silk stockings had been new, but now they bore numerous handprints and signs of being roughly handled.

Her face was flushed, the afterglow of their activities only just beginning to fade.

Recalling the past three days of madness, Xia Huaxuan felt somewhat dazed. Was there anywhere she hadn't been used?

She honestly couldn't say.

Still, the benefits were tangible. Originally just a minor cultivator at early Golden Core, after only three days of infusion, her cultivation had soared. Now she had reached late Golden Core.

Xiao Fan had controlled things well, preventing her from physically forcing a Nascent Soul breakthrough.

Looking at the jade beauty in his arms—tender pink skin, languid and powerless—and the white bedsheets blooming with crimson flowers marking his conquest, symbols of claiming mysterious territory, Xiao Fan felt immensely satisfied.

It felt like a love transaction, except instead of wealth, cultivation was the currency.

The gap between their cultivations was too vast. Xiao Fan hadn't gained any cultivation from her—this was purely one-sided infusion.

But he'd gained pleasure, plus a Daughter of Luck's primal essence. All in all, not a loss.

Xiao Fan sat up, cradling the beauty in his arms.

Xia Huaxuan felt she was hindering him and wanted to climb off, but she was completely exhausted—truly without a shred of strength remaining.

"Master, I..."

"It's fine." Xiao Fan said.

Xia Huaxuan let out a startled cry as she was lifted entirely. Instinctively, she wrapped her arms around his neck, her whole body hanging from him.

Her beautiful eyes were somewhat dazed as she recalled the moment they had become dual cultivators together—it made her incredibly happy.

But she was sensible. Her status was too lowly; she could only serve as his subordinate. She didn't dare dream of anything more.

"Master, please put me down. I can walk on my own," Xia Huaxuan said softly.

"Can you even stand?" Xiao Fan asked with a half-smile.

Xia Huaxuan's face reddened further, her head hanging low. Forget standing—she didn't have any strength at all right now.

Xiao Fan naturally knew her condition. She was his plaything, so of course he understood her state.

Carrying Xia Huaxuan's jade body horizontally, Xiao Fan brought her to bathe, cleaning his beloved toy.

The two sat in the bathing tub. Xiao Fan scooped warm water, inch by inch caressing silky smooth, flawless white jade—Xia Huaxuan's delicate body was something he truly couldn't get enough of.

He was very attentive.

Warm water flowed over her jade body as Xiao Fan tenderly washed Xia Huaxuan.

Xia Huaxuan was deeply moved. She had thought herself merely a tool for venting desire.

She hadn't expected that her master would even bathe her.

"Master, let me do it myself," she said shyly. "How can a master bathe his subordinate?"

Without waiting for Xiao Fan's reply, she snatched the water ladle and turned around to wash him instead.

Her movements were clumsy. Her jade hands stroked Xiao Fan's body, bringing a blush to her face. Though they had been intimate before, she'd lost herself in carnal pleasure then.

Now, fully conscious and this close, how could a girl not yet sixteen endure without feeling shy?

He sat serene as a buddha, unmoved by the beauty in his arms.

Of course, if he wanted, taking a couple of pills could restore him instantly.

But Xia Huaxuan's body was delicate. Even with pills, she couldn't recover quickly enough to withstand his fierce assault.

Next time then—more to explore later.

Xiao Fan lightly kissed Xia Huaxuan's tender cheek and said gently, "If anything comes up in the future, find me. I'll take care of it for you."

"Thank you, Master," Xia Huaxuan said softly.

She was content. Though her master wasn't her Dao Companion, being able to stay by Xiao Fan's side and be treated with such tenderness—she was already very satisfied.

After bathing and changing clothes—

Xia Huaxuan, still bare, dried Xiao Fan's body and dressed him in clean robes before putting on her own clothes.

"Wait."

"What is it, Master?"

Xiao Fan remembered that in the Dragon's Lair, there were several immortal gowns suited for female cultivators.

Not only ethereally elegant, but with strong defensive properties. Wearing one would make her look like a celestial fairy.

He retrieved three immortal gowns—one crimson, one pale yellow, one pure white.

"For you."

He tossed them to Xia Huaxuan.

Seeing these gorgeous, clearly extraordinary gowns, Xia Huaxuan was deeply shocked.

Though she lacked worldly experience and had limited knowledge, she could still recognize treasures. The quality of these robes far surpassed even what Holy Land elders wore.

No—they weren't even in the same league!

Like items from two different worlds entirely.

"Master, these are too precious. Xuan'er... Xuan'er cannot accept them." She dared not take them, hurrying to return them to Xiao Fan.

She was an orphan, alone and without backing in the Holy Land. When there are many women together, jealousy runs strong—especially toward someone as self-reliant as her. She'd suffered plenty of cold looks.

No one stood up for her. When things happened, she swallowed them down and endured.

Deep in her subconscious, she was just someone of lowly status, unworthy of such fine things. When she received these treasures, her first reaction wasn't to possess them but to feel undeserving—like holding a hot potato that would keep her from eating or sleeping in peace.

Humble and sensitive, weak and helpless—that had been her reality for the past three years.

To a girl who wore her emotions on her face, Xiao Fan saw her insecurity at a glance. He said coldly, "I'm a man. What would I do with these?"

"Take them when I give them to you. Put them on. I'm having you dress nicely to serve me better. Understand?"

Xiao Fan's sudden sternness made Xia Huaxuan freeze. Had she done something wrong?

Why was Master angry with her?

Under her bewildered gaze, Xiao Fan stuffed the other two robes into her storage artifact and helped her into the white immortal gown himself.

"Master, I..." Xia Huaxuan's eyes glistened with tears. No one had ever treated her so gently before.

"Enough, no crying." Xiao Fan said harshly, though his actions betrayed tenderness as he wiped away her tears.

"Yes." Xia Huaxuan immediately held back her tears, feeling the warmth of his palm on her face. His words were sharp, but his actions were gentle.

Sweetness filled Xia Huaxuan's heart. She knew she could never become his principal wife—even concubine was likely a distant hope. But she didn't think too much about it.

Being a follower, staying by his side, giving herself to him when he needed—that was enough.

Her fair face, youthful features, paired with that white gown—Xiao Fan had dressed Xia Huaxuan like a vision of moonlight. A soft ray of light filtered in, falling on her smiling face, pure and captivating.

Xiao Fan found himself momentarily entranced, as if seeing a first love.

"Master, is something wrong with my face?" Being stared at so intently, Xia Huaxuan's face showed a hint of self-consciousness—a maiden's shyness.

"Nothing. You're pretty, so I looked a bit longer." Xiao Fan smiled.

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, on successfully capturing the Daughter of Luck: Xia Huaxuan.]

[Xia Huaxuan: A newly risen Daughter of Luck with limitless potential. You have successfully assimilated her luck, gaining 66,666 Villain Points.]

[Xia Huaxuan has been captured by you. The luck she obtains will also feed back to you.]

[You have conquered her physically and psychologically. She is very humble, viewing you as the most important person in her life, willing to give her life for you. She is a woman who has been 100% captured. Please make good use of her.]

Make good use of her? How?

Besides putting out fires, what other use was there?

But thinking it over, no Daughter of Luck was ever simple. Perhaps Xia Huaxuan would unexpectedly soar to greatness someday.

That was the only possibility.

If so, then he'd invest in her.

"Take these spirit stones." What Xiao Fan lacked least was spirit stones. With a casual reach, he pulled out millions of High-Grade Spirit Stones.

This enormous sum left Xia Huaxuan overwhelmed. She wanted to refuse.

But Xiao Fan said, "Don't you want revenge?"

"Then take them."

Xia Huaxuan was speechless. She really did need spirit stones—for cultivation, for buying pills, for purchasing artifact-refining materials. Everything required spirit stones.

As a mere Golden Core cultivator, her monthly stipend was limited. With these millions of High-Grade Spirit Stones, her cultivation could advance by leaps and bounds.

Beyond this, Xiao Fan gave her the pills he'd received from Hundred Flowers Holy Land.

They were all meant for Golden Core, Nascent Soul, and Soul Transformation stages. He never relied on pills for cultivation—only primal essence and dual cultivation.

As long as Xia Huaxuan cultivated fast enough to practice with him, that would be her greatest help to him.

Xia Huaxuan could barely keep up. Spirit stones, pills, treasures, even various cultivation aids and cultivation methods—Xiao Fan had prepared everything for her.

She felt like her master truly treated her as one of his own.

"Master, thank you!"

"I will definitely cultivate diligently and help you however I can."

Help however she can? Well, if you twisted the meaning a bit, that wasn't wrong.

The two left the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda. To give his woman a good cultivation environment, he specifically sought out An Wen to arrange things for Xia Huaxuan.

An Wen noticed the subtle charm beginning to show between Xia Huaxuan's brows.

She understood instantly what had happened.

Sigh, this kid... whatever.

She went along with his wishes and assigned Xia Huaxuan to a Void Refining elder to take as a disciple and guide her cultivation.

Xia Huaxuan was naturally delighted, expressing her gratitude repeatedly—though most grateful of all to her master.

After handling these matters, Xiao Fan returned to Supreme Mystery Holy Land's palace, only to find just one Grand Ascension elder remaining.

Damn it, these elders were ancient, yet they still spent all their time being lovey-dovey with their Dao Companions. Shameless!

The second round of the Saintess selection lasted seven days total. Xiao Fan had only spent three days in the Exquisite Pagoda. He'd planned to quietly wait out the remaining days until Jiang Lanzhi emerged, watch her ascend to the Saintess position, and then conclude this trip.

But unexpectedly, another uninvited guest had arrived.

"Where is our Princess?"

A subordinate of the Witch-Yao King had descended!
