Chapter 122: Limitless Arrogance—Execute Them All

"So strong! The Holy Son looks refined and gentle, but I didn't expect one punch from him to have such tremendous force—he completely crushed a Grand Ascension cultivator!"

"Speaking of which, do we really need to protect the Holy Son? His strength doesn't seem any weaker than ours."

"Well, maybe it's about the participation that counts."

The three Grand Ascension elders from Supreme Mystery Holy Land never imagined that what had been a tense standoff would be shattered by a single punch from Xiao Fan.

One punch to obliterate a Grand Ascension cultivator—just how strong was the Holy Son?

If the Grand Ascension elders could maintain their composure, the disciples of Supreme Mystery Holy Land below were a completely different story. Their blood boiled with fervor, their eyes filled with worship.

"The Holy Son—he overwhelmed three Grand Ascension cultivators!"

"Holy shit, I thought I was dreaming for a moment. A Void Refining cultivator fighting Grand Ascension cultivators—one against three in a completely one-sided domination. Is this the Holy Son's true strength?"

"No wonder the Holy Son could parachute into his position. His strength is simply beyond what we can hope to reach."

"The Holy Son must be an Immortal reincarnated. Only an Immortal could accomplish something like this."

"That makes sense."

Even more exaggerated were the reactions of the other factions attending the Hundred Flowers Holy Land Saintess selection ceremony.

Among them, having even a single Grand Ascension Old Ancestor was already remarkable.

Grand Ascension Old Ancestors were lofty existences who might enter closed-door cultivation for a thousand years. These people could only look up to them—most had never even seen their sect's Grand Ascension Old Ancestor's face in their entire lives.

Grand Ascension cultivators were the highest existence in their eyes.

And such an existence had just been obliterated by Xiao Fan with a single punch.

Didn't that mean if Xiao Fan felt like it, he could wipe out their entire faction with a wave of his hand?

"Such terrifying strength! A Void Refining cultivator at the Early Stage crushing a Grand Ascension cultivator—how is this even possible?"

"Sometimes, the gap between people is greater than the gap between people and dogs."

"I'll accept that statement. We're all human, but while I'm still timid fighting at the same level, others are already fighting across two major realms—and winning with a single punch."

"I originally wanted to cultivate hard and make the world know my name. Now I see I should just be an ordinary person."

"True. Being an ordinary person isn't so bad."

The shock of that single punch was simply too great.

So great it defied description—like the destruction of heaven and earth, leaving an indelible mark on the heart of every cultivator present.

At the same time, they understood one truth:

The Holy Son must not be insulted!

Countless gazes fell upon Xiao Fan. In an instant, shock and fear transformed into worship and blind reverence.

This was power—terrifying power strong enough to make everyone submit.

Fists really are the best way to reason, Xiao Fan thought.

"You, you..."

Hong Rushuang's face was bloodless. She had thought she could humiliate Jiang Lanzhi properly, never expecting her fiancé to be such a monster.

Monstrously strong!

Xiao Fan turned to look at Hong Rushuang, smiling at her. "Don't worry. You're a disciple of Hundred Flowers Holy Land, so I won't kill you."

"However, you demanded my wife Lanzhi kneel and apologize to you. That demand was excessive, and you must compensate her."

"I've thought it over. You will live—and serve as my Lanzhi's maidservant for life. Forever and ever."

Arrogant—arrogance without limits!

Everyone who heard these words felt a chill in their hearts.

This was truly outrageous!

Hong Rushuang's identity had been revealed—she was a princess of a royal tribe. This tribe had casually dispatched three Grand Ascension cultivators to back her up.

Yet Xiao Fan wanted her as a maidservant, completely disregarding her background.

But on second thought, no matter how strong her background was, could it be stronger than the Xiao family?

Not to mention, Xiao Fan also had the identity of Supreme Mystery Holy Son. With two great powers behind him, few people in this world had a higher status.

"So arrogant!"

"More than that—his arrogance is absolutely limitless!"

"What do you know? If I were in my twenties and reached Void Refining realm, crushing Grand Ascension cultivators with a single punch, I'd be even more arrogant than him!"

"Exactly! Forget his strength—just his two identities as Supreme Mystery Holy Son and Xiao family heir would let me swagger around here."

"You really don't understand him. Aside from having a high-profile entrance, the Holy Son never uses his position to bully others. During all these days of competition, has anyone heard of the Holy Son doing anything out of line? Absolutely not."

"Right. He follows the rules. It was the Shaman God Sect's people who broke the rules first, which made him angry."

"This really can't be blamed on the Holy Son. She's just kicked an iron plate."

No one sympathized with Hong Rushuang. Victory and defeat in arena combat was perfectly normal.

Losing on stage and then trying to get revenge off stage—such people deserved to be beaten.

Jiang Lanzhi listened to Xiao Fan protecting his wife and felt a sweetness rise in her heart. He really is wonderful. I didn't choose wrong.

The other female disciples of Hundred Flowers Holy Land had stars twinkling in their beautiful eyes. The Holy Son treats Senior Sister Lanzhi so well!

The perfect lover! Too bad he's taken—they had no chance.

Hong Rushuang's heart turned to ash as she collapsed weakly on the ground.

A maidservant? Serve Jiang Lanzhi as a maidservant?

What kind of joke was this!

She wanted to object, but Xiao Fan ignored her.

He directly pronounced judgment on the others.

"As for the rest of you, you won't be so lucky."

"Die."

At these words, all the cultivators shrouded by the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda felt their hearts turn to ash.

Not just the cultivators trapped within the pagoda's range—even the observing cultivators didn't understand.

Did it really have to be a fight to the death?

"I don't think killing them is necessary. Keep them as hostages, or even make them slaves."

"I think so too."

But Xiao Fan gave no answer. His hands formed seals in ever-changing patterns, and the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda blazed with golden light.

Threads of golden light fell from the pagoda's base. Everyone inside panicked.

"Wait—don't kill me! I'm willing to serve you as master and obey your commands!" the Grand Ascension Wu General said.

He just wanted to live.

Not just him—all the others knelt and begged for mercy, hoping Xiao Fan would spare them.

Bai Fengliu's face was deathly pale. He had never encountered such a powerful enemy.

The overwhelming pressure and undisguised killing intent made him feel like he'd fallen into an icy abyss.

Xiao Fan's expression remained calm as he spoke lightly.

"Die."

Instantly, the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda burst forth with blinding radiance. It seemed like a million sharp swords were dancing, constantly piercing through the crowd.

Shrill screams, wails, and curses rang out continuously.

But it only lasted a few breaths. After the light faded, everything returned to silence—only severed limbs and remains flowing on the ground.

Blood rain still drifted through the air.

Strand by strand, like red silk threads weaving a crimson veil.

Brilliant yet radiating infinite chill. Those who didn't know might think a great battle had occurred here.

The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda was an Immortal King-level weapon. Ordinary mortals couldn't possibly block it.

It was only because Xiao Fan's cultivation was still low. Otherwise, with just a thought, he could have crushed these people to death.

Blood rain fell, drenching Hong Rushuang into a blood-soaked figure.

Truly crimson red, her face like frost.

Living up to the name Hong Rushuang.

"Retrieve!"

Xiao Fan recalled the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda, along with all the storage pouches and storage rings from the large group of cultivators.

He smiled and said, "Aunt An, I have a small gift for you. I've dirtied your place—consider this a cleaning fee."

He presented the storage pouches to An Wen.

That phrase "Aunt An" made An Wen feel incredibly pleased. Was he acknowledging her as his stepmother?

"Alright."

"Someone come clean up this blood. Don't let it interfere with the Saintess selection."

"Yes, ma'am."

An Wen didn't pursue the matter with Xiao Fan. After all, Hong Rushuang had provoked him first. More importantly, Xiao Fan's identity—he was her son.

Rounding it off, he was practically half her child.

Xiao Fan wasn't finished. He had long since noticed there was another old thing from Shaman God Sect.

A Grand Ascension elder!

"Three elders, don't let him escape," Xiao Fan said.

The three elders from Supreme Mystery Holy Land immediately understood. Three against one—this time the advantage was theirs.

"How dare you oppose my Shaman God Sect!" he said coldly.

But there was nothing he could do. A newly rising faction was far inferior to Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

"Don't know, don't care. You just need to die." The three Grand Ascension elders gave chase.

Dead end!

The Grand Ascension elder from Shaman God Sect had considered taking Xiao Fan hostage, but after witnessing his monstrous strength, he dismissed the thought.

If he rushed over, who knew who would end up as the hostage?

Xiao Fan landed on the ground and walked toward Hong Rushuang.

With a wave of his hand, a massive water sphere crashed down on Hong Rushuang's head, washing away all the blood.

Her bright red, translucent skirt clung tightly to her tender body. Her deathly pale face, lifeless eyes, and trembling body—

The gaze she directed at Xiao Fan held only fear and unease.

"What, what do you want?"

"Nothing much. You've already broken the rules, so I won't follow them with you either."

In full view of everyone, Xiao Fan smiled as he approached Hong Rushuang. The powerful oppressive force made her involuntarily retreat.

She had nothing to rely on.

Like grasping at a lifeline, she cried out to An Wen:

"Holy Master! Holy Master, this disciple knows she was wrong! Please stop him! Holy Master, I beg you!"

"I already gave you a chance," An Wen said without sympathy.

She truly had given her a chance. When she intervened earlier, she wanted to prevent the situation from escalating. But Hong Rushuang stubbornly refused to heed An Wen's warning.

Xiao Fan ignored her screams. With one hand gripping her throat and the other placed on her forehead—

Soul extraction!

After reaching Soul Transformation, one could control divine souls. With Xiao Fan's current Void Refining cultivation, he could easily peel away her soul.

A phantom figure identical to Hong Rushuang appeared.

The phantom was terrified, struggling to escape but powerless.

Xiao Fan's expression was emotionless as he tore at her divine soul.

Humans have Three Ethereal Souls and Seven Corporeal Spirits. Xiao Fan left her with only one soul and one spirit, refining all the rest into a jade token.

This process was extremely painful. Hong Rushuang's originally beautiful face contorted hideously, as if ten thousand arrows pierced her heart. Every part of her body felt the agony of being sliced a thousand times—that soul-piercing, heart-drilling pain.

She desperately wanted to scream, but couldn't make a sound. Her throat was gripped tightly by Xiao Fan, unable to produce any noise!

She could only stiffen her body, kick the ground frantically, and claw at Xiao Fan's hand with all her might, trying to break free—but to no avail.

Everyone watching felt their heads swim, a chill rising from the soles of their feet.

The Supreme Mystery Holy Son truly was domineering.

Say she'd be a maidservant and she became one—no face given whatsoever. He directly extracted her soul.

Just watching that painful process felt like ten thousand insects burrowing into one's heart. Who knew how Hong Rushuang managed to endure it?

When the soul extraction was complete, Hong Rushuang had already fainted. Her hair was disheveled, her face deathly pale. If not for the faint trace of life force still emanating from her body, she might have been mistaken for a corpse.

"This is the consequence," Xiao Fan said expressionlessly.

Then he released his grip. Hong Rushuang had long since lost consciousness. With this release, her legs couldn't support her, and she crashed heavily to the ground like a puddle of mud.

"Someone take her away."

"Yes, sir."

Xiao Fan then smiled as he returned to Jiang Lanzhi's side.

He handed her the refined soul token.

"From now on, she's your maidservant. She'll never pose a threat to you again."

"If you're unhappy, just kill her. Here."

Jiang Lanzhi's peach-blossom eyes were tender as water, her willow eyebrows shy and timid as she nodded gently. "Mm, thank you, husband."

Hiss!

What a little seductress. She's getting more and more alluring, seducing me eight hundred times a day. Looks like I'll need to use my big, big gift to fill up that small, small cave dwelling of yours.

The moment Hong Rushuang's soul was extracted, far away—thousands of miles distant—in a place called the Dark Abyss...

Crack! A jade stone in the embrace of a dignified man shattered. But it didn't completely break—it only split in half, still emanating a faint glow.

"What happened? Something's happened to Rushuang."

"Someone come!" he shouted, his authoritative voice echoing throughout the entire abyss.

"My King." A black shadow arrived in an instant, bowing respectfully to the dignified man.

"Something has happened to Rushuang. Go to Hundred Flowers Holy Land and see what's going on."

"Understood."

———

Here it comes!
