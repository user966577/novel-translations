Chapter 139: This Child of Fortune Is Quite Considerate

Xiao Fan opened his script.

[Wu Chen: Wu Tribe Divine Son. Early Grand Ascension. Extremely powerful—can survive three moves against an Earth Immortal.]

[Purpose for descending to the mortal realm: to collect Wu God Blood and create pure-blooded Wu Tribe members, awakening the Wu God bloodline.

Collecting the blood essence of ten thousand spirits was merely for the Myriad Spirit Blood Sacrifice to gather Wu God Blood. Supreme Mystery Holy Land disrupted his plans. Combined with the long-standing enmity between Supreme Mystery Holy Land and the Wu Tribe in the upper realm, he bears a grudge and wants to teach Supreme Mystery Holy Land a lesson.]

[Opportunities: Has already obtained the Wu God Legacy and Wu God Sword. Also carries 350 drops of Wu God Blood on his person—a great tonic. The Demon God Body's demonic nature needs it greatly.]

[Wu Chen harbors killing intent toward you. Watch yourself.]

Killing intent toward me? What the hell? I haven't offended you, have I?

Still, his power was considerable.

Able to survive three moves against an Earth Immortal. Wonder how many moves he can take from me?

Most importantly, those opportunities. Sending a sword, sending blood, even delivering himself and his fortune—were there really such good people in this world?

Xiao Fan was somewhat moved. You came all this way without sparing any effort.

If I don't personally kill you, I'd feel bad about it.

He drew the Fortune Plundering Sword, unused for so long. My blade has not yet tasted defeat!

Wu Chen steadied himself. He'd just caused such a huge commotion, yet no one came to pursue him?

Very unreasonable!

His heart pounded. Could it be that leaving the dog kennel meant entering a tiger's den?

"Surely I can't be that unlucky." He looked at the Holy Son's Palace, wanting to enter but not daring to.

"Senior, do you sense any danger?" He asked inwardly.

"A few Nether Hounds scared you like this? Poor mental fortitude. Hmph, a mere mortal holy land—I could blow it away with one breath..."

But before he could finish, he stopped abruptly.

"Uh, I suddenly have an epiphany coming on. Can't chat anymore."

Wu Chen found it strange. Why did senior stop mid-sentence?

But the next moment.

Tap, tap...

Soft footsteps approached, making Wu Chen instinctively alert.

The newcomer was an elegant woman, youthful and beautiful yet pure and flawless. A faint smile hung on her face, and she carried a cup of hot tea in her hands.

"The Holy Son cultivates so diligently. I should prepare some immortal tea to refresh him."

Xinxi smiled sweetly, carrying a cup of tea toward Xiao Fan's palace.

Perfect opportunity!

Wu Chen seized the moment, intending to immobilize Xinxi and add some poison to the tea. This way, he could complete his objective without any major disturbance. Brilliant!

But just as he emerged, Xiao Fan also walked out of the palace.

Before Wu Chen could act, Xiao Fan spotted him.

Damn, exposed!

Throwing caution to the wind, Wu Chen drew the Wu God Sword and attacked, placing the blade against Xinxi's neck.

In that critical moment, the scene fell into a strange stalemate.

"Holy Son, I..." Xinxi began, as if seeking permission.

Do you need me to kill him?

Absolutely not—my Child of Fortune can't be harvested by you!

Xiao Fan immediately shouted: "Stop! You can't kill him!"

Xinxi understood. The person to her right, holding a sword to her neck, was nothing but a small fry.

He couldn't cause any real trouble. She'd see what the Holy Son had to say.

Wu Chen was overjoyed. He laughed triumphantly:

"So this maidservant is that important to you? I never would have guessed!"

Never in a million years would he have imagined that what he thought was exposure had actually landed him a trump card. Seems my luck isn't so bad after all—earlier was just a fluke!

Xiao Fan watched with amusement. You can still laugh? Is your brain working properly?

Wu Chen felt something was off with the Wu God Sword today.

He'd clearly placed the blade against her neck. He tried to press it in, to break the skin and draw blood, to show this guy what he was capable of.

But the Wu God Sword was trembling, refusing to move an inch no matter how hard he pushed.

He carefully sensed the Wu God Sword. The sword spirit slumbering within had actually awakened—trembling as it stirred! Awakened!

So that's what it was—the sword spirit was awakening.

"My luck is really too good!"

He called out inwardly: "Senior, I awakened the sword spirit! Did you see? I awakened the Wu God Sword's sword spirit!"

But his senior was in seclusion and couldn't respond to his joy.

Inside Wu Chen's sea of consciousness, that senior was already scared witless.

Don't you dare cause trouble for me, kid!

Hah? Put the sword away! Put it away! Don't drag me down with you if you want to die!

He'd already given up on treatment. If they were discovered later, he'd just immediately pledge loyalty. As long as he ran fast enough, no one could kill him.

Never mind that senior.

Even Wangcai was having heart palpitations.

Holy crap, you actually dare put a sword to her neck?

You really aren't afraid of death!

Wangcai began praying for Wu Chen, hoping he'd leave an intact corpse behind. Not out of pity, of course—it was just that corpse disposal was his job.

Having an intact body would make eating more convenient. Licking up meat scraps would be too troublesome.

Wu Chen wasn't blinded by excitement. Acting rashly now would definitely bring Supreme Mystery Holy Land's pursuit. The power of those ten Earth Immortal realm Nether Hounds was still fresh in his memory.

He needed a legitimate reason to kill him—one that would let him leave unscathed!

"I am Wu Tao. I've long heard of Supreme Mystery Holy Son's reputation and wish to spar with him. To determine skill and decide life or death. However, lacking any connections, I resorted to this desperate measure of breaking into the holy land. I humbly ask the Holy Son to grant this request."

After thinking it over, he fabricated a reason.

A challenge—accidentally killing someone during a challenge would be pretty normal, right?

Xiao Fan was stunned. Would someone really be this considerate about delivering warmth?

You're truly a good person.

"Very well, I accept!" Xiao Fan agreed without a second thought.

As expected of a protagonist—even his fake name was so distinctive. Wu Tao? Did he have a friend named Zhong Chu?

"That's not enough. It must be witnessed by your elders."

"No problem. I'll agree to everything you say—do it your way." Xiao Fan nodded.

You came thousands of miles to deliver yourself to death. What's wrong with granting a few small requests?

Wu Chen was delighted. Finally, the clouds had parted to reveal the moon.

He lowered his sword and adopted the posture of a challenger facing Xiao Fan.

Soon, the Grand Elder hurried over, somewhat bewildered.

"Holy Son, what's this about?"

"He admires me. He came specifically to challenge me to a match. He's afraid you won't let him go if he hurts me, so he wanted you here to witness."

Hurt Xiao Fan?

The Grand Elder scratched his head, full of confusion.

You can pick up a bunch of Grand Ascension Nether Hounds just by going outside. With luck like that, who could possibly kill you?

"Holy Son, do you think I should agree?"

"I think you should agree."

"Alright, then you may begin."

Watching these two converse, Wu Chen was a bit confused. He's the Holy Son, not the Holy Sovereign, right? Yet a Grand Elder listens to him?

Could this be an imposter?

No, better add another layer of insurance!

"Since this is a challenge, and you're the Holy Son, such a grand occasion must be conducted publicly. Only then can it be fair and just."

"What does the Holy Son think?"

Dying in secret doesn't satisfy you—you want to die in front of everyone?

Completely outrageous!

Xiao Fan asked: "Are you sure?"

"Of course. You're the Holy Son. Shouldn't you let your fellow disciples witness your magnificence?"

Xiao Fan was moved. Such a good person—not only delivering himself but also considering my image!

Give me a dozen of these Children of Fortune!

"Fine, fine, fine. Whatever you want."

Soon, at the Grand Elder's command under Xiao Fan's orders, the disciples gathered at the Battle Immortal Platform.

The Battle Immortal Platform was Supreme Mystery Holy Land's sparring ground, used for disciples to practice and duel.

"Who's that guy? How dare he challenge the Holy Son!"

"He's so brave. Doesn't he know the Holy Son was punching out Grand Ascension cultivators like swatting flies at Hundred Flowers Holy Land?"

"Pretty normal. He's gone crazy wanting fame, thinking defeating our Holy Son would make him famous. He doesn't even consider—could the Holy Son possibly lose?"

"How many moves do you think he can take from the Holy Son?"

"Not even one!"

"I think so too."

On stage, Wu Chen stood quietly, the Wu God Sword on his back.

Hearing the jeers from below, he smiled dismissively.

Hmph, what are Grand Ascension cultivators? I can punch them out too, alright? You ignorant fools!

Just you wait. I'll show you how I take this so-called invincible Holy Son and hang him out to dry.

Wu Chen was brimming with confidence, victory in his grasp!

Xiao Fan listened to the endless mockery of Wu Chen from below.

Perfect—too perfect!

What Child of Fortune doesn't get mocked? I, Xiao Fan, officially acknowledge your status as a Child of Fortune.

Xiao Fan gripped the Fortune Plundering Sword, preparing to take the stage.

Xinxi approached with hot tea, smiling sweetly. "Holy Son, the immortal tea I prepared for you. Drink it while it's hot."

Xiao Fan touched the cup. Still warm.

He smiled. "I'll drink it when I come back. It won't get cold."

With that, he walked onto the stage.

Wu Chen was ready, eager to begin. Finally, I can kill him!

"Begin!" The elder on stage said the word and stepped down, leaving the arena to them.

Wu Chen was in high spirits, his gaze imperious.

His robes billowed without wind, his entire person rising into the air. The Wu God Sword in his hand blazed with radiant light, emitting dazzling white brilliance.

His aura surged dramatically. His early Grand Ascension cultivation was on full display, a powerful pressure erupting from his body, his might overwhelming.

Even the clouds above were scattered by him—ten thousand miles of clear sky.

"So you're the Holy Son. Today, I shall experience your renowned techniques."

"This move of mine, Wu Shadow Pursuit, is the strongest sword technique I've mastered. Combined with this Wu God Sword, it can fully unleash my power. Holy Son, watch closely!"

Wu Chen raised the Wu God Sword. Instantly, the divine sword multiplied into myriad copies, shadows following form.

Golden sword shadows densely covered the sky, like an ocean of swords. If this came crashing down, you'd be crippled if not killed.

Xiao Fan found him more and more considerate the longer he looked.

Did you know my father's swordsmanship is peerless? And that after I turned twelve, I studied sword arts with him for five or six years?

"Today, I'll show everyone a bit of the sword techniques I learned."

Xiao Fan pushed off with his foot—Swimming Dragon Phantom.

Though he'd slacked off as a child, he'd still learned something.

"Sword Suppressing All Heavens!"

Instantly, Xiao Fan's figure seemed to expand infinitely, vast and boundless. Throughout the entire cosmos, the sea of stars and celestial dust all transformed into stellar swords.

Wu Chen was utterly horrified!

Compared to his Wu Shadow Pursuit, his opponent's sky full of stars crushed him in sheer presence!

His sword rain hadn't even fallen before it dissipated completely.

Xiao Fan leaped forward, brushing past him. Cold light gleamed as sword qi rippled. What a fast sword!

Wu Chen tried to defend, only to discover—

A red fountain was spraying skyward.

A headless corpse was rapidly departing from him, falling to the ground.

His consciousness grew hazy. Dimly, he felt... wasn't that his own body?

What a pity—he had no chance for regrets.

Just like that, head and body parted ways.

Thud.

A headless corpse crashed to the ground.

The sky full of sword light vanished in that instant.

Xiao Fan walked down from the stage, approached Xinxi, picked up the hot tea and took a sip. He praised: "Your tea-making skills are getting better and better."

"As long as the Holy Son likes it." Xinxi replied. He complimented me!

Xiao Fan added: "By the way, that guy seems to have some strange things in his body. Go ahead and kill him."

Xinxi: "I know."

"Good. Also, take that sword of his. Retrieve the Wu God Blood too. As for the corpse, just feed it to Wangcai. I'm going to cultivate now."

"Good luck, Holy Son."

The disciples below, though mentally prepared, even expecting a single sword to end it—

Still couldn't help but be dazed when they saw the overwhelming presence of Sword Suppressing All Heavens.

"Holy crap, what kind of sword technique was that?"

"I felt like all the stars in the sky transformed into swords!"

"Is the Holy Son's sword mastery really this high?"

"What do you know? The Holy Son is an all-rounder. Even if he said he'd mastered dual cultivation techniques, I'd believe him."

"Don't slander him. How could the Holy Son practice such vulgar arts?"

"Exactly, exactly. Don't judge a gentleman's heart with a petty man's mind. I see your brow is dark, your eyes are dull—have you been practicing some demonic art?"

"How could that be? I was just making an analogy, just an analogy."

The outcome was as expected, but the technique was truly impressive. It drew endless amazement from the disciples. The Holy Son truly was the Holy Son—even killing looked this good.

[Ding, you inadvertently showed off, gaining fortune: One Good Show-Off.]

Xiao Fan: ??? That's really not necessary.

[Ding, you killed a Child of Fortune. Obtained villain points: 99,999.]

[Ding, you slew a Child of Fortune. Triggered reward set. Obtained reward: Dark Mask.]

[Dark Mask: Wearing this mask, no one can trace any karma back to you for anything you do. You are the true walker of the night, the mastermind behind the scenes!]

[Approaching ascension. The more villain points, the bigger the gift package upon ascending. Please keep working hard, Host.]

Dark Mask—not bad effects. Quite suitable for a righteous person like me.
