Chapter 137: The Righteous Holy Land's Unconventional Methods—The Wu Tribe Divine Son's Surging Power!

"Holy crap, Senior Brother Han, don't you have a Dao companion already? Why are you killing so fiercely!"

"I'm eliminating demons and defending the Dao. It has nothing to do with anything else."

"Like hell I believe you!"

"Don't run! Show some backbone, will you? All you know is how to flee—what kind of skill is that!"

"Hold on, Elder Wu, why are you stealing kills from the disciples? You're already old—you still want an arranged marriage?"

"Hmph, the old can still be vigorous! Got a problem with that?"

Supreme Mystery Holy Land's disciples and elders had gone mad chasing down the Wu Tribe.

Though the Wu Tribe was powerful, that was only relative to ordinary forces. Before Supreme Mystery Holy Land, this number of people was nothing to look at.

"Run! Escape while we can—whoever gets away, gets away!"

The Wu Tribe cultivators fell into chaos and were crushed.

It wasn't just a suppression of cultivation realms—it was a suppression of raw power.

The human race's Dao arts were flourishing, their treasures varied and numerous. Adding in all manner of pills and talismans, same-realm Wu Tribe cultivators were simply no match for Supreme Mystery Holy Land disciples.

Blades flashed and swords gleamed, the clash of metal rang clear—yet there were no battle cries shaking the heavens.

Only one-sided slaughter!

Splurt—

A fine head flew through the air. One Wu Tribe cultivator after another was harvested like leeks without mercy.

Supreme Mystery Holy Land's disciples charged forward fearlessly, radiating an aura of death-defying courage.

This spirit infected the people of West Talisman Prefecture. Their blood ran hot watching this, and the weapons gripped in their hands itched to join the fray.

If not now, when?

But the moment they rushed out, Supreme Mystery Holy Land's disciples blocked them.

"Your cultivation is too low. This battlefield is too dangerous—you can't handle it. Fall back."

"Exactly. Next time, alright? No matter what you say, you can't join this fight."

Having spoken, they didn't care whether the locals agreed or not and simply pushed them back.

Don't even think about stealing my kills!

The cultivators of West Talisman Prefecture exchanged confused glances, somewhat bewildered.

"So this is Supreme Mystery Holy Land?"

"Now this is what a holy land should be—protecting our entire human race."

The West Talisman Prefecture city lord watched the Supreme Mystery disciples charging fearlessly into battle, his eyes brimming with hot tears.

This must be what a model righteous holy land looks like.

"City Lord." Suddenly, a messenger arrived.

"What is it?"

"Supreme Mystery Holy Land's elders came and left, but then they returned. They constructed a large teleportation array and transported all these people here to save our West Talisman Prefecture."

"I saw."

Saying this, his heart filled with guilt.

Ah, I thought they were just going through the motions.

Never expected they genuinely wanted to help. I was shallow—judging a gentleman's heart with a petty man's mind.

A one-sided massacre, without any resistance.

In less than fifteen minutes, Supreme Mystery Holy Land's elders and disciples had killed every last Wu Tribe member.

Not a single one left alive!

This made Elder Youxu furious.

A bunch of old lechers, he'd told them to leave some alive, convenient for tracking down their lair. These old lechers had killed until their eyes went red and didn't leave so much as a hair behind.

Those disciples and elders were still unsatisfied, feeling they hadn't killed enough. On average, each person only got one kill.

And most of that time was wasted chasing them down.

They even came to claim credit: "Elder Youxu, mission accomplished."

Youxu's liver ached with anger. He berated them: "Before we came, I told you countless times to leave a few alive as informants. Did every word just go in one ear and out the other?"

Before we came, he did seem to have said something like that.

All the disciples and elders present lowered their heads, as if they'd caused trouble.

Elder Youxu wanted to scold them, but one by one they took it without retorting or making any excuses, slippery as eels.

"Forget it, I can't be bothered with you lot." Elder Youxu sighed.

A disciple suddenly spoke up: "Um, Elder Youxu, I heard that there are Wu Tribe sightings at Pearl Star City to the northwest."

"Really?"

Before Elder Youxu could respond, this group of silent disciples suddenly grew restless. Their eyes filled with excitement, wishing they could charge over right now.

Elder Youxu spoke as calmly as he could: "Who told you this?"

"Uh, I just heard, you know." The disciple said timidly.

Fabricating military intelligence!

However, there were still many Wu Tribe members lurking in the surrounding areas—otherwise, this group alone couldn't have gathered enough for the Myriad Spirit Blood Sacrifice.

Soon, disciples found a map on one of the Wu Tribe corpses depicting their invasion routes.

After Elder Youxu read it, his heart sank.

"Divided into 300 routes, each with over 10,000 people. Each squad collects blood from more than thirty races. The Wu Tribe member leading each squad must be at least Body Integration realm..."

This lavish configuration made Elder Youxu's heart grow heavy. This many?

Even if two-thirds of their forces were sent to attack the demon and yao race borders, that still left 100 Wu Tribe squads attacking the human race and the weaker tribes under human protection.

Damn it all—with such a massive operation, what were they trying to do?

Elder Youxu couldn't figure it out. He reported the situation to the holy land, hoping the Grand Elder could make sense of it.

As for himself, he continued leading the charge.

The West Talisman Prefecture city lord approached and thanked Elder Youxu for saving their lives.

Youxu waved it off—it was nothing, a simple matter. For them, it truly was just a simple matter.

Suddenly, as if remembering something, he looked at the cultivators in West Talisman Prefecture. The strongest was only Soul Transformation? Were there really no experts here?

"Why is everyone here so weak? Not a single Void Refining cultivator?"

The human race was prosperous; even at the edges of their territory, there should be Void Refining cultivators standing guard. That's why he found it strange.

The West Talisman Prefecture city lord spoke resentfully:

"Senior doesn't know—we were originally under the Firmament Sect's jurisdiction. Forget about defending us; the moment they heard the Wu Tribe was coming, they immediately fled."

"Hateful! The people of my West Talisman Prefecture still pay tribute to that Firmament Sect. Seventy percent of our annual taxes go to them—we're not even allowed to refuse."

Elder Youxu's expression turned cold. How could there be such people who eat and run? Shameless! Don't they understand that if you take someone's money, you should solve their problems?

"What do you mean by 'not allowed to refuse'?"

"Our region is remote, and bandits occasionally come to attack. Speaking of which, it's quite coincidental—whenever we're about to stop paying tribute, bandits happen to show up."

"But everyone knows what's really going on. We just don't expose each other." The city lord said.

Elder Youxu's expression remained flat. He simply asked: "Point me in the right direction. Where is that Firmament Sect, and how far is it from here?"

"They're to the east. Head southeast for about 4,000 miles, and you'll see a lake-sea. In the midst of that lake-sea is a chain of islands—that's the Firmament Sect."

"Mm."

"Junior Brother Zhao, come here a moment." Elder Youxu addressed another Grand Ascension elder.

"Senior Brother." The Grand Ascension elder replied respectfully.

"Go to that Firmament Sect and verify whether this is true. If it is, don't kill them—just bring their sect master and all their elders here directly. We happen to need scouts." Elder Youxu spoke coldly.

"Understood."

After speaking, Elder Zhao vanished from West Talisman Prefecture in a flash, heading straight southeast.

A mere 4,000 miles—for a Grand Ascension cultivator, it was just a couple of steps. After all, traversing a thousand miles in an instant wasn't just a figure of speech.

The West Talisman Prefecture city lord was overjoyed. He'd only been venting his frustrations; he never expected someone would actually seek justice for them.

The cultivators of West Talisman Prefecture felt the same. They'd long since grown sick of the Firmament Sect's overbearing, arbitrary, and unreasonable conduct. If not for lacking the strength, they'd have overthrown them ages ago.

Less than fifteen minutes later, Elder Zhao returned carrying an old man covered in bruises, gasping for breath.

Behind him, a long rope bound over a hundred cultivators together—all from the Firmament Sect.

"Senior Brother, I've already asked. The situation is verified—this Firmament Sect truly deserves death." Elder Zhao said.

"Mm." Elder Youxu nodded and took the old man.

"Late-stage Body Integration—your cultivation isn't bad. But I see you'll have difficulty breaking through. Your days are numbered." Elder Youxu remarked as he sized him up.

His gaze swept over the Firmament Sect elders. Most were Soul Transformation, a few reached Void Refining, but most were Nascent Soul cultivators.

The Firmament Sect's Body Integration ancestor had been in seclusion when suddenly an enormous hand reached in and plucked him from his cave dwelling.

He tried to resist, but that hand transformed into a palm and slapped down, knocking him unconscious. When he woke, he'd already been brought here.

He couldn't even see who had taken him—only sensed that the other party's aura was far stronger than his, an entire realm above.

A Grand Ascension cultivator!

He racked his brain but couldn't figure out where he'd offended a Grand Ascension cultivator.

Especially when he saw the newcomer's robes—someone from Supreme Mystery Holy Land. Now things were truly dire!

"Esteemed senior from Supreme Mystery Holy Land, I don't know where my Firmament Sect has offended you. I offer my sincerest apologies—please be magnanimous and spare me."

"You know where this is, don't you?" Elder Youxu said.

"West Talisman Prefecture? Wasn't it attacked by the Wu Tribe..."

Midway through speaking, as if realizing something, he couldn't bring himself to continue.

"So you know this is West Talisman Prefecture, and you know about the Wu Tribe. Seems you know everything." Elder Youxu smiled.

The smile looked rather frightening.

"Cowards who fled at the first sign of danger—and scum like you dares to found a sect?"

"Misleading disciples!"

Sensing that chilling killing intent, the Body Integration cultivator stammered: "Senior, I'm willing to make amends by..."

"No need. I think you're better off dead."

With that, Elder Youxu's hand emitted a dark glow that shot straight into the man's forehead, destroying his consciousness.

Having done this, he became even more unrestrained, directly refining the man into a puppet right there, as if no one else existed.

"Even trash should be put to use."

Elder Youxu spoke coldly, his gaze sweeping over the Firmament Sect members. They frantically lowered their heads, not daring to meet his eyes.

Terrified they'd be next.

Killing the chicken to scare the monkeys—the effect was achieved.

"Did you all see that? This is what happens!"

"Your only chance to survive is to go to the front lines and court death. Yes, court death."

"Someone come—give them the medicine."

Saying this, he produced a dark ceramic bottle.

He took out the pills inside and gave one to each of the Firmament Sect elders.

"I won't take this thing, I won't!" Someone resisted.

"Won't take it? Kill him!" Elder Youxu showed no mercy. "Swallow it and you might live. Refuse, and I'll send you to death right now."

This actually worked.

One after another, they scrambled to comply, afraid that one careless move would get them killed. Was this really a righteous elder? This man was more demonic than actual demons—he'd kill at the slightest disagreement!

The pills went down, and the Firmament Sect members all donned masks of agony. Their expressions twisted and contorted, their stomachs churning as if they might die any moment.

"Each of you has only seven days. If you can't deliver 100 Wu Tribe heads within seven days, you'll definitely bleed from every orifice and die as your bones dissolve to marrow."

"Of course, I also have rewards. Here are 10 antidote pills. Once they're gone, they're gone."

They didn't know what that pill had been, but such agony surely meant it was poison.

And it wasn't over. To prevent escapes, Youxu also branded their souls with divine sense marks—a secret technique of Supreme Mystery Holy Land. As long as they didn't ascend to immortality, they couldn't escape.

Everyone's mind raced with schemes. There were over a hundred of them, but only 10 antidote pills. Less than one-tenth could survive. They couldn't flee either—they'd been branded with divine sense marks.

"Alright, you may begin." Youxu released their bonds.

At the same time, he had his newly-refined patriarch puppet monitor them—one more layer of insurance.

The urgency of death was like a noose tightening around their necks, making it hard to breathe.

Survive!

Those who had previously avoided battle were now charging out like madmen, desperate to find Wu Tribe members to fight to the death.

Sure enough—no pressure, no motivation.

The people of West Talisman Prefecture watched in astonishment. This righteous holy land's methods were truly... unconventional!

Elder Zhao's expression turned teasing as he transmitted his voice:

"Senior Brother, where'd you get that poison pill?"

"How could we righteous cultivators use poison? This is a pill my granddaughter refined. She asked me to help her test its efficacy. Isn't this the perfect waste-not-want-not way to use them as test subjects?"

"Senior Brother, your heart is truly dark."

"Learn from it, Junior Brother. We righteous cultivators must be more demonic than demons to succeed. Lying, cheating, and swindling are all fine as long as they achieve righteous ends."

"I've learned much."

Having saved West Talisman Prefecture, Elder Youxu continued his assault.

Supreme Mystery Holy Land's disciples had long been starving for battle. The moment Elder Youxu gave the order, they shot out like arrows.

Wu Tribe—don't run too fast!

They left behind only the cultivators of West Talisman Prefecture, staring at their departing backs.

"What are they after?"

"Exactly. Coming from so far, expending precious materials to build a large teleportation array, mobilizing tens of thousands of people—all just to save us?"

"It's normal. Your perspective is too narrow—you don't understand the magnanimity of a holy land." The West Talisman Prefecture city lord spoke reverently.

"Only a holy land would spare no cost, traveling to our human race's frontier to suppress evil."

"Having Supreme Mystery Holy Land is truly the great fortune of us ordinary cultivators!"

Made sense—it made too much damn sense.

If only they knew that these people were fighting so desperately just to secure Dao companions—what would they think?

Perhaps they'd say: Food and beauty are natural desires. Such genuine, unaffected behavior—this is true character!

Elder Youxu sent word back to the holy land, and the Grand Elder dispatched more reinforcements. Not quite emptying their ranks, but at least seventy to eighty percent of core disciples at Nascent Soul realm and above were deployed.

When Xiao Fan learned they were short on manpower, how could he, as the righteous Holy Son, not contribute?

With that, he directly summoned a thousand Grand Ascension realm Nether Hounds. Ten to a squad—with this configuration, they could chew the Wu Tribe down to the bone.

Even if they died, it didn't matter. Hell had plenty of these mongrels.

Seeing so many Grand Ascension dogs, the Grand Elder was stunned. "Holy Son, what is this?"

"Oh, I picked them up on the road." Xiao Fan made something up on the spot.

A real man never explains!

"Understood, understood." The Grand Elder nodded, indicating comprehension. The Holy Son could obtain legacies just by stepping outside—how terrifying.

Looks like the Heavenly Secrets Pavilion made a great contribution. The Holy Son truly was their holy land's lucky star—it would be hard not to rise!

Still, the Grand Elder had some doubts. Holy Son, couldn't you have picked up something more impressive? It somehow felt improper going out with dogs.

Having done this, Xiao Fan returned to his palace to continue cultivating, striving to become an immortal as soon as possible and... cuddle with Master Yu'er!

Looking at these thousand Grand Ascension dogs, the Grand Elder had never fought such a wealthy battle!

Sweeping across the world couldn't compare to this, right?

Day three of Supreme Mystery Holy Land's assault: 30 Wu Tribe squads crushed.

Day seven of Supreme Mystery Holy Land's assault: 80 Wu Tribe squads crushed.

In less than ten days, not a single Wu Tribe member within human territory escaped—all annihilated.

Meanwhile, the Wu Tribe Divine Son emerged from the secret realm in high spirits. He'd obtained the legacy, successfully broken through to Grand Ascension, and claimed the Wu God Sword.

This was the Wu God's own divine weapon. Legend held it contained the Wu God's sword comprehensions—learning even a fraction would allow one to kill across realms!

"Before, at Body Integration realm, I could already contend with Human Immortal cultivators. Now at early Grand Ascension, having also obtained the Wu God Sword, my power has surged. Even against an early Earth Immortal, I'd dare to fight."

"Who under heaven could be my match!!"

After Grand Ascension came Human Immortal. After Human Immortal came Earth Immortal.

The Wu Tribe Divine Son was brimming with arrogance, surveying everything before him with the gaze of one who looked down upon the world.

"I am invincible under heaven!"

Inflated—far too inflated.

But it was also normal. He was originally someone who had descended from the immortal realm. As the dignified Wu Tribe Divine Son, it would be abnormal if he couldn't kill across realms.

When one encounters good fortune, one's spirits soar. After spending half a month in the secret realm, he returned to the Dark Abyss—only to find the atmosphere seemed off. Rather tense.

"What happened?"

"Divine Son, that mortal realm's Supreme Mystery Holy Land has ruined our plans."

The Wu Tribe Divine Son's eyes narrowed. Supreme Mystery Holy Land?

"The mortal world's orthodox lineage of that Supreme Mystery Holy Land from above?"

"Yes. We dare not act rashly—everything awaits the Divine Son's decision."

"So we've actually run into a tough opponent."

"Supreme Mystery Holy Land and our Wu Tribe have always been at odds. How can I endure this insult?" The Wu Tribe Divine Son sneered.

"My power has just surged, and the Wu God Sword hasn't tasted blood yet. I'll use Supreme Mystery Holy Land to christen it!"

"I'm going to destroy them."

"Divine Son, you mustn't! No matter what, it's still a lineage of Supreme Mystery Holy Land. If we make a move, those above will surely learn of it, and then we'll face catastrophe."

"I'll exercise restraint."

Having spoken, ignoring his attendants' attempts to stop him, he departed alone!

A mere Supreme Mystery Holy Land—how dare you ruin my plans?

Hmph, I'll show you what cruelty truly means!
