A tiny, pure-white kitten with bright, silky fur lazily stretched its body and let out a meow.

Waiting for the gatekeeper disciple to look away, the cat darted through the mountain gates in a blur, vanishing from sight.

Following the path etched in her memory, the kitten crept toward Xiao Fan's palace.

But she didn't find Xiao Fan there. Instead, she spotted a breathtakingly beautiful woman with an air of refined elegance, seated in the palace and cultivating.

Miao Xiaoqing took in the woman's luminous eyes, pearly teeth, and dark hair cascading like a waterfall—and even she felt a pang of admiration.

Yaochi Immortal Palace lived up to its name. Even a random woman here was a peerless beauty.

Unable to find Xiao Fan, Miao Xiaoqing decided to conceal her presence and wait. But before she could, the woman she'd just been admiring suddenly appeared before her.

Jiang Lanzhi studied the little white cat, curiosity flickering in her eyes.

"Interesting. Where did you sneak in from, little kitty?"

Miao Xiaoqing's eyes went wide with disbelief. How could this woman have detected her?

Before she could react, Jiang Lanzhi pinched the scruff of her neck, lifted her up, and cradled her, idly stroking her fur.

Miao Xiaoqing went rigid. This cat lady doesn't show her claws, so you think I'm just a little kitten?!

She figured that at the Taiyi Golden Immortal level, trapping a random woman in an illusion would be child's play.

Surely she couldn't be unlucky enough to bump into a Grand Luo Golden Immortal?

She let her pupils shimmer with dark light and activated her illusion technique.

The next instant, she realized her mistake.

Wait—you're actually a Grand Luo?!

Jiang Lanzhi was equally surprised. Impressive—this was a Taiyi Golden Immortal-level cat.

She'd nearly been fooled by its docile, cute appearance.

Jiang Lanzhi subdued Miao Xiaoqing with a single strike, forcing her back to human form.

That wasn't the end of it.

Miao Xiaoqing knew she was outmatched and tried to flee, but Jiang Lanzhi was a full major realm above her.

Grand Luo Golden Immortal against Taiyi Golden Immortal—Miao Xiaoqing couldn't even run. She was pinned down in an instant.

Jiang Lanzhi eyed the woman before her—cat ears, pretty face—and demanded sharply, "Who are you? Why did you sneak in here?"

Miao Xiaoqing meowed indignantly, "Meow! I didn't sneak in! I'm here looking for someone!"

"And who are you? Why are you in my master's palace?"

Jiang Lanzhi had an inkling. "Your master's palace?"

"Of course! If it isn't my master's, is it yours?!" Miao Xiaoqing shot back, her confidence swelling the moment she invoked her master's name.

She pressed on: "Let me go! When my master gets back, I'll have him deal with you!"

Jiang Lanzhi understood. This "master" was obviously Xiao Fan.

But deal with me? That's a bold fantasy.

Knowing the cat belonged to Xiao Fan, Jiang Lanzhi released her. Not an enemy, then.

Miao Xiaoqing assumed Jiang Lanzhi had backed down out of fear. She huffed, "Smart move. Otherwise, when my master returns, you'd be in big trouble."

Without pressing the matter further, Miao Xiaoqing plopped down in the palace and waited for Xiao Fan, making herself at home.

Bored, she struck up a conversation with Jiang Lanzhi.

"Are you one of Yaochi Immortal Palace's elders? You seem new." Miao Xiaoqing said.

"I am new here." Jiang Lanzhi replied.

"That explains it." Miao Xiaoqing nodded. "But why are you here? As far as I know, only the master and the two Palace Masters and that one divine maiden are allowed in here."

Jiang Lanzhi found this amusing. "Why do you think I'm here?"

Miao Xiaoqing appraised Lanzhi's face—stunning beyond words—and her cool, proud aura. She must be the master's new maidservant.

"You're the master's servant?"

"If you say so, sure."

Miao Xiaoqing relaxed. Just a new servant girl—that meant her own status was definitely higher.

After all, she was the master's pet and plaything. A mere servant couldn't compare.

Adopting the tone of a seasoned veteran, she said, "Serve the master well from now on. If there's anything you don't understand, ask me. I'll teach you."

"Oh, well thank you." Jiang Lanzhi said with perfect sincerity.

Miao Xiaoqing was surprised at how agreeable this cool-looking servant was. The master had great taste—even his servants had such elegant bearing.

With the air of a senior mentor, Miao Xiaoqing launched into a detailed briefing on Xiao Fan's preferences and everything he liked.

She was thoroughly playing the role of an old hand.

When Xiao Fan returned to find Jiang Lanzhi and Miao Xiaoqing chatting away like old friends, he was baffled.

"Master, you're back! Meow~"

The moment she spotted Xiao Fan, Miao Xiaoqing threw herself into his arms without a word, as docile as a little kitten.

Which she literally was.

"Master, your new servant is very nice. You have excellent taste."

Xiao Fan blinked. "Servant? What servant?"

"Her, obviously!" Miao Xiaoqing pointed at Lanzhi.

The next moment, Lanzhi smiled and said, "Husband, your tastes really are wide-ranging. You don't even spare kittens."

"Lanzhi, I think there's been a misunderstanding. It's not what you're thinking." Xiao Fan said with utmost seriousness.

"Oh?"

Xiao Fan felt his image in Lanzhi's eyes crumbling to dust.

Dammit, I'm really not a beast!

Miao Xiaoqing caught the way Xiao Fan was explaining himself, then heard that word—"husband." Something clicked.

Even the Yaochi Palace Master only called him "Young Master."

Yet this cool, elegant woman was calling him "husband."

Could this be... the principal wife?!

Hsss!!

I'm dead. I just spent the whole time teaching the mistress how to serve the master. Am I trying to get myself killed?

Miao Xiaoqing forced a smile at Lanzhi, gave a meek little wave, quietly extracted herself from Xiao Fan's arms, and stood off to the side, head bowed, silent as a mouse.

Xiao Fan said, "Lanzhi, she's just an intelligence-gathering cat I keep. Believe me."

"Alright, alright. I believe you."

"But I am curious—just how many women are you keeping behind my back?" Jiang Lanzhi smiled sweetly.

Her voice was soft and gentle, but Xiao Fan knew: this was a death trap of a question.

Ahem.

Xiao Fan cleared his throat. "None of them compare to you."

"So how many?"

"You know I love you most."

"So how many?"

Xiao Fan knew there was no escaping this one.

He held up two fingers.

"Two more?" Lanzhi asked. Adding the four women at Yaochi, the cat, and herself—that made eight.

"About twenty." Xiao Fan said with an awkward grin.

Lanzhi's expression froze. Disbelief.

"How many?"

The shock was total. We've only been apart for a few years—how did you manage twenty?

Even Jiang Lanzhi, generous as she was, nearly blacked out at that number.

Xiao Fan rushed to explain: "Those were all mistakes I made accidentally. From start to finish, the only person I've truly loved is you. You have to believe me."

Jiang Lanzhi's eyes reddened, tears glistening, trembling on the verge of falling.

What kind of nonsense was this?!

Xiao Fan hurried to comfort her. She resisted at first but eventually yielded, collapsing into his arms and sobbing.

It took him a long while to calm her down.

He shot a withering glare at Miao Xiaoqing. You little cat—you made my woman cry. Just wait!

Miao Xiaoqing's body jolted. That domineering gaze reminded her of their usual... sessions.

Jiang Lanzhi stared at Xiao Fan with reddened eyes, her emotions tangled—love and resentment intertwined. She was clearly furious, yet she couldn't bring herself to scold him. She just let him chase woman after woman.

"You jerk! You absolute jerk!"

"I should never have believed your lies! I should've stomped my jade foot—stomped my foot right on you!"

"..."

Jiang Lanzhi vented her frustration, though the harshest word she could muster was "jerk." The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. She had to make Xiao Fan understand his mistake!

You've got the energy for twenty women? That means you've got stamina to spare. Let me squeeze every last drop out of you.

Jiang Lanzhi shoved Xiao Fan onto his back, completely ignoring Miao Xiaoqing's presence. Her expression was fierce as she tore at his robes—though her hands were surprisingly gentle.

With practiced ease, she threw herself into the task with everything she had, determined to claim his heart entirely, so he'd never want another woman again.

Jiang Lanzhi was going all out—serving him with absolute devotion.

Things she was normally too shy to do—things she'd only comply with after Xiao Fan begged—she now offered freely.

More than that, she was alluring, uninhibited, casting aside every shred of restraint and displaying a boldness she'd never shown before.

She knew that outside women would work even harder to please him. She couldn't lose.

Jiang Lanzhi was purely driven by anger. Twin trails of tears slid down her delicate face.

Xiao Fan let her vent, but seeing tears of pain on that adorable face made his heart clench—a physical ache.

He pulled her close, kissed her, and let her feel his tenderness.

He panicked. Genuine guilt stirred in his heart for the first time.

A long kiss later, Jiang Lanzhi whispered between sobs, "Husband, am I not good enough?"

"Lanzhi, you are the best woman in the world. Bar none." Xiao Fan gently wiped the tears from her eyes.

"Really?" Jiang Lanzhi choked out.

"Of course." Xiao Fan said with quiet conviction.

Jiang Lanzhi lay still in his arms, savoring his love in this fragile moment.

"Husband, can you promise me one thing?"

"Name it."

"Every woman from your past—I won't pursue it. But from now on, no more. No new women." Jiang Lanzhi pleaded.

Hope shimmered in her eyes.

Before Xiao Fan could answer, she continued: "And even if there are... just don't tell me. As long as you don't say it, I'll pretend nothing happened."

"I'll lie to myself." Her voice grew small, almost pitiful, as she forced a smile.

Xiao Fan held her tight and whispered in her ear.

"I promise. No more women. Not ever."

"Mm." Jiang Lanzhi smiled radiantly, and the clouds parted. The world was bright again.

When a woman loved deeply enough, she'd forgive anything—even fabricating her own delusion to give him an out.

Xiao Fan held Jiang Lanzhi in the silence. What a foolish woman.

Soon, Jiang Lanzhi realized the problem—her current state of undress, and there was another woman standing right there.

Sanity restored, she wanted to sink into the floor. She'd been impulsive, and certain things had... happened.

She scrambled to fix her clothing and flee.

But Xiao Fan had already been riled up.

Think you can escape? Not a chance.

"Husband, stop—someone's watching."

"So what?"

With a flick of his hand, Xiao Fan pulled Miao Xiaoqing over.

Meow!!
