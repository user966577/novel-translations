Chapter 117: The Hundred Flowers Holy Master's Invitation

At the center of the grotto-heaven stood a massive arena spanning about three miles across.

To be precise, the entire three-mile area served as the arena zone, containing hundreds of smaller platforms where multiple matches could take place simultaneously.

As the elimination rounds progressed and more disciples were knocked out, these smaller platforms would merge together to form larger ones.

The arena floor was entirely grayish-white, paved with snow-rock that was both flat and incredibly hard.

Around the arena's perimeter stood orderly pavilions where guests could observe from above.

To prevent stray attacks from the arena from damaging these surrounding structures, protective formations would activate during matches, enveloping the combat area.

Behind the arena, Jiang Lanzhi vaguely sensed that her strength had suddenly surged three days ago.

There had been no warning—just a sudden increase in power. She found it strange, but the One Heart Same Body technique was the only explanation.

"Xiao Fan must be cultivating diligently. He's so thoughtful—training hard just to boost my strength because he's worried about my stability."

Xiao Fan, diligently cultivating...

Well, that wasn't exactly wrong.

Achoo...

Xiao Fan rubbed his nose. Someone must be secretly praising his handsomeness again.

He sat in the pavilion, gazing toward the arena below.

On the platform, a beautiful elder in crimson robes slowly descended to the center.

Channeling spiritual power through her voice, the red-robed elder announced: "Welcome, fellow cultivators, to our Hundred Flowers Holy Land to witness the emergence of our new Saintess."

"Without further ado, let us begin."

The moment she finished speaking, she withdrew from the arena, letting the disciples enter and commence the elimination rounds.

Xiao Fan was quite pleased with her opening remarks.

He had expected a long, tedious preamble—discussing Hundred Flowers Holy Land's ancient history, the background of the Saintess selection, the rules and precautions, introductions of the elders and guests, and finally inviting the Holy Master to say a few words.

A whole procedural song and dance before getting to the main event.

Instead, Hundred Flowers Holy Land had condensed everything into a single sentence and gone straight to the point. Not bad.

Beside Xiao Fan sat two Hundred Flowers Holy Land disciples serving as his commentators, answering any questions he might have. This was a privilege reserved only for guests of distinguished status.

Xiao Fan watched as over a hundred platforms hosted simultaneous matches.

Somewhat puzzled, he wondered—this many people?

"Are the disciples of your Holy Land this confident? Why are so many participating in the Saintess selection?"

At a glance, he counted at least five or six hundred female disciples.

One of the Hundred Flowers disciples beside him replied:

"Your Highness Holy Son, you may not be aware."

"Actually, many of our senior and junior sisters have foresight. Especially after you declared that no one but Senior Sister Lanzhi could become Saintess—most of them gave up any thoughts of competing for that position."

"Indeed, they're not participating for the Saintess title."

"Oh?" Xiao Fan was curious. Then why?

Seeing his confusion, they explained:

"You may not know, Holy Son, but the Saintess selection actually has another layer of meaning."

Deeper meaning? Wasn't it just about selecting a Saintess? What else could there be?

"It seems the Holy Son knows little about our Hundred Flowers Holy Land." One of the female disciples smiled.

"There can only be one Saintess, but Hundred Flowers Holy Land has countless outstanding disciples. Our senior and junior sisters showcase their abilities on the arena—their strength and talent on full display."

"With so many factions present, including many talented young cultivators, perhaps some of them might find suitable Dao companions."

Now Xiao Fan understood.

Hundred Flowers Holy Land's survival strategy revolved around political marriages with various factions. Inviting so many powers to this Saintess selection wasn't just for ceremony, was it?

More importantly, it was about finding matches for their female disciples.

After all, few ever achieved immortality. Most female disciples would spend their entire lives hovering around Nascent Soul or Soul Transformation. If they didn't find a Dao companion while still in their youth, finding someone of equal status later would become difficult.

"Your Holy Land is quite considerate—organizing a matchmaking event for your disciples."

"Matchmaking event—that's not inaccurate."

Xiao Fan roughly understood now. To draw an analogy:

Hundred Flowers Holy Land was like a women's academy with not a single male cultivator. Hosting the Saintess selection and inviting various factions was essentially creating an opportunity for everyone to find Dao companions. Whether they could seize it was up to them.

Looking around, not to mention others, even the elders and disciples from his own Supreme Mystery Holy Land were practically howling with excitement.

"Holy shit, look at that girl on Platform One—her technique is massive!"

"That's nothing. Her skill is so white, long and white."

"The Nascent Soul mid-stage disciple on Platform Eighteen—her chest technique is too fierce! One wave of that surging tide and I'm knocked out!"

"Focus, guys! Where are your eyes looking?"

"We are focused! Look at those long legs—if she kicked me with those, I couldn't possibly block it."

"Yeah, if she used that surging tide technique on me, I'd collapse on the spot."

Xiao Fan was speechless. What happened to their dignity?

They were acting like they'd never seen women before. Could they be any less refined?

Xiao Fan wasn't that vulgar. After his sessions with Jiang Lanzhi and Ji Qingxue, his heart was as calm as still water.

What white technique! What long skill! What a ball!

Though Hundred Flowers Holy Land consisted entirely of female disciples, their strength was not to be underestimated. Nearly every one of them could fight above their level—even if only by a small margin.

Moreover, their battles weren't like mortal women's catfights—pulling clothes, grabbing hair, and attacking weak points. Instead, they exchanged all manner of immortal arts in dazzling displays.

Watching beautiful women fight was quite pleasing to the eye.

One of the Hundred Flowers disciples beside Xiao Fan said:

"Holy Son, that's Senior Sister Lanzhi. Look."

Following her gesture, Xiao Fan looked over and spotted Jiang Lanzhi's elegant figure.

One Heart Same Body, hearts connected—Jiang Lanzhi turned and smiled at him, and he found himself quite smitten.

On the arena, facing Jiang Lanzhi was a young woman with short hair and a youthful appearance, her bright eyes sparkling as a smile played at her lips.

She said with a grin: "Senior Sister Lanzhi, I'm afraid I can't beat you. Please go easy on me."

Jiang Lanzhi returned the smile: "I'll be gentle."

"Good, don't hurt me." She laughed as she spoke.

Given Jiang Lanzhi's special status, she naturally drew countless gazes.

"Is that the Saintess candidate?"

"I heard she's the Supreme Mystery Holy Son's fiancée. She must be incredibly talented."

"Exactly. She'll definitely win—the only question is how many moves it'll take."

"I bet within ten moves."

"I bet within three. If I'm wrong, I'll stick something up the guy upstairs."

"I bet five. If I'm wrong, those two get to French kiss each other as punishment."

Jiang Lanzhi stood on the platform. She didn't use any techniques—through One Heart Same Body, she had also gained Xiao Fan's formidable physical strength.

"I don't know how Xiao Fan trained to make his body this powerful." She clenched her jade-like fist, and a surge of tremendous force emanated forth.

"Senior Sister Lanzhi, watch out! My Maiden's Cute Punch—if it hits your face, you better not cry!"

The young woman's delicate, pink fist tightened into a small jade ball. Her short hair was neat and sharp, and her youthful face bore an expression of utmost seriousness.

Though Jiang Lanzhi was powerful, she never underestimated her opponents.

She had researched her competition. The young-looking disciple opposite her was at Nascent Soul mid-stage, but she had once beaten a Soul Transformation early-stage mother tiger demon to death with her bare fists!

In other words, she was scarier than a tigress!

A fierce gust of fist wind howled forth, arriving in an instant. From the moment she threw the punch to when it reached Jiang Lanzhi's face was but the blink of an eye.

Jiang Lanzhi remained unflustered, raising her hand to block the attack with perfect timing.

The young woman froze. All playfulness vanished from her cute face, replaced by seriousness and gravity.

That innocent-looking face easily misled people into thinking she was some fragile maiden.

And by not using techniques, relying only on her fists, she could better deceive her opponents.

Catch them off guard.

But she hadn't expected Jiang Lanzhi to be this strong.

Bang!

When her fist collided with Jiang Lanzhi's, a sharp pain shot through her arm.

Her physical body is no weaker than mine?

The young woman tried to withdraw her fist, but Jiang Lanzhi gave her no chance. With a single grab, she locked the fist firmly in place—no escape possible.

Being short, when Jiang Lanzhi simply lifted her arm, the girl's feet left the ground.

She was somewhat dumbfounded. What kind of technique was this?

The next moment, Jiang Lanzhi flew to the edge of the arena.

The young woman finally realized what was happening. Her jade-like feet kicked helplessly in the air as her free hand tried to push Jiang Lanzhi away.

"Senior Sister Lanzhi, you can't do this! Put me down—let's have a proper fight!"

Her feet kept swinging in the air, finding no purchase. The sight was rather... alluring.

Not just her—even the spectators were dumbfounded.

What kind of move was this?

"Hey, hey, hey—she's not planning to win like that, is she?"

"Apparently, in this arena competition, falling out of bounds counts as a loss."

As expected, Jiang Lanzhi reached the arena's edge, released her grip, and pressed down on the girl's head. With no way to resist, she tumbled off the platform.

This left her quite dejected. What a humiliating way to lose.

"Winner of this match: Jiang Lanzhi."

"I yield." Jiang Lanzhi smiled.

The young woman forced a smile, her expression bitter:

"Senior Sister Lanzhi, you're too strong! You and the Supreme Mystery Holy Son are absolutely perfect together—a heavenly match! Love you, hehe~"

This declaration instantly set countless male cultivators' hearts racing.

"She's way too cute!"

"I want all her information within fifteen minutes."

"Such an adorable girl—if I punched her, she'd probably cry for a long time."

"Damn, you're really a beast, aren't you?"

No one was surprised by Jiang Lanzhi's victory.

After all, the Supreme Mystery Holy Son wasn't ordinary—how could his fiancée be anything less than extraordinary?

"Oh? What a powerful physique." Bai Fengliu also noticed Jiang Lanzhi.

Though it was just one punch, his keen eye had caught the details.

If he could capture her, the Shaman God Sect's Lady Mo'e would have a host body to possess.

Xiao Fan watched Jiang Lanzhi's movements with some surprise—she had been too gentle.

Suddenly, a female elder from Hundred Flowers Holy Land approached and addressed him:

"Young Master Xiao, our Holy Master has emerged from seclusion and wishes to meet you."

Hm? Young Master Xiao!

This form of address carried quite a lot of information.

He had come here as the Supreme Mystery Holy Son, yet she was using his family name.

The Hundred Flowers Holy Master—he couldn't help but recall the romantic debts his father had left behind. Could she be trying to settle scores with him?

This...

"Young Master Xiao?"

"Oh, what did the Holy Master want to discuss?"

"Nothing specific. She simply wishes to meet you."

"Very well, lead the way."

With some trepidation, Xiao Fan followed the elder, curious to see just how his father had charmed the Hundred Flowers Holy Master so thoroughly.
