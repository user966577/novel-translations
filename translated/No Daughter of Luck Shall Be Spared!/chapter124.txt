Chapter 124: Those Who Work Hard—I'll Let You Rush Toward the Future

The Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda, also known as: Five-Star Exquisite Express Hotel.

After multiple in-depth exchanges, it now contained all types of rooms—rustic country estates, presidential suites, ocean-view rooms, bridal chambers, and more. Every variety was available.

In a bedroom fragrant with flowers, enticingly refreshing to the heart, a large bed was quietly positioned. My bed is quite spacious.

Xia Huaxuan sat nervously upon it, her jade hands gripping her skirt, her head lowered. Her entire face was flushed pink.

Excessive nervousness made her breathing somewhat rapid, her palms sweating.

Her hair was slightly damp. At Xiao Fan's request, she had first gone to wash up, and her hair hadn't dried yet.

Then she changed into the clothes he had prepared in advance.

Xia Huaxuan was nervous. She had never seen such long stockings before. How to describe them? They were very strange stockings—as thin as cicada wings, jet black yet hazy, like translucent gauze.

These stockings couldn't completely cover her slender, beautiful legs. Faintly, one could still see the alluring skin tone beneath.

The stockings were very long, wrapping around her jade feet and extending all the way up, past her knees and continuing much farther upward.

This was Xia Huaxuan's first time seeing such unusual garments.

According to the Holy Son, these were costume props. Only by wearing them could he conveniently cast his technique to enhance her cultivation aptitude.

Although Xia Huaxuan didn't understand what "costume props" meant, she grasped the key point: only by wearing them could he enhance her aptitude!

To become stronger, she suppressed her shame and resolutely put them on.

Besides these strange stockings, the Holy Son had also prepared a special black dress for her. This dress was completely different from anything she'd ever seen.

Very short—or rather, not very long.

The stockings reached up her legs, but this short skirt couldn't even cover the stockings.

Between the stockings and the skirt, a large expanse of fair skin was exposed. Although no wind blew, she felt incredibly cool.

The upper half of the dress was also strange—especially form-fitting, practically binding her entire body.

Her small frame was bound by the dress, making her ample bosom stand out prominently.

The neckline was rather low—not like the clothing she wore before that didn't even expose her collarbones. This neckline was so open that not only her collarbones were visible, but even... certain other things had nowhere to hide.

She didn't understand the Holy Son's intentions. Were all these preparations really necessary?

"The Holy Son must have considered this more thoroughly than I have," Xia Huaxuan told herself, taking a deep breath to calm down.

Xiao Fan pushed open the door and saw Xia Huaxuan sitting before the bed like she was sitting on pins and needles. His heart grew heated.

A mature, sophisticated black outfit paired with an innocent, adorable girl's natural shyness, plus Xia Huaxuan's innate fair, tender, youthful beauty—a pure, inexperienced girl wearing a provocative short dress created a stimulating contrast that no lustful person could refuse.

Creak~

The sound of the door opening rang out. Xia Huaxuan's two fair jade hands gripped her skirt even harder, her restless small hands alternating between resting on her legs and clenching into fists.

She stood up and, mustering all her courage, said to Xiao Fan:

"Holy, Holy Son, this sub-subordinate is ready. You, you can make your move anytime."

"I, I will definitely cooperate with your requirements."

Her attitude was like facing death, shy and flustered, her stammering voice trembling. She closed her eyes to say this, though without much confidence. The more she spoke, the softer her voice became.

By the end, both her head and voice had lowered.

Xiao Fan looked at this tender face paired with the impressive assets inappropriate for her age—very discordant.

A phrase came to mind: youthful face with... mature endowments.

Xia Huaxuan wasn't very tall—only reaching Xiao Fan's chin, making her relatively short among his women.

However, this made her seem like a petite beauty. Combined with her tender, rosy face, she was truly a woman who provoked criminal thoughts!

Xiao Fan chuckled softly and walked over.

Xia Huaxuan's body involuntarily stiffened. Was it coming? I, I'm so nervous!

She gripped the corners of her clothes tightly. She used so much force that she wrinkled the hem of her skirt.

Seeing her like this, Xiao Fan immediately understood—this little thing was quite nervous.

Excessive nervousness wasn't conducive to conducting exchange activities.

Xiao Fan walked to her side, sat down, and took her boneless, soft hand. With a gentle tug, he pulled her beside him.

Young girls naturally had a fragrant scent—fresh and alluring. Especially having just bathed, her pure, flawless body was even more intoxicating.

"Holy, Holy Son."

Xia Huaxuan had prepared mentally and unloaded her psychological burden, but her physical burden remained extremely tense.

Inexperienced, she was like a spring flower bud about to bloom.

The moment Xia Huaxuan approached Xiao Fan, her entire body became like a puppet on strings, completely without her own thoughts.

Following Xiao Fan's movements like a walking corpse, she drew near him.

Xiao Fan pulled her to sit on his lap, gently embracing her slender waist from behind. He rested his head on her fragrant shoulder and simply leaned there, motionless.

This fellow's movements were practiced, gentle, and comfortable. Xia Huaxuan was completely outmatched.

This made her even more nervous. Her entire body was like a taut bowstring—any plucking would feel so rigid.

A bowstring that's too tense can't produce beautiful music.

Xiao Fan didn't mind. The first time was always like this.

He embraced her waist with one hand while the other gently turned her tender, delicate face toward him, lightly touching it.

Instantly—

Her already shy, flushed face became covered in a rosy glow. The unique shyness of a maiden, that feeling of rapid breathing and fragrant exhalation, was scorching hot—igniting Xiao Fan's interest even more.

Haste makes waste. For unknown territory, first conquer, then occupy.

He didn't rush to launch his offensive. Instead, he whispered in her ear, asking about her past.

"How old are you? When did you enter Hundred Flowers Holy Land?"

Xia Huaxuan nervously said, "Re-replying to the Holy Son, this sub-subordinate, this sub-subordinate..."

"Don't be nervous. I don't like being too formal. Relax a bit. Just call me Master."

"You don't need to call yourself subordinate either. From now on, you'll be called Xuan'er."

Xiao Fan played with her silky hair, kindling her interest first.

"Yes, Xuan, Xuan'er understands."

However, she was still very nervous, so even her nod was somewhat mechanical and stiff.

"Speak."

"Holy Son, when Xuan'er was twelve, Falling Leaf Valley suffered disaster. Father, Mother, senior brothers and sisters all died."

"Only Xuan'er alone survived the catastrophe by falling into a ravine and escaping with her life."

"After that, Xuan'er by chance joined Hundred Flowers Holy Land. To prevent pursuit, Xuan'er even changed her appearance and cultivated in the Holy Land."

"To tell the truth, it's only been a few years. This is Xuan'er's third year cultivating in the Holy Land," Xia Huaxuan answered, her tone carrying a sense of loss—that wound would forever pain her.

Wait!

Twelve years old when disaster struck, joined the Holy Land, cultivated there for three years.

So, fifteen years old?

This was getting more outrageous by the day.

Xiao Fan looked at her in surprise. The hand embracing her slender waist slid slightly upward along her body.

Before long, it encountered an insurmountable peak.

"You call this fifteen?" Xiao Fan was shocked.

Xia Huaxuan felt the warm palm. Her body grew somewhat heated as she said tremblingly:

"Master, Xuan'er doesn't dare deceive you. If I must say where Xuan'er misspoke, it would be that the fifteen just now was my nominal age."

"Master, Xuan'er doesn't dare deceive you. Every word is true."

Huh?

This was still nominal age?

"Then what about this?"

Xiao Fan tightened his grip. The sudden assault made Xia Huaxuan let out a soft moan.

She said shyly, "My mother said everyone's constitution is different."

Incredible!

"Have you studied the cultivation method I gave you?" Xiao Fan whispered in her ear. The hot breath made her feel like her entire body was unbearably itchy, restless and unsettled.

But she didn't dare take initiative. She could only endure it forcefully, nodding and saying, "Xuan'er has studied it all."

"Mm, very aware."

The atmosphere began to grow suggestive. Though no peach trees were planted in the bedroom of the Five-Star Exquisite Pagoda, it was filled with peachy colors and spring intentions.

The Five-Star Exquisite Pagoda wasn't hot inside, but Xia Huaxuan's face glistened with crystalline beads of sweat. Beneath her fair skin, rosy clouds had long since flown to her cheeks.

Her breathing grew rapid. Master—Master was the Supreme Mystery Holy Son. His appearance was already that of a peerless immortal.

Combined with her stirring emotions, even without any transaction or matter of enhancing cultivation aptitude, Xia Huaxuan found it hard to restrain herself.

Her stiff body gradually melted like a pool of spring water—tender, soft, and clinging. She leaned weakly in Xiao Fan's embrace.

Her gaze was somewhat hazy—that was emotional stirring, desire's fire, and even more, primal longing.

"Ah!"

Suddenly—

Xia Huaxuan let out a startled cry. She felt danger lurking behind her—some heaven-piercing might.

This was Xiao Fan's innate fire-attribute companion immortal artifact. Named: Crimson Plum Falling Phoenix!

Xiao Fan gently lifted her up and tenderly laid her on the bed.

Xia Huaxuan's body was languid and powerless. She had completely lost the strength to resist. Fine sweat covered her face as she panted heavily, utterly enchanting.

Their four eyes met. Xiao Fan could even see the desire burning in Xia Huaxuan's eyes.

No words were needed. The atmosphere had been set. Women were naturally born knowing how to charm—no learning required. Especially Xia Huaxuan's lively eyes, watery and blinking with their own springtime radiance.

Xiao Fan waved his hand, dropping the red bed curtain to lock in the spring colors.

"Holy Son," Xia Huaxuan said softly, her tone full of affirmation.

She was the one seeking Xiao Fan's help. Xiao Fan wouldn't easily let her achieve her goal. He said, "Will you seize the future?"

Hearing this, Xia Huaxuan froze, her blush deepening. She gave an almost imperceptible nod.

"I won't actively help you. If you want to enhance your aptitude and increase your cultivation, you can only rely on your own efforts. Understand?"

"Xuan'er, Xuan'er understands."

"Then I leave it to you." As he spoke, he waved his hand. His companion immortal artifact, Crimson Plum Falling Phoenix, revealed itself.

Xia Huaxuan pushed Xiao Fan down, pinning him beneath her.

Two tender jade hands, inexperienced and shy, cupped his face as she leaned down for a deep, affectionate kiss.

After being active so long, this passive feeling truly had a unique flavor.

Xia Huaxuan's movements were very clumsy. Though she pressed against him with all her strength, her teeth remained tightly locked, her tongue not daring any action.

Xiao Fan cupped her delicate face—smooth and soft.

Nervousness made her entire body temperature soar, scorching hot. Combined with the burning fragrant breath she exhaled, the flames of war were thoroughly ignited.

Xiao Fan roughly pried open her teeth, capturing her tongue to savor carefully. Sweet and fresh, like jade nectar and fine wine, utterly intoxicating.

His hands unconsciously embraced her beautiful body, wishing he could meld her entirely into himself.

After a long while, their lips parted.

Xia Huaxuan's eyes rippled with surging emotions. The stiffness had vanished completely, replaced by soft sweetness.

She sat up and moved backward.

······

······

Xiao Fan felt triumphant in his heart. A milestone victory!

He gently stroked Xia Huaxuan's head. You've put in the effort—I won't let you down.
