Chapter 129: The Power of Braindead Fans Is Infinite!

Seeing his confidence, many asked curiously: "Then explain it."

"It's obvious. The Holy Son is challenging his own limits."

"Think about it—how much of a genius is the Holy Son? How could he be foolish enough to fight a Grand Ascension cultivator? If he's doing this, he must have his reasons."

"Do you even need to think about those reasons? Among cultivators of the same level, he's already invincible. To break through himself, he can only target higher-level cultivators."

"So the only reason to attack that Grand Ascension is this: the Holy Son wants to break through his limits through life-and-death tempering."

This person spoke with absolute conviction and sound reasoning.

"Break through limits?"

"Even breaking through limits doesn't require risking your life."

"Exactly. That reasoning is too far-fetched. I, Zhang San, don't really buy your explanation."

"I, Li Si, formally object."

The young man said disdainfully: "This is the difference between ordinary people like you and a genius like the Holy Son."

"Every single one of you has been coddled by your elders—afraid to drop you, afraid you'd melt in their mouths—without a shred of ambition."

"Look at the Holy Son. He doesn't even deign to play with the likes of you. Not to mention the distant past—just three days ago, didn't the Holy Son single-handedly kill two Grand Ascension cultivators?"

Everyone recalled that day's events, the memory still fresh.

After all, a Void Refining cultivator killing a Grand Ascension with one punch—such a thing was too shocking to forget.

"But the Holy Son used a treasure to restrain that person."

"That doesn't really count as a direct kill, right?"

"True. The Holy Son has strength, but he borrowed the power of a treasure. Still impressive though."

The young man nodded: "You've finally gotten a bit smarter. Don't you think the Holy Son knows this? The Holy Son understands better than anyone that using treasures can't help him break through himself."

"So this time, the Holy Son doesn't plan to use treasures—only his own strength."

Quite a crowd had gathered here, somewhat noisy. Xiao Fan, curious, swept his divine sense over and occasionally caught some of their words.

Huh?

You really know how to make things up. I didn't even know I had such thoughts.

Xiao Fan was stunned. Holy shit, was this what they called a braindead fan?

"Whatever. I'll keep up the act a bit longer, then end it."

Xiao Fan fought seriously.

Moreover, he hadn't used many techniques—only the power of the Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art. 840 million giant elephants stirred restlessly there, as if sensing a transformation.

The next stage after giant elephants was dragon elephants!

When that time came, it would be another metamorphosis, a complete rebirth!

The Divine Elephant Suppressing Prison Art circulated wildly. His entire body's blood and qi surged like endless river waves.

His complexion was ruddy, full of vigor, exuding might and dominance.

He desperately unleashed the power of the giant elephants. Each strike he threw was like mountains crumbling and earth splitting, howling winds arriving in the blink of an eye, captivating the soul.

A full-power punch landed on Left Wu's body, actually making him wince in pain.

"What kind of freak is this? His physical body is actually stronger than our Wu Tribe's."

Left Wu even trembled slightly. His cultivation was clearly two major realms above, and the Wu Tribe was naturally gifted with powerful bodies, yet he was being suppressed in physical strength by a human!

Moreover, this human seemed to still be growing, not yet having fully developed his body's power. Thinking about how his own Wu Tribe physique had already peaked—the pressure suddenly doubled.

No good. Can't win!

He was already thinking about how to escape.

"Hey, look—why is that person dodging the Holy Son? He doesn't dare fight back."

Some sharp-eyed cultivators noticed the problem.

"Yeah, why is he dodging and not daring to fight?"

"Isn't he a Grand Ascension cultivator? I heard he's also from the Wu Tribe, whose physical bodies are the strongest. The Holy Son clearly isn't using techniques against him, only physical strength. Why is he dodging?"

Inside the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda's range, Xiao Fan chased Left Wu and beat him, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

"Wait—if you hid both their cultivation levels, I'd think the Holy Son was the Grand Ascension cultivator."

The arguments outside also reached inside.

Left Wu heard everything and felt stifled. You people are really blind. Can't you see he's a monster?

The only reason I haven't been beaten to death is because he's showing mercy.

Absolutely ridiculous.

But he didn't dare speak up. If he told the truth, he'd lose even more face.

"Pay attention to the details. Look at the Holy Son—why is his face so flushed?"

Some observant cultivators noticed something was off.

"You've finally noticed what makes the Holy Son different. I'm gratified."

That young man smiled, his perceptive gaze activating once more.

"The Holy Son must be practicing some divine technique, using that Wu Tribe member as a training partner."

"Look—the Holy Son is steady as a mountain, while that Wu Tribe member is retreating step by step."

Some remained skeptical and challenged him: "But didn't you say the Holy Son was challenging his limits? If the Holy Son has the upper hand, how is he challenging his limits?"

"It is his limits—his physical limits!"

"Can't you see? The Holy Son's body is solid as bedrock, his blood and qi like rainbows, his heartbeat like war drums. He's practically a war god incarnate."

"How strong are the Holy Son's techniques? Need I say more? Yet now he's not using a single technique, relying entirely on his physical body. Using his own weakness to attack his own strength."

"Isn't the Wu Tribe supposed to have the strongest physical bodies? He's using what they're most proud of—their bodies—to defeat them! The Holy Son truly understands how to kill both body and spirit."

"At the same time, the Holy Son cultivates both technique and body. After this battle, his physical form will reach a new level. What good is the Wu Tribe's supposedly superior physique? They're still getting demolished by our Holy Son!"

Everyone looked toward the pagoda and found it was indeed as the young man said—in every fist-to-fist collision, Xiao Fan had the clear advantage.

"Can a human's physical body really be this powerful?"

"The Holy Son is this strong. Killing that Wu Tribe member would be effortless. Why compare physical bodies?"

Some cultivators wondered, a thought arising: Was the Holy Son just showing off?

The young man shook his head, revealing a look of disdain.

"You think the Holy Son is just showing off? Your vision is too narrow."

"Think about it. The Holy Son of Supreme Mystery Holy Land, a paragon of the righteous path—is he someone who craves vanity?"

"The Holy Son's heart encompasses all living beings. What he's doing is using what the Wu Tribe is most proud of—their physical bodies—to completely crush them!"

"Think about it. The Wu Tribe is famous for their bodies. If the Holy Son surpasses them in physical strength, even their last shred of dignity will be stripped away!"

"The Holy Son is bringing glory to our human race's body cultivators.

Being naturally strong isn't true strength.

Only through persistent effort and struggle, training your body through toil—that is true strength!"

Just like that, the whole perspective opened up.

Some cultivators wanted to argue back, but these words were so righteous and noble—if they objected, wouldn't they seem like nitpickers?

"The Holy Son's vision is beyond your comprehension. That's perfectly normal!" The young man finished speaking, lightly waving his jade fan, gazing at Xiao Fan in the sky with reverence in his eyes.

Everyone exchanged glances, wanting to refute but finding no grounds.

Someone took the lead, saying:

"I understand now. The Holy Son wants to lead us human cultivators in overcoming our physical weaknesses."

"Exactly. Our human race is known for techniques, but our bodies are weak. Even dedicated body cultivators are just slightly sturdier than regular cultivators."

"The Holy Son is publicly teaching us how to become true body cultivators!"

One call, a hundred responses.

When everyone else is praising, if you don't, do you think you're above it all?

No—you're just attention-seeking. Shameful!

Thus, more and more praise rang out, all saying Xiao Fan was defeating the Wu Tribe at what they were most proud of—their physical bodies.

This would completely shatter their confidence!

Holy shit!

They could even spin it this way?

The power of braindead fans was infinite. What was braindead? Having one's brain wide open—wasn't that braindead?

Xiao Fan was shocked. He was clearly putting on an act, yet these people had brought in the grand cause of the human race.

What nonsense about defeating the enemy at their strongest point to crush them—pure fabrication!

He just wanted to drag out the fight.

"Ridiculous. I thought my acting was bad enough, but I never expected your ability to fill in the gaps to be this strong."

"I feel like if I farted someone to death, you'd spin it into something like 'an immortal's fart is extraordinary!'"

Left Wu felt bitter inside—beaten up and then treated like a monkey for spectators.

Hearing those comments about his physique being inferior to humans, he felt he'd disgraced the entire Wu Tribe.

After acting long enough, Xiao Fan figured it was about time to end it with one strike.

Xiao Fan condensed Nether God Spears again, preparing to turn him into a pincushion and end this performance.

Sensing Xiao Fan's killing intent, Left Wu couldn't take it anymore and fled directly.

But a mere Grand Ascension—how could he escape the lockdown of an Immortal King-grade immortal weapon?

He despaired, finally understanding why he'd sensed danger from the beginning.

He'd thought someone was protecting Xiao Fan. Turns out Xiao Fan himself was the greatest danger.
