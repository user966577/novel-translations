Chapter 141: When It Comes to Women, My Intelligence Goes Max

"You few, go draw their fire. Lure their people away."

Outside Supreme Mystery Holy Land's mountain gates, a group of nine lurked suspiciously, plotting something.

Among them, the cold, beautiful young woman with an impressive figure addressed the other eight in black.

"As you command."

These eight naturally had no objections. They dispersed in different directions.

All eight were no weaklings—all at Earth Immortal realm. Yet they didn't dare underestimate Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

The Divine Son was powerful. Even all eight of them together might not have been able to take him down. Yet within Supreme Mystery Holy Land, he'd been killed with a single sword. This meant Supreme Mystery Holy Land must have powerful killing instruments hidden within.

With this being the orthodox lineage of the Supreme Mystery Holy Land above, even if they pulled out immortal killing techniques, none of them would find it strange.

No direct conflict—wisdom was the way!

With the Divine Maiden's intelligence, wouldn't this be child's play?

Soon, the eight split up. Two to a team, four directions, preparing to attack Supreme Mystery Holy Land.

The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden watched quietly, unmoving.

She wanted to see just how much strength Supreme Mystery Holy Land had hidden.

Before the eight could even act, ten Nether Hounds with ferocious faces, heads crowned with ghostly blue flames, and vicious eyes charged out.

The ten Nether Hounds immediately began barking.

"Woof woof woof woof!"

As if assigning tasks. After a brief exchange, they rushed toward the four directions.

The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden watched, her pupils contracting sharply.

"Are those... Nether Hounds from hell? And their realm isn't low!"

She'd once read in an ancient text descriptions of Nether Hounds—bodies full of death energy, ghostly blue nether flames, entirely black, pupils filled with infinite killing intent.

A perfect match!

"The ancient text recorded that Nether Hounds are fierce beasts of the nether world. Their killing intent is severe. Being touched by those ghostly flames brings bone-searing, heart-burning pain."

"I knew Supreme Mystery Holy Land wouldn't be simple." She rarely smiled, but now there was a hint of having everything figured out.

"Watch my Heaven Mystery Nine Transformations!"

Her body shifted, transforming into a fluttering butterfly. Two colorful wings beat gently.

She flew toward Supreme Mystery Holy Land, entering directly through the main gates.

With her perfected Heaven Mystery Nine Transformations, deceiving these mortals was effortless.

Soon, she entered Supreme Mystery Holy Land. Her divine sense swept lightly, and she quickly located the Holy Son's Mountain.

She moved carefully, beating her wings, flying inconspicuously to the Holy Son's Mountain.

There was nothing special about this Holy Son's Mountain. There weren't even guards—just a small black dog dozing at the door.

And a pure, ethereal woman, untouched by mortal dust and exuding celestial grace, carefully trimming flower branches at the doorway garden with scissors, meticulous and earnest.

The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden was somewhat entranced. A strange feeling arose in her heart—this person was actually as beautiful as her sister.

As if guided by fate, she fluttered her wings and landed on Xinxi's fragrant shoulder, greedily breathing in the scent. Her eyes showed a dreamy smile.

Xinxi smiled and waved her hand, brushing her away. Then she continued trimming the flowers.

"Bad!"

She cursed inwardly, heart racing, her whole body growing hot.

This feeling was wonderful—even more wonderful than being with her sister. She perched quietly on a flower, gazing at Xinxi with a dazed expression.

"Sister, I might be falling in love."

"But rest assured, I'll always be yours. She's just... a rather important passerby in my life. I swear!"

"Hmph, such a beautiful person wasted as a maidservant here. I'm taking her with me."

"Little beauty, wait for me to come out and I'll sweep you off your feet."

She'd made up her mind. Once she had Xiao Fan under control, she'd use him as leverage to exchange for the Wu God Blood and this little beauty.

The Wu Tribe Divine Maiden flew away, looking back three times with each step, reluctantly parting from Xinxi.

After she flew into the palace, Xinxi shook her head helplessly. Another new toy for the Holy Son.

Wangcai lay at the door, sneakily opening one dog eye. The master loved beauties. If I lured that little demoness here, would the master reward me with something?

Time to deploy my Wangcai beauty trap.

Xiao Fan looked at the two scripts in his hand—one purple-gold, one gold—deep in thought.

Was this the benefit of villain points?

Without leaving home, people came from a thousand miles to deliver themselves. And it was a two-for-one deal with sisters.

However, this seemed somewhat difficult. Because the younger sister's gender was female, preference also female.

[Li Yuxian: Golden fate. The older twin sister. Celestial Immortal realm. Extremely indulgent toward her younger sister, treating her like her own child. Very worried about her sister's sexual orientation and has always wanted to straighten her out.

Studied under the Confucian Dao Holy Academy, inherited Confucian Dao teachings. Future's foremost Confucian Dao talented woman. Has entered the Dao through qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting. Will achieve Grand Luo of the Primordial Chaos. Currently receiving a legacy within the Qiankun Painting Scroll. The legacy will end in one quarter-hour.

Loves composing poetry and matching couplets with others. But the immortal realm values strength above all—no one likes literary pursuits. She has nowhere to exchange ideas, can only entertain herself. She's always yearned for a poetry immortal to appear in the immortal realm.]

[With the host's ability to recite Three Hundred Tang Poems for children, casually reciting two would be enough to win her over.]

This Li Yuxian was a talented woman type.

Xiao Fan had never played this kind before. When the time came, he'd give her a line: "On the twenty-fourth bridge, moonlit night, where does the jade lady teach the flute?"

Would she? Possibly.

He continued reading.

[Li Yutong: Purple-gold fate. The younger twin sister. Human Immortal realm.]

Holy crap, am I finally getting to play with immortals today?

At first, Xiao Fan was quite happy. But when he saw that column—

[Li Yutong only likes women. She loves only her sister Li Yuxian. She likes to cuddle with her sister. For her sister, she'd do anything, even die without hesitation.

However, she doesn't like men. She once made a bold declaration to her sister Li Yuxian: if she ever fell into a man's hands and became his plaything, she'd rather die.]

His face immediately stiffened. This was tricky.

The older sister doted on the younger, and he couldn't force the younger—or someone would die.

He did have the power to control both, but for toys, living ones were better. He couldn't exactly say "get them while they're warm," could he?

Xiao Fan reread it, hoping to find some way to crack this.

"Li Yutong would even give her life for her sister..."

"Li Yuxian treats her sister like her own child, extremely doting, wanting to straighten her out..."

"Li Yuxian likes poetry and prose..."

Wait, he seemed to have found an angle!

Use Li Yutong's willingness to die for her sister!

First win over the older sister, then have the older sister act with him. He even had the excuse ready.

I'm doing this for her own good—helping you turn your sister normal. Will you cooperate with me?

Hehehehe... Indeed, when it comes to women, I'm a genius!

Xiao Fan laughed lewdly, extremely lewdly. Finally, was he about to unlock a new achievement?
