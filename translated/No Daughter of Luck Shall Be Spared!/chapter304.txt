Jiang Lanzhi gazed at the man before her, her beautiful eyes brimming with tenderness. No matter what Xiao Fan asked of her, she'd scold him a little—then do exactly as he wished.

She couldn't help it. This man was her one weakness. Seeing his contented smile made everything worthwhile.

Xiao Fan felt the same way. Jiang Lanzhi's unwavering devotion made him cherish her deeply, treating her with a gentleness reserved for her alone.

After their intimate time together, Xiao Fan whispered sweet nothings in Lanzhi's ear, making her laugh until she trembled.

The way Lanzhi looked at him—eyes sparkling like starlight—it was as if he were the most perfect person in the world, beyond all comparison.

Sensing his love for her, Jiang Lanzhi decided not to make things difficult for him.

"Go on—find some time to spend with your other women." Jiang Lanzhi said.

Huh? Xiao Fan thought he'd misheard.

Seeing his bewildered expression, Jiang Lanzhi bit her lip and smiled.

"Husband, you can't be by my side every day. You need to consider the other women's feelings too."

"I'd love to have you all to myself, but they're your women as well. You can't neglect them."

"Knowing that you love me is enough."

These words filled Xiao Fan's heart with gratitude. She was so understanding!

"Lanzhi, thank you for understanding." He held her tightly.

All he could think was that his mother's judgment had been impeccable. Arranging his engagement to Jiang Lanzhi was truly the best decision—she was one of a kind.

Jiang Lanzhi knew she couldn't chain Xiao Fan to her side. Better to be gracious and consider his needs.

The more gentle and considerate she was, the more love he'd give in return.

To gain something, you must first learn to let go.

She'd bet right. Xiao Fan poured into her a love unlike anything he'd given before. No one could replace her position in his heart.

Xiao Fan left Lanzhi to rest and carved out time for Yu Yue and Xinxi.

He'd long since come to see them as partners, not mere servants.

"Young Master, what brings you here?" Xinxi was surprised to see him.

She knew Xiao Fan had gone to be with Jiang Lanzhi.

She also understood that Jiang Lanzhi, as his formally betrothed fiancée, held a special status. It was only natural for him to prioritize her.

She understood. She accepted it.

Just... a small twinge of disappointment.

The time she'd get to spend with the Young Master would only grow shorter from here on.

So seeing him appear before her now was a delightful surprise.

Yu Yue maintained her calm exterior, bowing in greeting and arranging his seat, but the joy in her heart rivaled Xinxi's.

The Young Master hasn't forgotten us!

Xiao Fan smiled. "Lanzhi sent me. Told me to spend more time with you two."

He told them the truth, hoping his women could understand one another and coexist in harmony.

The ideal outcome would be all of them living together under one roof someday.

"I see." Xinxi smiled.

She warmly attended to Xiao Fan, brewing the fragrant tea he'd always loved.

Even though she hadn't made tea for him in ages, her movements were flawlessly practiced.

She must have been keeping up her practice all this time.

Yu Yue, ever perceptive, caught the meaning beneath his words—he wanted them to know that Lanzhi wouldn't steal his care and affection from them.

He hoped they'd all understand each other and avoid jealous infighting that would put him in an impossible position.

Yu Yue said nothing aloud, but she understood perfectly.

It seemed she'd need to have a talk with Ling'er and Xinxi, helping them see the Young Master's good intentions.

Xiao Fan spent over a month with Yu Yue and Xinxi, their laughter and warmth soothing his spirit.

It was deeply comforting.

Zhao Ling'er needed attention most. Her temperament had been sheltered by Yu Yue and Xinxi—she could be playful, a touch willful, and often anxious about losing what she had.

Xiao Fan had to tend to her emotions carefully, which required considerable effort.

But equally, her youthful vivacity and spontaneity brought him a joy that was hard to quantify.

Perhaps that was why men were eternally drawn to the bloom of youth.

Long Ningbing spent Xiao Fan's absence in closed-door cultivation, pushing her strength higher.

She might be far weaker than Xiao Fan, but every ounce of improvement might prove useful to him someday.

With that thought, cultivation never felt dull. She trained with boundless energy and fighting spirit.

Her human form was perfect for practicing immortal arts.

But Xiao Fan preferred her dragon horns and tail, so she kept those draconic features—at the very least, the sight of her should make him smile.

When Xiao Fan appeared before her, Long Ningbing's eyes lit up with surprise, and her slender, delicate dragon tail swayed uncontrollably.

"Young Master, you're here?" She immediately stopped cultivating and rose to greet him.

Xiao Fan smiled. "Afraid you'd be lonely all by yourself. Came to check on you."

Long Ningbing's cheeks flushed. That sounded rather intimate.

Xiao Fan loved her innocent, artless charm. They said dragons were lustful by nature, but Ningbing seemed to be the exception—her pure, wholesome sweetness was something he never tired of.

The two chatted happily, lost in easy conversation.

Within Yaochi Immortal Palace, Xiao Fan's days were peaceful and content.

Outside Yaochi Immortal Palace, war raged without end.

The Heavenly Demon Tribe went on a relentless killing spree against the foreign cultivators.

The Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor in particular fought like a man possessed, personally hunting his targets.

Most of the foreign cultivators were squads of Golden Immortal disciples led by Taiyi Golden Immortal elders.

Against the ordinary factions of the Eternal Immortal Domain, they were a formidable force.

Against a Primordial Chaos Grand Luo existence like the Blood Emperor? They were slightly larger fish.

Whenever intelligence reached the Heavenly Demon Tribe, the Blood Emperor struck personally, wiping them out with terrifying efficiency.

"Incredible—why is killing these foreigners so easy for him?"

"The Blood Emperor is truly powerful. I heard the Yaochi Palace Master carved half his body off last time, and he still hasn't fully healed—yet he's this strong."

"Here's the real question: why won't the Holy Academy's Dean take the field himself? If even the wounded Blood Emperor can manage it, there's no excuse for the Dean."

"Who knows. Maybe in the Academy's eyes, we're not even worth protecting."

The Holy Academy's reputation plummeted. They'd built an alliance, yet accomplished nothing.

The Blood Emperor's name, meanwhile, rose to heroic status. Some even hailed him as a savior.

What a bizarre world.

In the Heavenly Demon Tribe's palace within the Eternal Immortal Domain.

The Blood Emperor sat upon his throne, surveying his court with immense satisfaction.

He drew a gentle breath, and the rich immortal qi of the domain washed over him. The sensation was intoxicating—something he'd never dared dream of before.

"Are there any foreign cultivators left? I feel like they're getting scarcer," he said.

A hint of regret colored his words. Come on, send more.

Those foreigners were loaded. They'd been plundering for ages, and none of the loot had been sent back yet—they carried their entire fortune on them.

Every single one was a walking treasure chest. Each kill yielded an obscene haul.

The thrill of watching gold coins burst from corpses was addictive.

"Your Majesty, the foreign cultivators have gone completely silent. They're nearly extinct. A few stragglers have been found hiding, but they were weak—our forces have already dealt with them."

The Blood Emperor deflated slightly.

No more gold-coin drops?

"Very well. Leave the remaining small fry to our troops."

"As you command."

The Blood Emperor continued issuing orders.

"Everyone, we've come to a new environment. We need new methods to adapt."

"In the past, the Heavenly Demon Tribe lived in barren wastelands and could only cultivate using demonic qi. Demonic qi is violent and savage—one misstep during cultivation, and you lose your mind, becoming a blood-crazed fiend until you die."

"If there were a choice, who would willingly cultivate with demonic qi?"

His ministers nodded in deep agreement.

"Now that we've settled in the Eternal Immortal Domain, we can no longer rely on demonic qi or feed on human flesh. Our people must transition to the Immortal Dao."

A minister spoke up: "Your Majesty, switching to immortal cultivation isn't the issue. But our tribe's immortal techniques are woefully outdated. With such primitive methods, we'll never produce anyone of real consequence."

The Blood Emperor replied, "No matter. I already have a plan. Just follow my instructions."

"As you command."

Of course the Blood Emperor understood that cultivating the Immortal Dao required proper techniques.

And he already knew where to get them.

The Blood Emperor went to Lingyan's residence, where he found his sister looking melancholy and distracted—staring into space.

She'd been like this ever since she returned.

"Lingyan, why so glum? And why do you keep staring in the direction of Yaochi Immortal Palace?" he asked, puzzled.

Lingyan startled, her thoughts caught drifting. She forced herself to calm down and smiled. "I was just wondering how Nana's doing. What her situation is like."

Ah—worried about Nana. That made sense. Nana and Lingyan had always been close; Nana used to follow her around calling her "Auntie" every day.

"Don't worry," the Blood Emperor reassured her. "Nana has fortune on her side. I've already sent more people to search for her. There'll be good news soon."

Lingyan smiled and said nothing.

She knew Nana was fine. She knew exactly what Nana's situation was.

Not great, but certainly not bad either.

"Brother, was there something you needed?" Lingyan asked.

The Blood Emperor laughed awkwardly. "Well, Lingyan... I need to ask you a favor."

Outside, the Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor projected the image of a cold, ruthless tyrant who looked down on all creation.

In the public's imagination, he did whatever he pleased and everyone obeyed without question.

But only his closest family knew the truth: he was extraordinarily good to his own people. He wasn't cruel at all—quite the opposite; he treated them with remarkable warmth.

Especially Nana and Lingyan. If they asked, he'd pluck the very stars from the sky for them.

Lingyan smiled. "Brother, just tell me. No need to be so formal."

Only then did the Blood Emperor speak. "I need your help with something."

"Here's the situation: I want our tribe's youth to learn immortal cultivation techniques."

"Could you go to Yaochi Immortal Palace and speak with the Palace Master? Of course, we won't ask for charity—we're willing to pay. Whether it's buying or trading with treasures, whatever works."

"And if possible, I'd like to send our most talented young demonesses into the Palace to study the Dao. It would strengthen the bond between our two sides."

Lingyan blinked in surprise.

I'm really not close with the Palace Master. Sure, I called her "sister" that one time, but honestly, I'm pretty sure I'm just that man's plaything.

Even Nana was the same.

"Lingyan, is there a problem?" the Blood Emperor asked when she didn't respond.

"Brother, it is a bit difficult. You have no idea what happened when I went to negotiate last time."

The mortification—sharing a bed with Nana, baring everything.

"I know you might face some... indignities," the Blood Emperor pleaded, "but I have no other choice. Everything I do is for the tribe's future."

Lingyan felt his image surface unbidden in her mind. Her body flushed with restless heat.

That, combined with the fact that she'd been gazing toward Yaochi Immortal Palace for days now... Had she truly fallen for him?

Deep down, she realized she actually wanted to go to Yaochi Immortal Palace and see Xiao Fan.

Fine. I just want to check on Nana—see how she's doing. As her aunt, it's perfectly reasonable to look in on her.

"Brother, I understand."

"Thank you, Lingyan."

Lingyan: "We're family. No need for thanks."

The Blood Emperor beamed. Having a sensible, devoted sister—truly, one of life's greatest blessings!
