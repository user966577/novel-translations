Chapter 144: Li Yutong's Messages

"What do you mean?" Xiao Fan asked, bewildered.

"I shouldn't have taken advantage of your vulnerability to have you. I'll take responsibility for you." Li Yuxian said softly.

Crap. In her mind, he was the one who'd been played?

Wait, now he was the vulnerable party? Shouldn't he be standing on the moral high ground, pointing fingers at her?

Eating his fill, wiping her mouth clean, and still claiming the moral victory. This was the first time he'd played such a winning hand. Xiao Fan felt somewhat unaccustomed.

But he still put on an angry expression: "Satisfied now? Even if you have my body, you'll never have my heart."

With that, he pushed Li Yuxian away and regarded her coldly.

Li Yuxian knew she was in the wrong. She didn't refute any of Xiao Fan's accusations. Go ahead, scold me more.

As long as you don't resent me.

No matter how Xiao Fan berated her, she nodded and admitted fault, promising she'd take responsibility for him.

Hiss. Xiao Fan couldn't figure out which step had gone wrong.

After thinking, he said: "What exactly do you see in me?"

Li Yuxian said: "So many things. For instance, your appearance is peerless—more handsome than anyone I've ever seen. You've weathered life's storms, carrying a melancholic beauty. Most importantly, you're brilliantly talented, with depth."

Huh? He'd thought he was the one doing the seducing. Turns out she was throwing herself at him. He fell silent.

Seeing Xiao Fan's silence, Li Yuxian said: "I, Li Yuxian, swear to the heavens—not a word of this is false. In this life, I'll only love you."

Well, this could be considered a fortuitous accident. The process was somewhat convoluted, but the goal was achieved.

"Fine, consider yourself lucky." Xiao Fan was the epitome of getting a bargain and acting smug about it.

Li Yuxian excitedly embraced him, burying her delicate, smooth face against his chest, letting him feel her tenderness—a form of compensation.

With a beauty in his arms, Xiao Fan held her tight. Li Yuxian possessed an intellectual beauty—the very picture of a cultured, well-bred lady.

"Aren't you good at writing poetry?"

"I suppose."

"Won't you write something to commemorate our passionate time together?" Li Yuxian said excitedly.

Though Xiao Fan didn't understand what she was so excited about.

Xiao Fan said: "That wouldn't be appropriate. The poems I write are usually targeted, purposeful, even carrying a bit of critical edge."

"Just write one line." Li Yuxian said coyly, even planting a light kiss on his face.

Not an ounce of restraint.

How could Xiao Fan resist such coquettishness?

He gazed toward the east and saw a river crab divine beast holding up its pincers, watching him coldly.

"This line of poetry might anger the divine beast, so I can only scramble the order. You can piece it together yourself."

"Alright."

Xiao Fan thought carefully, then recited:

"Peach blossom, pistil, golden needle. Pierce through."

"Brows furrowed, dare not. Cry out loud."

Li Yuxian's mind was sharp. She quickly pieced together these word fragments, and soon had the two lines assembled.

The next moment, a crimson blush spread across her face.

"You're awful! Why would you write something like that!" Li Yuxian lightly slapped his chest, face flushed red.

"You wanted a commemoration, so I wrote two lines to commemorate you."

Having seized the moral high ground, Xiao Fan didn't even need to soothe her emotions. Instead, Li Yuxian was the one comforting Xiao Fan. The treatment really was different.

Suddenly, as if remembering something, Li Yuxian hurriedly retrieved the white yang fish from her storage ring—her half of the yin-yang twin fish.

"Oh no, my sister!"

"What's wrong?" Xiao Fan asked, feigning ignorance.

That sister of Li Yuxian's was still trapped in the formation Xiao Fan had prepared, unable to escape.

Not only that—the endless stream of five-element beasts had completely drained her strength. She was utterly exhausted.

Fortunately, Xiao Fan didn't want to kill her, only deplete her stamina. With the goal achieved, the danger was naturally lifted.

Li Yuxian felt apologetic. She believed she'd deceived Xiao Fan, since from their first meeting until now, she'd been using her sister "Li Yutong's" identity as the Wu Tribe Saintess for their intimate exchanges.

"I'll explain everything to you later, alright?" Her gaze was hopeful, her voice soft as water.

"Mm. As long as you don't lie to me." Xiao Fan smiled.

That struck right at her weakness.

Her heart was in chaos. She stared at Xiao Fan, afraid of losing him.

"What's wrong? Didn't you say something happened? Why aren't you checking?" Xiao Fan asked, puzzled.

"I..." After much hesitation, she came clean.

"I'm sorry. Actually, two of us came in, but at the time, I was inside the painting scroll, making you think there was only one person."

"The person you saw was actually my twin sister. I'm sorry I hid this from you. I'm actually her older sister."

"Huh?" Xiao Fan acted "greatly shocked," but quickly calmed down. He sighed:

"Forget it. As long as it's you, that's fine. You didn't deliberately deceive me—I mistook you for her myself."

Xiao Fan expressed understanding.

Li Yuxian had been extremely nervous, fearing Xiao Fan would think she was an imposter. If he actually liked her sister, her position would become very awkward.

Hearing Xiao Fan's words, the weight in her heart lifted.

She channeled spiritual power into the yang fish. From within came a series of feeble, breathless gasps.

Over a hundred messages flew out of the yang fish, leaving Li Yuxian overwhelmed. The messages had come so frequently—had something happened?

She first opened the one from half a month ago. At the time, she'd assumed her sister was just playing pranks and hadn't paid attention. Now she realized something might have actually been wrong.

"Sister, I'm trapped in a formation. Your little sister is dying. Come save me quick."

"Sister, if I'm gone, will you be sad? I love you so much—you must love me too, right? If I died, would you cry for me, sister?"

Xiao Fan frowned as he listened. This not only violated the natural order but also defied human ethics. How hateful.

I must teach her a proper lesson!

Li Yuxian grew anxious and immediately opened the messages from ten days ago.

At that time, the flames of passion between her and Xiao Fan had just ignited. They hadn't paid attention to anything else.

"Waah, sister, why won't you answer me? Did something dangerous happen to you?"

"Sister, did you run into danger like me? You don't want to tell me. You've always protected me like this. I'll definitely break through and come help you."

"Sister, wait for me. I'll definitely break through and save you. Wait for me. *cough*"

"Bang!"

At the end of the message came the sound of magical combat, indicating she was in the middle of a fierce battle.

Li Yuxian was overcome with guilt. Fierce battle? More like enjoyment.

Xiao Fan felt some regret. If only he'd heard this at the time.

She continued opening more—from five days ago, three days ago, all of them.

Li Yutong was still saying: "Sister, your little sister will definitely come save you. Just hold on a bit longer."

"Sister, you absolutely can't let anything happen to you!"

Holy crap. Listening to this, Xiao Fan actually felt somewhat impressed. So this was love?

He had to admit, Li Yutong had something special. Though her orientation was abnormal, her love for Li Yuxian was absolutely genuine.

That line about being willing to give her life—truly demonstrated.

Li Yuxian felt more guilty the more she heard. She'd been indulging in carnal pleasures, forgetting all about her sister. She was worse than an animal!

"Xiao Fan, my sister's in danger. Can you save her?" Li Yuxian said urgently, tears welling in her eyes.

This pagoda was Xiao Fan's. He could capture people, so surely he could control it too?

But Xiao Fan shook his head: "This pagoda is something I picked up from a secret realm. I can only use it to capture people—I can't fully master or refine it."

Of course he couldn't say everything was under control. Otherwise, how would he deceive her?

Li Yuxian didn't doubt him. This treasure's grade was higher than anything she'd ever seen. With Xiao Fan's strength, fully controlling it would be impossible.

Being able to use it against enemies was already an incredible stroke of fortune.

"What do we do? No, I have to go save her."

Li Yuxian panicked. Though her sister harbored improper thoughts toward her, she was still the person she doted on most. She couldn't watch her sister be in danger.

Xiao Fan said: "I'm more familiar with the pagoda. I'll go with you."

Li Yuxian didn't think twice. Her mind was entirely focused on rescuing her sister—nothing else could happen.

Following the path she'd come, Li Yuxian headed back. Using the yin-yang fish's connection, she located Li Yutong.

By now, Li Yutong had fainted. Her body was covered in dust and her clothes were tattered—clear signs of a grueling battle.

With a thought, Xiao Fan withdrew the formation, letting Li Yuxian rescue Li Yutong and bring her back to the thatched cottage to recuperate.

Of course, beforehand, Li Yuxian cleaned away all traces of their time together and eliminated the mingled scents of Xiao Fan and herself. She knew her sister wouldn't allow her to have a man.

Xiao Fan wasn't about to let Li Yuxian have her way. With a tender, caressing gesture, he brushed aside a strand of hair that had fallen across Li Yuxian's forehead, tucking it behind her ear, telling her everything would be fine.

And when she wasn't paying attention, he tucked a certain curly hair among Li Yuxian's silken locks.

Cleaned away the traces? I'll put you in an impossible position!

Li Yuxian's weary heart found something to lean on. She rested quietly against Xiao Fan's chest and said: "Thank you. Having you is wonderful."
