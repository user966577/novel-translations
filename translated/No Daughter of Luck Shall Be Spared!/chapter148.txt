Chapter 148: Dragon Girl Long Ningbing

Returning to the palace, Xiao Fan took out the Myriad Dragon Nest and placed the slumbering dragon girl on a jade couch.

The dragon girl had a graceful figure. If he remembered correctly, Long Aotian had mentioned that she'd suffered a divine soul injury at age eighteen, forcing her into a thirty-thousand-year slumber within the Myriad Dragon Nest.

Rounding off, the thirty thousand years didn't count. This dragon girl was eighteen!

The dragon girl was tall with slender, elegant legs. That cyan dress couldn't hide her alluring form.

Xinxi stood nearby, watching quietly.

The dragon girl's aura was very weak yet stable—giving the impression of someone clinging to their last breath.

A pair of verdant, lustrous dragon horns adorned her head like spring bamboo shoots. They carried that tender, fresh quality—greenish-white, rounded rather than sharp.

Looking at these art-like dragon horns, Xiao Fan couldn't resist touching them.

Though covered in fine golden fuzz, they were delicate and soft. Rather than prickly, they felt smooth as jade, like warm silk.

Nice texture. Xiao Fan kept touching for a while longer.

Xinxi's expression changed. She raised her hand, wanting to stop him.

But then again, perhaps there was no need. Given the Holy Son's personality, he definitely wouldn't let this dragon girl go.

"Hm? Are these dragon horns fake? Why does the fuzz fall off when I touch it? But after the golden fuzz falls, the horns look even more greenish-white and prettier."

"How'd it stick to my hand? I didn't agree to this—the golden fuzz is drilling into my hand, entering my body?"

Xiao Fan was somewhat puzzled. In a daze, he felt a strange mental connection forming with this dragon girl. He turned his head, looking questioningly at Xinxi.

Xinxi naturally understood his meaning. She explained:

"Holy Son, female dragons' horns cannot be touched casually. That fuzz is equivalent to a human woman's chastity.

A female dragon's horns cannot be touched even by her parents. When you touched them, Holy Son, you essentially claimed the dragon girl's chastity."

Xiao Fan's face was full of question marks.

I wasn't even ready, and I've already done the deed? Is this reasonable?

No way. I, Xiao Fan, refuse to acknowledge this custom!

"Even if you don't acknowledge it, Holy Son, it doesn't matter. That golden fuzz has entered your body. You should be able to feel the mental connection with her."

Xinxi had come to terms with it.

Women came and went around the Holy Son. The only one who stayed by his side was her! She was the Holy Son's most devoted woman!

"No. I won't allow this to happen!"

"Yin-Yang Reversal!"

This was a technique Xiao Fan had obtained before. It had even restored Lan Yuhong's essence—this should work too!

He activated the technique. Instantly, behind him appeared a pattern of two fish—one black, one white, yin and yang—rotating clockwise.

A mysterious aura emanated from Xiao Fan. Within a hundred-zhang radius around him, everything seemed to freeze, becoming incredibly solid.

The two fish did the same.

The next moment, the yin-yang fish stopped rotating and began turning counterclockwise.

Outside the door, falling leaves suddenly reversed their descent, flying back to the branches without error, rejoining where they'd separated.

Flower buds that had just bloomed seemed to shyly retreat after glimpsing the colorful outside world, closing up once more.

Time reversal!

Xinxi wasn't affected. She simply marveled at the Holy Son's formidable talent and impressive techniques.

It was just that the applications always seemed... strange. Why was it always used for such peculiar purposes?

Or was this precisely what he cultivated for?

The golden fuzz that had entered his body reappeared on his palm, detaching and flying back to those greenish-white dragon horns one strand at a time, as if nothing had happened.

However, that feeling of mental connection didn't fade.

Xiao Fan thought something might be wrong with his technique.

"Strange. Why is the connection still there?"

"This is a connection that's been confirmed through hundreds of millions of years and countless dragon generations. The Holy Son's strength isn't sufficient yet—he can only deceive himself, not sever the connection." Xinxi said softly.

Deceive himself...

Xinxi, you're really getting better at talking.

Xiao Fan poured out a pill, parted her pale red, warm lips, and fed it to her, using spiritual power to help with refinement.

The medicinal power instantly spread, permeating her limbs and flowing through her entire body.

The dragon girl's upturned lashes trembled slightly. Her slender cyan dragon tail also swayed gently like a willow branch in the breeze.

Her divine soul aura grew stronger. Her complexion became increasingly rosy.

Xiao Fan released his grip and stood up to observe. When would she wake?

However, as her divine soul strengthened, her body also radiated extremely powerful yin-cold energy. Frost appeared within ten feet of the jade couch. Her face was covered with frost, pale as snow—like an ice beauty.

Feeling the chill, Xiao Fan took two steps back.

Xinxi merely pointed with a jade finger. A beam of white light shot into the dragon girl's heart.

Soon, the frost vanished. The rime melted into water vapor. Everything returned to normal.

"Right. Long Aotian said his sister was born with a Pure Yin Azure Dragon Body. As a child, she couldn't control it and needed supreme yang treasures to suppress the pure yin energy. After her divine soul was injured and the yang treasure was lost, she ended up like this."

Xiao Fan recalled Long Aotian's words and instantly understood the situation.

"Xinxi, is there any way to solve this?"

"Yes. Destroy her constitution."

"Uh, never mind then."

Xiao Fan figured that if even the Ancestral Dragon's own daughter needed supreme yang treasures for suppression, it meant the Ancestral Dragon had no way to cure it either.

Either she needed constant suppression and someone by her side at all times, or the constitution was too powerful and could only be balanced through yin-yang harmony.

Before she relied on a treasure. Now she relies on me, Xiao Fan! Is this fate? I'm most skilled at the Dao of Yin and Yang.

While he was lost in thought, the dragon girl's soft, tender eyes slowly opened, somewhat dazed.

"Where is this? I remember I was attacked, and then..."

The dragon girl sat up and looked around, discovering a man and a woman watching her curiously.

The man was handsome, even radiating righteous vital energy. Moreover, when she looked at him, why did she feel a sense of familiarity in her heart, as if their minds were connected?

Could it be... Her divine sense swept out and found her dragon horns intact. Only then did she breathe a sigh of relief.

The woman had her hands clasped together, resting quietly at her lower abdomen, standing silently behind the man. She must be his maidservant.

"Did you save me?" The dragon girl smiled at Xiao Fan. Why did talking to him feel so familiar?

"Yes. I went through tremendous hardship to rescue you, then endured countless trials to gather all the precious medicines to revive you."

Looking into Xiao Fan's gentle gaze, she couldn't help but lower her eyes bashfully. A rosy tint rose on her pretty face. She felt somewhat shy.

Xiao Fan saw her complexion was healthy and rosy. He simply nodded: "Looks like you've recovered well. Good color."

"Thank you." She said softly, without any hint of a spoiled temperament.

Xiao Fan appreciated this. He most detested disobedient and ungentle women.

"Um, sir, where is my younger brother?"

The dragon girl asked, "He should have come out with me. If you found me, you should be able to find him too, right?"

"Don't worry. He's doing well at my place."

"Thank you for saving us, sir." She said softly.

They chatted for a while longer. Xiao Fan learned from the conversation that the dragon girl's name was Long Ningbing. However, she concealed her origins, only saying she came from beyond this world.

Little did she know, even without her saying anything, Xiao Fan already knew her background. Not telling him was fine.

Xiao Fan figured it was time to cultivate and prepare for his immortal ascension tribulation.

As for the dragon girl Long Ningbing—he'd let her be for now.

Xiao Fan and Xinxi left. They didn't say much more, only told her to rest well and speak up if she needed anything.

Long Ningbing nodded in thanks.

Watching Xiao Fan and Xinxi's departing figures, a flash of surprise crossed Long Ningbing's eyes.

"The clan elders always said humans are treacherous and cunning. But these two seem quite nice. Especially Sir Xiao—he's more gentle and handsome than any man I've ever met."

Thinking of her eye contact with Xiao Fan, his gentle gaze flooded her mind.

"Could this be the legendary love at first sight? If it's with Sir Xiao... it might not be bad."

This thought mysteriously arose in her heart. But she quickly dismissed it.

"What am I thinking? He saved me, and I'm lusting after him? I... sigh."

She thought this attraction was the mental connection. She never imagined Xiao Fan had performed a self-deceiving repair procedure on her.

After all, no matter how clever she was, she'd never imagine such a thing could be reversed.

Walking out of the palace, bright sunlight illuminated Long Ningbing completely. Her pair of dragon horns glittered brilliantly.

Her complexion improved. She lifted her head to the sky, her fair face tinged with pale pink, wearing a faint smile. Her slender dragon tail swayed left and right, full of spirit—the joy of someone reborn.

"So this is the mortal realm? Aside from lacking immortal energy, the scenery isn't bad."

"Hm? Why is there a skinny dog here?"

Long Ningbing noticed Wangcai, the small black dog sunbathing in the bright sunshine, and grew curious.

"How strange. Such a small skinny dog, yet my instincts tell me it's incredibly powerful?"

Long Ningbing walked over, crouched down, and poked the dog's head with a jade finger. The head bobbed back and forth like a lucky cat figurine.

Wangcai was utterly speechless. He was a dignified True Immortal-level Nether Hound, reduced to being a guard dog—and now these people kept playing with him?

Did he have no dignity? Furious and indignant! This dog's life couldn't go on!

He barked twice, baring his fangs, eyes glinting fiercely: Don't mess with me!

Then turned his head and went back to sleep.

Long Ningbing found this interesting. Quite a fierce little dog?

She grabbed Wangcai by the scruff of his neck. Wangcai couldn't do anything about her—any woman coming out of the master's room was a mistress. How could he dare resist?

He could only accept his fate, sticking out his tongue and wagging his tail—a completely different dog from moments ago.

Long Ningbing found it strange. He'd been so fierce just now—why was he wagging his tail begging now? Could this be a mad dog?

Startled, she immediately let go of Wangcai. But even when putting him down, her movements were gentle—as if gentleness was carved into her bones.

Long Ningbing was curious about everything around her. She examined the flowers and plants in the flower beds with great interest. Sometimes she'd turn away, finding it boring. Then she'd water the flowers and plants.

That was one thing. But on the ground, a colony of ants was relocating. She crouched down and watched quietly—for over six hours.

During that time, she even found some twigs and placed them on the ants' path, wanting to see how they'd solve the problem.

Xiao Fan concealed himself, quietly watching from the side. This was supposed to be an eighteen-year-old dragon girl?

Did she even have the mind of an eight-year-old?
