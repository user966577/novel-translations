"Actually, it's not entirely out of the question." Xiao Fan suddenly reversed course.

Lingyan's eyes brightened with surprise. She couldn't understand why he'd say this.

But if there was a chance, she had to seize it.

"Please, Young Master—do tell."

Xiao Fan walked over and sat down beside her, close enough that their bodies were nearly touching.

He slowly leaned in, resting his head against her shoulder.

Eyes closed, he breathed in her intoxicating fragrance, his warm breath falling against her ear. Lingyan froze, completely flustered.

She wasn't naive. Such intimate proximity made it impossible not to let her mind wander.

He's not going to ask for that kind of payment, is he?

Devastatingly handsome, overwhelmingly powerful—it wasn't as if the idea was completely unthinkable.

Lingyan trembled. His heated breath on her ear sent her pulse racing, her cheeks flushing, her throat going dry.

But Xiao Fan went no further. He stopped right at the edge.

He pulled away from Lingyan and resumed his composed demeanor, as if nothing had happened.

This push-and-pull left Lingyan completely unable to read him.

That was exactly the effect Xiao Fan wanted. He smiled.

"Everything has a price. If you can offer something that satisfies me, I'd give you the better half of the Eternal Immortal Domain without a second thought."

"If you truly please me, forget half a domain—I could hand you an entire one."

As he spoke, Xiao Fan casually released his aura. Just the presence of his Primordial Chaos Grand Luo realm was enough to leave Lingyan stunned.

Impossible—this Primordial Chaos Grand Luo aura was far too powerful!

Her brother, the Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor, wasn't in the same league. The word "overwhelming" barely sufficed.

Xiao Fan lightly touched the space in front of Lingyan's eyes.

The entire plane of space rippled like a still lake struck by a pebble, circles spreading outward.

Those ripples expanded without end until they became monstrous waves. Hundreds of millions of miles away, the starry void silently collapsed.

Brilliant galaxies flared like fireworks, blazing with dazzling light—only to be extinguished the very next instant.

If it were merely destructive force, Lingyan would simply think Xiao Fan was strong.

But in the next breath, snowflakes began to drift through that annihilated expanse—white specks floating gently.

As they swirled and danced, the obliterated stars recongealed and reformed, restored as if nothing had happened.

Lingyan's eyes went wide.

Destruction. Creation. Rebirth—all accomplished between heartbeats. Even her brother, the Heavenly Demon Blood Emperor, couldn't do anything remotely close.

No—this was beyond her understanding entirely.

Now she understood why this young man could so casually say "giving you half an immortal domain is no problem."

He'd been heavy-handed with threats before. Time for something different this time.

Make her come to him.

"How would you say my power compares to the Blood Emperor's?"

Lingyan's expression turned reverent. "Young Master," she said softly, "I'm afraid my brother wouldn't even have the chance to run if he faced you."

"Oh? Really?" Xiao Fan smiled.

Lingyan sighed and nodded. "Really."

Alongside her awe, she was uncertain.

What had that earlier gesture meant? And those words—what was he really after?

Was he interested in that sort of arrangement, or wasn't he?

She didn't fear giving herself. As a princess of the Heavenly Demon Tribe, her priority was the tribe's interests—how to ensure their survival and prosperity.

Just as she was wrestling with the question, Xiao Fan circled behind her, one hand around her waist and the other lifting a strand of her dark hair, which he brought to his nose.

Lingyan went rigid. Her calm breathing turned rapid.

Her cheeks burned crimson, and her clenched fists grew damp with perfumed sweat.

"Young Master, please... please behave," she managed, her voice tight.

Lingyan's body fought against the sensation even as her mind raced. She simply could not get a read on his intentions.

He seemed to want her, yet he didn't. He toyed with her emotions like a master playing a game.

Her resistance, however, was utterly futile in Xiao Fan's arms—more like coquetry than defiance.

He rested his chin on her shoulder, his cheek brushing hers.

Lingyan felt suffocated. The searing warmth left her restless and agitated.

"I can grant the Heavenly Demon Tribe a foothold in the Eternal Immortal Domain. I can even make them the second-greatest power here, surpassed only by Yaochi Immortal Palace."

"But before that happens, shouldn't you offer something that pleases me?"

He whispered against her ear, arms locked around her waist.

Feeling particularly bold, Xiao Fan gently nipped the jade-soft, water-smooth lobe of her ear.

Lingyan couldn't withstand this kind of intimate torment. Her body blazed hotter and hotter, as if ten thousand ants were gnawing at her heart.

An unbearable itch—she desperately needed it to stop.

"Young Master, what you want... Lingyan can give it to you."

"But you must keep your word."

Even teetering on the brink, she clung to his promise. The Heavenly Demon Tribe's interests came first, always.

Xiao Fan smiled and pressed a light kiss to her cheek. "Of course. I never lie to women."

With his assurance secured, Lingyan's rigid body went boneless. She exhaled fragrant warmth, her violet pupils growing hazy and unfocused.

Desire surged through her. Her perfect human form slipped as two curved, rounded horns sprouted through the dark hair at her temples.

Like bamboo shoots pushing through spring soil—tender, budding, fresh.

The same pure-temptation holy-demonic aura as Nana radiated from her completely.

Her pliant body sank into Xiao Fan's arms, her back pressed flush against his chest through the thin violet silk.

She tilted her head back, exhaling an exotic, fragrant wind into his ear. The breath of spring.

Xiao Fan lifted Lingyan into his arms, straightened her, and whispered, "Your enthusiasm determines how much support I give."

"Show me just how far your enthusiasm goes."

He cradled her devastating face in his hands and kissed those cherry-red lips, tasting nectar and ambrosia.

Lingyan's jaw clenched shut, but she yielded almost immediately—then took the initiative, wrapping her arms around his waist, responding with awkward, inexperienced passion.

She didn't know what she was doing. All she could manage was to tentatively offer her tongue, presenting herself for him to take.

A long moment later, Xiao Fan pulled back with obvious reluctance. Between them, a curved, translucent thread hung like an unbroken bond.

"That's enough. I won't force you."

"You can still back out. But this is your one and only chance—once you do, there won't be another."

Lingyan's breathing was ragged, her sculpted nose flaring. Eyes swimming with desire, she stared at the handsome young man before her, silently reminding herself: This is all for the Heavenly Demon Tribe. Everything I do is for the tribe's future.

She pushed Xiao Fan down onto the palace floor, palms braced against his chest, eyes ablaze with a fire that could consume him whole.

"I... I'll make sure you're satisfied."

Her hands trembled as they moved to her midriff. She squeezed her eyes shut and slowly tugged at the silk sash around her waist.

An inch. Two inches. The sash came free with a soft whisper.

Summoning every ounce of courage she possessed, the purple gown slipped from her shoulders, and through layers of mist, the breathtaking truth of her was revealed.

Xiao Fan savored every moment—her unpolished movements, her crimson face, the way she threw everything into pleasing him. It was irresistible.

Good. Give it your all.

Lingyan composed herself, acutely aware of his burning gaze. She turned her face away, unable to meet his eyes.

Guided by instinct, she placed her hands at his waist and fumbled for what felt like an eternity, struggling to undo what needed undoing.

Xiao Fan said sternly, "It seems you're still not ready."

Lingyan panicked. "Young Master, I just need a moment to adjust."

"I'll have it in just a second."

She poured every last ounce of her strength into those words, repeating to herself over and over: This is just a transaction. I'm not doing this willingly.

Before she knew it, she found the courage to look him in the eye and swiftly accomplished her task.

Seeing she was ready, Xiao Fan rose, gathered Lingyan into his arms, and kissed her cherry lips.

365x time acceleration—activated!

Lingyan braved through her inexperience. A muffled cry of pain escaped her lips, sweat beading on her face as a flash of anguish crossed her features.

Petals of crimson bloomed.

Xiao Fan lifted her and carried her into the Five Elements Exquisite Pagoda.

"Nana? What are you doing here?"

Lingyan was stunned. More importantly, she was mortified that Nana was seeing her in this state.

Nana was equally shocked. "Auntie, you too...?"

Lingyan took in her surroundings—and that telling word "too"—and understood enough to piece things together.

The embarrassment was overwhelming.

Xiao Fan waved a hand, pulling Nana closer.

Looking at these two beauties who could pass for sisters, he grinned. "Oh, you two know each other? Even better."
