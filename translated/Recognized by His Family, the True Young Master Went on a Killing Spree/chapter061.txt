Chapter 61: Qin Weiye's Plan

Qin Li sneered. "Let me guess—I'm supposed to be crippled and begging on the streets, right?"

Qin Xue said nothing. A chill was spreading through her body.

If Qin Li was fine, what was Qin Weiye really up to?

He'd tricked her mother into remarrying him. Could his real objective be—

"You're the smartest one in the family, Big Sis. Even smarter than me. I'm guessing you've already figured it out."

"Father wants the Jiang family's fortune."

"Bingo. See? Knew you were clever." Qin Li's grin widened. "Dad couldn't have pulled it off without faking my injuries. How else would your mother have fallen for it? How else would they have gotten back together?"

Qin Xue's voice rose. "Even so, Mother would never hand the Jiang family's assets to Qin Weiye."

"She wouldn't. But what if every member of the Jiang family were dead? And you all disappeared? Then Dad, as the family's son-in-law, inherits everything."

Qin Xue went cold all over.

Qin Weiye had truly lost his mind.

"The Qin family would never let someone like him become patriarch."

"The Jiang family can die. Why not the Qin family?" Qin Li said cheerfully. "The moment Dad was acknowledged as a Qin by blood, the outcome was sealed."

"You're both insane."

"Anyway," Qin Li continued, "we brought you here to start the process. Your mother and your sister are next. Then those two stubborn old fools. They'll all be joining you."

His grin turned feral.

Qin Xue's face was ashen.

She looked at this boy—the one she'd once treated like a real brother—and found nothing but malice.

"I regret it," she whispered. "Because of you, I mistreated my own brother. I was a fool."

"You really were. I'll never understand people like you—lavishing love on a stranger's child while ignoring your own flesh and blood. Do you know how hilarious I found it? How smug it made me?"

Qin Xue's face was white as paper. Guilt toward Qin Yang swelled inside her.

"Too late for regrets. You'll never earn Qin Yang's forgiveness now."

"You bastard."

Qin Li shrugged. "So what? Bastards are the ones who thrive in this world."

"Qin Yang will come for you. My brother will avenge me."

"Maybe. But he'll never know what happened. He'll think it was an accident."

He threw back his head and laughed. His men joined in.

One of them—a hardened, brutal-looking man in his forties—cut in impatiently. "Enough talking. Kill her."

Even Qin Li felt uneasy around this man. His father had recruited these people from somewhere, and every one of them radiated menace—cold-eyed killers, the lot of them.

"Go ahead," Qin Li said.

The man approached Qin Xue, dagger in hand, reaching for her throat.

Then a voice, light and amused, broke the silence.

"Well, what a coincidence. Fancy meeting you all here."

"Who's there?!"

Qin Li and his men spun around.

The knife-wielding man's blood ran cold. Someone had gotten this close without him sensing a thing.

Qin Yang sauntered into view.

Qin Xue's eyes went wide—first with shock, then with terror.

"Qin Yang, run! They'll kill you!"

She was genuinely afraid for him.

Qin Yang smiled. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "See, you're making this really awkward. I wasn't planning on rescuing you, but after that little display of concern, I can't exactly walk away."

Qin Xue stared in bewilderment.

She could feel his confidence—total and unshakeable. He didn't consider these men a threat at all.

The leader made a gesture. Several thugs moved to intercept, each radiating dangerous energy. Their eyes were cold and empty, regarding Qin Yang as though he were already dead.

As they closed in, they drew knives and lunged.

Qin Xue screamed.

Qin Yang swatted them aside—open-palmed slaps, one per man—and they flew like ragdolls. Every one hit the ground and didn't get back up.

The last one had his skull caved in by a single blow. Bone, blood, and brain matter painted the floor.

Qin Li nearly vomited.

He stared at Qin Yang in abject horror. The man had killed without a moment's hesitation.

Qin Xue was equally stunned. She realized now that back at the Qin family estate, Qin Yang had been exercising enormous restraint.

If he'd fought like this then, not a single member of the Qin family would have survived.

The leader recognized the danger. He pressed his dagger against Qin Xue's throat. "Don't come any closer. One more step and she dies."

Qin Yang looked entirely unbothered. "Go ahead. She hasn't exactly been nice to me. Kill her if you want."

The man faltered.

He glanced at Qin Li, who confirmed it with a nod. "He's telling the truth."

The man swore.

He abandoned Qin Xue and charged at Qin Yang, dagger aimed at his heart. But the real attack was below—a vicious kick aimed at the groin, the kind of dirty move designed to end a fight.

Qin Yang caught the blade in one hand and kicked out.

*Crack.*

The man's leg snapped. He collapsed.

Qin Yang wrenched the dagger away and drove it straight through the man's arm, pinning it to the marble floor.

The man screamed, nearly blacking out from the pain.
