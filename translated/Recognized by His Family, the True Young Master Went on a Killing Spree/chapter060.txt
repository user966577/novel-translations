Chapter 60: Qin Xue Gets Captured

Zhang Xin conducted his examination thoroughly.

His grandmaster had already confirmed the poison was gone, but since they'd come to him, he wouldn't cut corners.

"The toxins have been completely eliminated. You're clean."

Relief flooded the room.

"Wonderful!" Su Zhongtian exclaimed.

Old Master Su turned to Zhang Xin. "We didn't doubt Qin Yang. But when lives are at stake, we had to be sure. I hope you understand."

Zhang Xin's expression was contemptuous. "Save it. I told you—after today, we're done. I will never treat the Su family again."

Old Master Su's heart sank.

Alienating Zhang Xin was no small matter. If the celebrated practitioner decided to work against them, the Su family would feel it.

And that wasn't even considering Zhang Xin's master—the Needle Saint, one of the country's foremost medical authorities.

Old Master Su tried to smooth things over, but Zhang Xin cut him off with a curt farewell and left.

Watching him go, Old Master Su sighed. He knew he'd burned that bridge for good.

"Ungrateful bastard," Su Yulong muttered.

He didn't think much of Zhang Xin—just some doctor with good hands. Nothing special. Who was he to act high and mighty?

Old Master Su silenced him. "Shut your mouth. You have no idea what a physician of Zhang Xin's caliber represents."

Su Yulong grumbled. "He's a doctor. So what?"

"His connections are beyond anything you can imagine," Old Master Su said coldly. "Countless wealthy families and noble clans treat top physicians with the utmost respect. One word from Zhang Xin to any of them, and they'd happily make trouble for us as a favor. A single phone call could have the Su family drowning in problems."

"That can't be true."

"It is. And if Nuanyue were here, she wouldn't need to ask such an ignorant question. That's exactly why I gave her the family—and not any of you."

The implication was clear: they weren't capable enough. Weren't sharp enough.

The Su family in their hands would be devoured alive.

"Grandfather, I'm not necessarily worse than Su Nuanyue," Su Yulong protested.

"Enough. All of you, get out." Qin Yang's patience had run dry.

Only then did the Su family realize they were still in Su Nuanyue's home.

"Even if you're Nuanyue's fiancé, you're still an outsider," Su Yulong shot back. "We're the real family. You don't have the right to kick us out."

Qin Yang fixed him with an icy stare. "Who's family and who's an outsider—you don't get to decide. Only Nuanyue does. And who do you think she'd choose?"

Su Yulong flinched.

Even at his most delusional, he knew the answer.

"Leave. Before I have you thrown out."

Qin Yang was done playing nice. They were Su Nuanyue's relatives in name, but they'd never treated her like family.

He saw no reason for courtesy.

The group departed reluctantly, spurred on by the security guards eyeing them with undisguised eagerness—clearly waiting for the signal.

Nobody wanted to be the one who got literally tossed out.

Outside, Su Yulong was still fuming. "Are we just going to take this?"

"What do you want to do?" Su Zhongtian asked.

"I'll find someone to teach that Qin Yang a lesson. He's gone too far."

"Find who?" Su Zhongtian shot back. "Ye Longfei—the underground king of South City—is Qin Yang's sworn brother. Who exactly are you going to hire?"

Old Master Su fixed Su Yulong with a piercing stare. "Drop it. You can't afford to provoke Nuanyue or Qin Yang. Don't get yourself killed."

Killed? That serious?

He just wanted to rough Qin Yang up a bit. But hearing his grandfather's tone, the consequences seemed far worse than he'd imagined.

"Let's go home," Old Master Su said. "And stop scheming about the family fortune. Nuanyue won't let any of you go without."

He got in the car.

Su Yulong followed, still resentful. But he wasn't ready to give up.

As for Su Qiang—she'd been delivered to the authorities by Ye Longfei. Under normal circumstances, she'd be behind bars for a very long time.

Qin Yang went to pick up Ji Doudou.

She was about to finish her livestream.

As he drove, he suddenly sensed a familiar aura.

His instincts fired. He swung the car around and followed another vehicle.

It stopped at an estate on the outskirts of the city. Several men carried a woman out of the car.

Qin Xue. He knew it.

But she looked wrong—eyes shut, completely limp. She'd been drugged.

They put her in a wheelchair and pushed her inside.

"Qin Li's aura."

Another familiar presence. Qin Li was here too.

What was he doing?

Qin Yang's mind raced. Then he vaulted over the wall.

Inside, Qin Xue sat slumped in the wheelchair. A bucket of cold water was thrown in her face.

She jolted awake, disoriented. When she registered her surroundings, she shuddered.

"Hey, Big Sis. Long time no see."

That voice made her blood run cold.

Qin Li. Standing before her, dripping with arrogance and contempt.

Fear gripped her, but she forced herself to ask, "Qin Li, what are you doing? Why did you bring me here? Aren't you supposed to be—"

She stopped herself.

According to Qin Weiye, Qin Li had been crippled and left on the streets to beg.

But here he stood, perfectly fine.

Qin Weiye had lied to them. Again.
