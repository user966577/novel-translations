Chapter 56: You Still Have Us

Qin Yang froze.

He'd expected Su Nuanyue to be at least a little upset.

What he'd done back there had been extreme—threatening her entire family's lives to force their hand.

But seeing her reaction, he breathed a sigh of relief.

Thank god she could see things clearly.

"You think I'd be angry about what you did?" she asked, amused.

Qin Yang nodded.

"Why would I be angry? You did it for me. They were the ones who went too far—my aunt tried to kill me, and they still wouldn't punish her. Why should I feel bad for them?"

Her expression turned cold. "If it weren't for you, I'd have ended up crippled. Did any of them ever consider that?"

Qin Yang patted her shoulder. She was right.

That was exactly why he refused to let Su Qiang off the hook.

What Su Qiang had done was beyond despicable—targeting her own niece, trying to kill her. Only someone like Su Qiang could do something that monstrous.

Leaving a person like that free was a direct threat to Su Nuanyue.

She had to be locked away. If she weren't Su Nuanyue's aunt, Qin Yang would have killed her outright. That would have been the cleanest solution.

The only reason Su Qiang was still breathing was a thin thread of familial connection.

"They won't punish Su Qiang because in their hearts, she matters more than I do. To them, I'm just the enemy." Su Nuanyue laughed bitterly.

"Your grandfather treats you fairly well," Qin Yang offered.

Su Nuanyue scoffed.

"I know exactly how my grandfather feels about me. He didn't hand me control of the Su family because he loves me—it's because nobody else in the family is capable. Give me the reins, and they all get to live comfortably. Give it to anyone else, and the whole empire crumbles within years."

That tracked perfectly. Su Nuanyue was the only one with the ability to keep the Su family afloat—and grow it further.

"His real favorites are his own sons and daughters, and his grandsons. Granddaughters? In his eyes, we're just tools."

Qin Yang didn't know what to say. He could only pat her shoulder again.

They had that in common—neither was treated well by the family that should have loved them most.

If anything, not being actively harmed by their families already counted as good treatment.

They were truly kindred spirits in misfortune.

"It's fine. I figured it out a long time ago." Su Nuanyue lifted her chin with quiet pride. "The strong stand on their own. There's no point begging for other people's affection. As long as I live better than all of them, that's enough."

She had a point, but there was something bittersweet about it that tugged at Qin Yang's heart.

"Besides, I have Du Li, and I have you. That's more than enough. Compared to that, the rest of them don't matter."

Qin Yang smiled.

He reached over and gently stroked her hair. "You're right. You still have us."

"Come on. Let's wait for them to come crawling."

His smile widened. Working with someone smart was a genuine pleasure. He didn't even need to explain—she already knew exactly what he was thinking.

He'd never intended to refuse treatment. Just like Su Nuanyue said: let them come crawling.

The two returned home.

"Wait—how am I poisoned?" Su Nuanyue suddenly asked.

Qin Yang smiled. "You're not."

Her eyes went wide.

Then it clicked.

If everyone else was poisoned but she wasn't, Su Qiang would have shifted the blame onto her. That would have muddied everything.

But by claiming Su Nuanyue was also poisoned, even if Su Qiang tried to deflect, she couldn't. The moment she pointed out that Su Nuanyue wasn't affected, she'd be confirming her own guilt.

Either way, Su Qiang was cornered.

Du Li looked confused. "What poisoning?"

Su Nuanyue filled her in.

Du Li's eyes blazed. "Those animals! Su Qiang did all that to you, and they still wouldn't punish her? I want to beat every last one of them to death."

Seeing Du Li's fury, Su Nuanyue couldn't help but laugh.

It wasn't that nobody cared about her, was it?

At least Du Li and Qin Yang did.

Just then, Su Zhonghai was wheeled in, looking sheepish.

"Du Li, don't lump me in with the rest of them," he said quickly. "I'm furious too. I already told them they have to punish that animal Su Qiang."

He gritted his teeth.

Du Li didn't hold back. "You haven't been great to Miss either."

Su Zhonghai couldn't argue with that.

"I know," he said, voice heavy. "So I'm changing. From now on, Nuanyue is my most beloved daughter. Anyone who dares bully her will answer to me."

Su Nuanyue's expression softened slightly.

"Qin Yang, can you cure my dad first?"

"Sure."

He didn't object. Everyone else could wait, but Su Zhonghai was different.

If the man were still the same as before, Qin Yang wouldn't have bothered. But Su Zhonghai had clearly changed.

He gestured for Su Zhonghai to come forward.

Su Zhonghai obediently stood before him.

Qin Yang gripped his wrist and channeled his qi, sending a current of energy surging into Su Zhonghai's body.

Moments later, Su Zhonghai felt an incredible lightness—as though a weight had been lifted from every inch of him.

"Done."

Done?

Su Zhonghai blinked in disbelief.

He'd just grabbed his wrist. That was it?

Even a TV drama wouldn't dare pull something this ridiculous.

"This poison has no antidote," Qin Yang explained. "The only way to neutralize it is with raw power—using internal energy to directly refine and destroy the toxin. Zhang Xin and the others are skilled physicians, but they don't have martial abilities, so they're helpless against it. Even most martial artists wouldn't be strong enough."

Su Zhonghai knew Qin Yang was some kind of warrior. Hearing the explanation put his mind at ease.

"What about the rest of them?"

Qin Yang's tone was indifferent. "That's up to them. They can choose to protect Su Qiang, or they can choose to live. If they'd rather shield the woman who poisoned them than worry about their own survival, I won't stop them. You're all family, after all."

Su Zhonghai understood immediately. This wasn't Qin Yang's decision to make—it was theirs.

Qin Yang had already laid out his terms.
