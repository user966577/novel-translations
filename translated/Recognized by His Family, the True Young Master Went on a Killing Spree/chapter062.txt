Chapter 62: Healing Her Legs

Qin Li watched in horror, his face chalk-white.

The sight of the man pinned to the ground—dagger buried through his arm, embedded in marble—made even a bystander wince.

Terrifying. That was the only word for it.

Qin Li tried to run, but his legs refused to cooperate. He couldn't take a single step.

"Talk," Qin Yang said. "Who are you people? Qin Weiye doesn't have the connections to recruit killers of your caliber."

These men were different from common thugs. Their presence, their killing intent—they were hardened fugitives, desperate men with nothing left to lose.

Someone had assembled them. But it wasn't Qin Weiye. He didn't have the ability.

"Just kill me," the man spat through gritted teeth. "Someone will avenge me."

Qin Yang ignored him and turned to Qin Li.

"And you don't know anything useful."

Qin Li blinked. How had Qin Yang known?

He truly didn't know where his father had found these people—only that they were terrifying.

"What are you going to do?" Qin Li's voice trembled.

"An eye for an eye."

Qin Li understood instantly. His face went ghost-white.

"You can't kill me! I'm your brother! We share the same blood! The whole world will condemn you!"

"Finished?" Qin Yang asked.

Qin Li sensed the ax about to fall. He opened his mouth—

"Good. Time to go."

Qin Yang squeezed.

*Snap.*

Qin Li's neck broke in his hand.

Qin Xue shut her eyes.

Not out of sympathy for Qin Li. She felt sorry for Qin Yang. Brother killing brother—half-blood or not, the connection was real.

She couldn't imagine the weight it would leave on him.

"Trash."

Qin Yang tossed the body aside and wiped his hand in disgust.

Watching this, Qin Xue realized she'd worried for nothing.

Killing Qin Li hadn't bothered Qin Yang in the slightest. If anything, he seemed mildly pleased—like he'd taken out the garbage.

"Let's go."

"What about them?"

"Leave them."

Then he looked at Qin Xue with open distaste.

"I'm definitely not carrying you."

Qin Xue looked down at her legs. They still weren't healed—she couldn't walk. If he wouldn't carry her, was she supposed to crawl out?

Qin Yang placed his hands on her legs.

Qin Xue startled. Had he lost his mind?

"What are you doing?! I'm your sister!"

Qin Yang rolled his eyes. "Not everyone thinks like a pervert. I refuse to carry you, so I'm fixing your legs first."

Qin Xue flushed with embarrassment.

"The doctors said it would take weeks to heal," she protested feebly. "Just carry me."

"In your dreams."

He worked on one leg, then switched to the other. Moments later, he stood. "Done. Let's go."

"Done?"

She was skeptical. But she tried moving—and gasped. Her legs worked perfectly.

"You're lucky," Qin Yang said with exaggerated disgust. "If I weren't too grossed out to carry you, I wouldn't have bothered."

Qin Xue smiled despite herself. What a terrible liar.

She knew why his attitude had changed. She'd passed him information about the family—a small gesture—and he'd come to save her life without hesitation.

That made him infinitely better than Qin Li, whom she'd treated like a real brother for years and who'd tried to murder her without a second thought.

"Thank you, little brother."

The gratitude was genuine. The guilt was overwhelming.

"God, you talk a lot. Move."

He headed for the exit. Then he snapped his fingers.

Fire erupted behind them, and the entire estate was engulfed within seconds.

Destroying the evidence. Not that Qin Yang feared consequences—he just hated loose ends. Especially when Qin Xue was involved.

"How did you do that? Can you teach me?"

Qin Yang ignored the question. "When you get back, stay in the wheelchair. Pretend your legs are still broken. If Qin Weiye finds out about Qin Li and sees you walking around, he'll come for you next."

Qin Xue nodded hastily. "Got it. Thank you."

"Stop calling me your brother. We're nothing to each other. Now hold on."

He put the car in gear and drove off.

Qin Xue sat in the passenger seat, the faintest smile playing on her lips.
