  "synopsis": "Qin Yang spent eighteen years as a forgotten son--abandoned by his father Qin Weiye, who chose to raise another woman's child in his place. But Qin Yang is no ordinary young man. Trained in the hidden world of cultivators, he commands powers that defy mortal understanding: healing the incurable, slaying the inhuman, and terrifying even the National Security Bureau with his mere identity.\n\nWhen fate reconnects him with the Su family through Su Nuanyue--a capable heiress fighting to maintain control of her family empire--Qin Yang finds himself dragged back into the world of wealth and power he never wanted. Meanwhile, his biological father crawls back into the orbit of the prestigious Qin family, scheming for an inheritance worth hundreds of billions.\n\nQin Yang couldn't care less about family legacies or corporate empires. But threaten the people he protects, and the true young master will show the world why even immortal cultivators speak his name with reverence.",
