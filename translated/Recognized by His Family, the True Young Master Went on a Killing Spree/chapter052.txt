Chapter 52: Heading to the Old Manor

No wonder Jingang had said that without blood ties, Qin Yang could deal with them in under three days.

Kill every member of the Qin family, and the Qin family ceases to exist.

Qin Youtian nodded slowly. "I understand. I know what to do."

"If I didn't want to avoid a rift between my brother and his blood relatives, I wouldn't be helping you. You're the ones who wronged him."

Jingang said it plainly. When he'd first learned about Qin Yang's past, he'd wanted to go kill Qin Weiye himself.

"That was Qin Weiye's sin, not mine," Qin Youtian protested.

"Oh, give me a break. You've got how many illegitimate children running around? You never took responsibility for any of them. And you have the nerve to point fingers?"

Qin Youtian was speechless.

He rolled his eyes. "Ungrateful girl."

"Old geezer."

His eyes flashed dangerously.

Then Qin Yihan ducked into Jingang's arms, putting on her most pitiful expression. "Hubby, he's bullying me. Beat him up for me."

"What--I'm your father! You want someone to beat me up?"

Qin Yihan smirked. "My husband would be doing the beating, not me. That's not unfilial."

The logic was absurd, but it somehow held up.

Qin Youtian's confidence wavered. "Son-in-law... you wouldn't actually do it, would you?"

Jingang scratched his nose. "I do whatever my wife tells me."

Qin Youtian gave up talking.

"Fine. I'll set up a company for you," he told Qin Yihan. "You go run it. Regardless of results, the inheritance is yours. Everything goes to you."

He'd finally made his decision.

As for Qin Weiye and the others, they were gearing up for fierce competition, never knowing they'd already been eliminated.

With Jingang backing her, Qin Yihan was invincible. There was no point in delaying.

"Finally made a smart call, old man. I was about to have Jingang make those bastards disappear. Looks like that won't be necessary."

Qin Yihan smiled.

Qin Youtian broke into a cold sweat.

His daughter was truly fearless. If he hadn't made this decision today, she might very well have had him "disappeared" too.

He sighed inwardly. It was his own fault--too many illegitimate children, too many mistakes. No wonder Qin Yihan resented him.

With that matter settled, Qin Yang and Ji Doudou had dinner at home.

That evening, Su Nuanyue returned.

She said curiously, "The Qin family reached out today about a collaboration. They offered me a project they could easily handle alone. It feels like they're deliberately giving me money."

Qin Yang smiled. "They are."

He explained the situation with Jingang and Qin Yihan.

Su Nuanyue was stunned.

A battle brother had become an uncle-in-law?

This morning Qin Yang had thrown Qin Yihan out, and now he had no choice but to accept her.

The irony made Su Nuanyue burst out laughing.

"Going forward, if the Qin family wants to collaborate, go for it. My bond with Jingang is thicker than blood. Consider it doing him a favor."

"Got it. Honestly, a partnership with the Qin family benefits us both. We've been competitors for years, each trying to one-up the other without either side winning. Cooperation is the smart play."

With Qin Yang and Jingang in the picture, neither family needed to worry about the other playing dirty.

Full cooperation would elevate both houses to new heights.

Their overlapping industries and complementary strengths could all become advantages.

Su Nuanyue was so excited she wanted to call Qin Yihan immediately. She was a workaholic through and through.

"Weren't we supposed to visit your old manor tonight?"

That snapped her back to reality. She frowned, knowing the old manor meant facing a den of wolves.

"Right, I almost forgot. Let me change."

When she came back down, she wore a fitted black evening gown and high heels, her hair styled to perfection--so stunning it was almost blinding.

Even Qin Yang found himself staring.

He'd never quite realized just how beautiful Su Nuanyue could be.

"Gorgeous," Du Li breathed, her eyes full of admiration.

"You're no less striking," Su Nuanyue told her. "You just never bother with it. You have so many beautiful outfits you never wear. If you actually dressed up, you'd rival me easily."

Du Li's beauty was different--sharp and fierce, mixing elegance with an edge. Nothing like Su Nuanyue's exquisite porcelain-doll perfection, but with a charm all its own. In terms of raw beauty and presence, she was every bit her equal.

"I don't like dressing up."

"You should, though. You have Qin Yang now--dress up for the person you love."

Du Li grinned. "I already reeled him in. Even less reason to bother now. What's he going to do, dump me? If he tries, I'll go find myself ten college guys and rotate through them daily."

Qin Yang's eyes narrowed. "You won't get the chance."

A mental note was made. This woman needed to be thoroughly occupied so she'd have no energy left for finding college boys.

Du Li had no idea the disaster she'd just brought upon herself. By the time she begged for mercy, it would be far too late.

Qin Yang accompanied Su Nuanyue out the door. Du Li stayed behind--no need for her to come. With Qin Yang there, who could possibly hurt Su Nuanyue?

If such a person existed, Du Li's presence wouldn't make a difference anyway.

She was rather looking forward to seeing how badly the Su family elders would get wrecked tonight.
