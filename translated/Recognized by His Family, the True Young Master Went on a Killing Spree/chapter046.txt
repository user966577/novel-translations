Chapter 46: Throw Her Out

Qin Yang looked up at Qin Yihan and said flatly, "I'll give you one minute to explain. If I'm not satisfied, I'll have someone beat you senseless and throw you out."

His words caught Qin Yihan off guard.

But she wasn't panicked. "Qin Weiye is an illegitimate son of our Qin family. My biological brother died, and Qin Weiye was brought back to be groomed as the heir."

So that was how it was.

South City had two Qin families--one great, one small.

Everyone had always assumed the two were unrelated.

Who could have guessed that Qin Weiye was actually the illegitimate son of the truly prestigious Qin family?

Qin Yang was somewhat surprised as well.

But what did that have to do with him?

This kind of explanation wasn't what he wanted to hear.

"I have nothing to do with Qin Weiye, so your explanation doesn't satisfy me."

Qin Yihan sensed something was wrong.

"What are you going to do?"

She asked nervously.

"Throw her out."

Qin Yang said flatly.

Several bodyguards rushed in and handled it directly, tossing Qin Yihan out the door.

Qin Yang was a bit dissatisfied--they didn't even rough her up first.

Su Nuanyue and the others were dumbfounded by this outcome.

Qin Weiye had already gone bankrupt, yet now he was about to rise again, reaching heights even greater than before.

The truly prestigious Qin family was in an entirely different league from Qin Weiye's so-called family.

"With your background, if you joined the Qin family, you'd be the only grandson of the third generation. The heir and his children are dead--your abilities are more than enough to inherit everything. You wouldn't even need to reconcile with Qin Weiye. I'm sure the Qin elders would recognize how extraordinary you are."

Su Nuanyue said.

Qin Yang would become the Qin family heir and kick Qin Weiye to the curb.

He'd get his revenge and gain the family empire in one stroke.

Unlike the Jiang family, the Qin family was genuine old money--even a cut above the Su family in status.

Their businesses were all legitimate too. Becoming heir would only benefit Qin Yang.

But Qin Yang shook his head. "Not interested."

"That's the Qin family we're talking about. Their assets must be worth over a hundred billion."

Du Li said.

This wasn't even in the same category as the Jiang family or the lesser Qin family.

"Want to hear my honest opinion?"

Qin Yang looked perfectly serious.

Both women nodded, eager to hear his real thoughts.

"Beneath me."

Qin Yang said.

Su Nuanyue and Du Li stared at each other.

Three simple words--beneath me. If the Qin family heard this, their jaws would hit the floor.

A family worth over a hundred billion, and someone had the audacity to say they were beneath him?

Qin Yang would be the first person in history.

Meanwhile, after being thrown out, Qin Yihan actually smiled.

"Perfect. He didn't disappoint me. He's truly not allied with Qin Weiye. Now I can relax. Among all those illegitimate sons, the only one who posed any real threat was Qin Weiye."

She turned and left, the anger from moments ago completely gone.

She had only come here to test Qin Yang's intentions.

Since he wouldn't accept Qin Weiye, he naturally wouldn't accept their family either.

That made him not an enemy.

They might even join forces against Qin Weiye.

A glint flashed through Qin Yihan's eyes at the thought.

"By the way, come with me to the old manor tonight. Meet the family."

Su Nuanyue said.

"Are they starting trouble?" Qin Yang asked.

"Mm. A girl like me controlling the Su family--they see it as a massive humiliation, something they absolutely refuse to accept. My last car accident was connected to them."

Su Nuanyue said.

"Got it. I'll tag along tonight and help you tear through them all."

Qin Yang grinned.

"Get some rest first. Wait for me to come back."

Su Nuanyue and Du Li left.

Qin Yang freshened up and prepared to rest.

Then Ji Doudou appeared in his room.

"Shouldn't you be streaming right now? What are you doing here?" Qin Yang asked, surprised.

Ji Doudou's streams were always marathon sessions--she should have been live right now.

"I take a few days off each month. Can't stream every single day. Otherwise I'd be worse off than a corporate drone."

That made sense.

"You reek of blood--it's really thick. But strangely, I can't see any karmic debt on you. If anything, you've actually gained some merit. What happened? Did you go slay some demons?"

Ji Doudou asked curiously.

The stench of blood on Qin Yang was strong enough to sting the nose. Ordinary people wouldn't notice, but she could sense it clearly.

Yet his fortune had actually deepened. Very strange.

"Killed over a thousand Island Nation people. That's how it ended up like this."

Ji Doudou's eyes lit up. "So that's a thing you can do! If you killed all the Island Nation people, could you accumulate enough merit to reach sainthood?"

Seeing her practically itching to try, Qin Yang didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

He quickly shut down the idea.

"They may be beasts, but you can't just wipe them all out at once. The heavens would lock onto you, and forget sainthood--you'd get struck by divine lightning until there was nothing left."

If that method actually worked, it wouldn't have been Qin Yang's turn. Dragon Kingdom's cultivators would have done it long ago.

The reason he'd gained so much merit was because the Anbei family's onmyoji had committed too many atrocities. Killing them counted as slaying demons and purging evil.

That was why his merit had increased so substantially.

Killing ordinary Island Nation citizens wouldn't produce the same result.

So Qin Yang was waiting for the right moment. Once he could withstand divine lightning, he'd wipe the Island Nation clean.

"Fair point. I was oversimplifying things. Come on, let's cultivate."

Ji Doudou pressed herself against him. She truly loved this cultivation method.

Qin Yang smiled and obliged. Nothing better to do during the day anyway.

Outside, the servants who could hear the commotion from the bedroom couldn't help clicking their tongues in amazement.

The young master's stamina was absolutely terrifying.

"Mama Wang, no wonder our young miss is willing to share him. A man like that--one woman couldn't possibly handle him alone."

One of the maids remarked.

Mama Wang, still carrying traces of her former beauty in her early forties, sighed, "You're right. We've been around the block ourselves, and our men were never this strong--not even in their twenties."

"Comparing yourself to others will only make you miserable."

The maids chattered away.

Qin Yang threw himself into cultivation.

Meanwhile, at the Qin family estate, Qin Weiye and all the other illegitimate sons had entered the ancestral manor.
