Chapter 50: Jingang Gets Beaten Up

Jingang studied Ji Doudou, a hint of surprise in his eyes. "Why do I feel like you're stronger than me? But I can't read your level at all."

He was genuinely confused.

Ji Doudou radiated a subtle pressure that made him deeply uncomfortable--the same sensation Mystic had given them all back in the day.

Strangely, Qin Yang himself no longer gave off that feeling. Standing before Jingang, he seemed completely ordinary.

Ji Doudou smiled. "That's because you're too weak."

Jingang didn't buy it. He narrowed his eyes. "Let's spar."

"Outside."

Ji Doudou glanced at the surroundings. She didn't want to wreck Su Nuanyue's home. The courtyard, at least, could be repaired without disrupting daily life.

Qin Yihan couldn't help asking, "You're not going to stop them? Aren't you worried your little girlfriend will get hurt?"

"You're the one who should be worried."

Qin Yang said.

"Ha! Your woman's the one getting beaten up. Why would I be worried?"

Qin Yihan scoffed.

Then screams erupted from the courtyard.

Her smirk vanished.

Something was wrong. Those screams didn't sound like Ji Doudou at all--they were unmistakably male.

Jingang was getting beaten?

She bolted for the door.

Qin Yang called after her, "Don't bother. Doudou knows her limits. Jingang's my brother--she won't actually kill him."

Wouldn't actually kill him? Was that supposed to be comforting?

She rushed out anyway.

In the courtyard, she witnessed an astonishing scene.

Jingang was being pummeled by Ji Doudou without the slightest ability to fight back. He lay on the ground as she hammered fist after fist into his face. His chiseled features had swollen into something resembling a pig's head--a truly pitiful sight.

The injuries were all superficial, though. Ji Doudou had clearly held back.

After a while, she finally stopped.

Jingang stayed flat on the ground, unable to rise.

"What did you do to me? Release it!"

"Just a little trick. An immobilization spell."

Ji Doudou said breezily.

Against someone of equal power, the spell wasn't reliable. But against someone far weaker? It worked every time.

Jingang had been frozen in place and could do nothing but lie there taking the beating.

Qin Yang sauntered out and chuckled at the scene.

Martial artists versus cultivators--it wasn't even a fair comparison. Jingang had basically asked for it.

He flicked a finger, sending a wisp of energy that shattered the spell.

Jingang scrambled to his feet, but the way he looked at Ji Doudou had completely changed. Not a trace of condescension remained.

In the world of warriors, might made right. Simple as that.

"Alright, you two head out. I get the message. I won't give Qin Yihan any trouble. As long as she doesn't come looking for mine, I'll help her when I can."

Qin Yang said.

Jingang's face lit up. That was exactly why he'd brought Qin Yihan to meet Qin Yang.

He was often away on missions, while Qin Yang was based in South City. If Qin Yihan ever needed help, she could turn to him.

He just hadn't expected her to turn out to be Qin Yang's aunt, making himself Qin Yang's uncle-in-law.

He knew Qin Yang's history--knew he had little affection for his blood relatives--so he didn't push Qin Yihan to stick around.

With Qin Yang's promise secured, Jingang grinned. "I knew you were solid, Mystic. We'll be off then."

"Get lost. Oh--and starting tomorrow, come find me whenever you're free."

Jingang was puzzled.

"You're too weak. Forget about my world--even among martial artists, there are people who could kill you without breaking a sweat. I'm worried. Come train with me."

Jingang lit up. "Seriously? Mystic, you're the best! I love you, man!"

"Get out. I don't swing that way."

"Show some respect for your uncle." Jingang straightened up.

Qin Yang's face darkened. "Doudou, hit him with a Palm Lightning."

Jingang flinched and bolted.

But even after he'd cleared the courtyard gates, no Palm Lightning came. He breathed a sigh of relief.

Ji Doudou looked a bit sheepish. "I... don't actually know Palm Lightning. Would Five Thunders from the Heavens work instead?"

Qin Yang immediately waved the idea off. Even the weakest Five Thunders would reduce Jingang to ash.

"Forget it. The crime doesn't warrant the death penalty."

Ji Doudou giggled. Of course she wouldn't actually blast Jingang with heavenly thunder. She'd only been joking.

Soon after, Jingang pulled all the Dragon Pavilion members into a group chat, Qin Yihan included.

He tagged everyone.

"I got married. This is my wife, Qin Yihan."

"Congratulations, brother!"

"Welcome, sister-in-law!"

"Welcome, sister-in-law!"

"Welcome, sis!"

Ninety-six people responded.

The Dragon Pavilion had 108 core members in total.

Including Qin Yang, the remaining handful stayed silent.

Qin Yang understood instantly.

Those people had likely died in action.

Little Douzi was among them.

He drew a deep breath.

These 108 were the absolute core of the Dragon Pavilion. Twelve were already gone.

Had his departure been right or wrong?

If he'd stayed, could he have prevented those deaths?

His heart was heavy.

Then Jingang tagged him again.

"Dear nephew, say hello to your uncle. Oh, and everyone--my wife is Mystic's biological aunt, which makes me Mystic's uncle-in-law."

The entire chat erupted.

Qin Yang's face turned black.

He turned to Ji Doudou. "Can you get a lock on Jingang's position from here?"

Ji Doudou blinked. "What for?"

"Hit him with Five Thunders."

Qin Yang's eyes were practically shooting fire.
