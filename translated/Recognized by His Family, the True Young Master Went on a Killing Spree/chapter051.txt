Chapter 51: Father-in-Law, My Brother Is Your Grandson

Jingang shivered. Suddenly, he had a very bad feeling.

The group chat was already holding a memorial for him.

"Crossing Mystic? You're dead meat."

"Jingang, this time next year might be your anniversary."

"Rest in peace, brother. I'll take good care of your wife for you."

"Godspeed."

Jingang's forehead was beading with sweat.

In his excitement, he'd somehow forgotten that Mystic was the most vindictive person alive. Teasing him like this? That lunatic would absolutely retaliate tenfold.

"Honey, um... come with me to see Qin Yang tomorrow?"

"What's wrong?"

"I think he might actually kill me."

"Don't worry, he won't."

"Really?" Jingang's spirits lifted immediately.

"Mm. Qin Yang said so himself. He said even if he beat you to death, as long as it hadn't been more than twenty-four hours, he could bring you back."

Qin Yihan said confidently.

In hindsight, Qin Yang probably hadn't been joking. Having a nephew this powerful was actually quite nice.

Jingang's face went dark.

That was reassuring? It sounded more like a threat.

Killed and brought back to life--meaning if Mystic wanted to torture someone, they couldn't even die without his permission.

He gazed up at the sky, certain his immediate future would be miserable.

The couple returned to the Qin estate. Jingang's face had already healed. As a powerhouse at the Terrestrial Immortal level, injuries like these were nothing.

"Son-in-law! You're back! Please, sit down. I had no idea about your background. You should have told your father-in-law earlier--saved me that embarrassment. What position do you hold in the Security Bureau, if I may ask?"

Qin Youtian tiptoed around the question.

Having his identity flagged as classified state information meant Jingang's status was extraordinary--likely a very high rank within the Bureau itself.

For the Qin family, a connection like this could transform their future.

Jingang smiled faintly. "You may have the wrong idea, Father-in-Law. I'm not part of the Security Bureau."

"Then how...?"

"My brothers and I have a cooperative relationship with them. We're friends, you might say. Our identities are classified at the highest level--not because we're agents, but because of who we are."

Qin Youtian wasn't disappointed. Anyone the Security Bureau treated this way was obviously no ordinary person.

"That's still remarkable. Ordinary people can't so much as get a meeting with the Bureau. The fact that you cooperate means your strength is on par with theirs."

Jingang gave a slight smile and didn't deny it.

"Yihan can be impulsive," Qin Youtian continued. "She's sharp but not malicious. I hope you'll take good care of her."

"She's my woman. No one will dare touch her. In Dragon Kingdom, she can do whatever she pleases."

The sheer confidence in that statement took Qin Youtian's breath away.

Just who was this man?

"Besides, I have a brother who's even more formidable than me. He's acknowledged Yihan as his sister-in-law. Even if I can't protect her, he won't let anyone bully his brother's wife."

He paused, smiling. "And you already know him."

"Who?"

Qin Youtian's curiosity was piqued.

If Jingang could walk through Dragon Kingdom untouched, and his brother was even stronger, that person must be a figure of significance on the entire Blue Star.

Qin Youtian couldn't recall knowing anyone of that caliber. He was a regional powerhouse, sure, but nothing special on the national stage--let alone globally.

Qin Yihan's expression was complicated. "It's Qin Yang."

Qin Yang?

The name sounded awfully familiar.

Then it clicked.

His most promising illegitimate grandson--who happened to be his daughter's husband's sworn brother. Which made his daughter... her own nephew's sister-in-law.

Qin Youtian's brain nearly short-circuited.

What kind of coincidence was this?

Then came a rush of elation.

He'd been right. Qin Yang was extraordinary.

If Jingang could swagger through all of Dragon Kingdom, what did that make someone even more powerful? Now Qin Youtian wanted nothing more than to bring Qin Yang home and hand him the keys to the kingdom.

Jingang read his mind. "Qin Yang won't reconcile with your family. You know that. And the Qin family's wealth doesn't interest him."

The words stung. The Qin family was a top-tier force in South City, even above the Su family. Being told it wasn't worth Qin Yang's attention hurt.

"If I were you, I wouldn't approach Qin Yang directly. Work with Su Nuanyue instead. Earn her goodwill. If she puts in a good word, there's a chance he might come around."

Qin Youtian's eyes lit up. "Really?"

"But there's a condition: don't give the inheritance to Qin Weiye. If you do, Qin Yang may personally destroy the Qin family. A few phone calls and three days--that's all it would take for the Qin family to vanish from Dragon Kingdom."

"Impossible. The Qin family isn't some pushover. How could one person dismantle us in three days?"

"Be grateful you share blood with him. Another family wouldn't get three days. They wouldn't even get an hour."

"I don't believe that."

"Killing everyone in the family is the most effective way to deal with a family."

The casual menace in those words finally made the message land.
