Chapter 59: Qin Yang Is Her Strength

"Enough! Nuanyue is a member of the Su family. What's this about her being your grandson's wife? Since when is Qin Weiye your son?" Old Master Su snapped.

Qin Youtian grinned smugly. "He's one of my illegitimate sons. His child is naturally my biological grandson."

"Shameless."

Old Master Su had been faithful to his beloved wife his entire life—never so much as looked at another woman. Qin Youtian's behavior disgusted him to the core.

And the man was flaunting it right in his face.

Qin Youtian didn't care. "Call me what you want. Having an outstanding grandson and granddaughter-in-law is what matters. Jealous?"

Jealous?

Of course he was.

Qin Yang could mobilize this many powerful figures with a single phone call. That said everything about his influence.

Without real power, none of these people would give him a second glance—let alone rally to his cause.

Old Master Su took a deep breath. "Nuanyue, I spoke rashly before. I've thought it over. Your terms are fair—and right. I should give you a proper answer. The Su family is yours. It will always be yours. No one can take it away. You don't need to go anywhere."

The last part was clearly directed at Qin Youtian.

Qin Youtian shrugged it off. In the end, the Su family's assets would belong to his grandson's line anyway. Nothing to fuss about.

Just then, several cars pulled up. Ye Longfei stepped out and announced with a cold smile, "No need to trouble yourself, Old Master Su. I've already delivered Su Qiang to the authorities."

He spotted Xu Liang and started. "City Chief, you're here too."

Xu Liang was aware of Ye Longfei's connection to Qin Yang. Under Ye Longfei's influence, South City's crime rate had plummeted. He'd brought the street gangs under control, kept them within strict rules, and refused to cross certain lines—or let anyone else cross them.

Xu Liang didn't mind the man. He nodded. "Good work."

Ye Longfei let out a quiet breath of relief.

Old Master Su was seething but didn't dare say a word.

"Sister-in-law," Ye Longfei called to Su Nuanyue, "if there's anything you need, just say the word. Whatever your big brother can do for you, consider it done."

"Thank you, Brother Ye."

Ye Longfei waved it off and left with his men. Having the City Chief present—even knowing nothing would happen—still made him uneasy.

In the car, his son Ye Chen couldn't resist asking, "Dad, did Uncle Qin call the City Chief too?"

"Call?" Ye Longfei scoffed. "Your uncle didn't ask—he summoned. You have no idea how many people would kill for a chance to get on his good side."

Ye Chen's jaw dropped.

"Don't overthink it," Ye Longfei said. "There'll be plenty more shocking things down the road. Your uncle has entered the mortal world and settled in South City. That's our good fortune. Make sure we don't squander it."

"Yes, sir."

The various guests departed one by one.

Now it was just the Su family and Su Nuanyue.

She looked at Old Master Su. "Go find Qin Yang. I'll call ahead and have him treat you. As for Su Qiang—I won't go out of my way to harm her. Whatever punishment she receives is the consequence of her own actions. I won't interfere either way."

She walked into the building.

Old Master Su exhaled. But his expression was hollow.

"That's great—it's settled! But Dad, you don't look happy," Su Zhongtian ventured.

"Nuanyue has completely turned her back on us. From now on, she won't listen to a word I say."

"Once this blows over, you could gradually reclaim the businesses from her," Su Zhongtian suggested. "Without that leverage, she won't be able to stand against us."

Old Master Su shot him a withering look. "You think Nuanyue doesn't have the means to stop that? And do you honestly believe the businesses are what give her power?"

"What else would it be?" Su Zhongshan asked, confused.

Old Master Su sighed. "Maybe before. But now, Nuanyue's real strength is Qin Yang. If we try to take back her businesses, Qin Yang will bankrupt the Su family overnight. Every one of us will be begging on the streets."

The brothers went pale.

"How?" Su Zhongshan demanded.

"Did you not see who showed up today? Any one of them could do it alone—to say nothing of whatever else Qin Yang has behind him. We've all underestimated him."

The family exchanged stunned glances.

Difficult as it was to accept, the day's events made it impossible to deny. Qin Yang genuinely wielded that kind of power.

They returned to Su Nuanyue's residence, where Qin Yang let them in this time.

"Who's first?" he asked.

"Me!" Su Yulong's hand shot up instantly.

Seeing the others' annoyed looks, he put on a smile. "I'm just volunteering to test it first—make sure there's no harm done. Consider me a guinea pig for you, Brother-in-law."

Nobody bought it.

A scream erupted from Su Yulong.

His body seized violently. It was a long moment before he recovered.

Qin Yang had already withdrawn his hand. "A bit rusty," he said casually. "But the poison's cleared. Don't worry—there's only a tiny bit of pain."

Having just watched Su Yulong nearly pass out from agony, nobody believed the "tiny bit of pain" claim. Even a knife wound shouldn't have produced that reaction.

They strongly suspected Qin Yang had done it on purpose.

But survival took priority over comfort.

One by one, they stepped forward and had the poison removed.

Once everyone was clean, Zhang Xin arrived.

His tone was cool. "Old Master Su, you don't even trust my grandmaster? Fine—I'll examine you one last time, but after this, don't contact me again."

Offending his grandmaster and still expecting medical care? Not a chance.

Zhang Xin was only doing this out of respect for their past relationship—a final courtesy.
