Chapter 54: The Whole Family's Been Poisoned

Just then, Su Nuanyue's voice drifted in from the entrance.

"Everyone's here, I see."

She walked in on Qin Yang's arm.

Old Master Su's eyes lit up. "You must be Qin Yang! What a fine young man. Come, let Grandpa get a good look at you."

Qin Yang approached with a smile. "Hello, Grandpa."

"Good, good! I can tell this one's no ordinary boy. With you by Nuanyue's side, I can rest easy."

The old man was effusive, clasping Qin Yang's hand and beaming with joy.

But Qin Yang's brow creased.

Discreetly, he sent a thread of true qi into the old man's body--and immediately detected something wrong.

The old man had been poisoned.

It was a slow-acting toxin, subtle and insidious. It would gradually erode the body until death, and any doctor examining him would find nothing abnormal--writing it off as natural causes.

Noticing Qin Yang's gaze, Old Master Su asked, "Something the matter?"

"Grandpa's been poisoned."

He said it bluntly.

"What?"

The room erupted.

"Don't spout nonsense! Grandpa is perfectly healthy!" Su Yulong snapped.

Su Qiang added with a sneer, "Typical country bumpkin--just has to make a scene. Is that why the Qin family threw you out?"

Qin Yang said nothing. His gaze swept over every person in the room before settling on Su Qiang.

"Everyone here has been poisoned. Every single person--except you. You did this."

Stunned silence.

They stared at Qin Yang, bewildered. He had to be making this up.

Su Nuanyue looked at him questioningly.

"Qin Yang, what exactly is going on? Grandpa believes you. Explain."

Old Master Su's voice was grave.

If only he'd been poisoned, the explanation would be straightforward--someone wanted him dead for some specific reason.

But the entire family? That was different. That meant someone wanted them all dead.

And if Su Qiang was the only one untouched, the endgame was obvious: everyone else dies, and the Su family fortune becomes hers.

He'd always doted on his youngest daughter. He didn't want to believe she'd do something like this.

"The toxin is an extremely sophisticated poison called 'Maiden.'"

"Maiden?"

"*A maiden of sixteen, body soft as cream--secretly she drains the marrow from your bones.*"

Qin Yang recited.

"Long-term exposure causes the body to slowly wither. After three years of consumption, death is guaranteed--and it looks exactly like a natural decline."

"That's impossible!"

Everyone went pale.

"You're talking nonsense! Why would I poison my own family?"

Su Qiang shouted.

"Exactly! Don't try to scare people. Auntie would never do that." Su Yulong backed her up.

Qin Yang smiled. "Simple enough to prove. Get a skilled traditional medicine practitioner in here. Under normal circumstances, they'd never catch this particular toxin. But if they know what to look for, they can confirm it."

"No! Father, brothers, don't listen to his drivel. He's some country nobody--what would he know about medicine?"

Su Nuanyue spoke up: "My legs--they were genuinely crippled. I thought I'd be in a wheelchair forever. Qin Yang healed them. His medical skills are extraordinary."

Shock rippled through the room.

They'd assumed Su Nuanyue's disability had been faked. Now they knew better--Qin Yang had cured her.

Old Master Su made his decision. "Send for Master Zhang immediately."

"Father, you can't believe this over me!"

Su Qiang's face was a mask of hurt betrayal. Her act was convincing--several family members began to feel guilty for doubting her.

"If it's not you, a medical examination will prove your innocence. So why are you trying to stop it?" Qin Yang asked coldly.

That silenced the room.

Old Master Su gave Su Qiang a long, searching look. "Send for Master Zhang."

Su Qiang's legs gave out. She sank into her chair.

Seeing that, everyone understood.

Su Zhongtian could barely believe it. "Sister... how could you?"

She said nothing, clinging to a last shred of hope.

Master Zhang arrived quickly.

The moment he saw Qin Yang, his eyes went wide.

He dropped to his knees immediately. "Your disciple's disciple, Zhang Xin, pays respects to Grandmaster."

The room went dead silent.

Grandmaster?

Zhang Xin was calling Qin Yang... Grandmaster?

This was Zhang Xin--the most celebrated traditional medicine practitioner in all of Haijiang Province, one of the top practitioners in the entire country.

And he was kneeling before Qin Yang.

The collective sense of reality shifted violently.

"Rise. Examine them. Check for a poison called 'Maiden.'"

Qin Yang gestured toward the gathered family.

Zhang Xin couldn't help a wry smile. "With you here, Grandmaster, what need is there for my humble efforts? If you say they've been poisoned, they've been poisoned."

"They don't believe me."

Zhang Xin's expression cooled. He turned to Old Master Su. "Sir, my grandmaster's medical knowledge exceeds mine a hundredfold. If he says it, it's true. Do not doubt him."

"Old friend, why do you call Qin Yang 'Grandmaster'?"

"My master is Fang Wendao, the Needle Saint--and he is merely Grandmaster's named disciple. It's our privilege to even address him as such."

The Needle Saint--Fang Wendao.

One of the most formidable medical practitioners in all of Dragon Kingdom. A figure so elite that even Old Master Su couldn't guarantee a meeting.

And Qin Yang was the Needle Saint's master? One who'd only accepted him as a named disciple at that?

If Zhang Xin hadn't said it himself, not a soul in the room would have believed it.

But Zhang Xin would never joke about his own master.

"You have no idea how truly formidable Grandmaster is. He's--"

"That's enough. Stop bragging."

Zhang Xin caught himself, remembering that his grandmaster was a man of extreme discretion.

The Su family was consumed with burning curiosity about just who Qin Yang really was.
