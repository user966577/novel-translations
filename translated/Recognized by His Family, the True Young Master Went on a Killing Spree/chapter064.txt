Chapter 64: Impotent Rage

Ji Doudou smiled. "It might have been risky before, but now I have you. Nothing to worry about."

Qin Yang shook his head. "That's not good enough. I don't like it." His gaze sharpened. "Do you have any leads on them at all?"

"When my family was destroyed, we had some local influence but were never part of the cultivation world. We specialized in divination—mortal-level practitioners. I've already reached Foundation Establishment. The people who came for us were ordinary martial artists. Even if they found me, I could handle them."

Qin Yang wasn't convinced. "If your divination abilities still can't locate them after all this time, do you really think the people who wiped out the Ji family are just ordinary mortals?"

The words hit Ji Doudou like cold water.

She looked up at him.

"Leave this to me. And stop streaming."

His tone left no room for argument. Ji Doudou considered it, then relented. "Fine."

If her enemies were cultivators rather than ordinary people, her Foundation Establishment strength might not be enough.

Things were more complicated than she'd assumed.

Qin Yang wasted no time. He dialed White Cloud Temple.

"Disciple! Miss your old master already?"

"Master, I need your help looking into something."

"Figures. My ungrateful disciple only calls when he needs a favor. What is it?"

"The Ji family of the Dragon Kingdom was annihilated. I suspect cultivators were involved. Can you track down who did it?"

Old Daoist Baiyun's voice turned serious. "Why are you investigating this?"

"The last survivor of the Ji family is one of my women."

Silence. Then an explosion of profanity.

"Some bastard dared mess with my disciple's woman?! Consider it done, boy. I'll find every last one of them."

"Thank you, Master."

Old Daoist Baiyun chuckled. "Come visit sometime—bring the wives. White Cloud Temple is only about 12 miles from where you live."

"We'll be there tomorrow."

"Now that's my good disciple. I'll get on the Ji family investigation right away. You'll have your answers by tomorrow."

He hung up.

Qin Yang grinned at Ji Doudou. "It's handled."

"By tomorrow?"

"My master has eyes and ears everywhere. What might be impossible for anyone else is child's play for him."

Ji Doudou marveled silently. Just how powerful was this master of his?

"We should go shopping," she said suddenly.

"Now?"

"Gifts! We're meeting your master tomorrow. I'm nervous." She paused. "And call Nuanyue and the others. Everyone should come. It wouldn't be right to leave anyone out."

Qin Yang gave her a thumbs up. That was real class.

He called Su Nuanyue, who agreed instantly. Meeting Qin Yang's master was something she'd rearrange her entire schedule for.

"I'll sit this one out," Du Li offered.

Su Nuanyue shot her a look. "Absolutely not. You're Qin Yang's woman too."

"But—"

Su Nuanyue grabbed her arm. "No arguments. They're already on their way."

They met up at one of South City's premier shopping centers—a palace of luxury brands.

Qin Yang personally selected the gifts while the women watched in growing bewilderment.

Designer menswear. Tailored suits. High-end shoes.

Then he had Su Nuanyue pull strings to secure a ticket to a lingerie fashion show.

And celebrity merchandise.

Not exactly what you'd expect as gifts for a venerable martial arts master.

"Are you sure your master likes this kind of thing?" Su Nuanyue asked carefully.

"I wish I could get him a girlfriend, but that's not exactly something you can gift-wrap."

The three women were speechless. Their mental image of Old Daoist Baiyun had just plummeted.

How had a master like that produced someone like Qin Yang?

"He's eccentric. Free-spirited."

They accepted this explanation. Barely.

He also bought a considerable amount of fine liquor.

By the time they finished, they needed a truck to haul everything.

"That should do it."

The total wasn't particularly alarming by their standards. Even Du Li—technically a bodyguard—had profit-sharing in Su Nuanyue's company and a bank balance she'd honestly lost track of. Conservative estimate: ten figures.

Du Li's phone rang.

She checked the caller, frowned, and stepped away.

Qin Yang's ear twitched. He caught every word—not deliberately; his hearing was simply that sharp.

Du Li returned wearing a smile, but something was off. A quiet heaviness lurked beneath the cheer.

"Everything okay? If you need help, I'm here."

"I'm fine," she said brightly. "I'm a Terrestrial Immortal—the strongest class of mortal warrior. What could I possibly need help with?"

Qin Yang let it go. He'd deal with whatever it was when the time came.

"Qin Yang! You did this, didn't you?! You animal! How could you?!"

A furious roar from across the plaza. Qin Weiye stormed toward them, lunging for Qin Yang's throat.

Ji Doudou intercepted him with a kick that sent him sprawling.

"You think you can touch Qin Yang in front of me? Dream on."

Qin Weiye glared through bloodshot eyes, seething with barely contained rage.

Qin Yang met his gaze without expression. The emptiness in his eyes made Qin Weiye shiver.

Qin Weiye collected himself with a shuddering breath. "You know what I'm talking about."

"I killed him. And there's nothing you can do about it." Qin Yang's voice was flat. "Impotent rage—that's all you've got."

Qin Weiye's face went white.
