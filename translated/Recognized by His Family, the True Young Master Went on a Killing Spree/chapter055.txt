Chapter 55: No Cure

They were desperate for Zhang Xin to continue.

When he stopped, the disappointment was palpable.

But his deference to Qin Yang told them everything they needed to know.

"Ungrateful wretch. What do you have to say for yourself?"

Old Master Su's voice was ice.

Su Qiang's face was ashen. Then a bitter resentment surfaced. "I have nothing to say. But you can't blame this on me."

The room didn't know whether to laugh or cry. She'd done it and was claiming innocence? Absurd.

Even Old Master Su was so angry he nearly laughed.

"You poisoned the entire family and say it's not your fault?"

"You always favored Nuanyue and never cared about me! Why does she get to lead the family just because she's a girl, while I--also a girl--can't even work at the company? A few million a month in living expenses--did you ever consider how I felt?"

Several family members actually sympathized. Not enough to excuse poisoning, but they understood the jealousy.

"Su Nuanyue's car accident--that was you too, wasn't it?" Qin Yang said.

"Stop pinning everything on me!"

"Would I say it if I didn't have proof? Want me to show you the evidence right now?"

Su Qiang laughed hollowly and sighed. "Fine. Yes, it was me."

If he could detect the poisoning, he probably did have evidence. There was no point in denying anything.

"I knew it." Qin Yang smiled.

Su Qiang's eyes went wide. He'd bluffed her. She glared at him with pure venom--this bastard had ruined everything the moment he walked in.

"Take her away. Keep her under strict guard."

Old Master Su was furious. But it was still just house arrest.

Qin Yang noted the old man's reluctance with contempt. Even after being poisoned, the patriarch couldn't bring himself to properly punish his own child.

Su Nuanyue, however, was genuinely displeased.

Old Master Su smiled bitterly. "Nuanyue, what your aunt did was inexcusable. I'll punish her. But please, don't report this to the authorities. If it gets out, it'll only hurt the Su family."

"I disagree."

Qin Yang spoke before Su Nuanyue could.

"Qin Yang, perhaps you should defer to Nuanyue on this."

"No."

Seeing the old man's smile vanish, Qin Yang continued flatly, "You're all poisoned. I'm the only one who can cure you. If Su Qiang doesn't receive proper punishment, you can all face the consequences of what she's done."

Panic swept the room.

Old Master Su looked to Zhang Xin.

"The Maiden toxin is incurable. Even my master couldn't do it. Feel free to consult any practitioner of traditional medicine in the country--they'll tell you the same."

Incurable.

Meaning Qin Yang was the only person alive who could save them.

"To be frank, Old Master Su--the fact that my grandmaster didn't personally deal with Miss Su Qiang is already a considerable show of respect to you. Otherwise, she'd already be dead."

Zhang Xin's reminder settled over the room like a cold weight.

"My grandmaster is a warrior first and a healer second."

Warriors killed.

Old Master Su's expression shifted through several emotions. "Can't we discuss this further? I'll give the entire Su family empire to Nuanyue."

Qin Yang scoffed. "What's Nuanyue's is Nuanyue's. No one can take it from her. Your offer changes nothing. And honestly? The Su family fortune isn't worth that much. You overestimate it."

He took Su Nuanyue's hand and walked out.

"You have three days to think it over. If you haven't made a decision by then, I won't lift a finger even if you change your minds later."

With that, they left.

Old Master Su turned to Zhang Xin one last time. "Give it to me straight, Old Zhang. This poison--truly, no one else can cure it?"

Zhang Xin nodded. "There's one other person."

"Who?"

Hope flickered in the old man's eyes.

"My great-grandmaster, Old Daoist Baiyun--the abbot of White Cloud Temple."

The eagerness on Old Master Su's face grew.

Zhang Xin smiled. "I wouldn't bother, sir. If you approached my great-grandmaster with this, he'd most likely slap you dead on the spot, then come over and slap Su Qiang dead for good measure."

"He's that violent?"

"He dotes on my grandmaster more than anything. Anyone who wrongs Grandmaster, he takes care of personally."

Old Master Su sighed deeply.

"If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave," Zhang Xin said. "And sir--if Miss Su Qiang doesn't receive her proper punishment, please don't contact me again. I'd rather not be expelled by my master."

He left without waiting for a response.

The Su family members looked at each other in dismay.

"Father, you can't just let us all die! Are you going to sacrifice the entire family for Su Qiang?" Su Zhongtian demanded.

"That's right, Father. Even if we older ones don't matter, think about your grandchildren." Su Zhongshan added.

Su Zhonghai kept his composure. "Father, think carefully. Are you really going to trade all our lives for one woman who's lost her mind?"

"Easy for you to say," Su Zhongtian snapped. "You think you're exempt?"

Su Zhonghai gave him a withering look.

Did his big brother forget who he was? Su Nuanyue's father.

Qin Yang might be cold, but he wouldn't let Su Nuanyue's own father die. And Su Nuanyue wouldn't stand for it either.

Su Zhongtian wanted to argue but realized he had nothing. He fell silent with a dramatic eye roll.

Old Master Su was almost disappointed the others had stopped complaining.

If they'd kept going, he might have actually signed everything over to Su Nuanyue.

Outside the manor, Su Nuanyue suddenly threw her arms around Qin Yang, her body trembling.

He held her gently. "Don't cry. I'm here. I won't let anyone hurt you."

"Ha ha ha!"

She pulled back, beaming--laughing from pure joy.

Qin Yang was thoroughly confused.

"God, that felt amazing!" she said. "They've been making my life miserable for years. Finally--finally--I got to see them squirm. Qin Yang, you're the best."

She threw her arms around him and planted a kiss on his cheek.
