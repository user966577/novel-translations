Chapter 48: Jingang, the Live-In Husband

One of the less perceptive illegitimate sons couldn't resist mocking, "Little sis, you brought yourself a gym trainer? Those guys are all muscles and no substance--weaker than us ordinary folk."

"Oh? You think I'm a gym trainer?"

The man flashed a grin.

"Obviously. With your build, if we fought, I'd still take you seven times out of ten."

This was Qin Ao--arrogant by name, arrogant by nature. Not much talent, but plenty of pride.

"Shut up, you idiot!" Qin Youtian snapped.

Qin Ao's expression froze. "Dad, I just don't want little sis getting scammed. I hear the fitness world is really sketchy. She must have been tricked."

Even Qin Weiye was speechless. He was supposed to be competing against this group of morons? It was an insult to his intelligence.

This big man was clearly no ordinary person. The aura coming off him made Qin Weiye's legs tremble.

Even Qin Youtian didn't exude this kind of pressure.

"Shut up. One more word and you're out."

Qin Youtian's tone went cold, and Qin Ao immediately fell silent.

"May I ask your name, sir?" Qin Youtian's tone was remarkably polite.

"Jingang."

Jingang? Qin Youtian turned the name over in his mind. He didn't recognize it.

But the aura on this man was anything but ordinary.

"And which family do you hail from?"

"No family. Orphan. I have some brothers--they're the closest thing to family I've got."

Qin Youtian took a deep breath. Could this Jingang be from the underworld? With an aura this formidable, he had to be some crime lord's top enforcer.

"Do you know Ye Longfei?"

Jingang was sharp--he caught Qin Youtian's meaning immediately.

He smiled. "Relax. I'm not from the underworld. I do know Ye Longfei, but we have no dealings. Though in my presence, he wouldn't dare step out of line."

Understood.

Qin Youtian asked no more. He turned to Qin Yihan. "Fine. I approve the marriage. You can get your certificate today."

"Thank you, Father."

Qin Yihan's tone was flat. She couldn't bring herself to be happy with this father.

If Qin Youtian hadn't created this mess with all his illegitimate children, she wouldn't need to compete against them.

She even suspected that her brother's and nephew's deaths might have been the work of one of these bastards.

And Qin Youtian had brought them all home anyway. Of course she was angry.

She pulled Jingang away.

Qin Youtian surveyed the remaining sons. "Everyone except Weiye, you're dismissed. Tomorrow someone will take you to your assigned companies. I hope you'll work hard and not waste this opportunity."

"Yes, sir."

They filed out, shooting jealous glances at Qin Weiye. Being singled out clearly meant the old man favored him.

Once only the two of them remained, Qin Youtian spoke. "I hear you have a son."

"Yes. Qin Li."

"I'm not talking about him."

Qin Weiye's heart lurched. The old man had clearly investigated everything.

"There's another son. Qin Yang. He's already severed ties with me."

"Idiot."

Qin Weiye lowered his head, not daring to argue.

He knew he'd underestimated Qin Yang. Whether in cunning or capability, Qin Yang far surpassed Qin Li.

If he had to choose an heir, Qin Yang was obviously the better pick. But he'd made the stupidest possible choice.

"The reason I favor you isn't just your ability--it's because you have Qin Yang for a son. I trust you understand my meaning."

"I'll make amends. I'll beg him to reconcile." Qin Weiye said immediately.

Qin Youtian sneered. "Reconcile? Are you joking? After what you did to that boy, you think he'll reconcile with you? Is your face really that thick?"

Qin Weiye flushed. He knew his actions had been despicable. Qin Yang's refusal to reconcile was entirely understandable.

"Then what does Father suggest?"

"Build a good relationship with him. Even if reconciliation is impossible, don't make things worse. When you're on your deathbed, hand the Qin family to him. From what I've seen of that boy, he values loyalty. He wouldn't abandon the family."

Qin Weiye's spirits soared. He understood the implication--the old man was going to give him the position of heir.

"Rest assured, Father. I'll do exactly as you say."

"Don't celebrate too early. The position isn't guaranteed. Yihan is also capable. I might very well give it to her instead. After all, this empire was built by her mother and me together."

He waved his hand, dismissing Qin Weiye.

A shadow passed through Qin Weiye's eyes.

No one was going to stop him from becoming heir. If Qin Yihan got in his way, he wouldn't mind making her disappear.

He'd do anything to control the Qin family.

Watching him leave, Qin Youtian frowned slightly.

Qin Weiye had the ability, but his character was another matter entirely. Handing the family to him might be either a blessing or a disaster.

Perhaps Qin Yihan really was the better choice.

His thoughts drifted to Jingang. Who was that man, exactly?

He picked up his phone and dialed.

"I need a background check. His name is Jingang. I want his complete file within ten minutes."

Half an hour later, he still hadn't received a response.

Two hours later, his phone finally rang.

"Any results?"

"Sir, this is the National Security Bureau. You have been flagged for unauthorized inquiry into classified state information. Our agents are en route to the Qin estate. Please prepare an explanation."

The line went dead.

Qin Youtian was dumbfounded.

Classified state information? When had he looked into state secrets?

Then it hit him--he'd just run a check on Jingang.

Could this be connected to the man his daughter had brought home?

The thought of Security Bureau agents arriving at his door sent a chill down his spine. Swallowing his pride, he frantically dialed Qin Yihan.
