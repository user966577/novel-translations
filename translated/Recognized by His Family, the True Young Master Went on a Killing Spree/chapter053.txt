Chapter 53: Try to Hold Back a Little

On the way there, Su Nuanyue was still lecturing Qin Yang.

"Try to hold back a little."

"Worried about me?"

She shot him a look. "I'm worried about them. I'm afraid you'll kill them."

Qin Yang: "..."

Was he really that violent?

"Relax. They're your relatives. I wouldn't kill them on sight."

At least not until a conflict arose. He kept that part to himself.

Su Nuanyue knew his temperament and abilities. He'd never be the one at a disadvantage. She just didn't want him going too far.

After all, her grandfather was still alive, and she didn't want to upset him.

If not for his support all these years, she never could have maintained control of the Su family.

They arrived at the old manor and stepped out of the car.

They were stopped at the gate immediately.

"Miss, the eldest young master has given instructions. You may enter, but no outsiders."

Outsiders?

Qin Yang looked left, then right, then pointed at himself.

"Yes. You."

A power play? Too amateurish. Utterly beneath him.

This kind of move might intimidate ordinary people, but to Qin Yang it only raised his anger meter.

Once that meter filled up, all bets were off.

A cultivator follows his heart.

So he kicked the guard. The man went flying.

Can't tell the difference between a king and a pawn? Getting kicked was generous.

"Let's go."

Su Nuanyue's eye twitched. They were already fighting, and they hadn't even walked through the door. She could only imagine how far Qin Yang would go once they got inside.

Her eldest cousin was definitely in for a bad night. Provoking Qin Yang was the dumbest decision he'd ever make.

The other guards saw what happened and didn't dare breathe a word.

Inside, watching through surveillance monitors, a young man's face darkened.

"Bold. Very bold. He thinks that with Su Nuanyue backing him, he can ignore the rules of our house."

Su Yulong--eldest grandson of the Su family.

He was capable in his own right, though nowhere near Su Nuanyue's level. Compared to her, he lacked both the temperament and the vision--narrow-minded and stubborn.

This was why he'd always played second fiddle.

He resented her bitterly. He was the eldest grandson of the main branch, yet a woman had seized control of the family. If Su Nuanyue were gone, that power would naturally fall to him.

He headed downstairs. The entire Su family had assembled.

Elders and juniors alike--over a dozen people in all. Only core family members had the privilege of being here.

An old man in his seventies sat at the center, his expression clouded.

He listened to the others talk, his breathing growing heavier.

Without exception, every single one of them was criticizing Su Nuanyue.

"She hasn't even arrived yet, and you're already going after her?" Old Master Su said coldly.

He was reaching his limit. The disappointment in his eyes was palpable.

These people were Su family members in name only. All they cared about was power and profit. If even one of them had half of Su Nuanyue's dedication to the family, the Su household would already dominate South City.

"Father, it's not that we're picking on her. She's a junior, yet she can't even be bothered to arrive before her elders. That's disrespectful."

This was Su Zhongtian, Su Nuanyue's eldest uncle.

Su Zhonghai spoke up: "She's just busy, big brother. Besides, it's not even time yet. Don't nitpick."

Su Zhongtian gave him a cold look. "Please. You used to trash-talk her constantly behind her back. Now you're playing the loving father?"

"I was manipulated. She's my daughter--how could I not care about her?"

"Give it a rest, Third Brother. That girl never treated you like a father anyway."

That was Su Zhongshan, the second brother--lazy in both manner and tone.

"That's right, Third Brother. Nuanyue has never given any of us the time of day."

This was Su Qiang, Nuanyue's aunt.

Su Zhonghai felt a chill. He realized he'd once been just like them.

Back then, he'd joined in the attacks. He couldn't imagine how Su Nuanyue must have felt--her own father turning against her.

She must have had an incredibly hard time.

"Enough. Shut up, all of you. One more bad word about Nuanyue and you're out."

Old Master Su's icy gaze swept the room. "Don't forget who gave you the lives you enjoy. Without Nuanyue running the company, do you think you'd have all this?"

No one was grateful.

Su Yulong even retorted, "Grandfather, we could manage the company just fine. You just wouldn't give us the chance. I won't speak for the others, but I'm every bit as capable as her."

"Me too," chimed Su Yumin, Su Zhongshan's son.

Old Master Su nearly laughed from sheer rage. These two overestimated themselves spectacularly.

Had they forgotten how many messes they'd created over the years? If Nuanyue hadn't cleaned up after them, they'd both be behind bars.

"Shut up. If I hear one more word against Nuanyue, I'm signing every last share over to her."

The nuclear option.

The room went dead silent.

If Su Nuanyue held all the shares, they were finished. She'd kick them out in a heartbeat.

They clamped their mouths shut, terrified the old man might actually follow through.

Su Zhonghai, on the other hand, silently wished they'd kept talking. A few more insults and the whole empire would have been Nuanyue's.

Ever since learning his son wasn't biologically his, all he wanted was to give Su Nuanyue the best of everything.
