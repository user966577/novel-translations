Chapter 65: Greetings, Senior Brother

"Why?" Qin Weiye demanded, face ashen.

"You know why."

Qin Weiye took a shuddering breath. Qin Yang knew everything.

"You knew, and you still dared kill him? Do you have a death wish?"

"Try calling that man of yours. See if anyone picks up."

Qin Weiye didn't understand, but he pulled out his phone.

It rang and rang. No answer.

He tried again. And again.

"How is this possible?"

"Sun Yihu is dead," Qin Yang said. "Scum like that—killing him was a public service."

Jingang must have handled it the moment he identified the target. That was his style.

Against the Dragon Pavilion, a petty criminal empire hadn't stood a chance. The whole thing was over before it started.

Qin Weiye sagged. The more he learned about Qin Yang, the more terrifying the picture became.

Sun Yihu's disappearance shattered any illusion of safety he'd clung to.

"If you're this powerful, why come back to us at all?"

"My parents brought me into this world. I owed them that much." Qin Yang's voice was flat. "Coming back was how I settled the debt. If you'd treated me well, I would have protected you for life. Given you everything you wanted. But if you couldn't manage basic decency, then this was my chance to sever all ties and close the karmic account."

Option two. They'd chosen option two.

They'd treated him like dirt.

So Qin Yang cut them loose without a backward glance.

"But Qin Li was your brother. Your own blood."

"And you sent him to kill Qin Xue. Your own daughter." Qin Yang's voice didn't waver. "I returned what was given. You set Qin Li on Qin Xue—am I not allowed to return the favor? Are the rules of this world written only for your convenience?"

Su Nuanyue spoke up, incredulous. "Qin Weiye, have you completely lost your mind? Even a tiger won't eat its own cubs."

"He despises Qin Yang so much he won't touch us, yet he'd murder his own daughter?" Du Li said in disbelief.

Qin Weiye laughed—a wild, ugly sound. His expression twisted with contempt.

"Daughter? She's just meat squeezed out by a woman I never loved. Kill her, keep her—makes no difference. Qin Li was my son. The rest of them are garbage. They should all be dead."

"Lunatic."

Ji Doudou kicked him hard enough to launch him across the plaza. He hit the pavement and didn't move.

"Want me to finish him off? I'll do it so you don't have to. He is your biological father, after all."

Qin Yang shook his head. "Sometimes being alive is worse than being dead. I'll let him live—and suffer. I'll strip everything from him, piece by piece."

Killing Qin Weiye would be a mercy. Making him watch his entire world crumble while he stood powerless to stop it? That was real punishment.

"Let's go."

The three women exchanged glances but said nothing. They assumed Qin Yang must be hurting—just hiding it well.

In the car, he caught their somber expressions. "Why so serious?"

"Are you... okay?" Du Li ventured. "If you need to cry, just let it out. We're all here."

"She's right," Ji Doudou added. "Don't hold it in."

Su Nuanyue nodded.

"Why would I be sad?"

"After everything Qin Weiye did—that doesn't hurt?"

Qin Yang smiled. "My earliest memories are of my master. He raised me, taught me everything I know. He's the one who matters. I never lacked a father's love."

In his heart, master equaled father.

"Qin Weiye is just a stranger who happens to share my DNA. An enemy, even. Why would I grieve over an enemy? A bit of blood means nothing on its own."

He was telling the truth. The indifference was genuine.

The tension finally left the car.

"All right. Let's head home. Early night tonight."

The women agreed.

What they didn't realize was that Qin Yang's version of "rest" involved all three of them.

He was up at dawn, refreshed and energized.

"Come on—time to meet Master."

All three shook their heads. They'd go in the afternoon.

"Why?"

"You animal," Du Li said, and went back to sleep.

The other two followed suit.

They'd come to accept that monopolizing Qin Yang was a physical impossibility. The man was a force of nature.

At two in the afternoon, they finally set out for White Cloud Temple.

The three women had expected a serene Daoist monastery, perhaps staffed by monks in flowing robes.

Instead, they found dozens of men in crisp black suits standing in rigid formation. At their head was an elderly man—silver-haired, ramrod-straight, and radiating vitality despite his age.

As the group stepped out of the car, every man in black bowed in unison.

"Greetings, Senior Brother."

Su Nuanyue nearly jumped out of her skin.

The sheer presence—the discipline, the deference—felt less like a temple welcome and more like a scene from a crime thriller.

She hadn't expected Qin Yang to command this level of respect within his own sect.
