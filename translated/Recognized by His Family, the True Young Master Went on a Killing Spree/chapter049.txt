Chapter 49: An Accidental Uncle-in-Law?

"What do you want, old man?"

Qin Yihan wasn't the least bit polite.

Ever since Qin Youtian had brought those illegitimate sons home, whatever respect she'd had for her father had all but evaporated.

"Tell Jingang--I didn't mean to pry. Ask him to call off the Security Bureau. I have no intention of stealing state secrets."

Qin Youtian's voice was bitter.

If he'd known his son-in-law had that kind of background, he never would have run that check. Now, if Jingang refused to intervene, he could be taken in for questioning.

"You investigated Jingang?"

Qin Yihan was furious.

Qin Youtian sighed. "He's going to be your husband. I can't know nothing about him. I just ran a basic background check, and the Security Bureau swooped in."

"Then enjoy your stay in a holding cell. Once you're locked up, I'll kick out all your illegitimate sons, and the whole estate will be mine."

Her tone dripped with schadenfreude.

"You ungrateful girl!"

In truth, Qin Youtian wasn't that worried. It was just a misunderstanding--the authorities would figure that out soon enough. He simply didn't want the embarrassment.

Qin Yihan hung up.

Jingang chuckled. "Let it go. He's your father. I'll make a call."

He pulled out his phone and dialed.

"Old Cao, that person who ran a check on me? That's my father-in-law. He was just worried about handing his daughter to a stranger, so he looked into me. Don't make a big deal out of it. No need to send anyone."

"Yeah. Thanks. I'll buy you a drink sometime."

He hung up.

"Lucky old bastard. I really wanted to see him get hauled away."

Qin Yihan said, annoyed.

Jingang laughed.

"Come on. Let's go get our certificate first, then I'll introduce you to a brother of mine. He happens to be in South City."

"Okay!"

Qin Yihan was thrilled. She'd been pursuing Jingang for a while now. He'd only recently accepted her, and now he was taking her to meet his closest people. It meant he'd fully accepted her.

As an orphan, Jingang's brothers were all the family he had.

After getting their certificate at the civil affairs bureau, Jingang posted a photo of it on social media.

Qin Yihan did the same.

Qin Yang and Ji Doudou had finished their cultivation session. Ji Doudou had fallen asleep from exhaustion.

Qin Yang scrolled through his phone and spotted the new post. When he saw Jingang's marriage certificate, his eyes nearly popped out of his skull.

"What the hell? Who's blind enough to marry you?"

He fired off a comment immediately.

Below it, more replies poured in--though Qin Yang couldn't see most of them. He could only see Jingang responding to the others.

"Brothers, when I get the chance, let's all get together. I'll introduce you to your sister-in-law."

Then Jingang messaged him privately.

"Where are you? I'm bringing my wife to meet you."

"At the Su residence. Come on over. I want to see which poor soul ended up as your wife. With that body of yours, what woman could handle you?"

"Screw you."

Jingang shot back, then headed for the Su estate with Qin Yihan.

At the Su residence, Qin Yang nudged Ji Doudou awake.

"My brother's coming. Get up and meet him. If he's ever in trouble, you can help out."

Hearing that, Ji Doudou snapped awake.

Her legs were still shaking. Clutching her lower back, she managed to shower, dress, and drag herself out of bed.

They'd barely stepped out of the room when they spotted Jingang and Qin Yihan standing in the main hall.

Qin Yihan's expression was peculiar. A bad feeling crept over her.

When she saw Qin Yang, she nearly blacked out.

Jingang's brother was Qin Yang?

What kind of cosmic joke was this?

She'd married her nephew's sworn brother.

Qin Yang, normally unflappable, was equally stunned.

"Where's your wife?" he asked Jingang.

Jingang wrapped his arm around Qin Yihan and grinned proudly. "Right here! Funny coincidence--you two even share a surname. Maybe you're related going back a few hundred years."

Both of them rolled their eyes internally. A few hundred years? They were related right now.

Jingang raised an eyebrow. "Well? What are you waiting for? Call her 'sister-in-law.'"

Qin Yang shook his head. "Can't do it. Absolutely cannot."

Jingang's face darkened. "Come on, Mystic. Are you too good for me now? Don't make me call the boss to sort you out."

"Please. If Qiao Yue came, she'd help me sort you out. Since when has she ever taken your side?"

Jingang rolled his eyes dramatically. That was probably true. Given how much their boss adored Qin Yang, she'd definitely beat Jingang up first.

Just then, Qin Yihan extended her hand with an awkward wave.

"Hey there, nephew. We meet again."

Nephew?

Jingang froze. Then his eyes went wide. "No way."

Qin Yihan smiled ruefully. "It's exactly what you think. Remember Qin Weiye from earlier? He's Qin Yang's biological father--and my father's illegitimate son. So Qin Yang is my nephew."

He'd become Mystic's uncle-in-law?

First came shock. Then pure, unbridled glee.

"Ha! This is perfect! Mystic--call me Uncle!"

Seeing his insufferably smug expression, Qin Yang sneered, "In your dreams. I don't even acknowledge the aunt, so where does that leave an uncle? Keep dreaming."

Despite the rejection, Jingang remained delighted.

Blood ties between Qin Yang and Qin Yihan were a fact no one could erase.

"Heh heh. Like it or not, I'm your uncle now. From now on, let's see you try to bully me. That'd be insubordination--unfilial, even!"

Ji Doudou observed quietly, "You're dreaming. Qin Yang slaps his own father around. You think a fake uncle scares him? I'd watch your mouth if I were you, or you might end up getting thrashed."

Jingang's laughter died in his throat.

She had a point.
