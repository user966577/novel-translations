Chapter 57: Not Seeing Anyone

Su Zhonghai nodded. "I know. I'll talk to them. If they refuse, let them die. They won't even punish the woman who tried to murder my daughter—what, is my daughter worth less than Su Qiang?"

Seeing this kind of conviction from Su Zhonghai, Qin Yang was genuinely surprised.

He hadn't expected such a dramatic transformation.

After a moment's thought, he said, "I like what I'm hearing. Keep saying things like that. As a reward, I'll fix up the rest of your injuries while I'm at it."

Before Su Zhonghai could process the words, Qin Yang was already working.

A surge of powerful energy flowed into his body. Every wound, every ache, every old injury—all of it began to heal.

Su Zhonghai's face lit up with shock and joy. He stared at Qin Yang, barely able to believe it.

He'd never imagined Qin Yang would simply heal all his injuries on the spot.

Within minutes, every last trace of damage was gone.

"Stand up and try walking."

Su Zhonghai hesitated, then rose to his feet.

He took a tentative step, then another—and found he felt no different from before his injuries. It was as though they'd never happened.

The excitement was almost too much to bear.

His injuries were gone. Completely healed.

All because of Qin Yang.

Su Zhonghai's faith in Qin Yang's medical abilities was now absolute. No wonder he was the Needle Saint's teacher.

The man truly had the skills to back it up.

*I got lucky,* Su Zhonghai thought. *Having a son-in-law like this.*

Su Nuanyue was equally stunned. Witnessing Qin Yang's miraculous healing again, she realized she still didn't truly understand the full extent of what he could do.

He never stopped surprising her.

Qin Yang was like a treasure vault—every time you looked, there was something new. You never knew how many more surprises he had in store.

Du Li, however, was shocked for a different reason.

What Qin Yang had just done wasn't ordinary healing. It was closer to marrow cleansing and bone refinement—a complete reconstruction of the body.

A Terrestrial Immortal could theoretically perform this technique, but never as effortlessly as Qin Yang had. Using it would severely deplete their vitality, requiring a long recovery period.

Yet Qin Yang hadn't even broken a sweat. He showed no signs of exertion—not even a heavy breath.

"We're family. No need for formality," Qin Yang said. "Just treat Nuanyue well from now on. That's all I ask."

Su Zhonghai's approval of him reached new heights.

"Don't worry," he said immediately. "She's my daughter. Of course I'll treat her well."

Qin Yang nodded.

Su Zhonghai left.

When word reached the Su family that Su Zhonghai had returned from Su Nuanyue's residence with all his injuries healed and practically glowing with happiness, they knew at once.

The poison had been neutralized. And more than that—Qin Yang had healed his injuries too.

Injuries that severe, cured in less than half an hour?

That was unheard of. Almost supernatural.

The realization made them anxious.

"Dad, are we really not going to ask Qin Yang to cure us?" Su Zhongtian asked.

"Scared?" Old Master Su sneered.

"Who wouldn't be?" Su Zhongtian said bitterly. "That poison is sitting inside us—who knows when it'll kill us? And our own sister did this. She didn't treat us as family at all. She poisoned every single one of us over a bit of property."

Despite everything, the pain in his voice was genuine. He'd always been good to his younger sister.

This was how Su Qiang repaid him.

"I'll handle this," Old Master Su said. "I'll speak with Nuanyue. She's a sensible girl—she'll forgive her aunt."

A flicker of determination crossed his face.

Su Yulong spoke up. "Grandfather, can't you see? Nuanyue is done with us. And even if she weren't—it wouldn't matter. The one making decisions isn't Nuanyue. It's Qin Yang."

He added with certainty, "Unless Qin Yang agrees, it doesn't matter how much you beg Nuanyue. She won't go over his head."

"Exactly," Su Zhongshan agreed. "Doing that would undermine Qin Yang. Nuanyue would never."

Old Master Su grew irritated. "I know what I'm doing. I don't need any of you to teach me."

Everyone fell silent, frustrated but cowed. They wanted to push back, but one look at the old man's fury killed the impulse. If he dug in and refused to seek help, they were all doomed.

So they swallowed their protests and stewed in anxiety.

That night, everyone in the Su family except Su Zhonghai and Su Nuanyue lay awake.

Their minds raced. Su Zhongtian and the others had begun to accept that they might actually die.

If Old Master Su wouldn't deal with Su Qiang, Qin Yang wouldn't lift a finger, and there was no removing the poison.

Survival seemed impossibly out of reach.

The next morning, bleary-eyed and haggard, they showed up at Su Nuanyue's door.

They didn't even make it inside before Du Li threw them out.

"Miss doesn't want to see any of you. Get out."

Her voice was frigid. She made no effort at courtesy—she was Su Nuanyue's bodyguard, not a member of the Su family.

Not even Old Master Su could give Du Li orders.

Unless Su Nuanyue herself spoke up, Du Li would answer to no one.

The Su family members didn't dare make a scene. They could only leave in frustration.

Then Old Master Su himself arrived.

Du Li blocked him just the same.

"You won't even let me in? Du Li, you'd stop even me?"

The old man was visibly angry. He'd always had a decent relationship with Su Nuanyue—the closest in the family.

Because of that, Du Li had always shown him respect.

But after learning what the old man had done, that respect evaporated.

"No," Du Li said with a cold laugh.

"What if I insist?"

Old Master Su narrowed his eyes and pushed forward.

The next instant, he felt himself being lifted off the ground and hurled through the air.

He stumbled on landing and fell hard.

Pointing a trembling finger at Du Li, the old man sputtered with rage. She'd actually thrown him out.

"I said Miss isn't seeing anyone. You have thirty seconds to leave. After that, I start hitting."

"You wouldn't dare."

Du Li cracked her knuckles. "Try me."

Old Master Su got in his car and drove away.

Getting beaten up in front of everyone would be a humiliation he'd never live down.
