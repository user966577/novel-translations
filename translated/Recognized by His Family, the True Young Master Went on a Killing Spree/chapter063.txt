Chapter 63: Hunting the Enemy

Qin Yang dropped Qin Xue off in the city and drove away.

She watched his car disappear, then clenched her fists. Progress.

Remembering his instructions, she immediately bought a wheelchair, sat in it, and called the Jiang family to come pick her up.

Jiang Wanrou came personally. Her eyes reddened the moment she saw Qin Xue.

"I've been calling you nonstop! No one answered. I thought something terrible had happened."

Despite her own troubles, Jiang Wanrou's love for Qin Xue and Qin Wan was genuine. If anything happened to either of them, she wouldn't survive it.

"My phone was on silent, Mom. I'm fine."

"Thank god. I was terrified that Qin Yang had done something to you."

Qin Xue's heart clenched. "Mom, he's my real brother. He'd never hurt me."

Jiang Wanrou scoffed. "What about your legs? Did you forget?"

She wanted desperately to tell her mother that Qin Yang had just healed her—but she knew Jiang Wanrou's hatred ran too deep. Revealing it now would only complicate things.

Give it time.

"Let's go home, Mom. I'm tired."

"Of course."

"One more thing—please increase security around the house. Something about Dad feels off. I'm worried he might try to hurt you."

Jiang Wanrou stiffened.

She studied Qin Xue. "When did you change wheelchairs?"

Qin Xue froze, then recovered quickly. "Today. You probably didn't notice."

Jiang Wanrou looked unconvinced but let it go, her expression thoughtful.

Qin Xue's nerves were frayed. She knew her mother's temperament—if Jiang Wanrou learned the truth about Qin Weiye now, she'd confront him on the spot.

And then their so-called father would have every reason to accelerate his plans against all of them.

She sighed inwardly. If only she hadn't burned bridges with Qin Yang. His protection would have made everything simple.

But there were no second chances.

Mother and daughter returned to the Jiang estate, each lost in thought.

Meanwhile, Qin Yang called Jingang.

"Mystic! What can your uncle-in-law do for you?"

"Look into Qin Weiye. He made a move against Qin Xue today—sent a team of hardened killers after her. Not the type he could recruit himself."

"On it. Give me half an hour."

Jingang hung up and got to work.

Beside him, Qin Yihan stirred, bleary-eyed. "What's going on?"

"Something's up with Qin Weiye. Nothing major—I'll have my people look into it."

She nodded. "That man always rubbed me the wrong way. Good to get clarity."

Jingang dispatched his operatives.

Qin Yang headed to Ji Doudou's place.

She was still streaming. He slipped in behind her and wrapped his arms around her.

The chat exploded.

Ji Doudou's fortune-telling had grown increasingly accurate, and her fame was rising fast. Her live audience regularly topped a thousand viewers, and some tuned in purely for her looks. Seeing a man get that intimate set them off.

"My goddess has a man?!"

"Who's that guy? I challenge him to a duel—winner gets Doudou!"

"Get your filthy paws off her!"

"Unfollowed. 'Mystic Doudou'? More like shameless."

But the long-time fans pushed back:

"She's always had a boyfriend."

"That's the old #1 donor. Her destined husband."

"She never pretended to be single. You guys are projecting."

As the arguments escalated, Ji Doudou stepped in with a smile. "Everyone, I'm a fortune-telling streamer. Everything else is irrelevant. This is my man. Take it or leave it."

A wave of unfollows. Some demanded refunds for their donations.

"Refunds? Not happening. Don't even think about it."

She kicked the loudest complainers from the chat.

"That's all for today, friends. My man's here and we've got plans."

She ended the stream, turned off the camera, and threw her arms around Qin Yang.

Things got heated fast.

Afterward, Ji Doudou said, "You smell like blood. Killed someone?"

Nothing got past her.

He nodded and told her everything.

Ji Doudou traced invisible patterns in the air, her fingers moving through a divination. "Qin Weiye is truly ruthless—willing to murder his own daughter. But the people behind him aren't simple. The underground king of the northern half of South Province... He wants to absorb the Qin family, use their businesses to take over South City, then push into the south."

"I know who it is," Qin Yang said.

Sun Yihu.

The undisputed ruler of northern South Province's underworld.

He'd conquered the north but couldn't push south—South City stood in his way. So he'd found a workaround: install Qin Weiye as a puppet, swallow the Qin family's resources, and use them to take the city from within.

By the time Ye Longfei caught on, it would be too late.

"They're just mortals," Ji Doudou said lightly. "Kill them and be done with it."

She said it with the same casual tone most people used for ordering takeout.

Qin Yang smiled. In the eyes of cultivators, people like Sun Yihu were nothing.

"Why do you do the livestreaming, anyway?" he asked.

"To find my enemies."

She didn't bother hiding it.

"Using yourself as bait," Qin Yang said. "Building exposure so the people who destroyed the Ji family will notice you. When they come for you, you'll finally have a trail to follow."

"Smart boy."

"Too dangerous."
