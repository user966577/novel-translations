Chapter 47: I'm Your Child Too

An old man in his seventies sat at the head of the room, his spirit remarkably vigorous.

This was none other than Qin Youtian, patriarch of the Qin family.

Qin Youtian had been a philanderer since his youth, leaving behind no shortage of romantic debts.

It wasn't until he married his wife that he finally showed some restraint.

Even so, rumors of illegitimate children surfaced from time to time.

Now, his legitimate son was dead.

Only one legitimate daughter remained.

Qin Youtian had no choice but to bring the illegitimate sons into the family and select an heir.

After all, he couldn't possibly hand the massive Qin family empire to a woman.

Among them, he was most impressed by Qin Weiye.

Qin Weiye had talent. He'd built a respectable business empire on his own. Compared to the others, he was leagues ahead.

Besides Qin Weiye, there were five other illegitimate sons.

Most of them were just ordinary people.

When they learned they were being brought into the Qin family, their first reaction wasn't joy--it was terror.

In families like these, fights over inheritance were life-and-death affairs. For ordinary people, this kind of world was overwhelming.

Qin Weiye, on the other hand, was perfectly at ease. Compared to the others, he appeared far more composed. Though he couldn't entirely mask his excitement, his eyes burned with unmistakable ambition.

Qin Youtian studied them one by one. When he looked at the others, he couldn't help frowning.

Only when facing Qin Weiye did he give a slight nod.

Though Qin Weiye had recently become something of a laughingstock and had been driven to bankruptcy--well, who didn't face setbacks in life?

Against a behemoth like the Su family, even Qin Youtian himself couldn't have done better in Qin Weiye's position.

There was another important reason he favored Qin Weiye: Qin Yang.

Qin Weiye was at odds with Qin Yang and had never treated him well.

But Qin Youtian had done some digging. Qin Yang was no ordinary person.

If Qin Yang were willing, Qin Youtian wouldn't mind making him the heir directly.

This was a descendant far more capable than Qin Weiye.

"You've all done well. From today forward, you are members of the Qin family. I will assign each of you a company and give you one year. Whoever produces the best results earns the position of heir."

Everyone's hearts stirred with anticipation.

Even the ones who'd been ordinary people until now felt a spark of ambition. If they worked hard enough, maybe they really could carve out a future.

The air grew heavy with excitement.

Only Qin Weiye remained calm, clearly confident. Compared to these brothers of his, he had every advantage. With the Jiang family's support and his own years of business acumen, crushing the competition would be child's play.

"Father, I want to participate too."

A voice rang out, sharp with displeasure.

Qin Youtian didn't even glance at the newcomer. "No."

"Why not? I'm your child too."

Qin Yihan strode in, eyes blazing.

"You're a girl. You'll marry out eventually."

Qin Yihan scoffed. "I'm over thirty and still unmarried. What 'eventually'? If you're worried, I'll find a live-in husband right now. He'll marry into our family, and any children will carry the Qin name."

Qin Youtian paused. That wasn't entirely unreasonable.

Only Qin Weiye frowned.

The legitimate line had produced one son and one daughter. Qin Yihan was that daughter.

When her brother was alive, she'd had no interest in the family fortune. She was content to live under his protection--he would have looked after her for life.

But now her brother and nephew were dead.

She couldn't afford to stay idle. She had to stand up and protect what her brother had built.

That fortune was something her mother had fought alongside her father to create. Why should it go to some mistress's bastards?

The thought hardened her resolve.

Qin Youtian fell silent.

Qin Weiye spoke up: "Your argument makes no sense. With all of us sons here, why should a daughter inherit? It's not as if the Qin family lacks male heirs."

Qin Yihan fixed him with an icy stare. "I know exactly who you are, Qin Weiye. You raised your mistress's brat while throwing your own flesh and blood away. You're worse than an animal. Someone with that kind of character--a mistress's bastard--you think you deserve to be the Qin family heir? Let me make this clear: as long as I'm alive, no one is taking what belongs to my brother and my mother."

Her words sent a flash of fury through Qin Weiye's eyes.

"We've been formally recognized," he said coolly. "By seniority, you should be calling me 'big brother.'"

"A mistress's bastard wants to play patriarch? What a joke. In my eyes, you're lower than a dog."

Qin Yihan didn't mince words.

All six illegitimate sons glared at her with hatred. Her words had struck their deepest wound.

"Enough! Shut your mouth!" Qin Youtian barked.

Qin Yihan stared him down, neck stiff. "Are you giving me this chance or not?"

Qin Youtian drew a deep breath. "I'll give you the chance. But on one condition."

"Name it."

Relief flooded through her. The old man had finally budged. If he hadn't, seizing the family fortune would have been far more troublesome.

"If you want to inherit, you must outperform them significantly--not just by a slim margin. Remember, you're only a daughter."

"Fine."

"Don't agree so quickly. There's another condition. You must get married soon. Otherwise, I won't believe you'll actually take a live-in husband."

"That's easy," Qin Yihan said casually. "I already have a boyfriend. We can get our marriage certificate today."

Qin Youtian was stunned.

He almost couldn't believe his ears.

Qin Yihan had always been a committed singleton, uninterested in men since childhood.

The family had assumed she was joking--until she hit her thirties still showing zero interest, and they'd actually panicked.

Now she had a boyfriend?

Was this real? She hadn't hired an actor, had she?

"You didn't hire someone to put on a show, did you? I've read plenty of novels. Don't think you can fool me."

Qin Yihan rolled her eyes. "He's not someone you can just hire for a performance. He wouldn't even give our Qin family a second glance."

She called toward the door. "Come in."

A tall, powerfully built man walked in.

One look at his rippling muscles and the fierce, battle-hardened aura radiating from him, and everyone's expression changed.

Qin Youtian's eyes flickered. He wasn't naive enough to mistake this man for a gym trainer. The killing intent he exuded made even Qin Youtian's heart tremble.
