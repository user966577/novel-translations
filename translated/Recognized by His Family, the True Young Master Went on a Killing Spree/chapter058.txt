Chapter 58: The Big Shots Gather

After Old Master Su left, Du Li was still fuming.

She'd genuinely respected the old man before. After all, among the entire Su family, he'd been the best to Su Nuanyue.

Now she saw it was all an act.

His real affection was reserved for his own sons, daughters, and grandsons.

Su Nuanyue's place in his heart had never been particularly high.

Du Li snorted in contempt. Conniving old fraud.

She stormed back into the villa, visibly agitated.

"What are you so worked up about? People like them aren't worth it." Qin Yang pulled Du Li into his arms.

She struggled briefly, failed to break free, and gave up.

"Miss's family are all absolute freaks," she fumed. "If I didn't care about her feelings, I'd kill every last one of them."

Qin Yang chuckled. "Killing them would be easy enough. I just don't want Nuanyue to be hurt by it."

Su Nuanyue emerged from her room.

"They're not guilty enough to deserve death," she said evenly. "And they're no threat to me, which is why I tolerate them. But if they won't deal with Su Qiang, I absolutely won't let Qin Yang cure them. Su Qiang tried to take my life. If they think that's not serious, then I won't consider their deaths serious either."

Su Nuanyue lived by one simple principle: treat others as they treat you.

Everything else was noise.

"Du Li, go with Nuanyue to the office," Qin Yang said. "If anyone tries to cause trouble there, throw them out."

"Gladly." Du Li was itching for the chance.

Su Nuanyue smiled. At least she had these two.

Du Li and Su Nuanyue headed to the company.

They found Old Master Su and the rest of the family blocking the entrance.

Su Nuanyue didn't spare them a glance.

"Nuanyue, are you really going to treat us like this?" Old Master Su called out.

Su Nuanyue stopped. Her stare made the old man flinch—cold and distant, as though she were looking at a stranger.

"What I mean is—are you really going to ignore the entire family over Su Qiang?"

His tone softened.

Su Nuanyue said nothing.

Du Li spoke for her, voice dripping with contempt. "Old Master Su, as long as the guilty party receives proper punishment, Qin Yang will treat all of you. Even if you pressure Nuanyue, it won't help. She doesn't have the final say on this."

"Silence!" the old man barked.

Du Li smirked and closed her mouth. Her expression made her disdain perfectly clear.

Old Master Su took a deep breath. "Nuanyue, if you insist on this path, you can forget about controlling the Su family."

The temperature around Su Nuanyue dropped several degrees. She'd been content to remain silent, but now her gaze swept over every one of them like a blade.

"Fine."

Old Master Su's eyes went wide, as if he'd heard something incomprehensible.

"Think carefully, Nuanyue. The only reason Qin Yang is with you is because you run the Su family. It's not about who you are. Lose that position, and he'll abandon you."

"The Su family's leadership? What does that even matter?" A cold laugh cut through the air. "If Miss Su wants it, our Mr. Qin can set her up with something far bigger."

Lu Lixing had appeared at the company entrance.

Old Master Su's expression shifted—stunned more by Lu Lixing's words than by his presence.

"CEO Lu, what exactly do you mean?"

Lu Lixing didn't even look at him. He addressed the crowd at large: "If Su Nuanyue is no longer the Su family's head, the Lu family will terminate every partnership with the Su family. Permanently."

Old Master Su's face drained of color.

Before he could respond, another voice rang out.

"I, Gu Tianming, will say the same. If Miss Su is removed from leadership, the Gu family will cancel all cooperation with the Su family as well."

Gu Tianming arrived with a stern expression. But in front of Su Nuanyue, he was all warmth and deference. "Miss Su," he greeted with a respectful nod.

Su Nuanyue nodded back, puzzled. "What brings you all here?"

"It was the Immortal Master—I mean, Mr. Qin, who called us," Gu Tianming explained with a smile.

It was Qin Yang's doing. Su Nuanyue understood immediately.

He must have anticipated that her family would try to pressure her and called in reinforcements.

More people arrived in quick succession.

The most shocking was Xu Liang—the City Chief of South City.

"Sister-in-law," Xu Liang said with a sigh, "Brother Qin Yang went too far this time—almost let you get bullied, treating me like an outsider. From now on, if you ever need anything, come to me. Anyone who messes with you—if I can't handle it, I'll get my old man involved. I've got people above me, but my old man? He's basically at the top."

Old Master Su felt a chill run down his spine.

City Chief Xu Liang was extraordinarily well-connected.

And he was protecting Su Nuanyue.

Everyone knew about Xu Liang's father. The man was essentially one of the most powerful people in the country.

Yet Xu Liang had ties to Qin Yang.

Several other CEOs voiced their support for Su Nuanyue as well.

Old Master Su was backed into a corner.

Then Qin Youtian arrived.

He sneered. "Su, you old ghost—bullying my grandson's wife? Do you think you can disrespect the Qin family?"

Grandson's wife?

Confusion rippled through the crowd. Not many people knew the connection between Qin Weiye and Qin Youtian.

The recent acknowledgment of Qin Weiye as Qin Youtian's son had been kept quiet—after all, illegitimate children weren't exactly something to boast about.

"Qin Youtian, what nonsense are you spouting? Who's your grandson's wife?" Old Master Su shot back.

Qin Youtian glanced at Su Nuanyue with a smile. "Qin Yang is my biological grandson. That makes Nuanyue my grandson's wife." He turned to Su Nuanyue directly. "Nuanyue, if the Su family doesn't want you, I'll give you control of the Qin family instead. From today on, you can be the Qin family's matriarch."

He'd had his eye on Su Nuanyue's abilities for a long time. Now that she was his granddaughter-in-law, recruiting her to manage the Qin family would be the ideal outcome.

He stared at Su Nuanyue, hope written plainly on his face.

This time, Old Master Su was genuinely panicking.
