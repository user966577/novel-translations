Lin Jianguo looked at those eyes of his son—cold, devoid of any emotion—and his heart jolted!

He knew Lin Yuan wasn't joking.

He wasn't being impulsive either.

He had truly... developed killing intent!

That was the absolute killing intent of a supreme being, looking down on all life with indifference!

Lin Jianguo was silent for a moment.

His iron-blooded killing aura, powerful enough to change the color of heaven and earth, slowly receded.

He knew his son had grown up.

He had his own code of conduct, his own path to invincibility.

He shouldn't interfere too much.

He only needed to stand behind his son.

If the sky fell, he'd hold it up for him!

If gods and demons descended, he'd slaughter through them together!

"Good."

Lin Jianguo nodded heavily, his voice unprecedentedly solemn.

"Go."

"One hour."

"If you're not back in one hour."

"I will personally lead a million troops to flatten the Liu family and reduce everything within a hundred miles to rubble!"

His words rang with conviction!

Full of unquestionable dominance and... indulgence!

My son, Lin Jianguo's son, wants to kill someone? Then kill!

After you've killed, whatever trouble comes, your old man will shoulder it!

"Won't need an hour."

The corner of Lin Yuan's mouth curved slightly.

"Just killing some ants. It'll be quick."

As his words fell.

His figure, under Lin Jianguo's watchful gaze, began to blur and distort.

As if the space beneath his feet had become a pool of calm water disturbed by a pebble.

Mysterious ripples spread outward in rings.

Next second.

Hum——!

Lin Yuan's figure simply vanished from where he stood!

Without a trace of spiritual energy fluctuation.

Without a sign of spatial tearing.

Just like that, he was gone.

As if he had never belonged to this space.

Lin Jianguo stared at the empty courtyard, his pupils contracting sharply!

This was...

Kunpeng Wandering Step? When had Lin Yuan mastered such a divine ability?!

At the same time.

Liu Family Estate.

Inside the council hall, the atmosphere was oppressively tense.

Liu Qingtian sat in the patriarch's seat, his sinister face twisted with nervousness and anticipation.

His fingers gripped the armrest like a death vice.

He was waiting!

Waiting for news from the Divine Court!

Waiting for word that that little beast Lin Yuan had been beheaded!

He had staked everything!

As long as Lin Yuan died, the Lin family would be enraged, but would also be crippled by losing their most important heir!

Then the Divine Court could exploit the opening!

And his Liu family, as the greatest contributor, would receive unimaginable rewards!

He would rise to the heavens in a single bound!

Just as he was lost in his manic fantasies.

"Pa... Patriarch! Something's wrong!"

A servant came scrambling through the door, terror written across his face!

"Patriarch! The soul lamp in the forbidden grounds... the soul lamp is shattered!"

BOOM!!!

This sentence struck Liu Qingtian's crown like divine lightning!

The soul lamp... shattered?!

That lamp was connected to the token he'd given the Divine Court assassins!

When the lamp shattered, it meant...

The mission had failed!

The two Meridian Opening top assassins he'd sent were dead!

"No... impossible... this is absolutely impossible!"

Liu Qingtian shot up from his chair, letting out a shrill, disbelieving howl!

Those were two Meridian Opening powerhouses!

The Divine Court's elite assassins!

Sent to kill one measly Qi Sea Realm brat—how could they have failed?!

However.

Before he could recover from this devastating blow.

A cold voice, devoid of any human warmth, lazy as a death knell from the Nine Nethers.

Clearly echoed across the entire Liu family estate!

"Liu Qingtian."

"I've come."

"Get out here and die."

In an instant!

Liu Qingtian's blood felt as if it had frozen solid!

He rushed out of the hall and looked up.

There, atop the Liu family estate's tall gate tower, cast in refined iron.

A young figure stood quietly, hands clasped behind his back.

Moonlight draped over him, stretching his shadow long and far.

He stood there so casually, yet seemed like the sole sovereign of the entire world!

It was Lin Yuan!

How... how could he be here?!

He was supposed to be at the Lin family estate!

From the assassins' deaths to his appearance here...

Mere breaths had passed!

How did he get here?!

Did he fly?!

No! Even a Meridian Opening expert couldn't be this fast!

Endless terror, like icy tides, instantly drowned Liu Qingtian's heart!

"Stop him!!"

"Everyone! On him! Stop him!"

Liu Qingtian let out a hysterical, maddened roar!

He knew there was no retreat now!

Today, either Lin Yuan died, or his Liu family perished!

"Kill him! Whoever can kill him! I, Liu Qingtian, will reward them handsomely—cultivation resources, divine weapons, whatever you want!"

With heavy reward comes brave fools!

In an instant!

The entire Liu family estate erupted!

Countless figures poured out from every corner!

Liu family guards!

Liu family retainers!

Liu family death warriors!

A full several hundred strong!

Every one of their eyes gleamed with greed and madness!

They surged like a black flood, carrying sky-high killing intent, toward that lone figure atop the gate tower!

"KILL!!!"

The thunderous war cry nearly overturned the night sky of Yan Jing City!

However.

Facing this formation terrifying enough to make any expert blanch.

Lin Yuan's face showed only its usual calm.

He just dug at his ear, somewhat impatiently.

"So noisy."

Then.

He lifted his foot.

And stomped lightly downward.

Hum——!

No earth-shaking roar.

No heaven-destroying energy explosion.

An invisible wave, containing the might of heaven and earth itself, rippled outward with his foot as the center, like water!

Wherever it passed.

Time seemed to freeze.

Those hundreds of charging Liu family guards—their expressions froze in an instant!

Their bodies locked in place as if under a paralysis spell!

Immediately after.

Pff! Pff! Pff! Pff!...

A dense succession of sounds, like rain on banana leaves, erupted all at once!

Those hundreds of Liu family elites—whether Qi Sea guards or Meridian Opening retainers...

Their bodies, like fragile porcelain, exploded under that invisible wave!

Reduced to clouds of blood mist!

In an instant!

The entire plaza before the Liu family gate was cleared!

All that remained were scattered limbs and a stench of blood thick enough to choke.

Dead silence!

The entire world fell into dead silence!

Liu Qingtian stood frozen at the hall entrance.

His mouth hung open, his eyes bulging as if they might pop from their sockets!

He stared at the carnage, at that figure still standing atop the gate tower, pristine and untouched.

His mind went blank!

One stomp!

Just one stomp!

His Liu family's proud hundreds of elite warriors!

Just like that... gone?!

Without even touching a corner of his opponent's clothes!

What kind of power was this?!

Was this power that humans could possess?!

Just as his soul shattered and his courage crumbled.

Lin Yuan's cold voice sounded once more.

"The noisy flies have been cleaned up."

He lowered his gaze, his eyes piercing hundreds of meters precisely to land on Liu Qingtian.

"Now, it's your turn."
