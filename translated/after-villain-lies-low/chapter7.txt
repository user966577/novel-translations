Lin Ke'er stood to the side, initially listening in confusion.

But as Lin Yuan continued his explanation, she felt as though a window had been thrown open in her mind. All the obstacles she couldn't understand before were instantly resolved!

She stared at the diagram on the ground—more perfect, more mysterious than even the textbook's standard formation diagrams.

Then she looked at her brother, who acted as if it were nothing special. Her little mouth dropped into an "O" shape, her eyes filling with stars of admiration.

"Wow! Big brother! When did you become so amazing!"

Lin Ke'er threw herself at Lin Yuan's arm, her face full of shock. "You explain it even better than the special-grade formation teacher at the academy!"

Lin Yuan stood up, dusting off his hands, his expression matter-of-fact as he boasted, "Of course. Who do you think your brother is? I'm a one-in-a-million genius. This little stuff? Self-taught."

"Psh, keep bragging!"

Just then, a cool voice came from nearby.

A stunningly beautiful woman in a high-end tailored business suit, tall and sharp in demeanor, stood leaning against a corridor pillar with her arms crossed, watching them.

Her features bore some resemblance to Lin Yuan's, but her brows carried an additional air of authority and edge from long holding power.

"All you know is how to goof around. Only little Ke'er here would believe your nonsense. Xiao Yuan, even though our family has wealth and power, the martial path is like rowing against the current—if you don't advance, you fall behind. You still need to put in effort yourself."

Hearing this familiar, nagging "lecture," Lin Yuan's head immediately began to ache.

No need to ask—his workaholic sister who commanded a massive business empire, Lin Mengyao, was back.

Their grandfather guarded the frontier, and their parents held high positions, rarely home—mostly communicating via video calls.

So this sister, only a few years older than him, had naturally taken on the role of "head of the household."

Every time she came back, she subjected him to ideological education.

"Sis, why do I feel like you're becoming more and more like Mom?"

Lin Yuan couldn't help but retort.

"Hey! You little brat, you dare mock me now?"

Lin Mengyao's beautiful eyes widened. In a flash, she appeared before Lin Yuan and rapped her fair knuckles against his head—not too hard, not too soft.

"Ow!"

"Hehe!"

Lin Yuan's exaggerated yelp and Lin Ke'er's bell-like laughter echoed through the cozy courtyard.

The family chatted and laughed as they walked toward the dining room, preparing to enjoy the late-night snacks their sister had specially brought home.

Time flew, and the school-wide competition drew ever closer.

The entire Capital Martial Arts Academy was permeated with an atmosphere of tension.

All students were frantically cultivating in these final days, trying to achieve good results in the competition.

Especially Ye Xuan.

Ever since Lin Yuan cut off his "financial pipeline," he seemed to have become a different person, training ten times harder than before.

Every day he was either challenging his limits in the gravity chamber or accepting various high-difficulty missions from the task hall.

Using combat to temper himself, exchanging blood for resources.

Under his relentless effort and the Supreme Dao Ancestor's guidance in his mind, his cultivation had indeed progressed by leaps and bounds.

Finally, three days before the competition began, he successfully broke through his bottleneck!

"BOOM!"

In the cultivation room, a powerful aura erupted from within Ye Xuan. He snapped his eyes open, brilliant light flashing in them!

Marrow Cleansing Realm second level!

Feeling the spiritual power within him—several times stronger than before—Ye Xuan's face broke into a confident smile.

Though he was only at second level, he had the secret techniques the Supreme Dao Ancestor had taught him and combat experience far beyond ordinary people.

He was confident that even facing someone ordinary at fifth or sixth level Marrow Cleansing Realm, he could put up a fight!

And Lin Yuan?

Only Marrow Cleansing Realm sixth level.

Ye Xuan firmly believed that was nothing but a hollow realm Lin Yuan had stacked up using resources—impressive-looking but useless!

In real life-or-death combat, realm wasn't the only deciding factor!

An intense battle intent burned in his chest.

He wanted to challenge Lin Yuan!

He wanted to utterly crush this young master who had always been above him, right in front of everyone, before the competition even began—washing away all his previous humiliation!

Thought became action.

Ye Xuan immediately rose and stormed out of the cultivation room, heading straight for the rear garden where Lin Yuan usually hung out.

Sure enough, he spotted that familiar figure at first glance.

Lin Yuan was sprawled out on the lawn.

Chewing on a grass stem, legs crossed, humming some unknown tune while sunbathing.

That leisurely, carefree appearance was completely at odds with the tense atmosphere pervading the entire academy.

Seeing this scene, the rage in Ye Xuan's heart shot up instantly, veins bulging on his forehead.

He was killing himself training here, and this guy was lying around sleeping?

"Lin Yuan!"

Ye Xuan strode over, his voice like thunder. "You waste! Do you dare have a proper match with me?"

Lin Yuan was disturbed and opened his eyes with irritation, yawning as he gave Ye Xuan a lazy glance.

"Match with you? Why?"

"You!" Ye Xuan nearly spat blood from this couldn't-care-less attitude. "Are you scared?"

"Scared?" Lin Yuan seemed to have heard the world's greatest joke. "I just have no interest. Would beating you make me lie more comfortably, or make the sun feel warmer?"

These casual words dealt Ye Xuan more damage than ten thousand vicious curses!

This was blatant disregard!

"You're asking for death!"

Ye Xuan lost all composure. His spiritual power instantly erupted—he was about to attack directly.

"Hold it! Kid, don't be rash!"

In his mind, the Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice urgently rang out. "This one's aura is steady and deep, unfathomable! Acting rashly now is not in your favor! Endure this moment. Defeating him at the competition, in front of all the important figures—that's the wisest course!"

"I can't endure anymore!" Ye Xuan roared mentally. "Today I'm going to utterly crush him! Make him know who the real genius is!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor couldn't dissuade him and could only sigh inwardly.

Just as Ye Xuan was about to strike, a figure approached.

"Ye Xuan."

It was Li Xuan'er.

She hurried over, and when she saw Lin Yuan on the lawn, her expression became visibly awkward and uncomfortable.

But she still didn't speak to Lin Yuan, instead looking directly at Ye Xuan.

"Ye Xuan, come with me for a moment. I need to talk to you."

Recently, having lost Lin Yuan's resource supply, Li Xuan'er had deeply experienced how difficult cultivation could be.

Her progress had slowed to a crawl, still stuck at Marrow Cleansing Realm third level with no improvement whatsoever. This made her feel an unprecedented sense of crisis.

So she wanted to team up with Ye Xuan, to train together and acquire resources.

However, Ye Xuan was at the height of his anger. Seeing Li Xuan'er only made it worse.

It was because of this woman that he'd been humiliated by Lin Yuan and lost his funding!

Now that this path was cut off, what use was she to him anymore?

Ye Xuan shot her a cold glance, his tone harsh. "I'm busy lately. No time."

Without waiting for Li Xuan'er's reaction, he forced down his urge to attack, gave a cold snort, and strode away.

Leaving Li Xuan'er standing there alone, stunned.

She watched Ye Xuan's retreating back, showing no reluctance to leave, then glanced at Lin Yuan in the distance, who couldn't even be bothered to look at her.

In her heart...

For the first time, an indescribable sense of bewilderment and regret welled up.
