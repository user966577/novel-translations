That announcement was the final straw, completely crushing Ye Xuan's proud Dao heart.

Humiliation!

Unprecedented humiliation!

He, Ye Xuan, bearer of great fortune, with an ancient master at his side—he thought himself the true dragon destined by fate!

He had endured countless hardships, poured out a hundred times more sweat than anyone else, to achieve what he had today.

He had believed this tournament, with all eyes watching, would be his stage to soar to the heavens by stepping on Lin Yuan's corpse.

But what was the result?

He couldn't even qualify to make the other man lift a finger!

Just a single thought, a single wave of pressure, and he was defeated!

Defeated so thoroughly, so pathetically, so laughably!

"Why... why is this happening..."

Ye Xuan lay prone on the ground, his body unable to move. Only blood and tears of humiliation mixed together, sliding down from the corner of his eye.

He didn't understand!

He couldn't comprehend it!

Lin Yuan, that good-for-nothing who had nothing but his family background, that pampered young master who did nothing but lie around and sleep all day—how could he possibly possess such terrifying power!

This didn't make sense!

This wasn't fair!

"Master... Master!"

Ye Xuan screamed desperately in his mind, his voice trembling with despair.

"What... what realm is he? Why is he so strong? This is impossible!"

Within his Sea of Consciousness, there was only deathly silence.

After a long while, the Supreme Dao Ancestor's aged voice finally spoke, but this time, it was filled with unprecedented gravity and a hint of...

Fear.

"Boy... this Lin Yuan... is unfathomable!"

"I cannot see through him... but that pressure just now, that crushing force from a higher plane of existence... I've only seen its like once in my entire life!"

"His true cultivation, at the very least... at the very least, is Marrow Cleansing Realm seventh or eighth level! Or even..."

The Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice paused, as if even voicing his speculation seemed inconceivable.

"He may already be at the peak of Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level!"

BOOM—!

Peak of Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level!

Those words struck like apocalyptic divine lightning, crashing hard into the depths of Ye Xuan's soul!

His entire being went blank, his mind empty, even his thoughts ground to a halt.

Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level?

How could that be!

He was only eighteen years old!

In the entire history of Dragon Xia Country, the youngest person to reach Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level had been twenty-two!

What gave Lin Yuan the right?

He himself had fought tooth and nail, encountered fortune after fortune, and with his master's help had barely managed to break through to Marrow Cleansing Realm second level—and that was already being hailed as a once-in-a-century prodigy.

But Lin Yuan?

All he did every day was sleep and stare at nothing!

How could the gap between them not only fail to shrink, but actually widen into an abyss of despair?!

Unwillingness!

Fury!

Resentment!

Every negative emotion surged like floodwaters breaking through a dam, instantly sweeping away all his reason and pride.

"Pfft—"

Ye Xuan could no longer hold back. Another mouthful of heart blood sprayed out, staining the arena beneath him red.

His consciousness slowly sank into endless darkness and despair.

The arena. The spectator stands.

Everyone remained trapped in the reality-shattering scene they had just witnessed, unable to regain their senses.

That wasn't a fight.

That was a god passing judgment on a mortal.

"It's over... just like that?"

"Lin Yuan... he didn't even do anything!"

"This is terrifying! Is this what true aristocratic heritage looks like? The gap between us and him is bigger than between humans and dogs!"

After a brief silence, the stands erupted into a flood of discussion.

But this time, no one dared call Lin Yuan a "lying winner." No one dared mock him as a "coward hiding in his shell."

When they looked at that figure slowly walking down from the arena, the only reactions left were pure awe and fear.

Among the crowd, Li Xuan'er's face was as pale as paper, her delicate body trembling uncontrollably.

She looked at Ye Xuan on the stage, soaked in blood, unconscious.

Then she looked at Lin Yuan, whose retreating figure radiated nothing but indifference and distance.

An ice-cold chill shot from the soles of her feet straight to the top of her head.

All her previous satisfaction, all her disdain—in this moment, they became a colossal joke.

She had mocked Lin Yuan for being a coward, when in truth he simply couldn't be bothered to make a move.

She had treated Ye Xuan as the future supreme powerhouse, as her most successful investment.

And that investment couldn't even withstand a single move against Lin Yuan!

So it turned out...

She was the laughable fool all along!

She once had the opportunity to get close to that man, had once enjoyed treatment that would drive any woman insane with jealousy.

But she had pushed it all away with her own hands.

She had treated a true divine dragon as an ATM to exploit at will, while treating a mud-fish that thought too highly of itself as treasure!

Regret!

Endless regret gnawed at her heart like a venomous snake.

If only...

If only she hadn't treated him that way, if only she had seized the opportunity...

But in this world, there were no "if onlys."

On the other side, Gu Ningxue's striking eyes were also filled with shock.

She had expected Lin Yuan to win.

But she never imagined it would be in such a crushing, unreasonable manner!

"Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level..."

She murmured to herself as her heart couldn't help but beat faster.

This man was even more mysterious, even more powerful, even more... interesting than she had imagined!

She suddenly felt that the Lin Yuan who used to trail behind Li Xuan'er like a lovesick puppy, and this Lin Yuan who was lazy yet domineering to the bone, were two completely different people.

"A lion never cares what sheep think of him..."

She remembered those words Lin Yuan had once said.

Now it seemed he wasn't showing off—he was simply stating a fact.

Everyone present, including Ye Xuan, were perhaps nothing more than sheep in his eyes.

Lin Yuan paid no attention to the tidal wave of discussion behind him.

He walked to the sofa in the contestant area and comfortably lay back down.

Old butler Uncle Zhong immediately approached with two maids, his face flushed with excitement.

"Young Master! You were amazing! You're practically a War God reborn!"

Uncle Zhong was so excited he was babbling incoherently.

"Alright, alright, enough with the flattery." Lin Yuan waved his hand impatiently. "Hurry up and call the old man."

"Yes, yes, yes!"

Uncle Zhong quickly dialed the number to the Northern Frontier.

The holographic display lit up, and Lin Zhan's naturally commanding face appeared.

He had clearly seen everything through the broadcast. Those eyes, usually as calm as an ancient well, were now filled with barely suppressed shock and wild joy!

"You little brat! When did you reach Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level?!"

Lin Zhan's voice was actually trembling.

"Ah, I was just lying around and happened to break through."

Lin Yuan replied casually.

Lin Zhan: "..."

He felt like a knife had been plunged into his heart.

Back in his day, how much suffering had he endured, how many brushes with death had he survived, to break through to Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level!

And with his own grandson, it became "lying around and happened to break through"?

Comparing people really could make you drop dead from frustration!

"Ahem!" Lin Zhan forcibly suppressed the turbulence in his heart and put on a stern face. "Not bad! You didn't embarrass me!"

"That's a given." Lin Yuan pursed his lips. "Old man, you'd better not back out of what we agreed on."

"Don't worry!" Lin Zhan waved his hand grandly. "When Lin Zhan gives his word, it's as good as law! From today on, you can lie flat however you want! Anyone who dares disturb you, I'll personally break their legs!"

"Deal!"

Lin Yuan snapped his fingers in satisfaction and hung up the call.

He stretched lazily and instructed Uncle Zhong, "Done. Pack it up, we're heading home! My back is killing me today—I need a good soak in the bath and another nap!"

[Ding! Congratulations Host for completing the "Passive Participation" mission, successfully face-slapping the Child of Destiny and defending the dignity of lying flat!]

[System Evaluation: Perfect performance! Minimum effort, maximum impact! Distributing rewards...]

[Congratulations Host, you have received a Heaven Rank top-grade movement technique—"Kunpeng Leisurely Steps"!]

Listening to the string of notifications in his mind, Lin Yuan's mood grew even better.

Another Heaven Rank top-grade technique?

This round, totally worth it!

Just as he was about to get up and leave—

A teasing female voice came from nearby.

"Champion Lin, leaving so soon? Not staying to enjoy the cheers and worship of the entire school?"

Lin Yuan turned his head and saw Gu Ningxue standing there with her arms crossed, watching him with an amused smile.
