After a warm and lively celebration dinner, Lin Yuan returned contentedly to his absurdly large bedroom.

Lin Mengyao and Lin Ke'er were still immersed in the shock of his championship, chattering excitedly about throwing him an even grander celebration party tomorrow.

Lin Yuan had zero interest in that.

A party?

With that time, he'd rather lie around a bit longer and farm more rewards from the system.

He locked the bedroom door, and with a thought, entered his bedroom's private training ground—a space the size of a football field.

"Kunpeng Leisurely Steps..."

Lin Yuan closed his eyes.

Information about this divine movement technique instantly surfaced in his mind, branding itself into his soul like an innate instinct.

He casually took a step forward.

No earth-shattering display, not even a ripple in the air.

But the next second, something bizarre happened—

Over a hundred lifelike afterimages remained where he had stood, as if a hundred Lin Yuans were standing there simultaneously, their auras indistinguishable between real and fake.

Meanwhile, his true body had already appeared silently at the edge of the training ground, a thousand meters away!

"Hmm?"

Lin Yuan raised an eyebrow and lightly tapped his foot.

This time, his figure suddenly transformed into a streak of flowing light, not traveling in a straight line, but tracing countless twisted arcs through the void.

Sometimes like a Kunpeng striking the water, raising invisible waves that traversed thousands of meters in an instant.

Sometimes like a fish playing in streams, weaving and darting between dense stone pillars so fast that space itself seemed to ripple, leaving behind a continuous string of sonic booms as air tore apart.

In just a single breath, he had crossed back and forth through this football-field-sized training ground dozens of times!

Afterimages hadn't even faded before his true body appeared in a new position, as if space had lost its hold on him, as if distance was nothing but a joke beneath his feet.

"Interesting..."

Lin Yuan stopped, feeling the power within him that seemed capable of tearing heaven and earth apart. A playful smile curved his lips.

He could clearly sense that this movement technique's true power went far beyond this.

At full mastery, transforming into billions of afterimages that blotted out the sky, or crossing ten thousand miles in an instant—none of that was fantasy!

Unfortunately, his current realm was still shallow; he could only display the tip of the iceberg.

But even just this "tip" was enough to make every other movement technique in the world a joke.

One step, a thousand meters. Ten thousand afterimages.

This wasn't a movement technique.

This was a supreme divine ability to command space itself!

Where the heart wished, the body followed!

"Worthy of a Heaven Rank top-grade technique!"

Lin Yuan stopped, thoroughly satisfied.

Ordinary people would treat even a single Yellow Rank technique as a family heirloom.

And his system casually handed out Heaven Rank top-grade treasures!

Heaven Rank top-grade was the pinnacle of techniques in this world!

This treatment!

Simply unmatched!

Lying around to grow stronger, receiving all kinds of divine techniques and secret arts—he wouldn't trade this life even for godhood!

Also deep in the night.

Some rejoiced while others worried.

Dragon Xia Country Capital Martial Arts Academy, a premium training room.

Li Xuan'er's face went deathly pale as she suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, her aura instantly wilting.

Before her on the ground were already two dried bloodstains.

Third time!

This was her third failed attempt to break through to Marrow Cleansing Realm fourth level!

Each failure brought spiritual backlash that damaged her meridians considerably, requiring several days of rest to recover.

She opened her eyes unwillingly.

Looking at the spirit plants she had exchanged for with academy points—only average quality—a deep sense of helplessness welled up.

Not enough!

Resources, far from enough!

Unbidden, a place surfaced in her mind—the Lin Family Estate's treasury.

A place she had once been able to enter and exit freely.

There, heavenly treasures were piled like mountains.

Thousand-year spirit herbs released intoxicating fragrances, while various precious pills sat casually on shelves like worthless candies.

Before, she only needed to ask, and no matter how precious the item, Lin Yuan would deliver it to her without hesitation.

She had thought it was all natural and deserved.

But now?

Without this biggest "ATM," she finally understood how difficult cultivation truly was.

It turned out that without resources.

Even a genius couldn't take a single step forward!

A faint hint of regret, like a poisonous weed's seed, quietly sprouted in the depths of her heart.

If only...

If only she had treated him a little better...

On the other side.

Ye Xuan sat cross-legged in a shabby hotel room.

The injuries from being crushed by Lin Yuan in the tournament had mostly healed after several days of recuperation.

But the wounds in his heart had only grown worse.

Lin Yuan's indifferent gaze, that line "You're not even qualified to make me lift a finger"—it was like a poisoned thorn lodged deep in his soul, tormenting him day and night.

"Lin Yuan!"

He suddenly punched the ground, leaving a shallow fist-print in the hard floor, his eyes filled with unwillingness and murderous madness.

He couldn't just wait around like this anymore!

Following the normal path of cultivation, he would never catch up to that monster's footsteps!

If he wanted revenge, if he wanted to trample that man beneath his feet, he had to take the road less traveled!

Fortune favored the bold!

Ye Xuan's eyes became incredibly determined.

He dragged a black bundle from under the bed, checked the weapons and medicine inside, then pulled up his hood and silently melted into the night.

His destination—

Yan Jing's largest underground black market.

He would take the most dangerous but most lucrative hunting missions there!

Trade blood and life for the capital to grow stronger!

Early the next morning.

When the first rays of sunlight filtered through the luxurious floor-to-ceiling windows and fell on Lin Yuan's face, he was curled up on his bed of exotic beast soft leather worth millions, sleeping so soundly that drool was nearly flowing out.

Just then, a cold mechanical tone chimed in his mind right on schedule.

[Ding! Detected that Host has successfully maintained lying-flat posture for one day, adhering to the core "Lying Flat" philosophy. Distributing rewards...]

[Congratulations Host, you have received a Heaven Rank top-grade technique—"Boundless Ocean Sword Intent"!]

"Mmm..."

Lin Yuan was awakened by the sudden sound, frowning slightly in annoyance.

But when he heard the reward clearly, that bit of irritation at being disturbed vanished instantly.

Replaced by endless elation!

Again?

Another Heaven Rank top-grade?

And this time it's a sword technique?

Lin Yuan felt a massive surge of sharp, keen sword dao comprehension pour into his soul.

As if in that instant, he had practiced the sword for billions of years, becoming an invincible sword god standing at the pinnacle of the sword path!

"Awesome!"

Lin Yuan rolled around on the bed in satisfaction.

Others were still fighting tooth and nail, staying up all night for a pittance of resources.

And him?

All he had to do was sleep and bask in the sun every day, and various divine techniques and secret arts would come knocking at his door.

This feeling was simply incredible!
