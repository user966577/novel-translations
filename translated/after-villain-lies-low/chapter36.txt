Night spread like thick ink.

The clamorous Yan Jing City finally settled into peace.

Lin Yuan walked alone along the tree-lined path back to the estate.

Streetlamps stretched his shadow long. The surroundings were so quiet he could only hear the rustle of wind through leaves.

He rather enjoyed this tranquility.

Compared to the deafening chaos inside the Dragon's Nest, this was practically heaven.

His mind drifted, unconsciously reviewing everything that had happened today.

Ye Xuan, the protagonist who in the original novel should have soared triumphantly, cementing his "Child of Destiny" status at the National League with a legendary victory.

Now he'd become a prisoner everyone wanted dead, a pitiable wretch with his cultivation crippled.

His life trajectory had been utterly derailed by this butterfly from another world.

The Supreme Dao Ancestor in his Sea of Consciousness was probably so furious his soul was scattering.

And the Huangfu family, who'd tried to use Ye Xuan as their knife—

That investment had completely gone up in smoke, losing even their underwear.

The original plot, after his series of "micro-adjustments," had completely collapsed, sliding toward an entirely unknown direction.

But...

So what?

Lin Yuan's lips curved into an indifferent arc.

Did he care?

He didn't care one bit.

Whatever Child of Destiny, whatever plot direction.

Before absolute power, all schemes and blessed fortune were just children playing house—a joke.

No matter what happened to Ye Xuan's future, no matter what new trouble this world might spawn.

One thing would never change.

That was...

Nobody better disturb this young master's peaceful napping!

"Sleep is life's first principle..."

Lin Yuan stretched luxuriantly and quickened his pace toward home.

Just then.

A clear, pleasant voice tinged with urgency and breathlessness called from behind.

"Lin Yuan! Please... wait a moment!"

Lin Yuan's steps paused, brow furrowing almost imperceptibly.

Why did people always love disturbing others late at night?

He turned slowly to see a graceful figure leaning against a streetlamp, slightly winded.

It was Gu Ningxue.

She seemed to have run all the way here, a light sheen of perspiration on her forehead, glittering in the moonlight.

Her heroically beautiful face carried a flush from exertion, her bright eyes fixed unblinkingly on him.

"I... I've been looking for you for a while."

Gu Ningxue caught her breath.

She strode to Lin Yuan, her voice filled with sincerity and gratitude.

"Today at the arena... thank you."

She drew a deep breath.

As if gathering tremendous courage, she continued: "If you hadn't intervened at the end, I might have... already..."

She didn't finish, but the danger was self-evident.

Ye Xuan's final punch had burned all his life and reason into one killing strike.

Even if she'd blocked it, she would have been severely wounded, perhaps left with lasting Dao injuries.

Lin Yuan, descending like a god, had pulled her back from the cliff's edge.

This debt of gratitude was heavy as Mount Tai.

She could never repay it!

Yet facing this new champion's utterly sincere thanks, Lin Yuan's expression showed nothing.

He merely regarded her quietly, eyes as flat as if looking at someone asking for directions.

He waved dismissively, speaking with matter-of-fact, almost impatient casualness:

"It was nothing."

With that, he didn't even give Gu Ningxue a chance to respond, turning directly to continue toward the estate.

As if to him, that heart-stopping rescue was truly no different from swatting a mosquito.

Gu Ningxue stood frozen.

She'd prepared a bellyful of words, imagined countless possible follow-ups.

But she'd never expected his reaction to be so...

Cold.

In the instant of her daze.

Lin Yuan's figure, beneath a streetlamp not far ahead, suddenly became indistinct.

The next second, he seemed to melt into the night, vanishing without a trace.

As if he'd never been there.

Cold night wind swept past.

Gu Ningxue stood alone on the empty path.

The championship trophy in her hands, representing the pinnacle of national collegiate glory, suddenly felt impossibly heavy.

She stared dazedly at the direction Lin Yuan had disappeared.

For a long moment, she slowly clenched her fist.

In her beautiful eyes, the original gratitude and awe gradually gave way to a more fervent, more determined light.

"Lin Yuan..."

"What kind of person are you, really?"

Meanwhile.

In a dimly lit, cramped room reeking of disinfectant.

Ye Xuan slowly came to amid a cacophony of whispered discussion.

His consciousness was still hazy, but he could vaguely hear two men's deliberately lowered conversation.

"Sigh, what a waste, truly a waste! A promising genius, a strong contender for national champion, and now... reduced to this! What was he thinking? Why couldn't he just walk the proper path instead of cultivating those self-destructive forbidden arts!"

"Tch, please! You really believed all that 'underdog comeback' media hype?"

Another voice, dripping with contempt and disdain: "I heard this Ye Xuan had mediocre talent—basically trash! His earlier rise was only because some woman was feeding him resources from behind! Then somehow she stopped supplying him, and he fell back to his original level. Probably couldn't handle the gap and took the crooked path, trying to cheat his way back! Serves him right!"

These words stabbed into Ye Xuan's brain like red-hot needles!

Relying on a woman...

Fell back to his level...

Trash...

Serves him right...

"Ugh..."

Ye Xuan groaned in agony, eyes snapping open.

The two chattering medics, startled to see him awake, immediately shut up.

They exchanged glances, then hurried out as if fleeing a plague.

BANG, the door slammed shut.

The world fell silent once more.

Ye Xuan turned his stiff neck, scanning his surroundings.

He found himself lying on a cold metal bed, surrounded by mottled walls and antiquated medical equipment.

An old hospital room.

Apparently he'd been taken to a hospital.

And for now, his life wasn't in danger.

But...

What did it matter?

In that moment, his heart became hollow.

Like a shell drained of all emotion, a walking corpse.

He knew...

He was finished.

Cultivation crippled, meridians shattered.

His reputation had plummeted from the clouds to rock bottom—now a fraud and devil everyone despised.

Li Xuan'er, that stupid woman, had already been squeezed of her last use.

And the Huangfu family that had used him as a blade? Seeing him in this state, they'd surely discarded him like trash long ago.

He had nothing now.

No, he still had one thing.

That was... his endless, bone-deep hatred for Lin Yuan—the desire to grind that man's bones to ash!

"Lin... Yuan..."

Ye Xuan squeezed out those two words through gritted teeth.

He slowly clenched his fist, sharp nails digging deep into his palm.

Blood seeped through his fingers.

Drop by drop, it fell onto the yellowed bedsheet, blooming into jarring blood-red plum blossoms.

In his hollow eyes.

Gradually, a glimmer rekindled.

Not a light of hope.

But a mad, obsessive light of destruction—wanting to drag the whole world into hell!

CREAK—

Just as Ye Xuan's inner battle raged, on the verge of being consumed entirely by madness.

That battered old door made an ear-piercing sound.

Someone was slowly pushing it open from outside.

"Who's there?!"

Ye Xuan's head snapped up, irritation in his eyes.

But when he saw the familiar yet bedraggled figure in the doorway, his entire body went rigid.

The visitor was...

Li Xuan'er!

"What are you doing here?"

Ye Xuan's voice was ice, devoid of any emotion.

His eyes flashed with extreme disgust and irritation.

He grabbed a water cup from the nightstand and hurled it at Li Xuan'er!

"Get out!!!"

"You worthless thing who only brings men bad luck! Get out of my sight!"

The cup grazed Li Xuan'er's scalp, shattering against the wall.

Glass shards exploded at her feet.

The crisp sound echoed harshly through the silent room.

Yet facing Ye Xuan's hysterical roar and near-crazed violence, Li Xuan'er's face showed no fear, no retreat.

She didn't even dodge.

Just stood there quietly, letting the flying glass shards graze her cheek, leaving a thin trail of blood.

Her pale, numb face slowly curved into a strange, chilling arc.

"Get out?"

Li Xuan'er repeated the word softly, her voice hoarse yet carrying an indescribable, heart-piercing cold.

"Ye Xuan, look at yourself now."

"Like a stray dog with its teeth pulled and spine broken, you can only rage impotently at a 'worthless thing' in your eyes."

"You think you still have the right to tell me to leave?"

These few words were ten thousand times more vicious than those two medics' gossip!

Like a poison-coated dagger, they pierced precisely, brutally, into Ye Xuan's already shattered heart!

"You... what did you say?!"

Ye Xuan's body trembled violently. He tried to sit up from the bed, but the movement tugged at his collapsed meridians. The agony sent him crashing back down!

"You bitch! What do you know!"

"If that bastard Lin Yuan hadn't ambushed me! If he hadn't attacked with such cowardly tricks! How could I have lost! I'm the champion! I'm the strongest!"

Ye Xuan's eyes were crimson, his roars like a madman's.

He blamed all his failure, all his humiliation, on Lin Yuan!

"Is that so?"

The mockery in Li Xuan'er's eyes deepened.

"A loss is a loss. No amount of excuses changes the fact that you're now crippled."

She walked forward slowly, step by step.

Her high heels crunched on glass-strewn floor, making "crunch, crunch" sounds like stepping on Ye Xuan's fragile nerves.

"However..."

Just as Ye Xuan's rage was about to fully erupt, Li Xuan'er's tone suddenly shifted.

She stopped at the bedside, looking down at this man she'd once loved to the point of humility, and now hated to the bone.

That originally hollow, numb face now showed a smile that made one's heart skip—cunning and seductive.

"Ye Xuan, do you want revenge?"

Her voice seemed to carry magic.

"I can help you."

"Help you recover to what you were... no, even stronger than before!"
