His finger tapped rhythmically, lightly, against the armrest.

Others only saw Lin Yuan's pitiful score.

But he had noticed a detail everyone else had overlooked.

Lin Yuan's movement route seemed random, like a headless fly wandering aimlessly.

But in reality, the direction he was heading had pointed, from start to finish, unwaveringly toward the wilderness depths—toward a forbidden zone marked in blood-red on every family's intelligence files—

Black Wind Valley!

Lin Yuan meandered unhurriedly toward Black Wind Valley.

However, when he reached a narrow canyon entrance, his steps finally stopped.

Not by choice.

The path ahead was blocked.

SWISH SWISH SWISH—!

Dozens of figures burst from behind the canyon's rock walls like ghosts!

In the blink of an eye, they had Lin Yuan's way completely sealed!

Leading them was a burly man with a face full of menace, gripping a cold-gleaming ghost-head broadsword—none other than "Zhao Tiger," eldest grandson of the second-tier Zhao family!

A Marrow Cleansing fifth-level cultivation made him something of a figure at his age.

Behind him trailed over fifty scions from other second-tier families, all wearing hostile expressions, surrounding Lin Yuan with greed-filled malice in their eyes.

"Lin Yuan!"

Zhao Tiger pointed his blade at Lin Yuan, his voice dripping with arrogance!

"Time and again you've looked down on us Yan Jing aristocrats! Arrogant and dismissive!"

"Today, on behalf of those first-tier families you've insulted, we'll clean house properly!"

"Prepare to die!"

His words rang with righteous fury, as if he represented justice itself.

But before he even finished!

WHOOSH! WHOOSH!

Two black shadows exploded from behind Lin Yuan without warning!

Each gripped a poison-coated dark-green short blade, soundlessly, aiming straight for Lin Yuan's vital back!

Simultaneously!

Zhao Tiger in front bared his teeth in a savage grin, his full spiritual power erupting!

"Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain!"

He roared, his ghost-head broadsword whipping up a vicious wind.

The blade's edge even manifested a tiger phantom, carrying mountain-splitting, stone-shattering might, cleaving down toward Lin Yuan's head!

Ambush!

Encirclement!

And it was a merciless killing blow!

Facing this deadly pincer attack, Lin Yuan's face finally showed a flicker of change.

His gaze went cold.

No panic, no rage—only an absolute, god-looking-down-on-ants iciness.

He didn't dodge, didn't evade.

Didn't even shift his footing.

Just—lightly, casually—raised his hand.

HUM—!

A wisp of pale blue sword qi erupted from his fingertip!

That sword qi wasn't particularly massive.

But it was refined to the extreme, brilliant to the extreme, fast to the extreme!

Like a shooting star tearing through eternal night, trailing a dreamlike tail of light, it flashed past at speeds beyond visual limits!

SHLICK—!

The air was torn open!!!

The two ambushers' savage grins froze instantly!

They felt only a chill at their wrists!

The next second, their prized poisoned blades—along with their hands—were sliced clean off!

Before they could even scream!

That pale blue sword qi seemed to grow eyes, changing direction instantly, plunging into their dantians!

THUMP! THUMP!

Two muffled sounds!

Their bodies, like punctured balloons, released all their cultivation in that moment!

Having done all this, the sword qi still showed no sign of stopping!

It traced an elegant arc through the air, meeting Zhao Tiger's momentum-charged ghost-head broadsword head-on!

"CLANG—!!!"

An ear-splitting clash of metal rang out!

Zhao Tiger felt an utterly irresistible, overwhelming force transmit through his blade!

His prized Profound-Rank middle-grade ghost-head broadsword, before that slender sword qi, was cut through like paper—cleaved in two!

"PFFT—!"

Zhao Tiger sprayed blood wildly, his entire body flying backward like a kite with its string cut, slamming to the ground over a dozen meters away!

His dantian was likewise shredded by that domineering sword qi!

All of this, though lengthy to describe.

Actually took less than one second from Lin Yuan raising his hand to all three being crippled!

Those second-tier family scions who'd been ready to enjoy the show went completely stupid!

They gaped wide-eyed, jaws dropped, minds blank!

By the time they snapped back to reality, all that remained were groans of agony across the ground—and that figure, standing exactly where he'd been, as if he'd never moved—the demon-god-like silhouette!

"RUN—!!!"

Someone let out a bloodcurdling scream!

The rest, as if seeing ghosts, were instantly scared witless and turned to flee!

But—too late.

Lin Yuan casually flicked out several more sword qi strands.

Pale blue streaks of light, like death's invitations, precisely caught up to every fleeing figure.

THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!

A continuous string of dantian-shattering thuds echoed through the canyon.

【Ding! Successfully eliminated competitor. Points seized: 10!】

【Ding! Successfully eliminated competitor. Points seized: 8!】

【Ding! Successfully eliminated competitor. Points seized: 12!】

On his wristwatch, the mechanical notifications rang out like a death knell!

Lin Yuan's score rocketed from a pitiful 13, soaring wildly!

100!

200!

300!

400!

Finally settling on the number—【513】!

His ranking, too, shot up like a rocket, leaping from dead last straight into the top ten!

In the observation stands.

The place erupted!

"Wh-what's happening?! Zhao Tiger and the others—they were all eliminated?!"

"Heavens! Lin Yuan's points! Shot up five hundred at once! He crippled every single one of them!"

"This... this is slaughter! Blatant slaughter!"

The Zhao family patriarch's face, which had just been wearing a smug grin, turned ashen!

He shot to his feet, eyes crimson, jabbing a finger at Lin Jianguo sitting calmly in the corner, letting out a beast-like roar!

"Lin Jianguo! Your son's methods are too vicious! He actually crippled my grandson's dantian! This isn't over!!!"

"That's right! My son was crippled too! Lin Jianguo, you owe us an explanation!"

Other family heads whose children had been crippled also rose, voices filled with righteous indignation, looking ready to gang up on him.
