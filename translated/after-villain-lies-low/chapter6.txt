Meanwhile.

A hundred li northeast of the capital, Yan Jing City.

The Black Wind Mountain Range.

"ROAR!"

A nimble beast covered entirely in cyan scales—a second-rank Vicious Beast called a "Wind Wolf"—was lunging at a young man in black with its bloody maw wide open, bringing a gust of foul wind.

Ye Xuan's eyes narrowed as he shifted his footwork, barely dodging the lethal strike.

His chest heaved violently, sweat already soaking through his clothes.

His body was covered with countless small wounds, and his spiritual power was more than half depleted.

To gather the resources needed for his breakthrough, he'd had no choice but to accept high-risk missions from the academy—hunting Vicious Beasts whose strength matched second or third level Marrow Cleansing Realm martial artists, all alone.

"Die, beast!"

Ye Xuan spotted an opening as the Wind Wolf's pounce missed. A fierce glint flashed in his eyes as he gathered his remaining spiritual power into his right fist and threw a powerful punch!

"Mountain-Splitting Fist!"

His fist landed solidly on the Wind Wolf's soft underbelly. The violent force penetrated its body, instantly shattering its internal organs.

The Wind Wolf let out a wail of agony. Its massive body convulsed a few times before going still.

Ye Xuan collapsed onto the ground, gasping for breath.

Yet there was no joy of victory on his face—only resentment and rage.

"Lin Yuan!"

He ground out the name through clenched teeth, slamming his fist into the earth.

"Damn waste! You're only high and mighty because of your family background! Hmph, you think cutting off my resources means I'm finished? Without you, I, Ye Xuan, can still climb to the peak through my own efforts!"

Though he said this, the frustration inside him was nearly overflowing.

Once upon a time, he only needed to cultivate steadily, and Li Xuan'er would deliver top-tier resources right to him.

But now, for the sake of a measly second-grade pill's worth of money, he had to risk his life fighting Vicious Beasts.

This enormous contrast had nearly shattered his composure.

"Master..." he couldn't help asking in his mind, "Why do you think that Lin Yuan suddenly wised up? Wasn't he crazy in love with Li Xuan'er? How could he just stop being a simp like that?"

After a moment.

An aged voice echoed in his mind.

"Kid, I told you long ago—don't put all your hopes on that Li family girl. That's the same as putting your fate in someone else's hands, hanging yourself from a single tree!"

"You really think Lin Yuan is a fool? With his illustrious family background, he's seen countless beauties and talents since childhood. How could his vision and temperament really be that poor? Li Xuan'er's tricks of stringing him along and using him might work once or twice, but over time, even a pig would get sick of it!"

This voice was Ye Xuan's greatest secret and trump card.

He was originally an orphan with mediocre talent.

But in an accident, an additional Primordial Spirit appeared in his mind, one that called itself the "Supreme Dao Ancestor."

This ancestor claimed to have once been a supreme powerhouse standing at the pinnacle of martial dao.

Due to certain circumstances, his body perished and his dao dissipated, leaving only a wisp of Remnant Soul residing in Ye Xuan's Sea of Consciousness.

The ancestor promised that if Ye Xuan could help him gather materials to reconstruct his physical body in the future, he would teach Ye Xuan everything, helping him become a new martial legend.

It was under the ancestor's guidance that Ye Xuan had been able to create miracle after miracle, becoming a commoner genius.

Hearing the ancestor's lecture, a trace of bitterness appeared on Ye Xuan's face.

How could he not understand this logic?

But the ancestor needed a massive amount of rare treasures to reconstruct his body. Relying on himself alone, when would he ever gather them all?

Getting close to Li Xuan'er and using Lin Yuan as a "super ATM" was the fastest shortcut he could think of.

Who could have known that this path, which had been going so smoothly, would suddenly be cut off!

That Lin Yuan bastard wasn't following the script!

"Sigh..."

Ye Xuan sighed helplessly, climbing to his feet and dragging his exhausted body over to dissect the Wind Wolf's corpse, extracting the valuable materials.

Looking at the pitiful harvest in his hands, the determination in his eyes grew even stronger.

Roads had to be walked one step at a time.

Since the shortcut was gone, he'd rely on his own fists to punch out a path to the heavens!

Lin Yuan, just you wait!

He finished his work, shouldered his mission items, and headed back toward the capital without looking back.

Night fell, and lights came on across the city.

The Lin family estate was brilliantly lit, like a divine palace descended to the mortal world.

Lin Yuan had just finished enjoying a dinner prepared by a Michelin three-star chef...

No, by his family's exclusive spirit chef, and was preparing to return to his room to continue his great endeavor of lying flat.

Just then, a crisp voice with the soft, sticky quality unique to little girls rang out.

"Big brother! Big brother! Wait a moment!"

Lin Yuan turned around.

He saw a little loli in a pink princess dress with twin ponytails, exquisitely cute like a porcelain doll, running toward him while hugging a stack of jade slips taller than herself.

It was none other than his precious little sister who was proficient in formations—Lin Ke'er.

"What is it, little Ke'er?"

A doting smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.

He genuinely adored this mischievous little sister.

"Big brother, help me look at this!"

Lin Ke'er ran up to him and presented the topmost jade slip like offering a treasure.

She blinked her big watery eyes, pouting with frustration. "This 'Nine-Twist Dragon Trap Formation' has such a complicated array core setup! There are several nodes I just can't figure out, and I don't understand what the academy teachers explain either."

Nine-Twist Dragon Trap Formation?

Lin Yuan raised an eyebrow.

This was quite an advanced trapping formation. Forget academy students—even many formation grandmasters might not fully comprehend it.

He took the jade slip and sent his divine sense into it. Countless mysterious, complex formation patterns and node variations instantly flooded his mind.

If it were the old Lin Yuan, seeing this would definitely give him a splitting headache.

But now, after being transformed by the Primordial Sacred Body, his comprehension had reached an inconceivable level.

Those formation variations that seemed obscure and difficult to Lin Ke'er looked as simple as elementary arithmetic to him.

He casually snapped a twig from a nearby flower bed, crouched down, and began drawing on the open ground of the courtyard.

"Look here—the spiritual power flow between the third main node and the seventh auxiliary node shouldn't connect directly. Instead, they need to route through a void node to form a loop. That's how you make the formation's energy self-sustaining."

"And here—the array core can't be placed in the center. That's a trap. The real gate of life is actually here. Using the gate of life as a guide to reverse the cosmos, you can transform death into life and trap a true dragon..."

Lin Yuan casually sketched out an incomparably mysterious formation diagram on the ground.

In just a few words, he dissected the core secrets of this advanced formation, cutting straight to its essence.
