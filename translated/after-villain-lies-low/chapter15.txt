A few days later.

Lin Yuan, attended by two pretty maids, leisurely finished his breakfast before yawning and sauntering toward Dragon Xia Country's Capital Martial Arts Academy.

Ever since winning the championship and obtaining his grandfather's "Lie-Flat Special Permit," he felt his life had become even more comfortable.

Going to school now was purely about finding a different place to sleep.

The moment he walked onto campus, he keenly overheard several students huddled together nearby.

They were whispering about something secretively.

"Have you guys heard? That Ye Xuan is absolutely insane!"

"What? What happened? What did he do now?"

"A few days ago he actually went to the black market alone and took that level-six mission that's been up for a month—to hunt a Nether Leopard!"

"Holy crap! Seriously? Does he have a death wish? That's a second-order Vicious Beast!"

"Right? But guess what? The guy actually succeeded! I heard he was half-dead when he came back, but he really did kill the Nether Leopard!"

"My god! That's insane! Then isn't he rolling in it? A Nether Leopard's spirit core is premium material!"

"You bet! Apparently he made a killing this time! He was probably stung bad after losing to Young Master Lin at the tournament—now he's training like his life depends on it, trying to get his face back!"

Hearing this chatter, Lin Yuan, who happened to be passing by, paused slightly in his steps.

Ye Xuan?

Hunted a Nether Leopard?

And got a Superior Nether Spirit Core?

Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly.

This guy...

His luck was that good?

More importantly, a second-order Vicious Beast—at Ye Xuan's Marrow Cleansing Realm second level cultivation, he could solo it?

Second-order Vicious Beasts were comparable in strength to the Marrow Cleansing Realm, but because of their tough physiques, it was nearly impossible for someone at second level to kill one alone.

Clearly...

Ye Xuan was indeed exceptional.

But after a moment's thought, Lin Yuan immediately understood the key.

Protagonist Halo. Not surprising.

Ye Xuan was, after all, the Child of Destiny in the novel "Supreme Martial God"—the author's beloved son.

Blessed with fortune, he was destined to rise.

However...

A playful curve formed at the corner of Lin Yuan's lips.

His current path to glory was far rockier than in the original story.

In the original plot.

Ye Xuan had shot to fame in the tournament, rising by stepping on "Lin Yuan" the villain, basking in boundless glory.

Then, he would have gained the attention of the academy's higher-ups.

All kinds of top-tier cultivation resources, techniques and secret arts, secret realm cultivation qualifications—all would have been thrown at him like free candy.

He only needed to cultivate steadily to safely and rapidly increase his strength.

But now?

The championship had been stolen by Lin Yuan, the spotlight had been taken by Lin Yuan, and naturally the academy's rewards had nothing to do with him.

Without his "ATM," and without the academy's resource support, he had only one path left to grow stronger.

That was going to the black market for missions, going to the most dangerous places, licking blood from the blade's edge, trading his life for resources.

Though he could still encounter fortune, the risks involved were at least ten times higher than in the original story!

And the resources he earned from fighting for his life were probably less than half of what the Lin family and academy could provide!

Just then, the students who had been gossiping finally noticed Lin Yuan walking past.

"Y-Young Master Lin!"

Their faces went pale instantly, their discussion cutting off abruptly. They nearly bit their own tongues.

They had just been discussing how Ye Xuan was triggered by Lin Yuan—and now the man himself overheard?

The students hurriedly forced smiles uglier than crying and bowed to greet him.

"Good morning, Young Master Lin!"

"Hello, Young Master Lin!"

Then, without waiting for any reaction from Lin Yuan, they fled as if they'd seen a ghost, heads down, not looking back.

Lin Yuan watched their panicked retreat with some amusement.

He shook his head, too lazy to bother with them, and strolled leisurely toward that familiar ancient tree in the back garden.

Ye Xuan was fighting desperately?

What did that have to do with him?

Even if the sky fell, it wouldn't disturb his nap.

Lin Yuan was walking with his "don't-care-about-anyone" stride, about to head to his personal "Lie-Flat Sanctuary"—

That centuries-old tree in the back garden.

But halfway there, a striking figure cut in from the side and blocked his path.

"Well, well, Champion Lin—off to sleep again?"

It was Gu Ningxue.

Today she wore a sharp martial arts uniform that outlined every curve of her explosive figure.

Her wavy hair was tied in a high ponytail, giving her a dashing air.

"What is it?"

Lin Yuan raised an eyelid, his tone lazy.

"Of course there's something—something huge." Gu Ningxue crossed her arms, a meaningful smile on her face.

She didn't beat around the bush. "I'm here on behalf of the academy's team to formally invite you to join. In another month, it's the annual National College Martial Arts League. We need your strength."

National College Martial Arts League?

Lin Yuan searched his memory—this was indeed a significant plot point in the original novel.

It was the highest-level competition among all of Dragon Xia Country's top martial arts academies.

It was also the best stage for young talents to make their mark and gain national attention.

Those who performed well in the league would not only bring glory to their school but also receive massive resources and honors. They might even be recruited directly by the military or major factions.

"Represent the school in the competition, exchange pointers with geniuses from other top academies nationwide, bring glory to the school, and gain countless honors and rewards." Gu Ningxue looked at him, speaking persuasively. "How about it? Interested?"

However, after hearing all this, Lin Yuan just yawned and looked at her like she was an idiot.

"Do you really think someone of my caliber needs to fight others for those scraps of resources?"

Gu Ningxue: "..."

This response killed the conversation dead.

Top-tier resources that ordinary people could only dream of—in his mouth, they became "scraps"?

Although what he said was technically true, it was still crushing!

Lin Yuan ignored her constipated expression and instead raised an eyebrow. "Besides, something's off here. Inviting me to join the team—shouldn't something this big have the principal or dean come personally? Why send you?"

Gu Ningxue pursed her lips but said nothing.

But her expression said it all.

Lin Yuan understood instantly.

These old foxes!

They definitely knew he was hard to approach—coming directly would probably result in getting rebuffed.

And Gu Ningxue was one of the few girls at school whose family background matched his, and she'd been somewhat close to him lately.

So they'd given this task to Gu Ningxue, hoping to use the "beauty strategy"?

Or rather...

They thought coming through Gu Ningxue would have a higher success rate?

Dream on!
