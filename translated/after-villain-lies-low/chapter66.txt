"Mm."

Lin Jianguo gave only a faint acknowledgment.

"My Lin family doesn't keep idle people."

"The Chen family's artifact refining skills still have some use in the military."

"You may leave now."

"Yes! Yes! This junior takes his leave!"

Chen Tianhao felt as if he'd received a pardon from the heavens. He kowtowed once more, then shakily rose from the ground, keeping his body bowed as he retreated from the study.

Only after leaving the Lin family estate, when the night wind hit him.

Did he realize that his back had been completely soaked through with cold sweat.

But the expression on his face was one of unprecedented wild joy and excitement!

From today onward, his Chen family belonged to the Lin family!

With the Lin family as a towering tree that could block out the very sky, what was one little Liu family?!

Inside the study.

Lin Jianguo looked at the Stellar Vein map on his desk.

On that face that never changed through ten thousand years, a barely perceptible smile finally appeared.

Then, picking up the map, he turned and walked toward the rear courtyard.

Lin Yuan's room.

The lights were still on.

Lin Jianguo pushed the door open.

And saw his precious son lounging on the bed, legs crossed, surfing the internet with great relish.

That leisurely, carefree manner—as if the sky could fall and it would have nothing to do with him.

Lin Jianguo's eye twitched again.

He felt his blood pressure showing signs of spiking once more.

"Ahem!"

He coughed heavily.

Lin Yuan didn't even bother lifting an eyelid, just casually grunted an acknowledgment.

"You certainly have it easy."

Lin Jianguo said irritably.

"It's alright. Just finished dealing with some trouble, so I need to rest a bit."

Lin Yuan still didn't look up, his fingers flying.

Swish swish swish!

He rapidly tipped dozens of big rockets to a hardworking dancing streamer in a live broadcast.

"Trouble?" Lin Jianguo walked to his bedside and tossed the map onto him. "You mean this?"

Only then did Lin Yuan lazily glance at the map.

"Oh, the Chen family sent it?"

"What else?"

"You little brat, not bad at all."

"With one sentence and a handful of dirt, you got that old fox Chen to submit completely."

"Even that Stellar Vein they'd hidden for decades—they obediently delivered it as a pledge of allegiance."

"These tactics of yours are far better than mine back in the day."

Lin Jianguo pulled up a chair and sat down.

His tone carried a boastful pride he hadn't even noticed himself.

"It's nothing special. They just had guilty consciences, so I went with the flow. I only gave them a chance to pick a side."

Lin Yuan pursed his lips.

Looking at his son's calm, everything-under-control demeanor, Lin Jianguo felt both gratified and exasperated.

This kid was good in every way.

Except for this bone-deep laziness that made him want to rage just looking at it!

"Fine. Since you've got it all figured out, this vein's yours to handle."

Lin Jianguo stood up, preparing to leave.

"Do what you want with it—hand it over to the family or keep it for yourself, your call."

He knew his son, though lazy.

Was absolutely no fool.

On the contrary, he saw things more clearly, more thoroughly than anyone!

"Got it." Lin Yuan waved his hand, signaling he could leave now and stop disturbing his enjoyment.

Lin Jianguo: "..."

He took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing the urge to drag this brat out of bed and give him a good thrashing.

Then, face dark, he turned and walked out of the room.

Just as he stepped through the doorway, he heard a lazy voice from inside.

"Oh, by the way, Dad."

"The Liu family is probably going to do something desperate soon."

"Have the city garrison stay sharp lately. Don't let anyone cause trouble at our doorstep."

Lin Jianguo's footsteps halted.

His stern face was instantly covered with icy killing intent!

"Hmph!"

"If that Liu family dares to reach out."

"I will personally grind their claws to powder, inch by inch, bone and all!"

Liu Family.

Council hall.

The atmosphere was colder than an ice cellar, more oppressive than hell.

At the head of the room, in the patriarch's seat, sat a middle-aged man with a sinister face and eyes like a venomous snake.

Liu family patriarch, Liu Qingtian!

"Trash! All of you, trash!"

He swept his hand violently, and the thousand-year nanmu table beside him was instantly blasted into pieces by a surge of violent force!

Wood chips flew everywhere!

Below the hall, a row of Liu family executives knelt.

Every one of them was silent as cicadas in winter, heads bowed, bodies shaking like sieves.

"Patriarch, please calm down! Please calm down!"

One elder spoke up, trembling.

"Calm down?"

Liu Qingtian let out a shrill, cold laugh, his twisted face full of madness and unwillingness.

"How can I calm down?!"

"My son was so frightened his soul scattered—to this day he's still lying in bed like an idiot, drooling!"

"Now even that old dog Chen has run off to the Lin family in the middle of the night, wagging his tail, begging for mercy and pledging allegiance!"

"How do you expect me to calm down?!"

His Liu family was finished!

He could clearly feel an invisible net, already descending upon them from the direction of the Lin family.

Before long.

His Liu family would be like a bug caught in a spider's web, having its last drop of blood sucked dry while still alive!

He couldn't accept it!

He absolutely refused to accept such an ending!

He, Liu Qingtian, had been the wind and rain of Yan Jing City his entire life. How could he just pathetically be trampled underfoot?!

"Lin family... Lin Yuan..."

Liu Qingtian ground his teeth, squeezing those two names through the gaps.

Since you won't let me live!

Then we'll all die together!

Night deepened.

Liu Qingtian came alone to a dark chamber deep within the Liu family's forbidden grounds.

He lit three sticks of black incense that emanated an eerie aura.

Then, from his robes, he produced a token black as ink, carved with a twisted eyeball pattern.

He sliced open his finger and let his blood drip onto the token.

Hum——!

The token instantly erupted with an evil black light.

A raspy, cold, inhuman voice slowly emanated from within.

"Patriarch Liu, have you decided?"

"I have."

Liu Qingtian's voice was equally cold, devoid of any emotion.

"I want you to kill someone for me."

"Who?"

"Lin Yuan!"

The other end of the token fell into brief silence.

Moments later, that raspy voice spoke again.

"The Lin family's boy?"

"Do you know what it means to touch him?"

"It means a fight to the death with that old bastard Lin Zhan."

"Can you afford this price?"

Liu Qingtian laughed bitterly.

"What can I not afford?"

"My Liu family is willing to offer thirty percent of our holdings in exchange for Lin Yuan's life. How about it?!"

The other end of the token fell silent again.

This time, the silence lasted even longer.

Just as Liu Qingtian's heart was sinking to rock bottom.

Finally, that raspy voice, carrying a hint of amused interest, spoke once more.

"Heh heh... Patriarch Liu, you certainly have backbone."

"Thirty percent of your holdings to buy the life of one Qi Sea Realm brat."

"This deal—the Divine Court will take it!"
