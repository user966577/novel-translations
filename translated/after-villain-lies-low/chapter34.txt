Time seemed to slow to a crawl in that moment.

The ice-blue phoenix and the golden dragon-elephant.

Under the horrified gazes of a hundred thousand spectators, they collided in the most primitive, most savage manner!

There was no earth-shattering explosion.

The instant they made contact, all sound seemed to be swallowed!

The entire world fell into an eerie silence!

Then came a brilliance so blinding it could blind everyone—impossible to describe in words.

It erupted from the point of collision!

That light was half dominating golden, half icy holy blue!

Two completely different yet equally terrifying forces were frantically devouring and annihilating each other!

The golden dragon-elephant phantom roared, trying to use its world-suppressing might to utterly crush the ice-blue phoenix!

Yet the ice phoenix released an even more piercing, more resonant cry!

Endless extreme cold qi surged from within it!

CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

The air—froze!

Light—froze!

Even that violent torrent of golden energy began to solidify and crystallize the instant it touched that extreme cold!

The golden dragon-elephant let out an unwilling wail.

Its massive body of pure energy was rapidly covered by a layer of ice-blue crystals, from head to tail!

Finally, with a "bang," under the ice phoenix's piercing cry, it shattered completely!

Transforming into countless golden motes of light!

PFFT—!

The instant the dragon-elephant phantom shattered, Qin Zhan was struck as if by a devastating blow, spraying a mouthful of blood, his face instantly turning pale as paper!

His pride, his strongest strike—just like that, it was broken?!

Yet before he could react.

The ice phoenix, though now much more ethereal after shattering the dragon-elephant, still carried its momentum. With endless soul-freezing chill, it slammed into his chest!

Qin Zhan's body flew backward like a baseball struck at high speed.

He traced an arc through the air, crashing heavily outside the arena, smashing a huge crater into the hard ground.

On the arena.

Gu Ningxue wasn't faring much better.

Her face was pale, her breathing rapid, her sword-gripping hand trembling slightly.

That single Ice Phoenix Descends had drained nearly all her spiritual power.

But—she still stood.

Like a proud snow pine, standing unbowed through the blizzard!

The venue remained deathly silent.

Everyone had been utterly stunned by that immortal-battle-like scene, losing all capacity for thought.

Until the referee's trembling voice suddenly rang out!

"Victor... Capital Martial Arts Academy, Gu Ningxue!"

BOOM—!!!

As if a nuclear bomb had been dropped into a calm lake!

The entire Dragon's Nest was instantly flooded by an unprecedented wave of cheers and screams that could burst eardrums!

"She won! Gu Ningxue won! She defeated Qin Zhan!"

"My god! Ice phoenix devours dragon-elephant! This is absolutely the most spectacular duel I've ever seen! Bar none!"

"Too strong! Too beautiful! From today on, Goddess Gu is my only faith!"

"The finals! She's made it to the finals! She'll face that monster Ye Xuan for this tournament's championship!"

Qin Zhan struggled to rise from the ground, wiping the blood from his lips.

He looked at that peerlessly beautiful figure on the arena, eyes holding no resentment—only heartfelt admiration.

He cupped his fists toward Gu Ningxue from a distance.

"I lost. Completely convinced."

With that, he turned and walked away without looking back, amid the crowd's respectful applause.

On the other side, in the contestant waiting area.

Ye Xuan watched the woman on the arena—her spiritual power drained but still radiantly magnificent.

In his crimson eyes, an unprecedented, flame-hot battle intent exploded!

Excellent!

You didn't disappoint me!

Only by defeating such a powerful opponent will my championship truly mean something!

Gu Ningxue!

You will be my final, most magnificent stepping stone as I become a legend and ascend to the summit!

He could feel his blood burning with excitement, burning with madness!

He could hardly wait to battle her!

Inside the VIP box.

Lin Yuan's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.

His gaze, piercing the vast distance, locked onto Ye Xuan, whose battle intent was now boiling as he prepared to take the stage.

Unlike the earlier amusement of watching a monkey show.

Now, his eyes held a contemplative chill.

This guy...

He was burning too desperately.

Like a candle about to burn out, igniting his entire body just to release that final light and heat.

Dazzling, yes, but—it also heralded destruction.

"Ladies and gentlemen!"

"The moment we've all been waiting for has finally arrived!"

The host's voice, hoarse but still bursting with passion, echoed throughout the Dragon's Nest!

"The National College Martial Arts League finals—the ultimate championship match!"

"Now, let us welcome our two final kings with the most thunderous cheers—"

"Ye Xuan!!!"

"Gu Ningxue!!!"

BOOM—!!!

The entire stadium erupted!

The sea-like roar of voices nearly shook souls loose from bodies!

Under the gaze of millions, Ye Xuan and Gu Ningxue once again ascended the battered, crater-filled arena.

The final battle was about to begin!

"Fight!"

No wasted words. The instant the referee announced the start, both moved simultaneously!

Gu Ningxue's sword transformed into an ice-blue streak, impossibly fast, carrying bone-piercing chill as it struck at Ye Xuan's throat!

Ye Xuan let out a crazed roar.

Without dodging, his blood-red dragon-scaled fist, in a mutual-destruction stance, hammered toward Gu Ningxue's head!

BANG! BANG! BANG!

Sword light and fist shadow clashed frantically at the arena's center!

For a moment, the entire arena was engulfed in violent energy storms!

One was an ethereal celestial maiden, her swordplay otherworldly and graceful!

The other was a blood-bathed young demon god, his fist technique dominating, fearless unto death!

Their battle was more intense, more dangerous than any before!

Gradually, Gu Ningxue, with her deeper spiritual reserves and more exquisite techniques, began gaining the upper hand.

Ye Xuan, after continuous high-intensity bursts, began showing chaotic qi and slight hesitation in his movements.

Now!

A flash of sharp light crossed Gu Ningxue's beautiful eyes.

Seizing a gap where Ye Xuan's old force was spent and new force hadn't formed, her sword traced a dazzling flower!

"Ice Seal Dust-Severing!"

But just as she prepared to press her advantage and secure victory—

"Urgh—!"

Ye Xuan suddenly let out a pained grunt, his body going rigid!

A heart-tearing agony erupted from his limbs, from the depths of his dantian!

That was...

Technique backlash!

His meridians, pushed beyond endurance by the endless burning, were finally showing signs of collapse!

His qi fell into chaos!

This sudden development created a fatal pause in his movements!

And Gu Ningxue's combat instincts were razor-sharp!

Though she didn't know what had happened, she wouldn't miss this heaven-sent opportunity!

"BAM!"

Her technique shifted with lightning speed, a palm strike landing on Ye Xuan's chest!

Ye Xuan flew backward as if struck by a heavy blow.

He sprayed a jet of blood midair, crashing heavily at the arena's edge.

But he forced his hand against the ground, stabilizing himself, not falling off the stage.

How could this be?!

He stared at his own body in disbelief, his mind churning with shock!

Why now, of all times!

"Boy! Your body has reached its limit! Forfeit now!"

In his Sea of Consciousness, the Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice was frantic with anxiety. "Keep fighting and you'll die!"

"No!"

Ye Xuan's head snapped up, eyes crimson, his expression crazed!

"I've finally made it here! Just one more step! How can I give up!"

"AHHHHH—!"

He let out an inhuman howl, ignoring his shattering meridians as he frantically squeezed out the last of his potential!

An energy more violent, more crazed, more filled with destruction and death than ever before erupted from within him!

"Not good!"

Alarm bells rang in Gu Ningxue's heart as an unprecedented sense of crisis instantly engulfed her!

But—it was too late!

Ye Xuan's figure appeared before her as if by teleportation!

That handsome face was now completely twisted by pain and madness, looking like a demon crawled from hell!

In his eyes, no trace of reason remained.

Only the purest desire to tear everything before him to shreds—

Killing intent!

"DIE!!!"

He poured all his life, all his soul, all his will into this final punch!

This punch was no longer martial technique!

It was the purest, most mutual-destruction-seeking—

Slaughter!!!

Gu Ningxue's expression changed drastically!

She wanted to dodge, but found her body firmly locked by that death-saturated killing intent!

The entire crowd rose in horror!

What was happening?

Had Ye Xuan gone insane?!

Was he trying to kill Gu Ningxue?!

This wasn't a competition anymore!

This was murder!

Yet just as that destructive blood-red fist was about to touch Gu Ningxue—

A flat voice, carrying a hint of impatience, echoed leisurely through the stadium.

"So noisy."

Then.

A streak of golden sword qi, too fast to be captured by the naked eye or even locked onto by divine sense, shot from an unknown source!

It ignored space, ignored time, arriving before the strike!

BOOM—!!!

That golden sword qi, with an overwhelming, all-crushing posture, effortlessly shattered Ye Xuan's ultimate punch—the one that had burned all his life force!

Crushing victory!

No resistance whatsoever!

The sword qi's momentum barely diminished as it slammed into Ye Xuan!

Ye Xuan didn't even manage a scream.

His entire body was like a nail being hammered into the ground, smashed from midair by that sword qi, forced to kneel on the hard alloy arena!

With him at the center, the entire arena collapsed!
