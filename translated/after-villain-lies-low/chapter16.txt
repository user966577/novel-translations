"Not interested. Not going. Stop bothering me."

Lin Yuan delivered a clean triple rejection, waved his hand, and made to walk around her.

"Hey, wait!"

Gu Ningxue hurriedly blocked him again.

She knew that convincing this guy wouldn't be easy.

She took a deep breath and played her trump card.

"Lin Yuan, I suggest you reconsider. Before I came, the principal said that if I can't convince you, he might... personally contact Old War God Lin at the Northern Frontier."

Contact my grandfather?

Lin Yuan's footsteps actually stopped.

He slowly turned around, a hint of surprise on his face.

Seeing his expression, Gu Ningxue felt a surge of delight, thinking her "threat" had worked.

She couldn't help but laugh. "What? Scared? Let me guess—the reason you participated in the school tournament before must have been because Old War God Lin ordered it, right?"

In her view, the only person in the world who could make this salted fish flip over was probably his legendary grandfather.

However, after his initial surprise, Lin Yuan's expression became strange.

He looked at Gu Ningxue and suddenly laughed too.

"Haha..."

He laughed so hard he doubled over, as if he'd heard the funniest joke in the world.

Gu Ningxue was getting a bit creeped out by his laughter. She frowned. "What are you laughing at?"

"I'm laughing because the principal miscalculated."

Lin Yuan finally managed to stop laughing and wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes. "If they really dare go to my grandfather, you think my grandfather will break their legs instead?"

Gu Ningxue was stunned, her face full of question marks.

What kind of logic was this?

Seeing her confused expression, Lin Yuan was in a great mood and kindly explained.

"Before I entered the tournament, I made a deal with my old man. As long as I got first place, I can lie flat however I want from now on."

"Anyone who dares disturb me over trivial matters like this, he'll personally step in and clear the obstacles for me."

"So, do you understand now? If the principal goes to complain, won't that be walking right into the crosshairs?"

Lin Yuan spread his hands innocently.

Gu Ningxue was completely speechless.

She opened her mouth but found she couldn't say a single word.

That was possible?!

Using grandpa to pressure him, only for him to turn around and use grandpa as a shield—and an upgraded version at that!

What kind of weirdos was this family?!

Lin Yuan looked at her deflated yet adorable expression, nodded with satisfaction, and turned to leave.

After two steps, he turned back.

He waved at the still-dazed Gu Ningxue and said in an encouraging tone:

"Besides, with you and talents like Ye Xuan, our school will definitely bring home the grand slam. I won't butt in—good luck!"

Watching Lin Yuan's retreating figure, Gu Ningxue stood frozen in the wind for a full half-minute.

"This guy..."

She really couldn't hold back and burst out laughing, her body shaking with mirth.

Shaking her head, her face a mix of laughter and exasperation.

Then, Gu Ningxue stopped dawdling and headed toward the principal's office in the administration building.

When she relayed Lin Yuan's words—"my grandfather will break your legs"—verbatim to the expectant principal and several academy higher-ups, the entire office fell into an eerie silence.

The white-haired principal's hand holding his thermos froze in mid-air.

The dean of academic affairs' glasses slid down to the bridge of his nose without him noticing.

Several usually stern special instructors had expressions that were beyond spectacular, as if they'd collectively swallowed a hundred flies.

"He... he really said that?" The principal swallowed hard, his voice a bit dry.

Gu Ningxue suppressed her laughter and nodded sincerely. "Word for word. Didn't change a thing."

"Preposterous! Absolutely preposterous!"

The principal slammed his fist on the table, fuming. "That brat! He's completely out of control! I... I..."

He stammered for a while but realized he really had no way to deal with Lin Yuan.

Couldn't beat him in a fight.

Scold him? He wouldn't even acknowledge it.

Go to his family?

His family was even more protective—in a very physical sense!

One instructor pushed up his glasses and summarized bitterly: "So... we wanted to use Old War God Lin to pressure him, but not only did it fail, it would actually trigger 'reflect' and 'critical hit'?"

The office fell silent again.

Everyone felt their worldview being ground into dust by this grandfather-grandson duo.

In the end, the principal waved his hand helplessly, like a deflated balloon.

"Forget it, forget it! Let him be! Without him, our Dragon Xia Country Capital Martial Arts Academy can still win the championship!"

"Assemble the team immediately! Gather all the top talents of our academy! I refuse to believe that without Lin Yuan, the earth will stop spinning!"

Soon, a new team roster was announced through the academy's internal forum.

【Dragon Xia Country Capital Martial Arts Academy - National College League Team Roster】

Captain: Gu Ningxue (Marrow Cleansing Realm Level 6)

Member: Ye Xuan (Marrow Cleansing Realm Level 2)

Member: Li Xuan'er (Marrow Cleansing Realm Level 3)

Member: Zhao Mang (Marrow Cleansing Realm Level 1)

Member: Liu Yun (Marrow Cleansing Realm Level 1)

The moment this list was posted, it caused a huge stir on the forum.

"Holy crap! No Lin Yuan! Young Master Lin really isn't participating!"

"I told you—he couldn't be bothered with this kind of competition!"

"This lineup is already super strong, okay! Goddess Gu is leading the team herself, plus Ye Xuan the super dark horse!"

"Exactly! Ye Xuan may only be at Marrow Cleansing second level, but his real combat power is way beyond that! I believe in him!"

"Li Xuan'er is there too, tsk tsk, this is interesting—ex and current... pfft, new flame and old flame competing together?"

In a premium gravity training room at the academy.

Ye Xuan was shirtless, sweat steaming off him as he furiously lifted a barbell weighing thousands of pounds.

He saw the team roster pop up on his light-brain.

A flash of disappointment, like a spark, came and went.

Not being able to personally defeat Lin Yuan on the nationally-watched stage was his greatest regret.

But the next second, that disappointment was replaced by an even hotter, even more fervent ambition!

Fine!

Lin Yuan, you arrogant fool!

Since you're so full of yourself that you'd give up this chance to make a name for yourself, then I'll accept it graciously!

Without that mountain pressing down on me.

This National League.

All the glory, all the praise, all the resources—will belong to me, Ye Xuan, alone!

I will become the brightest star on this team!

I will lead them to victory!

I will make all of Dragon Xia Country know.

Who is the true destined one of the younger generation!

When that time comes.

You, Lin Yuan, will be nothing but a joke!

A background character in my legend, Ye Xuan—someone who missed his era because of cowardice and laziness!

"HAAA!"

Ye Xuan let out a bestial roar and heaved the thousands of pounds over his head!

In his eyes burned raging flames!

Girls' dormitory.

Li Xuan'er looked at the roster, her feelings a complicated mess.

She and Ye Xuan were finally standing together legitimately, becoming teammates fighting side by side.

This was once a scene she had dreamed of.

But now, she couldn't feel any happiness at all.

In her mind, she kept seeing Lin Yuan's indifferent gaze from the tournament day, and Ye Xuan's pathetic figure kneeling and vomiting blood.

That chasm...

Could it really be bridged through effort?

For the first time, she felt deep doubt about her choices.
