Outside Yan Jing City, Wilderness Entrance.

Dozens of menacing-looking hover tanks, forged entirely of special alloy, sat like crouching steel beasts in neat rows across the vast plaza.

Young scions from Yan Jing City's major aristocratic families, clad in various custom battle suits, gathered here. The air carried a distinct scent—a mix of excitement, tension, and a hint of blood.

Before them all stood a massive teleportation array.

Runes flowed across the ground, radiating a pale blue glow as the formation made final energy adjustments for the imminent transport.

Through the morning mist, one could vaguely make out the wild, indistinct outline of the distant wilderness.

Occasionally, a roar or two from some unknown beast echoed from those uncharted depths, making every heart present beat faster.

In the crowd, two figures stood out.

Chen Yu and Liu Mingxuan.

Chen Yu wore dazzling silver-white battle armor, gripping his family heirloom Profound-Rank upper-grade war saber "Wind Ripper." His sinister gaze swept through the crowd like a viper searching for that figure he loathed to the bone.

Beside him, Liu Mingxuan wore understated black martial attire. His powerful Qi Sea fifth-level aura emanated subtly, keeping the second-tier family scions at a respectful distance. His fingers lazily toyed with a crystalline demonic beast core, his lips curved in a knowing, confident smirk.

Behind them clustered over a dozen core members of the Chen and Liu families, forming a clearly defined faction.

"Young Master Liu, that waste hasn't arrived yet. Don't tell me he's scared off?" Chen Yu kept his voice low, dripping with unconcealed venom.

"Scared?" Liu Mingxuan chuckled softly, pocketing the core. "Someone like him doesn't know the meaning of 'scared.' But it doesn't matter. As long as he dares enter, this wilderness will be his burial ground."

The two exchanged a tacit, vicious look.

On the other side of the plaza, several equally powerful young prodigies had each staked out their own territory, radiating auras that warned strangers away.

Xiao Long, grandson of the Xiao family's martial god Xiao Cheng'en, stood like an iron tower, his massive battle-axe wider than a door propped on his shoulder. He bantered loudly with the dozen-plus Xiao family members behind him.

His Marrow Cleansing eighth-level presence was wild and unrestrained, though his eyes occasionally flicked toward the entrance, as if waiting for some show to begin.

Song Yao, daughter of the Song family patriarch, moved like an elegant purple leopard.

She wore a form-fitting combat suit, a coiled chain-blade at her waist. She stood conversing quietly with Gu Ningxue, who wore similarly sleek attire.

The two were old acquaintances, though Song Yao's clever eyes harbored undisguised ambition for this hunt.

Just as tensions simmered and undercurrents swirled.

A languid figure, yawning, sauntered slowly from the distance.

It was Lin Yuan.

The moment he appeared, the bustling atmosphere of the plaza instantly stilled!

Countless gazes converged on him!

He walked with one hand in his pocket, the other—remarkably—holding a bright red spirit fruit, which he munched on "crunch, crunch" as he walked.

That casual demeanor stood in stark, glaring contrast to the fully-armed, battle-ready "warriors" around him!

He didn't look like he was here for a life-or-death hunt at all!

He looked like he was on a spring outing!

"I thought you'd sleep right through it at the estate. Didn't expect you to actually show up."

"Don't tell me Uncle Lin literally kicked you out of bed?"

Gu Ningxue, seeing his appearance, pressed a hand to her forehead in exasperation and stepped forward to greet him with a joke.

Lin Yuan's lips twitched almost imperceptibly. He took another big bite of spirit fruit but didn't answer.

"So that's it," Gu Ningxue smiled. "Seems even our great lying-flat deity has moments of being powerless."

At the tail end of the Chen family's contingent, Chen Ruoxi stood quietly.

She wore a simple, elegant long dress today, completely out of place with the surroundings.

Her father Chen Tianhao was spraying spittle at Chen Yu, lecturing him about "winning glory for the family" and such.

He hadn't spared her a single glance from start to finish.

Her gaze traveled through the crowd, landing on that figure chatting and laughing with Gu Ningxue.

Her hand unconsciously tightened around that re-forged bronze hairpin.

Within her, curiosity about the man's unfathomable strength warred with the grievance and bitterness of being utterly ignored by her family.

She wanted so badly to step forward, if only to say one word.

But in the end, she didn't move—only watching from afar, in silence.

Just then.

"Attention!"

A thunderous bellow exploded from the high platform!

A middle-aged man in dark green special forces uniform, stars on his shoulders, strode up.

His face was cold and severe, naturally commanding. The terrifying pressure of the Transformation Realm swept across the venue like a tide, making every young scion catch their breath!

In his hand he held a black command token representing the military's highest authority.

"The Wilderness Hunt lasts seven days!"

His voice, carried by amplification arrays, reached every ear clearly.

"Your goal is simple—survive and earn points!"

"Kill a first-tier demonic beast: 1 point! Second tier: 10 points! Third tier: 100 points! And so on!"

"The wristwatch on each of your wrists is both your identity credential and your point storage device!"

At this, he paused, his cold gaze sweeping across like a blade.

"One final rule—the most important one!"

"Eliminating any competitor allows you to seize... all their points!"

These words detonated like a bomb in the crowd!

Everyone froze!

Eliminate opponents, seize all their points?

This wasn't a hunt at all!

This was encouraging them to slaughter each other!

Instantly, countless people looked at their companions with changed eyes!

Former cooperation and friendliness were instantly replaced by wariness and greed!

Chen Yu and Liu Mingxuan's faces broke into undisguised, savage grins!

This rule was practically tailor-made for them!

The middle-aged officer seemed quite satisfied with the crowd's reaction.

His lips twisted into a cold arc.

Then he continued: "Remember—inside the wilderness, there are no rules, no restrictions! You can form teams freely, or... do as you please!"

"Now, the hunt..."

"Begins!"
