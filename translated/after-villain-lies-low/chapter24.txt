Ye Xuan forcibly suppressed the churning blood in his chest and opened the door.

Standing outside was Li Xuan'er—pale-faced, yet with a hint of urgency and hope in her eyes.

"Ye Xuan..."

Seeing him, Li Xuan'er acted as if she had found her savior and hurriedly began, "Let's talk! Lin Yuan... Lin Yuan is too terrifying! We need to join forces! You're the most dazzling star in the National League right now. As long as we get back together, with your current fame and status, we'll definitely still have a chance..."

Her words were cut short by Ye Xuan's cold, derisive laugh.

"Join forces?"

Ye Xuan looked her up and down, his gaze as if examining a worthless pile of garbage.

"Do you even qualify?"

Those three words were like three sharp knives, stabbing viciously into Li Xuan'er's heart.

Her face went even paler.

"Ye Xuan! How can you say that?!"

She stared in disbelief at this man who was both familiar and strange, her voice cracking. "Back then, to be with you, I didn't hesitate to break with Lin Yuan! I gave you all the cultivation resources the Lin family gave me! You only have today because of me! How can you treat me like this?!"

She thought that bringing up past favors would at least move him.

Instead, what she received was Ye Xuan's even more unbridled laughter, dripping with mockery and contempt.

"Hahaha... hahahaha!"

Ye Xuan doubled over with laughter, as if he had heard the funniest joke in the world.

"Li Xuan'er, do you really think that highly of yourself?"

He suddenly stopped laughing.

He stepped forward and leaned close to her ear.

In a voice only the two of them could hear, like a demon's whisper, he said:

"Did you think I approached you back then because I actually liked a conceited fool like you?"

"I merely saw that you were Lin Yuan's woman, someone I could continuously extract Lin family resources from!"

"Being good to you?"

"That's called investment!"

"Now that Lin Yuan doesn't want you anymore, do you have any value left to me at all?"

BOOM——!

These utterly cruel words struck like divine thunder from the highest heaven, shattering Li Xuan'er's last illusion to pieces!

She stood frozen, as if struck by lightning, her mind completely blank.

So...

That was how it was?

So from beginning to end, she had only been a tool to be used?

A tool for extracting resources from Lin Yuan...

A tool?

All her sacrifices, all her betrayals, all her smugness...

In this moment...

Became one colossal joke!

"No... you're lying! You're not that kind of person!"

Li Xuan'er seemed to go mad, suddenly grabbing Ye Xuan's arm and shrieking hysterically, "You're deceiving me! You must be deceiving me!"

"Get off!"

Extreme disgust and impatience flashed in Ye Xuan's eyes.

He flung his arm violently, and a tremendous force sent Li Xuan'er flying, slamming her hard against the corridor wall.

"A piece of garbage someone else threw away dares come begging to me?"

Ye Xuan straightened his collar, his eyes cold and devoid of any emotion.

"Don't come bother me again. Otherwise, I wouldn't mind making you disappear from this world completely."

With that, he turned to close the door.

"No!"

Li Xuan'er struggled up from the ground and threw herself at him again, clutching his leg desperately, crying and pleading, "Ye Xuan! Please! Don't abandon me! I'll do anything for you! Please..."

She had completely broken down.

Abandoned by Lin Yuan, ignored by her family, and now even her last hope had pushed her into the abyss in the cruelest way possible.

She had nothing left.

Looking at this woman at his feet, clinging to his leg like a dog with no dignity—

Ye Xuan's last shred of patience was finally worn away.

The disgust in his eyes transformed into physical fury!

"I told you to get lost! Don't you understand?!"

He raised his foot, intending to kick her away.

But then he felt that wasn't satisfying enough.

Under Li Xuan'er's disbelieving, tear-filled, pleading gaze—

Ye Xuan slowly raised his hand.

"SLAP——!!!"

An ear-splitting crack echoed through the silent corridor!

This slap carried spiritual power!

Li Xuan'er's entire body was sent spinning through the air, rotating twice before crashing heavily onto the carpet several meters away.

"Pfft!"

A mouthful of blood, mixed with several broken teeth, sprayed from her mouth, leaving a striking blood-red blossom on the pristine carpet.

Half her face swelled visibly, bearing a clear imprint of five fingers—a shocking sight.

Her ears rang; the world seemed to spin.

Ye Xuan didn't even spare her another glance.

He simply shook his hand coldly, as if he had just swatted a disgusting fly.

Then, with a "bang," he slammed the door shut.

Leaving all the cries, pleas, and despair outside.

In the corridor, contestants and hotel staff who had been disturbed pointed and whispered at Li Xuan'er on the ground.

Li Xuan'er just lay on the cold floor, feeling the searing pain on her face and the long-numbed despair in her heart.

Her consciousness slowly sank into endless darkness and humiliation.

Why...

Why did it turn out this way...
