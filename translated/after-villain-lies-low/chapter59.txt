"I... I..."

Chen Ruoxi looked into Lin Ke'er's pure, innocent eyes, her lips moving, but she didn't know how to begin.

Should she tell this sweet, innocent little girl that her brother had refused her entry, leaving her outside?

That would be too humiliating!

However, Lin Ke'er seemed to see right through her embarrassment.

She sighed like a little adult, then whispered in an "I understand" tone:

"Big sister Chen, are you here to see my brother?"

"And you got stopped by these two clueless blocks of wood at the gate?"

Chen Ruoxi's pretty face instantly flushed to the roots of her ears.

She could only nod, mortified.

"Sigh!"

Lin Ke'er sighed again, patting Chen Ruoxi's hand like a little adult, comforting her.

"Big sister Chen, don't worry! And don't blame them!"

"It must be my lazy bum brother giving orders again! All he does every day is sleep and sleep—he hates being disturbed the most!"

"But don't worry, big sister Chen!"

"My brother spoils me the most! I'll go talk to him! He'll definitely see you!"

Lin Ke'er thumped her little chest as she spoke, solemnly promising.

"That's not necessary—I just came here to ask a few small questions..."

Chen Ruoxi shook her head.

"What questions? Tell me, big sister Chen! I'll go ask my brother for you!"

Lin Ke'er's eyes spun with mischief, a plan forming in her mind.

"Really?"

Chen Ruoxi was momentarily stunned.

"Of course!"

Lin Ke'er lifted her chin, making a guarantee.

Seeing her so confident, Chen Ruoxi thought it over and decided to take the gamble. If she just left like this, she'd never be able to let it go.

So she laid out all her questions for Lin Ke'er, one by one.

"Oh, is that all? Wait here for me!"

With that.

Before Chen Ruoxi could react, Lin Ke'er hugged her stack of jade slips and scampered back into the estate like a gust of wind.

Chen Ruoxi watched that small yet incredibly dependable figure disappear, her heart a mix of emotions.

Hope, once again, was rekindled!

Deep within the estate, Lin Yuan's bedroom.

Luxurious. Spacious.

The floor was covered with the soft pelt of some unknown exotic beast.

Lin Yuan was sprawled gracelessly across a sofa made of beast leather.

His left hand held a spiritual fruit emanating rich fragrance, which he nibbled at lazily.

His right hand drew patterns in the air.

Before him, visible only to himself, the system panel continuously refreshed with notifications.

Mmm, bliss.

This was what life should be.

Just then.

The bedroom door was shoved open.

Lin Ke'er shot in like a little cannonball, landing directly on Lin Yuan's back.

"Brother! Brother! Wake up! Stop sleeping!"

Lin Ke'er shook Lin Yuan's arm, wheedling.

"What..."

Lin Yuan didn't even lift an eyelid, mumbling incoherently.

"Don't bother me, I'm busy."

"Brother!" Lin Ke'er persisted. "I just ran into a big problem while studying formations!"

"I feel like artifact refining and formations have a lot in common! Especially that... that artifact spirit! Yes! Artifact spirits! They feel just like formation eyes!"

"Quick, tell me—how are artifact spirits actually nurtured? Do you also have to carve lots and lots of complicated runes?"

Lin Ke'er blinked her big eyes, her face full of "thirst for knowledge."

This was the "perfect" excuse she'd thought up on her way here!

She certainly wasn't going to say that the pretty big sister outside wanted to know!

That way, her brother would definitely find it too troublesome and just send the person away!

"Artifact spirits?"

Lin Yuan's movements paused.

He finally deigned to shift a tiny bit of attention away from the system panel.

Then, in an extremely impatient tone—like he was swatting away a fly—he said casually:

"What's so hard about that?"

"To nurture an artifact spirit, you use your own essence blood as a guide, dripping it into the refined artifact to establish the most basic connection."

"Then, you add heavenly treasures matching the artifact's attributes as nourishment for the artifact spirit's growth."

"Finally, use the 'Spirit Condensation Incantation' and nurture it with divine sense for forty-nine days. That's it. Now go play somewhere else, stop bothering me."

With that.

Lin Yuan rolled over, burying his head in the soft beast pelt. Instantly, the sound of steady breathing could be heard.

As if those words had exhausted all his energy.

"..."

Lin Ke'er looked at her brother who'd fallen asleep in seconds, sticking out her tongue helplessly.

But!

Mission accomplished!

She memorized every single word her brother had just said, word for word.

Then, on tiptoe, she snuck out of the bedroom.

At the estate entrance.

When Lin Ke'er repeated Lin Yuan's exact words to Chen Ruoxi.

Chen Ruoxi stood there as if struck by lightning!

Essence blood as a guide!

Heavenly treasures as nourishment!

Spirit Condensation Incantation for nurturing!

So that's how it was!

So that's how it was!

All her previous attempts had been wrong from the very first step!

She'd actually overlooked the most crucial, most fundamental step of "essence blood as a guide"!

No wonder!

No wonder she couldn't succeed no matter what!

Sudden enlightenment!

The bottleneck that had plagued her for days and nights shattered in this moment!

An unprecedented, thoroughly refreshing sense of clarity spread through her entire body!

"Little sister Ke'er!"

Chen Ruoxi grabbed Lin Ke'er's small hand excitedly, that cold and aloof face blooming with a smile more brilliant than ever before.

"Thank you so much! Truly... thank you so much!"

"You've... you've helped me tremendously!"

Lin Ke'er was startled by her enthusiasm, scratching her head a bit bashfully.

"Hehe, big sister Chen, you don't need to thank me. It was all my brother who said it."

"Your brother?"

The smile on Chen Ruoxi's face faltered slightly.

She looked at Lin Ke'er's innocent face and said in a dreamlike voice:

"Yes..."

"Your brother..."

"He's really... incredible!"
