At the same time!

Liu Mingxuan formed hand seals with both hands.

His powerful spiritual energy at Qi Sea Realm fifth level transformed into wave after wave of invisible mental attacks, crashing viciously into the two women's minds like a tide!

Physical attack and mental attack, descending simultaneously!

"Not good!"

Gu Ningxue's and Song Yao's expressions changed drastically!

They could feel Liu Mingxuan's mental attack causing a momentary freeze in their thoughts!

And that split-second opening was fatal!

"Break!"

At the critical moment, Song Yao gritted her silver teeth.

Throwing caution to the wind, she whipped her chain blade into a purple whirlwind, meeting Chen Yu's domineering saber aura head-on!

Meanwhile, Gu Ningxue endured the stabbing pain in her mind, gathering all her strength into a single sword thrust aimed at Liu Mingxuan's direction!

BOOM——!!!

A deafening explosion erupted!

Song Yao's chain blade, the instant it collided with the "Gale Slash," was knocked from her grip by that violent force!

She herself was struck as if hit by an ancient beast.

With a muffled groan, blood sprayed from her mouth as her slender body flew backward uncontrollably, slamming hard into a giant bamboo stalk!

On the other side, Gu Ningxue's sword had successfully pierced Liu Mingxuan's protective spiritual aura, but only made it waver slightly.

She was thrown backward by the recoil, her blood and qi churning, her face turning deathly pale in an instant!

With just one exchange!

The combined might of the two most gifted women was instantly shattered!

And both were wounded!

"Now's our chance!"

"They're done!"

The surrounding prodigies, seeing this, eyes blazing with cruel light like sharks smelling blood, rushed forward as one!

Puff! Puff!

Caught off guard, Gu Ningxue's shoulder and Song Yao's thigh each received another deep wound that cut to the bone!

The two stumbled together, back to back, gasping heavily, and for the first time, their eyes showed a trace of despair.

The encirclement slowly tightened.

Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu approached leisurely, their faces wearing the satisfied, cat-toying-with-mouse smiles of victors.

"I told you, you couldn't escape."

Liu Mingxuan straightened his clothes, looking down at the bedraggled pair, his voice full of the triumphant pleasure of a winner.

"Hahaha! Gu Ningxue, Song Yao! Weren't you both so good at fighting? Get up and fight some more!"

"Capturing you two at once—our points might shoot straight to the top of the rankings!"

Chen Yu laughed wildly without restraint.

His gaze wandered brazenly over their blood-soaked combat suits.

"Most importantly..." Liu Mingxuan's lips curved in a sinister arc. "With you two as bargaining chips, I refuse to believe that coward Lin Yuan can keep hiding in Black Wind Valley!"

"What a brilliant plan to kill two birds with one stone!"

The surrounding noble heirs also chimed in with satisfied sneers and jeers.

They looked at the two women trapped in the center like lambs to the slaughter.

"Capture them!" Chen Yu waved his hand, giving the final order. "Remember, we want them alive! I want that waste Lin Yuan to watch with his own eyes as the women he loves beg for mercy before us!"

However.

Just one second before they could make their move.

An aura far colder than winter, far more evil than the abyss, suddenly descended from above, shrouding the entire bamboo grove!

"Just this pack of dogs and chickens, and you think you can touch her?"

A hoarse voice dripping with infinite malice rang beside everyone's ears.

Chen Yu, Liu Mingxuan, and the others' expressions changed drastically as they whipped around!

Two figures had appeared behind them at some unknown moment.

A man and a woman.

The man had sinister features, his eyes filled with towering hatred.

The woman was seductively beautiful, but a sickly cruelty hung at the corner of her lips.

It was Ye Xuan and Li Xuan'er!

"Ye Xuan?!"

"It's you, you waste!"

When they saw who had come, Chen Yu and Liu Mingxuan first blanked, then their faces split into expressions of extreme disdain and mockery.

Those behind them were all students from Capital Martial Arts Academy who hadn't been shy about mocking Ye Xuan in the past.

"I was wondering who it could be. So it's this stray dog! What, weren't you hiding outside well enough? You actually dare come here to die?"

"Hahaha, perfect! We'll start with you, then go deal with Lin Yuan!"

They didn't take Ye Xuan seriously at all!

In their view, a waste whose dao heart had shattered and who was wanted by the league—even if he showed up here, what waves could he possibly make?

"Seeking death!"

Ye Xuan's eyes instantly erupted with terrifying killing intent!

What he hated most was people calling him a waste, calling him a stray dog!

BOOM——!

A violent, blood-black spiritual energy exploded from within him!

His entire body shot forward like a cannonball, instantly plunging into the crowd!

"What?!"

The smiles on Chen Yu's and Liu Mingxuan's faces froze instantly!

They felt it!

That spiritual energy was violent, evil, yet... incredibly powerful!

Definitely above Qi Sea Realm sixth level!

"This is bad! We underestimated him!"

They tried to retreat, but it was already too late!

"AAHHH——!"

Screams rose one after another!

Ye Xuan was like a god of death returned from hell.

Each strike he made, another prodigy was torn to shreds by his strange blood-colored claw light!

And Li Xuan'er had also transformed into a pink specter. With every flicker, a male disciple would freeze with a vacant expression under her bewitching smile as she drained him of his vital essence!

This wasn't a battle.

This was... a one-sided slaughter!

In less than a minute.

The "Lin Yuan Execution Alliance" elite squad that had been so imperious moments ago was reduced to just Chen Yu and Liu Mingxuan, both covered in blood, collapsed on the ground, staring in terror at these two who seemed like demon gods!

"Hahaha... hahahaha!"

Ye Xuan stood on Liu Mingxuan's chest, letting out a deranged laugh!

"You looked down on me! You mocked me!"

"And now?!"

"Aren't you still lying like dead dogs under my feet?!"

"You... you..." Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu's eyes were filled with terror. "How did you... become this strong?!"

"Want to know?"

A cruel smile spread across Ye Xuan's face.

"Ask the King of Hell when you get to the underworld!"

He was about to deliver the killing blow.

"Stop!"

Gu Ningxue's cold voice rang out.

Ye Xuan slowly turned his head. Those eyes full of venom and murderous intent locked dead onto Gu Ningxue!

That hatred was ten thousand times stronger than what he felt for Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu!

"Gu Ningxue!"

He squeezed the name out through clenched teeth.

"Do you think I would listen to you?"

"You're so close to that bastard Lin Yuan—you should have died long ago!"

Li Xuan'er also approached, looking at Gu Ningxue's devastatingly beautiful face, her eyes burning with jealous flames.

"That's right! That position should have been mine! You stole everything that belonged to me!"

"Gu Ningxue, you deserve to die!"
