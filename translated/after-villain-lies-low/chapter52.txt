"NO——!"

The black-robed figures let out screams of absolute despair!

Yet their voices were instantly swallowed by the deafening roar!

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The earth wailed!

Space shattered!

The entire bamboo grove, along with several surrounding hills, was leveled to nothing under this meteor-strike-like assault!

In just one breath!

The dozens of Divine Court elites who had been so menacing were mostly wiped out!

The survivors were all wounded, blood and qi churning, their faces filled with disbelieving terror!

"A devil... he's a devil!"

"Quick! Form the Blood God Array! Fight him with everything we've got!"

The lead black-robed figure, at Qi Sea Realm, had gone completely mad!

In his eyes reflected the ever-approaching death stars filling his entire vision!

He wanted to resist!

He wanted to dodge!

But under the dual suppression of the Grand Celestial Star Formation and the falling stars, he couldn't move a single finger!

He could only watch helplessly as that star, larger than a mountain, grew infinitely larger in his pupils!

Then...

He bit through his tongue, spraying a great gout of life essence blood!

The remaining seven or eight black-robed figures followed suit, sacrificing their life sources entirely!

HUM——!

A towering figure, dozens of zhang tall, formed from pure corrupt blood and resentment, slowly condensed within the formation!

An aura foul enough to taint heaven and earth spread wildly!

"ROAR——!"

The blood-colored demon god let out a sky-shaking howl, its massive palm smashing down toward Lin Yuan!

This was their last card!

Their desperate, all-or-nothing gamble to trade their lives for his!

Yet.

Lin Yuan merely cast a cold glance at that demon god.

Then, extending two fingers together like a sword.

He drew a light stroke before him.

"Boundless..."

"Sword Intent!!!"

A formless, soundless sword intent spread from his fingertip.

That sword intent wasn't sharp.

Nor was it domineering.

It was like the deep, infinite ocean that embraces all things yet also swallows them.

Seemingly calm.

But in just the next second.

It raised waves towering enough to devour everything!

BOOM!!!!!!

Wherever the sword intent passed.

That imperious blood-colored demon god, that foul aura capable of tainting all—was utterly annihilated by the ten-thousand-zhang tsunami formed of endless sword intent!

"AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!"

Piercing screams echoed across the scene.

But soon.

They were swallowed by the sword intent.

Finally...

Dissolving, collapsing, silently and without trace...

Returning completely to nothingness.

Along with the last few black-robed figures' lives, all consumed by this "ocean."

When the last wisp of sword intent dissipated.

The stars in the sky faded, the blood moon vanished.

The sky returned to clarity.

As if all that world-destroying devastation had been nothing but an illusion.

The entire world fell into deathly silence.

Pin-drop quiet.

Whether it was Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu collapsed on the ground, or Gu Ningxue who had just recovered from her meditation, or Ye Xuan and Li Xuan'er in their craters, unable even to crawl out.

Everyone's minds had crashed.

What had they just witnessed?

A formation conjured with a single thought, drawing down the stars of the Nine Heavens.

A single punch thrown, ten thousand stars falling.

A single finger pointed, endless sword intent becoming an ocean.

Those dozens of menacing Divine Court assassins, that demon god of blood summoned by sacrificing their lives, reeking of corrupt evil...

Just gone?

Wiped out by that Lin Yuan who stood motionless from start to finish, using three completely different yet equally miraculous methods?

From beginning to end, Lin Yuan hadn't even shifted his feet by half an inch!

This...

Is this something a human being can do?!

Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu trembled like leaves.

Their pants had long since become hot and wet.

Fear!

Endless fear, like icy venom, had been injected into every limb and bone, freezing their souls!

They finally understood.

What they had provoked wasn't some hot-blooded young genius.

What they had schemed to surround and kill wasn't some Lin family scion.

It was a god—wearing the skin of a youth—who could shatter stars with a snap of his fingers and slaughter all living beings!

Their so-called "Lin Yuan Execution Alliance," their so-called "inescapable net"—before such an existence—was nothing but an utter joke!

"Cough... cough cough..."

In the crater, Ye Xuan coughed violently, each cough bringing up black blood mixed with organ fragments.

He didn't look at his body, nearly shredded by the sword intent.

He only lifted his head, using an expression mixed with ultimate hatred, ultimate unwillingness, and... ultimate despair, to stare at that figure standing calm as still water.

It was over.

Everything was over.

All his hopes for revenge, all his ambitions and unwillingness, had been ground to dust by that world-ending display.

The gap was too vast.

So vast that he couldn't even muster the energy to be jealous.

All that remained was endless, icy... despair.

Gu Ningxue had also risen to her feet.

Her cold, beautiful face was now covered with undisguisable shock.

She knew Lin Yuan was strong.

But she never dreamed Lin Yuan could be this strong!

This had completely exceeded her understanding of the very concept of "martial arts"!

So this was...

His true strength?

Just as this deathly silence hung over everything.

A figure abruptly, without any warning, appeared before Ye Xuan.

He still wore that wide black robe, hood pulled low.

But the aura emanating from him—vast as an abyss, cold as a demonic prison—made everyone's hearts seize!

Too powerful!

This aura was a hundred, a thousand times more terrifying than all those Divine Court assassins combined!

He simply stood there, yet seemed to be the very source of evil in this heaven and earth!

"Father..."

Ye Xuan, seeing who had come, finally reignited a faint glimmer in those ashen eyes.

It was his father!

Ye Canglan!

Ye Canglan didn't acknowledge his son.

He slowly raised his head, his gaze beneath the hood piercing through space to lock dead onto Lin Yuan.

An invisible aura filled with destructive intent exploded forth!

"Brat..."

Hoarse, icy, devoid of the slightest emotion, the voice emerged from beneath the black robe.

"You dare wound my son and ruin my plans."

"You... deserve death!"

Before his words even finished!

He moved!

No superfluous actions.

He simply, plainly, struck out with one palm toward Lin Yuan's direction!

BOOM——!!!

The entire space seemed to freeze solid under this single palm!

A massive talon formed from the purest, ink-black death energy materialized out of thin air!
