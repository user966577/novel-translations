"Mountain Split!"

Zhao Wenwu's muscles bulged across his entire body.

Like an enraged bull, he charged with the momentum to cleave mountains and shatter stone, hurling a punch at Gu Ningxue!

His fist wind howled, compressing the air until it emitted a muffled boom!

Yet facing this fierce punch, Gu Ningxue didn't even shift her feet.

In her mind, the image of Lin Yuan involuntarily surfaced—that lazy, couldn't-care-less-about-anything demeanor.

"Like a cockroach that won't die, plenty of tricks up his sleeve..."

Though Lin Yuan had been talking about Ye Xuan, those words set alarm bells ringing in her head.

When a lion hunts a rabbit, it still uses its full strength!

The moment she stepped onto this arena, she had set aside every trace of condescension!

"Clang——"

A clear, melodious sword cry rang out.

A snow-bright sword flash, like a falling star from the Nine Heavens, flickered past in an instant!

Fast beyond measure!

Everyone saw only a white streak, unable to even discern how Gu Ningxue had drawn her blade!

The next second.

Zhao Wenwu's wild charge came to an abrupt halt!

He froze in his punching stance, his face filled with disbelief.

A wisp of icy chill rose slowly from his neck.

He lowered his head with difficulty.

A sword thin as a cicada's wing had somehow, silently, come to rest against his throat.

The blade's edge gleamed with frigid light—one more inch forward and it would pierce his throat in an instant!

Gulp.

Zhao Wenwu swallowed hard, his forehead instantly drenched in cold sweat.

The entire arena fell deathly silent.

Seconds later, the referee's voice finally rang out.

"First match—Gu Ningxue wins!"

ROAR——!!!

The stadium erupted in thunderous applause and exclamations!

"Holy crap! Instant kill! Another instant kill!"

"Too strong! Goddess Gu's sword is so fast you can't even see it!"

"Zhao Wenwu's a fifth-level Marrow Cleansing after all! He couldn't even take one move from her!"

Gu Ningxue sheathed her sword, gave Zhao Wenwu a slight nod.

Then turned.

Crisp and decisive, she walked off the arena.

The matches continued.

Imperial Military Academy's Qin Zhan took the stage. His opponent was a sixth-level Marrow Cleansing expert known for agile footwork.

Yet before his domineering Dragon Elephant Prison-Suppressing Art, all technique seemed pale and powerless.

Just three punches!

Only three punches!

Qin Zhan shattered his opponent's protective aura and sent him flying out of the arena with a single blow—simple, brutal, and unreasonable!

Then came Magic City Martial Arts Academy's Liu Ruyan, War God Academy's Shi Lei...

These top-tier geniuses also demonstrated their overwhelming dominance, advancing with ease.

The pace of the competition was breathtakingly fast!

Finally, when the light screen froze once more, all eyes in the venue instantly converged on a single name!

【Capital Martial Arts Academy · Ye Xuan VS Cangyun Martial Arts Academy · Luo Tian】

"Here it comes! It's that dark horse Ye Xuan!"

"His opponent is Luo Tian! Cangyun Academy's ace—a seventh-level Marrow Cleansing veteran powerhouse!"

"Now it gets interesting! Ye Xuan may have defied the odds all the way here, but he's still just a grass-roots fighter with a shallow foundation. Against an old hand like Luo Tian, his dark horse journey probably ends here!"

"Hard to say—Ye Xuan's got something weird about him!"

Amid the chatter, Ye Xuan and the tall, haughty-faced Luo Tian stepped onto the arena.

Luo Tian looked Ye Xuan up and down, his lips curling into unconcealed contempt.

"Ye Xuan, right? I've heard of you."

He spoke in a condescending tone. "A second-level Marrow Cleansing piece of trash who's made it this far by burning his potential with secret techniques. Impressive, I'll give you that."

"Too bad your luck ends here."

"Today, I'll personally expose you for the clown you are!"

Luo Tian suddenly released his aura!

The mighty pressure of a seventh-level Marrow Cleansing expert swept toward Ye Xuan like a tidal wave!

He intended to crush Ye Xuan's fighting spirit with sheer presence alone!

Yet facing this pressure, Ye Xuan simply stood there, his face expressionless.

In his mind flashed the pathetic image of Li Xuan'er, that foolish woman, crying and begging him to take her back.

Flashed the scene of Lin Yuan, that bastard, lounging in his chair, bringing Huangfu Zhuo to his knees and making him vomit blood with a single glance!

Endless rage, resentment, jealousy...

Transformed into the purest fuel, blazing fiercely in his chest!

"Is that so?"

Ye Xuan slowly raised his head. His eyes had turned blood-red, filled with madness and violence!

"Shut up!"

BOOM——!!!

An aura ten times more violent than Luo Tian's erupted from Ye Xuan's body, shooting skyward!

This was no longer mere spiritual energy fluctuation!

It was a destructive force—

A mixture of blood-fiend qi, Dragon Might, and endless mad will!

"What?!"

The smile on Luo Tian's face froze instantly, replaced by utter terror!

Before this aura, his seventh-level Marrow Cleansing pressure crumbled like paper, scattered into nothing!

"This move—is to shut you up!"

Ye Xuan's figure vanished from where he stood!

The next instant, he appeared before Luo Tian. A fist covered in blood-red dragon scales, trailing a sonic boom that tore through the air, slammed forward!

"Blood-Burning... Dragon Fist!"

BANG——!!!

A tremendous crash!

The layers of protective aura Luo Tian hastily erected shattered like glass!

His entire body, as if struck head-on by an armored behemoth at full speed—

Sprayed a jet of blood from his mouth!

Flew backward!

Crashed heavily onto the ground beneath the arena, instantly unconscious!

One move!

Again, one move!

The entire Dragon's Nest, in that moment, fell into deathly silence!
