Yan Jing City, Old District.

This area had been completely abandoned after the horrific beast tide fifty years ago.

Crumbling walls, wild overgrown grass.

Broken billboards creaked and groaned in the night wind.

The air carried a musty smell of decay, mixed with the faint tang of dried blood.

Li Xuan'er supported Ye Xuan, trudging through the ruins, one labored step at a time.

Ye Xuan's complexion was even darker than the night around him.

He had no idea why Li Xuan'er was bringing him to this godforsaken place.

Since agreeing to that humiliating arrangement, he had become a soulless walking corpse.

Li Xuan'er seemed completely oblivious to his mood.

She walked ahead, her high heels clicking on the rubble-strewn path, each step crisp yet lonely.

Finally, she stopped before a church that had half-collapsed.

In the shadow of the church stood a vague figure.

The person wore a loose black robe with the hood pulled low, shrouding themselves entirely in darkness, face invisible.

They stood there silently, as if merged with the ruins themselves.

If Li Xuan'er hadn't stopped, Ye Xuan wouldn't have even noticed someone was there.

"I've brought him."

Li Xuan'er's voice broke the dead silence, carrying a hint of deference she herself hadn't noticed.

The black-robed figure slowly nodded.

They moved.

Step by step, emerging from the shadows.

Each step was slow, as if landing on Ye Xuan's heartbeat, filling him with inexplicable oppression and unease.

Ye Xuan's body instinctively tensed.

He watched the unknown black-robed figure with alert eyes.

Though he was now crippled, the martial artist's instincts remained.

He could sense this black-robed figure was dangerous!

Extremely dangerous!

The sensation was like facing a prehistoric beast in slumber—utterly terrifying pressure!

This person was definitely a powerhouse!

A powerhouse far beyond his imagination!

Who were they?

Behind Li Xuan'er stood someone of this caliber?

Countless thoughts raced through Ye Xuan's mind.

The black-robed figure stopped before Ye Xuan, saying nothing, merely watching him silently.

Though he couldn't see their face.

Ye Xuan could feel an appraising, complex, penetrating gaze upon him.

Under that scrutiny.

He felt as if he'd been stripped bare.

From inside to out, all his secrets, all his resentment and bitterness—laid completely bare!

"Who... are you?"

Ye Xuan's voice came out hoarse and dry.

The black-robed figure didn't answer his question.

They slowly raised their hand.

That hand was very clean, very pale.

Not at all like the hand a supreme powerhouse should have.

Then, under Ye Xuan's tense gaze.

They lowered their hood.

Moonlight, cold as water.

Fell upon the face now emerging from darkness.

In that instant!

Ye Xuan's body went rigid!

His entire being felt struck by divine thunder from the Nine Heavens, charred inside and out!

Mind—blank!

BOOM—

It was the face of a middle-aged man.

Features handsome and defined, showing traces of age at the corners of his eyes yet still revealing the handsomeness of his youth.

And this face...

Bore a seventy-percent resemblance to Ye Xuan's own!

Old District.

If Ye Xuan was a wolf cub not yet fully grown.

Then the man before him was a true alpha wolf standing atop the mountain, surveying all beneath.

"Xuan'er..."

The middle-aged man spoke.

His voice carried a peculiar magnetism—gentle, yet containing an unquestionable authority.

"You've grown up."

These simple four words.

Were like a hundred-million-ton hammer, crashing into Ye Xuan's already-collapsed defenses!

Him...

Who was he?

Why...

Did he look so much like himself?

Why...

Did he call his name in that tone?

An absurd thought, one he himself found laughable, surged uncontrollably from the depths of his soul!

Impossible!

Absolutely impossible!

He was an orphan!

He'd grown up in an orphanage!

He had no father!

His mother had died long ago!

"You... you've got the wrong person!"

Ye Xuan practically shrieked the words.

His body trembled violently; the inner turmoil pulled at every wound, the agony nearly making him pass out.

Yet the middle-aged man's expression showed no change.

He merely watched Ye Xuan quietly, that complex gaze now holding a trace of pity, of disappointment.

"It seems these years of hardship have made you forget even your own bloodline?"

He slowly extended his hand, palm upward.

HUM—!

A blood-red flame, as if condensed from the purest blood, materialized from nothing in his palm!

The instant Ye Xuan saw that blood flame!

His pupils contracted to pinpoints!

His blood, in that moment, boiled uncontrollably!

Every drop of blood within him screamed, rejoiced, submitted!

That was absolute suppression and resonance from the deepest core of his bloodline!

"No... this can't be..."

Ye Xuan's lips lost all color.

He crumpled to the ground, utterly drained of strength to resist.

Though a million refusals churned within him.

But...

A fact presented itself mercilessly before Ye Xuan!

He knew.

He didn't need to doubt anymore.

The man before him.

This man who filled him with crushing pressure and fear.

Really was...

His...

Father!

Lin Estate.

Back Garden.

The sunlight was just right, the breeze gentle.

Lin Yuan lay comfortably in his dedicated lounge chair, covered by a soft cashmere blanket, sleeping soundly.

His life these past few days had been as leisurely and monotonous as ever.

Besides sleeping, he'd find a different spot to keep sleeping.

【Ding! Detected Host successfully "slacking off" in public for over 24 hours. Achievement "Social Terror" unlocked. Reward: minor cultivation advancement!】

【Ding! Detected Host refused social interaction over two hundred times consecutively. Achievement "Ultimate Recluse" unlocked. Reward: Heaven-Rank lower-grade technique—"Grand Dream of Eternal Seasons" introductory chapter!】

【Ding! Detected Host "lying flat" total duration exceeded one hundred hours. Milestone achievement "Ultimate Salted Fish King" unlocked. Reward: one Profound-Rank supreme medicinal pill—Mystic Dragon Scarlet Blood Pill!】

These days.

Rewards arrived on schedule.

As for the aftermath of the Su family banquet.

Things like the Chen family being bound to a war chariot, the Liu family seething with fury, and that girl called Chen Ruoxi locking herself in her room for hours before emerging...

None of it concerned Lin Yuan in the slightest.

Could anything be more important than sleep?

Just as he was reaching a critical point in his rendezvous with the Duke of Zhou's daughter.

A wave of energy more pure and vast than ever before surged like the Milky Way pouring down, flooding through his limbs and bones!

Lin Yuan's cultivation, which had plateaued at Qi Sea first level, couldn't even hold for one second before being swept away like dead leaves in a storm!

Qi Sea sixth level!

Done!

The entire process didn't leave even a ripple of disturbance on his peaceful, sleeping face.

He merely smacked his lips in his sleep, annoyed, and rolled over.

Mm...

Seems like a breakthrough happened.

Not bad—Qi Sea sixth level. Spiritual power's gotten much denser. He could sleep even more soundly now.

As for that "Grand Dream of Eternal Seasons" technique...

Lin Yuan's divine sense swept over it casually.

Oh, a technique that could run automatically while sleeping, refining divine soul and physical body.

Not bad at all—practically tailor-made for this young master's needs!

From now on, even cultivation time was saved. He could devote himself entirely to the great enterprise of sleeping!

System, you really understand me!

Lin Yuan nodded with satisfaction, ready to continue sleeping.

But come to think of it...

Where had that guy Ye Xuan run off to?

Logically, with his Dao heart shattered and now a wanted criminal, the Martial Alliance should have captured him long ago.

Yet days had passed with no word.

As if he'd vanished from the face of the earth.

Lin Yuan's mind drifted, involuntarily recalling the original novel's plot.

In the original, though Ye Xuan was officially an orphan, he actually had a father.

And that father was no small figure.

He was a complete, lurking-in-the-shadows, world-shaking...

Super villain!

The leader of a mysterious organization called the "Divine Court"!

This organization had gathered countless demonic path cultivators and malcontents, dedicated to overthrowing the existing order and establishing what they called a "Divine Kingdom."

In the original plot, Ye Xuan's father would personally appear in Yan Jing City during the "Wilderness Hunt" arc, pursuing some scheme.

Then, through a twist of fate, he would reunite with Ye Xuan.

After that came a melodramatic saga of "righteous son" versus "evil father"—love and hate intertwined, killing each other yet bound together.

But now...

The plot had been utterly derailed by this butterfly.

Ye Xuan had fallen to rock bottom ahead of schedule, becoming a stray dog.

Li Xuan'er had also vanished to who-knows-where.

These two together...

Could it be...

That Ye Xuan had connected with his villain father ahead of schedule?

A "former protagonist" whose cultivation was crippled and who hated the entire world.

A "big villain" with boundless ambition, seeking to overturn everything.

If this father-son duo got together early...

Now that would be entertaining!

At this thought, even Lin Yuan's salted-fish heart couldn't help but stir slightly.

Things were getting more and more interesting.

He slowly closed his eyes, a playful smile at the corner of his lips.

Whatever.

No matter how much they schemed.

Before this young master's absolute strength, they were nothing but chickens and dogs—not worth worrying about!
