Li Xuan'er stood at the back of the group.

At this moment.

She felt like an outsider who didn't belong.

She watched Ye Xuan, worshipped and revered by countless people.

She watched his face—pale from overusing the secret technique, yet filled with madness and obsession.

Her heart felt not a shred of joy, but rather a bone-chilling cold.

This...

Was this the man she had betrayed Lin Yuan to choose?

After the match ended.

In the rest room, Ye Xuan didn't even bother talking to any of his teammates.

He just sat alone, silently wiping the blood from his hands.

In those eyes, there was no joy of victory—only a predatory, man-eating gleam.

All his attention seemed focused on a distant direction—

The direction of the Lin Family Estate.

Li Xuan'er mustered her courage, stepped forward, and said softly: "Ye Xuan, congratulations. We... at this rate, we'll win the championship soon!"

Ye Xuan didn't even lift his head, just let out a cold snort through his nose.

"Championship?"

"This little kids' game—you call that a championship?"

"This is only the beginning."

With that, he stood up and pushed the door open.

Leaving all his teammates' congratulations and cheers behind him.

Li Xuan'er stood frozen in place, feeling as if a bucket of ice water had been dumped over her from head to toe.

A little kids' game?

Was that how he saw the glory he'd traded his life for?

In his eyes, it was worthless?

In that moment, her mind uncontrollably conjured Lin Yuan's lazy face once more.

Though that man was always uninterested in everything, he had always been gentle and accommodating toward her.

He would remember some dessert she mentioned liking offhand, and the next day have the family's special chef make it and deliver it to her.

He would awkwardly tell cold jokes to cheer her up when her cultivation hit a snag.

He would treat her every request like an imperial decree, fulfilling them all without asking why.

Back then, she had taken it all for granted—even found him annoying, like a clingy shadow she couldn't shake off.

But now?

Ye Xuan had won the world, yet begrudged her even a smile.

Lin Yuan had lost her, yet once gave her the world.

So it turned out...

She was the laughable fool all along!

She had treated a snake wearing dragon skin—cold and selfish inside—as treasure.

And pushed away the true divine dragon who could command wind and rain and would have shielded her from all storms!

Regret!

Endless regret sliced at her heart like the sharpest knife.

Leaving the rest room.

Li Xuan'er wandered the streets like a zombie.

Without realizing it, she hailed a cab.

And gave an address she once knew so well, now so unreachable.

The Lin Family Estate.

When that magnificent estate—like a divine dwelling from mythology—appeared before her eyes again, Li Xuan'er's breath stopped.

The towering walls, the heavily guarded posts.

And that massive gilded gate that seemed to separate two worlds.

All of it silently reminded her of what she had lost.

She once...

Could freely open that gate, walk into a place that countless noble ladies would break their necks trying to enter.

But now, she could only stand across the street like a pitiful wretch, gazing up in misery.

She watched refrigerated trucks carrying top-grade ingredients drive into the estate.

Any single ingredient was a hundred times more precious than the spirit plants she exchanged for with academy points.

She watched servants in neat uniforms coming and going.

Every face wore genuine pride.

A cold wind blew, and she instinctively pulled her coat tighter.

But that chill seemed to come from the depths of her soul—impossible to ward off.

She stood in those shadows for a long, long time.

Like a stone statue of a wife waiting for her husband's return, hoping to catch a glimpse of that familiar figure—even just a glimpse of his back.

Inside the estate, master bedroom.

Lin Yuan was soaking in his custom-made constant-temperature spiritual liquid massage tub, drowsy with comfort.

In his mind, the system notification had just finished.

[Ding! Detected that Host has not left home for ten consecutive days, perfectly embodying the "Self-Isolation Lying Flat" philosophy. Reward: One wisp of ancient divine beast "Black Tortoise" bloodline!]

Another top-tier bloodline reward!

Lin Yuan felt the power within him grow even more substantial.

Just then.

Old butler Uncle Zhong's figure appeared respectfully at the bathroom door.

"Young Master, that young lady from the Li family has been lingering outside the estate for nearly an hour now."

Lin Yuan kept his eyes closed, not even bothering to raise an eyebrow.

"Oh?"

Uncle Zhong paused, then continued his report: "From the looks of it, she wants to see you. The temperature outside has already dropped below freezing, and she's not dressed warmly. If she keeps standing there, she might..."

Lin Yuan finally opened his eyes. He sat up from the tub, wiped the water droplets from his body, his tone as flat as discussing the weather.

"It's cold out. Don't let her freeze to death at our doorstep—bad luck."

Uncle Zhong was taken aback, thinking the young master had gone soft.

However, Lin Yuan's next words made even him shiver.

"Send the security team out to remind her that dumping large garbage is prohibited at our doorstep, as is loitering for extended periods. If she still won't leave, cite suspicious activity and open the gates—release the dogs!"
