"Wow! That's wonderful!"

Lin Ke'er instantly cheered with joy, throwing herself into Chen Ruoxi's arms like a happy little butterfly for a big hug.

"Big sister Chen, you're the best! The best big sister I've ever met!"

Feeling that small, warm body in her embrace.

Chen Ruoxi's heart, which had been suspended due to the enormous pressure, somehow settled down.

Her gaze once again turned toward the depths of the estate.

Perhaps...

With that man around.

A Heaven-rank treasure wasn't entirely... out of reach.

From that day on.

A peculiar, almost bizarre pattern formed at the entrance of the Lin Family Estate.

Every few days.

Whenever Chen Ruoxi encountered a problem in artifact refining that she couldn't solve on her own.

She would appear at her usual spot outside the estate entrance, right on time.

Without a word, she would simply wait quietly.

And Lin Ke'er, the little princess of the Lin family, would faithfully come running out of the estate every day, hugging a pile of formation jade slips.

Then she would carry Chen Ruoxi's latest questions back home.

Straight to that lazy bum brother's bedroom, who was always sleeping.

"Brother! Brother! I've got another problem!"

"Why is it that when I put red copper and Profound Iron together, they always explode? How do I make different materials fuse together perfectly?"

"Brother! Brother! This is bad! My spiritual energy suddenly went out of control while refining! It almost blew up my cauldron! What do I do?"

"Brother! Brother! Help! Why does the spirit liquid I purify always have so many impurities? Is there any way to make it purer?"

At first.

Lin Yuan found it strange that his little sister, who was obsessed with formations to the point of madness, had suddenly developed such intense interest in artifact refining.

But he couldn't be bothered to think about it.

Too troublesome.

Besides, these were just basic questions that couldn't get any more basic.

A few casual words of guidance was all it took to deal with them.

For him, answering these questions took even less effort than rolling over.

And so.

Under Lin Yuan's "tacit approval" of this perfunctory "teaching."

Chen Ruoxi's artifact refining abilities began to skyrocket like a rocket!

In just half a month.

She had completely mastered all the Profound-grade artifact refining methods in the "Celestial Craftsmanship Compendium"!

Whether it was offensive flying swords, defensive armor, or auxiliary formation plates.

As long as it was within the Profound-grade range, she could produce it effortlessly, with a success rate exceeding ninety percent!

This rate of progress, if word got out, would cause an earthquake throughout Dragon Xia Country's artifact refining world!

However.

When she began attempting to break through to Earth-grade artifact refinement, new problems emerged.

On this particular day.

Lin Ke'er once again found Lin Yuan with a new "puzzle."

"Brother! That... that ten-thousand-year Profound Crystal, how do you purify it? I feel like it's so hard, my divine sense can't penetrate it at all!"

Lin Ke'er asked while carefully watching her brother's reaction.

On the sofa.

Lin Yuan didn't even open his eyes, just yawned lazily.

Then, he said something that instantly turned Lin Ke'er to stone.

"Tell the person asking through you."

"Stop practicing with that inferior junk from who-knows-what corner."

"Wasting time, and wasting my breath."

BOOM!!!

Lin Ke'er's mind went blank!

She... she she she...

She'd been found out?!

Brother... brother he... he knew all along?!

He knew she'd been passing messages for big sister Chen outside?!

For a moment, Lin Ke'er froze in place, completely at a loss, her little face flushing bright red.

It's over!

Brother's definitely going to be mad!

He hates trouble the most!

Tricking him like this—he'll never talk to me again!

However.

The storm she'd expected never came.

Lin Yuan just waved his hand impatiently.

"Ten-thousand-year Profound Crystal needs to be forged in Southern Bright Li Fire for seven days, then soaked in Nine Nether Cold Spring for one shichen before it can be softened."

"Now get out, don't disturb my sleep."

With that.

He rolled over again, his back to Lin Ke'er, and went still in an instant.

Lin Ke'er stood dazed for a long time before finally reacting.

Brother...

He wasn't angry?

Not only was he not angry, he even... told her the solution?

A huge wave of warmth instantly flooded Lin Ke'er's heart.

She tiptoed out of the room, then flew like a happy little bird, racing out of the estate.

When Chen Ruoxi heard from Lin Ke'er Lin Yuan's words—"tell the person asking through you."

She froze completely too.

Then.

A complex, indescribable feeling welled up in her heart.

There was the embarrassment of being caught red-handed.

There was the shame of having her scheme exposed.

But more than anything, there was a... strange warmth.

So he'd known all along.

He'd clearly known she'd been using his sweet, innocent little sister to ask him for guidance.

Yet he hadn't called her out, hadn't gotten angry.

Instead, time after time, he'd tacitly allowed this behavior to continue.

He'd even complained that the materials she used were too poor, a waste of time...

This man...

He really was just cold and lazy on the outside.

His heart, actually... was very gentle.

Chen Ruoxi's heart skipped a beat involuntarily.

A touching blush crept across her cold, aloof face.

Under Lin Yuan's "one eye open, one eye closed" indirect guidance.

Chen Ruoxi's artifact refining journey hit the fast lane.

One more month passed.

Chen Family, quiet room.

With a sword cry like a dragon's roar, a blinding bolt of lightning shot toward the heavens!

Before Chen Ruoxi, quietly hovering in mid-air, was a silver-white shield covered in mysterious thunder patterns!

The terrifying spiritual energy waves emanating from it caused the very space of the quiet room to distort!

Earth-grade lower-quality treasure—Thunder Pattern Heart-Protecting Shield!

Done!

She had successfully refined her first true Earth-grade treasure!

At the same time.

Chen Family, council hall.

The atmosphere was oppressive to the extreme.

In the seat of honor sat a middle-aged man with a stern countenance, radiating authority without anger.

It was the current patriarch of the Chen family, Chen Tianhao.

His fingers tapped rhythmically against the purple sandalwood armrest beside him, producing muffled thuds.

Each tap was like a heavy hammer, pounding on the hearts of every Chen family elder present.

Below the hall, two factions sat on opposite sides.

One faction, led by the Grand Elder, advocated repairing relations with the Lin family.

The other faction, led by the Third Elder, insisted on maintaining the alliance with the Liu family.

The two sides had been arguing for a full hour, faces red with anger, neither able to convince the other.
