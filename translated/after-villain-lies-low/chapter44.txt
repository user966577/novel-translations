The instant the words fell!

HUM—!!!

The massive teleportation array at the plaza's center blazed with light!

Blinding white radiance instantly swallowed every figure!

Then.

A spinning, weightless sensation of being torn, stretched, then violently hurled—

When vision cleared, everyone had scattered to the four winds.

Gu Ningxue found herself at the edge of a damp, gloomy forest.

Ancient trees blocked out the sun, the air thick with the smell of rotting leaves. Strange creature cries occasionally echoed from the distance.

Without hesitation, she drew her sword instantly, entering maximum alert and combat-ready mode the moment she landed, then began cautiously scouting her surroundings.

Elsewhere, Chen Yu and Liu Mingxuan's luck was clearly excellent.

The two had been teleported together to relatively open hilly terrain.

"Quick! Send the signal! Rally our people!"

Liu Mingxuan made the call immediately.

Chen Yu pulled a special signal flare from his vest and yanked the cord!

WHOOSH—!

A crimson smoke trail bearing a willow-leaf mark shot skyward!

Song Yao landed atop a steep mountain peak.

Biting wind whipped her ice-blue battle suit.

Holding her Cold Moon Whip, she surveyed the vast wilderness below with hawk-like eyes, her mind already racing through the most efficient hunting routes.

As for Lin Yuan.

His luck was rather good—he stood in a scenic spot.

Birdsong and flowers surrounded him, bees and butterflies danced, sunlight was warm and pleasant.

Forget third-tier demonic beasts—within miles, there wasn't even a single aggressive first-tier beast in sight.

Lin Yuan slowly picked himself up from the flower bed, dusted off, and gave an enormous yawn.

He plucked an unknown wildflower from nearby, stuck it in his mouth, then shoved both hands in his pockets and began strolling through this picturesque flower sea like an old man on an after-dinner walk.

Before long, three rabbit-like demonic beasts appeared, heads down munching on spirit grass.

【First-Tier Demonic Beast: Wind Rabbits】

【Points: 1】

Lin Yuan didn't even glance at them, just flicked his hand casually.

SWISH! SWISH! SWISH!

Three invisible qi blades sliced precisely across the three Wind Rabbits' necks.

Blood sprayed.

They didn't even have time to squeal before dying instantly.

【Ding! First-tier demonic beast killed successfully! Points +1!】

【Ding! First-tier demonic beast killed successfully! Points +1!】

【Ding! First-tier demonic beast killed successfully! Points +1!】

His wristwatch beeped mechanically three times.

Lin Yuan dug at his ear as if the noise had disturbed him, then continued forward.

A few more minutes of walking, and intense fighting sounds finally broke the peace.

Seven or eight muscular giant wolves, bodies wreathed in red flames, had cornered a trembling white fawn.

【Second-Tier Demonic Beast: Scarlet Flame Wolves】

【Points: 10】

Lin Yuan's brow furrowed with annoyance.

So irritating.

Interrupting this young master's leisurely stroll!

He couldn't be bothered to walk over.

Just flicked a finger.

WHOOSH—!

A strand of sword intent finer than hair, nearly invisible, crossed hundreds of meters in an instant like teleportation!

That sword intent traced a mysterious, profound arc through the air—like the Reaper's scythe—effortlessly piercing through every Scarlet Flame Wolf's skull!

THUD THUD THUD THUD...

A series of muffled thuds followed.

Those seven or eight ferocious Scarlet Flame Wolves went rigid, the flames in their eyes extinguishing instantly, then collapsed in unison!

From start to finish, they never even saw how they died!

【Ding! Second-tier demonic beast killed successfully! Points +10!】

The wristwatch chimed again.

Lin Yuan's score rose from a pitiful 3 to an equally pitiful 13.

After all that, he scanned around as if completing some trivial chore, quickly spotting a tree with lush branches and dense shade.

He strolled over with practiced ease, adjusted into a comfortable position, and leaned against the thick trunk.

Sunlight filtered through leaf gaps, casting dappled shadows.

A gentle breeze carried the fragrance of flowers.

Lin Yuan contentedly closed his eyes to bask in the sun.

Showing absolutely zero intention of actively hunting demonic beasts.

Meanwhile, at the observation plaza outside the wilderness.

A massive light screen hovered in midair, displaying real-time updates of every competitor's point rankings.

Right now, the data on the screen was jumping rapidly.

【First Place: Liu Mingxuan, Points: 30】

【Second Place: Xiao Long, Points: 28】

【Third Place: Gu Ningxue, Points: 21】

Liu Mingxuan and Xiao Long, leveraging team strength, had jointly hunted several second-tier demonic beasts within barely half an hour of the hunt's start, temporarily claiming the top spots.

Just then!

The rankings on the screen suddenly shuddered!

【First Place: Song Yao, Points: 100】

HISS—!

A collective gasp swept through the observation stands!

One hundred points!

That meant she had already solo-killed a third-tier demonic beast in such a short time!

"As expected of the Song family's young lady! That strength is terrifying!"

"Looks like this hunt's champion belongs to her!"

Just as the crowd marveled at Song Yao's power, Gu Ningxue's score was also climbing steadily, soon breaking 55 points and firmly claiming third place.

While all the prodigies fought frantically, racing against time.

At the very bottom of the leaderboard, one name stood out glaringly.

【250th Place: Lin Yuan, Points: 13】

Dead last!

And that pitiful score hadn't moved in nearly twenty minutes!

In the observation stands, the various family patriarchs watched this scene with mixed expressions.

"What's going on with that Lin family kid? Has he gotten too cocky?" The Su family patriarch couldn't help but frown. "Does he really think making a splash at the league means he's invincible? This Wilderness Hunt is no child's game!"

"If you ask me, it's just laziness acting up!" Xiao Long's grandfather, the martial god Xiao Chengen, gave an undisguised cold laugh. "With that kind of attitude, even heaven-sent talent will stumble sooner or later!"

Chen Tianhao and the Liu family patriarch wore expressions of barely-concealed glee.

In their view, Lin Yuan was simply asking for humiliation!

Amid all the commentary and mockery.

Only Lin Jianguo sat in his corner, expression unchanged, eyes like ancient wells as he watched the red dot representing Lin Yuan on the light screen.
