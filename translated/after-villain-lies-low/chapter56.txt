The Lin family, main council hall.

The atmosphere was unprecedentedly lively.

In the seat of honor sat the Old War God who had just displayed divine might, crushing a hundred miles of earth with a single palm—Lin Zhan.

At this moment, he showed none of that world-destroying majesty.

He looked just like an ordinary old grandfather from next door, his face full of kindness as he gazed at his little granddaughter chattering away on his lap.

"Grandpa, Grandpa! Was that three-headed demon dragon really that big? Big enough to swallow a mountain in one bite?"

The pigtailed girl, adorable as a porcelain doll, was Lin Ke'er. She clung to Lin Zhan's arm, shaking it vigorously.

Her bright, sparkling eyes were full of curiosity and admiration.

Despite her young age, she was recognized throughout Yan Jing City as a once-in-a-century formation prodigy!

To Lin Zhan's left sat a man with a resolute face and natural authority.

It was Lin Jianguo.

He simply sat there, spine ramrod straight, naturally emanating a terrifying aura of iron and blood.

As if behind him stood countless millions of armored soldiers in an unstoppable tide!

Dragon Xia Country's nation-protecting general, ranked first among the Three Dukes, wielding tremendous power! The supreme commander of Dragon Xia's entire military, whose word was absolute law!

Beyond him.

Mother Su Qin and elder sister Lin Mengyao were also gathered together.

This family...

Today, because of Lin Zhan's return, these figures who normally seemed like dragons glimpsed but never seen had finally assembled in one place.

Just then.

A lazy figure, yawning, sauntered slowly through the door.

"Big Brother! You're back!"

Lin Ke'er was the first to spot him, letting out a cheer.

Like a dancing butterfly, she broke free from Lin Zhan's embrace and threw herself into Lin Yuan's arms.

Instantly.

Every gaze in the hall focused squarely on Lin Yuan.

Lin Jianguo looked at his lackadaisical son and let out a wry laugh.

This kid, always that lazy attitude.

But his stern face couldn't hide the pride in his expression. "At least you didn't disgrace our Lin family."

"Yuan'er, you must be tired? Come sit down."

Su Qin's face was full of heartache and tenderness.

"Not bad at all, little brother."

Lin Mengyao's lips curved into a rare, genuine smile. "This time, you've stunned all of Yan Jing City."

Facing his family's care and praise.

Lin Yuan only offered a few perfunctory "mm-hmm"s.

Then, with practiced ease, he found the most comfortable chair and flopped right into it.

The entire motion was fluid and seamless.

Lin Jianguo's eye twitched at the sight.

Just then.

From the seat of honor, Lin Zhan, who had remained silent, slowly spoke.

His voice wasn't loud, but the entire hall fell instantly quiet.

"Yuan'er."

Lin Zhan's eyes—seemingly clouded yet piercing through all—settled on Lin Yuan.

"Those vermin from the Divine Court are nothing to worry about."

"What I'm curious about is..."

His tone suddenly turned serious!

"How did you know that Ye Canglan, that rat who's been hiding for fifty years, would appear there?"

In an instant!

Lin Jianguo, Su Qin, Lin Mengyao—everyone's gaze locked onto Lin Yuan with curious intensity.

Yes!

This was also the biggest question in their minds!

The Divine Court organization operated in secrecy, hiding deep.

Ye Canglan himself had been silent for decades—even the military's and Elder Council's intelligence networks couldn't find a single trace of him!

Lin Yuan, a young man who spent most of his time at school, rarely stepping outside.

How could he so precisely predict the enemy's movements, even knowing exactly where they would appear?!

This couldn't be explained by the word "genius" alone!

There must be some tremendous secret behind this!

Facing his entire family's soul-searching stares, Lin Yuan couldn't help but mentally roll his eyes.

"Careless."

Of course he couldn't say he was a transmigrator.

That the plot of this novel was crystal clear to him.

That would be too absurd.

Next second, he'd probably be mistaken for a body-snatching demon and jointly subdued by his dear father and mother.

Too troublesome.

He needed to think of an excuse.

One that could get him through this, fit his character, and settle the matter once and for all.

So.

Under his entire family's grave scrutiny.

Lin Yuan lazily shifted to a more comfortable position in his chair and said casually:

"Oh, that."

"I guessed."

"..."

"..."

"..."

Dead silence!

The entire hall fell into an eerie stillness!

Guessed?!

You're telling us you guessed?!

Veins instantly popped on Lin Jianguo's forehead!

He felt his blood pressure skyrocketing at an unprecedented rate!

Su Qin also helplessly pressed her palm to her forehead.

Lin Mengyao's eternally icy face showed the first cracks.

Only Lin Ke'er, her big bright eyes full of adoring little stars!

"Wow! Big Brother is amazing! Even his guesses are this accurate!"

Lin Jianguo: "..."

He felt himself on the verge of a heart attack.

"Ahem!"

Lin Zhan coughed heavily, breaking the bizarre atmosphere.

He fixed his gaze on his precious grandson, his voice stern. "Tell the truth!"

"Oh."

Lin Yuan curled his lip, seeming somewhat impatient.

He thought for a moment, then said in an even more perfunctory tone:

"Fine, I'll tell the truth."

"I didn't guess."

"I was born knowing."

"I can foresee the future."

"After all, I'm a genius. Having a trivial little ability like this—isn't that perfectly normal?"

With that.

He even spread his hands, an innocent expression on his face.

BOOM!

This time.

The entire hall seemed to be struck by divine lightning from the Nine Heavens!

Lin Jianguo shot up from his chair.

He pointed at Lin Yuan, lips trembling.

For a long moment, he finally squeezed out a sentence through gritted teeth:

"You, you... you unfilial son!!!"

He felt like his skull was about to be blown off by this precious son of his!

Born knowing?

Foreseeing the future?

Why don't you just say you're a deity descended to earth?!

What kind of attitude was this?!

Was this how you spoke to your father, to the nation-protecting general of Dragon Xia?!

He was about to blow up.

To properly educate this insolent brat with some fatherly love.

However.

An aged hand gently pressed down on his shoulder.

"Jianguo, sit down."

Lin Zhan's voice remained calm.

But that unquestionable authority made Lin Jianguo's raging fire instantly extinguish.

He could only glare fiercely at Lin Yuan.

Then, reluctantly, he sat back down in his chair.

"Father! You're just going to let him get away with this?!"

"Let him? My Lin Zhan's grandson, a heaven-sent prodigy—having some secrets, having some special abilities—is that abnormal?"

"If he doesn't want to say, then we don't ask."

"We only need to know he's our family. That's enough."

Lin Zhan's gaze slowly swept over everyone present.

"Our Lin family reached its current position not through schemes and plots, nor through digging for secrets."

"It was through unity, through trust!"

"As long as we stand together as one, there's no person, no force in this world that can shake us!"

His words rang with conviction!

Su Qin was the first to stand, her face wearing a gentle yet resolute smile.

"Father is right. Yuan'er is my son. No matter what he is, I believe in him, I support him."

"That's right!" Lin Ke'er waved her little fists, face full of pride. "Big Brother is the best!"

Lin Mengyao said nothing, but the look she gave Lin Yuan had softened considerably with understanding.

Lin Jianguo watched this scene.

Opened his mouth, but in the end, could only let out a helpless sigh.

The whole family had been sweet-talked senseless by this kid!

He was the only bad guy here.

What more could he say?

He could only accept it!

Lin Yuan looked at this touching scene of parental love and filial piety, and nodded with satisfaction.

Mm, not bad.

This excuse was perfect.

"Alright, since there's nothing else, I'm heading back to my room."

Lin Yuan yawned.

Rising, he prepared to slip away.

"Stop right there!"

Lin Jianguo barked again.

"Stay home and don't go anywhere! In two days, you're coming with me to the military camp. I'll personally put you through your paces!"

He refused to believe he couldn't handle this brat!

Yet.

Lin Yuan merely curled his lip, waving his hand without looking back, his figure quickly vanishing at the end of the corridor.

That attitude clearly treated his words as nothing but wind past his ears.
