The entire venue fell into deathly silence once more.

Everyone stared wide-eyed at the figure kneeling on one knee, gasping heavily, as if looking at a monster.

He won...

He won again!

Against War God Academy's Shi Lei, the one called "Absolute Defense."

Ye Xuan had once more used the most violent, most unreasonable method to forcibly shatter his opponent's barrier and claim victory!

Was this guy even human?!

He was simply a young demon god born for battle and destruction!

"He... he won! Ye Xuan won again!"

"Good heavens! He shattered Shi Lei's Bright King Glazed Body! That's Shi Lei's rare innate physique!"

"A miracle! This is definitely the greatest miracle of this tournament! Ye Xuan was born to create miracles!"

After the brief silence came cheers and screams more frenzied than any before!

Countless people rose excitedly to their feet.

They waved their arms wildly, screaming Ye Xuan's name until their voices broke!

In their eyes, Ye Xuan was no longer just a competitor—he was a living legend!

A myth of someone rising from the bottom to challenge the impossible!

Yet beneath all this infinite glory and cheering, only Ye Xuan himself knew how terrible his condition truly was.

His meridians felt as if scorched by flames, sending waves of tearing agony.

His internal organs seemed displaced; every breath brought unbearable pain.

His spiritual power had been completely drained by that earth-shattering punch, leaving only a trickle.

Just then, the Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice, filled with intense anxiety and gravity, echoed urgently from his Sea of Consciousness.

"Boy! Enough! Stop now!"

"Forcibly activating the technique just now has already damaged your foundation! Keep this up, and your martial path will be completely ruined!"

"Listen to me! You've already proven yourself! Forfeit now—with your record of defeating Shi Lei, a top-three finish is guaranteed!"

"The top-three rewards are already generous enough! Enough to repair the foundation damage you've sustained, maybe even push you further! There's no need to risk your life for a mere title!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice carried unprecedented severity.

Yet hearing these words, Ye Xuan's pale face twisted into a grim, obsessive smile.

"Mere title?"

He roared internally: "How can first place be a mere title?!"

"I, Ye Xuan, either do nothing, or I do it best! Why should I settle for second place?!"

"Master! Didn't you say that with enough rare treasures, the backlash from my technique wouldn't be a concern?"

"If I win the championship! The champion's rewards plus what the Huangfu family promised will push my strength to an entirely new level! By then, what's a little foundation damage?!"

His crazed will burned like a raging inferno, even making the Supreme Dao Ancestor in his Sea of Consciousness feel a chill.

"Foolish!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor thundered: "The Blood-Burning Dragon Transformation Art is a forbidden technique! It burns not just your spiritual power, but your life origin! Your fortune! Your future!"

"Rare treasures can indeed make up for your losses! But that's merely drinking poison to quench thirst! The more desperately you burn, the greater your dependence on resources becomes! Unless you achieve perfection, continuing down this path will eventually consume you completely, turning you into a walking corpse that knows only slaughter!"

"A walking corpse is still better than being a worthless nobody trampled underfoot!"

Ye Xuan's head snapped up.

His crimson gaze fixed on the VIP box.

"I must win the championship! I must claim everything that should have been his, right before that bastard's eyes!"

"I don't just want to win—I want to win more gloriously, more brilliantly than him!"

"..."

In the depths of his consciousness, the Supreme Dao Ancestor fell into a long silence.

Finally, only a weary, conflicted sigh remained.

Ah...

He had his own selfish reasons for advising restraint.

He'd been trapped in this remnant soul state far too long.

To escape, even to rebuild his physical form, his only hope rested on Ye Xuan, this host.

He needed Ye Xuan to grow stronger, but he certainly didn't want Ye Xuan to die young from recklessness.

But now, it seemed this boy, under the stimulation of hatred and victory, had completely lost himself to obsession.

His once steadfast Dao heart was being eroded bit by bit by arrogance and madness.

Was this fortune, or disaster?

For the first time, a hint of uncertainty arose in the Supreme Dao Ancestor's heart.

Just then.

The host's passionate voice rang out once more!

"Let us congratulate contestant Ye Xuan for successfully advancing to the final match of the championship!"

"Next, we will hold our last semifinal!"

"Please welcome—"

"From Imperial Military Academy, Qin Zhan!"

"Versus—"

"From Capital Martial Arts Academy, Gu Ningxue!"

As the host's voice fell, the entire Dragon's Nest was pushed to a fever pitch once again!

"Here it comes! The match I've been waiting for!"

"Qin Zhan's Dragon Elephant Prison-Suppressing Art is supremely dominating—pure power overwhelming all! Gu Ningxue's Glazed Snow Heart Sword Art is swift as a startled swan, elegant and flowing! This is the ultimate collision between the most extreme power and the most extreme technique!"

"Who do you think will win? I feel Qin Zhan has the edge since he's at Marrow Cleansing eighth level! A full small realm higher!"

"Not necessarily! Goddess Gu's sword is unfathomably mysterious!"

Amid the crowd's discussion.

Qin Zhan, clad in black combat gear with a cold, imposing presence, and Gu Ningxue, equally striking in black martial attire with an aura of heroic valor, simultaneously ascended the arena.

The two faced each other from a distance, their invisible fighting spirits clashing violently in the air, even producing crackling sparks!

"Gu Ningxue."

Qin Zhan gazed at the woman before him, no trace of contempt in his eyes—only pure, worthy-opponent battle intent. "Your sword is fast. I look forward to it."

Gu Ningxue gripped her sword hilt, beautiful eyes icy cold.

"Your fists are heavy."

"Then—let's fight!"

At the referee's signal, the match officially began!

"ROAR—!"

Qin Zhan held nothing back, exploding with full power from the start!

He let out a roar like dragons and elephants bellowing, muscles bulging, veins popping, his entire form seeming to grow taller!

A savage, dominating aura of suppression swept through the venue!

"Dragon Elephant Stomp!"

BOOM!

He stomped heavily on the ground!

The ultra-hard alloy arena was dented by that single stomp.

CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!!!

Fissures spread outward from where he landed, frantically extending in all directions!

He himself transformed into a cannonball.

Carrying momentum capable of crushing mountains, he charged ferociously toward Gu Ningxue!

Before he arrived.

That terrifying fist wind had already compressed the air until it shrieked!

Facing this world-ending strike, Gu Ningxue's gaze remained calm as still water.

At the instant before Qin Zhan touched her, her figure suddenly became ethereal.

Like a reflection in water, one split into three, three into nine!

Startled Swan Phantom Steps!

Qin Zhan's punch, strong enough to obliterate an armored vehicle, slammed into empty air, the violent force shattering the afterimages!

But Gu Ningxue's true body had appeared ghost-like at Qin Zhan's flank!

"Clang!"

A cold sword gleam, like a startled swan in a snowy night, soundless yet impossibly fast, thrust straight at the vital point on Qin Zhan's back!

However, Qin Zhan's combat instincts were equally terrifying!

Without even turning, he struck back with an elbow!

"Dragon Elephant Tail Whip!"

Sword tip and elbow collided with precision!

An irresistible, overwhelming force transmitted through the blade!

Gu Ningxue's hand went numb, her entire body flying backward uncontrollably. Only a graceful midair tumble let her land steadily at the arena's far end.

Such powerful strength!

A single improvised elbow strike had nearly knocked the sword from her grip!

Qin Zhan wasn't faring much better.

A shallow white mark remained on his elbow.

Wisps of cold sword qi were trying to burrow into his meridians.

Though quickly crushed by his domineering dragon elephant true qi, that bone-piercing chill still made him wary.

Such a fast sword!

Such strange sword qi!

"Again!"

Qin Zhan's battle intent surged higher as he launched another storm of ferocious attacks!

For a moment, the entire arena was filled with flying fist shadows and crisscrossing sword light!

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

Each of Qin Zhan's punches seemed capable of piercing the void, smashing terrifying craters into the hard arena!

Gu Ningxue moved like a butterfly dancing through a meteor shower, elegant and graceful.

Each time, by the narrowest of margins, she barely evaded those lethal strikes.

Meanwhile, her sword always found the most inconceivable angles to thrust at Qin Zhan's openings!

Back and forth they fought, the battle earth-shattering, blotting out sun and moon!

The entire audience watched, mesmerized and blood pumping!

"Too exciting! This is what a true summit showdown looks like!"

"Qin Zhan's power is simply insane! Gu Ningxue doesn't dare clash with him directly!"

"But Gu Ningxue's footwork and swordplay are too strong! Qin Zhan hasn't even touched the hem of her clothes!"

Just then, Qin Zhan, frustrated by his inability to land a hit, seemed to exhaust his patience!

"Gu Ningxue! Hiding and dodging—is that any way to fight!"

"If you've got guts, take this move!"

He suddenly halted, drew a deep breath, and released his spiritual power without reservation!

"Dragon Elephant Prison-Suppression!"

ROAR—!!!

A massive dragon-elephant phantom, formed of golden spiritual power, slowly materialized behind him!

A terrifying pressure that could suppress heaven and earth, crush all things, instantly blanketed the entire arena!

Gu Ningxue felt her entire body grow heavy, as if an ancient divine mountain had been loaded onto her back. Even her movements became sluggish!

"It's over!"

Qin Zhan roared.

He merged with the dragon-elephant phantom behind him, transforming into a golden torrent of destruction that crashed down toward Gu Ningxue!

This strike sealed off all her escape routes!

Nowhere to run!

Inside the VIP box, Lin Yuan watched this scene and finally set down the spirit fruit in his hand. For the first time, he sat up straight.

HUM—!

Gu Ningxue's eyes blazed with unprecedented brilliance!

Her sword let out a clear phoenix cry!

"Earth-Rank superior sword technique—Ice Phoenix Descends!"

An even holier, more majestic ice-blue phoenix phantom burst from within her!

It spread its massive wings and released a cry that could freeze the very soul!

Under everyone's shocked, worldview-shattering gazes.

The ice-blue phoenix and the golden dragon-elephant collided violently!

BOOM—!!!

The entire Dragon's Nest shook with the impact!
