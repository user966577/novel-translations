Ye Xuan's spectacular rise in the National League!

News of his near self-destructive ascent quickly spread through all the major martial arts families of Dragon Xia Country.

Some marveled, some grew wary, and others...

Had different ideas entirely.

Dragon Xia Country, Huangfu Family.

Inside an ancient, classically-styled council hall.

Several elders with profound auras sat in a circle.

"This Ye Xuan is an interesting seedling, but his foundation is too shallow. Burning potential to gain power—that's ultimately a crooked path, unsustainable in the long run."

A white-haired elder sipped his tea and offered his assessment.

"The key isn't Ye Xuan." Another elder with a hooked nose had a calculating glint in his eyes. "The key is the Lin family's boy, Lin Yuan!"

"He first displayed power suggesting Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level at the school tournament, suppressing Ye Xuan with a single thought and attracting attention from all sides. Yet in the blink of an eye, he gave up the National League—the perfect opportunity to make a name for himself—and retreated to his estate to be a salted fish."

"Something this abnormal must have a hidden reason! I suspect the power he displayed before was either due to some powerful treasure with severe drawbacks, or... his cultivation method has critical flaws that prevent sustained combat!"

At these words, all the elders present fell into deep thought.

The Huangfu and Lin families were sworn enemies.

When Lin Zhan rose to power at the Northern Frontier, he climbed over countless experts to reach the top—including ancestors of the Huangfu family.

This blood debt was something the Huangfu family had never forgotten.

But with Lin Zhan's overwhelming power and control of the Northern Frontier Legion, they dared not make any rash moves.

Now, however, an opportunity seemed to have presented itself.

"Lin Zhan may be old but refuses to die—we can't touch him. But if we can settle some scores with the grandson he values most and thoroughly humiliate him, that would be quite satisfying!"

The hooked-nose elder sneered.

"Exactly! I propose we send someone to probe this Lin Yuan's true capabilities!"

"Who should go?"

All eyes fell on a young man standing ramrod straight at the end of the hall, his face written with wild arrogance.

Huangfu Zhuo!

The most outstanding genius of the Huangfu family's current generation—only twenty years old, yet already an expert at Marrow Cleansing Realm eighth level.

Combined with the Huangfu family's secret techniques, even someone at ninth level might not be his match!

"I'll go!"

Huangfu Zhuo stepped forward, his voice ringing with conviction, brimming with powerful confidence.

"I've long wanted to meet this so-called Lin family prodigy! I want to see whether he's a true dragon or just a mud loach putting on airs!"

The hooked-nose elder nodded with satisfaction. "Good! However, you cannot challenge him directly in the family's name—that would invite too much criticism."

"Go in your personal capacity to Capital Martial Arts Academy. Publicly claim you can't stand watching Lin Yuan bully people with his status, oppressing grass-roots talents like Ye Xuan, and you're there to 'seek justice' for Ye Xuan!"

"This way, we can probe Lin Yuan's true capabilities while standing on the moral high ground, earning a reputation for 'chivalrous justice.' Two birds with one stone!"

"Zhuo'er understands!"

A cruel smile formed at the corner of Huangfu Zhuo's mouth.

Humiliate Lin Yuan?

That wasn't enough to satisfy him.

What he wanted was to trample this so-called Lin family prodigy beneath his feet in front of everyone, ensuring he could never rise again!

The next day.

Capital Martial Arts Academy welcomed an uninvited guest.

A luxurious hovering sports car ignored the academy's no-fly regulations and landed directly in the plaza at the school gates, drawing stares from countless students.

The door opened, and Huangfu Zhuo—dressed in white martial attire, handsome but with arrogant eyes—stepped out, surrounded by a squad of black-clad bodyguards.

"Where is Lin Yuan?!"

His voice thundered like a bell, infused with spiritual power, instantly spreading across half the campus.

"Tell him to get out here and face me!"

This outrageously arrogant display immediately sparked public outrage.

"Who does this guy think he is? Coming to our academy acting so wild?"

"Huangfu Zhuo? Is he from that Huangfu family? What are they doing here?"

"Sounds like he's looking for Senior Lin Yuan?"

Huangfu Zhuo ignored the murmuring around him. He grabbed a passing student and demanded coldly, "Where is that coward Lin Yuan hiding?"

The student's legs went weak under the pressure of Huangfu Zhuo's eighth-level aura. Trembling, he pointed toward the rear mountain. "Lin... Senior Lin is usually... under that old tree in the back garden... sleeping..."

Sleeping?

Hearing those words, the contempt on Huangfu Zhuo's face grew even more pronounced.

As expected, a piece of trash!

With a formidable enemy at his doorstep, he still had the mood to sleep?

He snorted coldly, shoved the student aside, and strode toward the back garden.

A crowd of students followed along to watch the excitement.

Soon, they arrived at the back garden.

Beneath a hundred-year-old tree with flourishing branches and leaves, on a comfortable lounge chair, a figure lay covered with a blanket, sleeping soundly, his breathing even and steady.

Sunlight filtered through gaps in the leaves, casting dappled patterns of light across his body—a scene of utter peace and tranquility.

Seeing this, the last trace of wariness in Huangfu Zhuo's heart completely disappeared.

How could a true expert sleep so defensively in a public place?

This Lin Yuan was one hundred percent a fraud!

A cruel smile spread across his face as he slowly approached.

The surrounding students unconsciously held their breath.

They sensed that a great battle was about to erupt before their eyes.

Huangfu Zhuo stood less than ten meters from Lin Yuan, his lips curling into a contemptuous arc.

He decided to use his aura to crush this sleeping fool directly to his knees, forcing him to wake in the most humiliating way possible!

"Trash, wake up!"

He growled, and the terrifying pressure of a Marrow Cleansing Realm eighth-level expert surged toward Lin Yuan on the lounge chair like a bursting dam!
