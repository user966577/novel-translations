The next day, early morning.

When the first rays of sunlight streamed through the massive floor-to-ceiling windows into Capital Martial Arts Academy's teaching building.

The entire academy was shrouded in a strange atmosphere—a mix of excitement, awe, and nervousness.

Countless students gathered in small groups, whispering and buzzing with discussion.

And at the center of all their conversations was invariably one person.

Lin Yuan!

"Did you hear? At yesterday's league finals, that dark horse Ye Xuan was insta-killed by Senior Lin Yuan!"

"No way! I heard too! Apparently Ye Xuan used demonic arts and was about to kill Goddess Gu, then Senior Lin Yuan descended from the heavens and suppressed him with a single sword qi! The scene was like a god walking among mortals!"

"Too cool! Really too cool! What realm is Senior Lin Yuan anyway? A casual sword qi crushing a Marrow Cleansing peak who'd burned his life? He's got to be at least at Transformation Realm, no, maybe even Qi Sea Realm!"

"Who knows—Senior Lin Yuan's power is beyond our comprehension! He's a living legend!"

"Sigh, from today on, there's no hope of pursuing Goddess Gu. With Senior Lin Yuan as a mountain in the way, us ordinary folks don't even qualify to be rivals!"

The discussions were filled with shock and worship for Lin Yuan's unfathomable power.

Just then.

A languid figure, yawning, slowly wandered over from the distance.

It was Lin Yuan.

The moment he appeared, the noisy chatter around him instantly stopped!

All eyes focused on him!

Those gazes held awe, curiosity, worship, and even a trace of fear!

As if they were looking not at a fellow student but a deity walking among men!

Yet Lin Yuan seemed completely oblivious to these gazes that would make any young person giddy.

He didn't even spare an extra expression.

Still that half-asleep, lazy manner, he walked straight into his classroom.

Then, under the nearly solidified breathing of the entire class.

He expertly made his way to the back corner of the room.

Pulled out a chair.

Laid his head down.

Fell asleep.

The movements flowed seamlessly, as if practiced thousands of times.

The entire classroom was silent as a tomb.

Every student sat ramrod straight, not daring to breathe loudly. Even their page-turning unconsciously became gentler.

A few minutes later, the class bell rang.

A middle-aged teacher with a receding hairline and gold-rimmed glasses strode in carrying his lesson materials.

He habitually cleared his throat, about to begin lecturing.

Then his gaze accidentally swept over that figure slumped in the corner, sleeping soundly.

The teacher's body went rigid!

A layer of cold sweat instantly beaded on his forehead.

Of course he knew what had happened yesterday!

No kidding!

This was the big shot even the Martial Alliance's head referee treated with deference!

Forget sleeping in class—even if this young master tore the classroom apart, he wouldn't dare make a peep!

In an instant, countless thoughts raced through this experienced educator's mind.

Pretend not to see?

Or...

Finally, he swallowed hard and produced a smile more pitiful than crying for the whole class.

"Ahem... well... students, today we'll... we'll have self-study!"

With that, he fled the classroom as if escaping.

The room returned to eerie silence.

Every student looked at that figure in the corner as if watching a deity.

Incredible!

Absolutely incredible!

Ruthless without being preachy—one nap and the teacher dismisses himself!

Lin Yuan woke naturally from his nap.

He stretched lazily and, under the awed stares of his classmates, sauntered out of the classroom.

He planned to head to his usual spot in the back garden to continue his grand napping enterprise.

But just as he reached the garden entrance, a graceful figure blocked his path.

It was Gu Ningxue.

Today she'd traded her striking martial attire for an elegant white dress, losing some of her coolness and gaining a maiden's softness.

"Um..."

Gu Ningxue stood before him, seemingly nervous, her fair fingers unconsciously fidgeting with her hem.

"I heard... Ye Xuan, he dropped out."

"Oh."

Lin Yuan's response was as flat as a weather report.

He stepped around Gu Ningxue, ready to continue inside.

"Wait!"

Gu Ningxue hurriedly blocked him again. Gathering her courage, she asked: "You don't care at all where he went? Someone like him, so vindictive—after suffering such a huge loss, he definitely won't let it go!"

"Care?"

Lin Yuan finally stopped, turning his head to look at Gu Ningxue as if she were an idiot.

"An ant I stepped on disappeared from my sight. Why should I care which garbage heap it crawled into?"

With that, he ignored the stunned Gu Ningxue and walked straight to his familiar lounge chair deep in the garden, settling in comfortably.

The sunlight was just right, the breeze gentle.

Perfect weather for sleeping.

As for where Ye Xuan went, how the Huangfu family would react, and whatever beast tide was supposedly coming...

Everything would have to wait until this young master woke up.

After all, lying low was life's first principle!

Lin Yuan slowly closed his eyes.

Huangfu Family, Council Hall.

CRASH—!

A priceless antique blue-and-white porcelain vase was hurled to the ground, shattering instantly!

"Worthless! Utterly worthless!"

Huangfu Zhuo's face was ashen, his chest heaving, his handsome features twisted with extreme rage.

"How much did our Huangfu family invest in him? We even gave him Thousand-Year Fire Lingzhi! And the result? He not only failed to win the championship, but turned himself into a cripple with forbidden arts!"

"And right in front of the whole nation, he was trampled like a dog by that Lin Yuan! Our family's face has been completely lost by this waste!"

Below in the hall, rows of Huangfu family core members stood terrified, not daring to breathe.

They all knew this plan had utterly failed.

Ye Xuan, the chess piece they'd carefully selected.

Far from becoming a blade to strike at Lin Yuan and the Gu family, he'd become a massive joke, making their Huangfu family a laughingstock in Yan Jing's elite circles.

All effort wasted!

"Young Master, there's no point dwelling on this now."

A white-haired elder spoke gravely.

He was the only one present who dared speak when Huangfu Zhuo was enraged—the Huangfu family's chief retainer, a peak Transformation Realm powerhouse, Elder Chen.

"That Ye Xuan is now a discarded piece, not worth worrying about. The real issue now is Lin Yuan!"

At that name, Huangfu Zhuo's pupils contracted sharply, a deep wariness flashing across his face.

The scene of that man lounging in his chair, bringing Huangfu Zhuo to his knees and vomiting blood with a single glance, still haunted his nightmares.

"What exactly does that man want?"

Huangfu Zhuo ground his teeth. "He clearly has power to crush everything—why hide behind the scenes? Did he cripple Ye Xuan to uphold some 'rules,' or... is he deliberately targeting our Huangfu family?"

"Hard to say."

Elder Chen shook his head, his aged face full of gravity.

"This Lin Yuan doesn't follow any conventional logic—completely unpredictable. But one thing's certain: since he acted, he knows about the connection between Ye Xuan and us."

"This is a warning! A blatant warning!"

"So we just accept this?!"

Huangfu Zhuo roared in fury.

"Of course not!"

Elder Chen's eyes flashed with a cold, sinister light.

"We can't beat him head-on. But... that doesn't mean we have no other options."

He spoke slowly: "Young Master, have you forgotten? Before long, it will be the annual... Wilderness Hunt."

"Wilderness Hunt?"

Huangfu Zhuo was taken aback.

Then, as if realizing something, his expression shifted to dawning comprehension, then became incredibly vicious.

"I understand..."

"Elder Chen, you mean..."

"Exactly."

"The wilderness is overrun with demonic beasts, dangers everywhere. Every year, quite a few geniuses 'accidentally' die in there. When the time comes, as long as we plan properly..."

"Even if Lin Yuan has backing that reaches the heavens, dying under a demonic beast's claws—who could say anything?"
