After rejecting Gu Ningxue's "plea for help," Lin Yuan's life returned to its former tranquility.

He couldn't even be bothered to think about the team's problems.

He immediately had Uncle Zhong add the entire school team's contact information to his blacklist.

The world was finally peaceful.

On the other side.

The flames of the National College League burned ever fiercer.

Without Lin Yuan, that "BUG"-level existence, Ye Xuan got his wish and became the most watched star on the team.

He was like a tireless beast, slaughtering his way across the arenas.

Relying on the secret techniques passed down by the Supreme Dao Ancestor and his battle will far exceeding ordinary people, he won match after match, leading Capital Martial Arts Academy through one round after another.

However, as the competition progressed, the opponents grew stronger.

"Bang!"

On the arena, Ye Xuan was blasted backward by a tremendous force, tumbling pathetically several times before stopping.

His throat sweetened as a thread of blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.

His opponent was Magic City Martial Arts Academy's top fighter, a muscular giant at Marrow Cleansing Realm fourth level who possessed the "Vajra Indestructible Body" physique.

The man's defense was absurdly high!

It was as if he'd put all his skill points into defense!

Ye Xuan's "Mountain-Splitting Fist" hitting him was like scratching an itch, completely unable to break through.

"Damn it!"

Ye Xuan gritted his teeth and pulled himself up from the ground, his chest burning with frustration and fury.

He realized he had made a mistake.

Even challenging opponents above his level had limits.

Fighting ordinary Marrow Cleansing fourth level martial artists, he could crush them with superior technique and experience.

But those who had made it this far in the National League—which one wasn't extraordinary?

Either they possessed special physiques or had cultivated top-tier techniques. Every single one was a prodigy among prodigies.

Against these true geniuses, his cross-level combat ability seemed rather lacking.

The gap between him and his goal of "dominating the field" was glaringly obvious!

"Master! I need power! Stronger power!"

Deep in the night.

In his hotel room, Ye Xuan roared unwillingly in his mind.

In his Sea of Consciousness, the Supreme Dao Ancestor was silent for a long while before finally letting out a long sigh.

"Boy, there is one path that can give you power enough to crush those at your level in a short time. But... the price is steep."

"What path?!"

Ye Xuan's eyes lit up instantly, as if a drowning man had grasped his last straw.

"It is a forbidden technique called the 'Blood-Burning Dragon Transformation Art.'"

"This technique can forcibly burn some of your life potential and martial foundation, converting them into the purest cultivation, allowing you to break through bottlenecks instantly!"

"But the price is that your future martial path will become incomparably difficult. Without massive resources to compensate, every breakthrough will be several times harder than for ordinary people!"

"And... it will continuously burn your life..."

The Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice became extremely grave.

"I'm willing!"

Ye Xuan answered almost without hesitation.

The future?

He couldn't worry about that now!

All he wanted now was to win!

To gain power!

To trample that lofty Lin Yuan beneath his feet!

If he couldn't defeat Lin Yuan, his martial path was already broken!

"Good! Since your mind is made up, this old man will lend you a hand!"

As the Supreme Dao Ancestor's words fell, an immense, sinister torrent of information flooded into Ye Xuan's mind.

"AHHHHH—!"

Ye Xuan let out an agonized howl.

He felt as if his blood were on fire, his bone marrow and meridians being forcibly torn apart and reconstructed by a tyrannical power!

That pain was more excruciating than being sliced by a thousand blades!

But at the same time, an unprecedented, powerful force was surging wildly within him!

Marrow Cleansing Realm third level!

BOOM!

Marrow Cleansing Realm fourth level!

In just minutes, his cultivation had been forcibly elevated by two minor realms.

Soaring straight to Marrow Cleansing Realm fifth level!

The next day's match.

Ye Xuan faced that same "Vajra Indestructible Body" muscular giant who had left him helpless yesterday.

"Kid, how are you going to tickle me today?"

The giant mocked with disdain.

Ye Xuan's face was expressionless as he slowly raised his fist.

The next second, he moved!

His figure was fast as lightning!

"What?!"

The giant's pupils contracted sharply.

Before he could react, a fist wrapped in terrifying power had already landed solidly on his chest.

BOOM—!

A muffled explosion!

That supposedly "Vajra Indestructible" protective aura shattered like paper in an instant!

The disdain and mockery on the giant's face instantly froze, then transformed into utter terror.

"Crack..."

Accompanied by the teeth-grinding sound of bones breaking.

His massive frame flew backward like a cannonball, crashing heavily beneath the arena.

His chest had caved in severely—knocked unconscious on the spot!

One punch!

Just one punch!

The entire venue fell deathly silent!

Everyone was left soulless by the terrifying combat power Ye Xuan had displayed!

After a brief silence came a tsunami of cheers!

"How... how is this possible?!"

In the front-row spectator seats.

A martial arts commentator shot to his feet: "Yesterday he couldn't even break through the defense, and today one punch sends the 'Vajra Indestructible Body' Magic City champion flying off the stage?!"

"That's the Vajra Body! It's said to withstand even low-grade magical artifacts—how could one punch do this?!"

"Just how strong has he become?"

In the rest areas on both sides of the arena.

The other schools' competitors were in an uproar.

"Marrow Cleansing Realm fifth level?! He was only at second level yesterday—he broke through two minor realms overnight? Is that even humanly possible?"

"That combat power is insane! At fifth level he can one-punch a fourth level with the Vajra Body—if he grows to the peak of Marrow Cleansing, who could possibly stop him?"

"Capital Martial Arts Academy is going to defy the heavens this time! First Lin Yuan, now Ye Xuan is this fierce... good thing Lin Yuan dropped out, or how would anyone even compete?"

Discussion spread like a tide.

From the spectator stands to the competitor areas, everyone looking at Ye Xuan had changed—

Shock, wariness, curiosity!

And...

Inexplicable fear!

Ye Xuan merely swept his cold gaze across those below the stage.

Taking in all those shocked and awed looks, a cold curve formed at the corner of his mouth.

This was the power he wanted.

Power enough to crush everything!

The matches that followed became Ye Xuan's personal showcase.

Facing the runner-up seed from the previous league.

The opponent had just assumed a defensive stance when Ye Xuan's blood-burning finger wind pierced through his protective aura.

Struck directly in the shoulder, he screamed in surrender!

Against a Wind Spirit Body martial artist who specialized in speed, Ye Xuan pushed his movement technique to the extreme and overtook him, sending him flying with broken bones from a single whip kick!

Even when facing an opponent also at fifth level who had cultivated a top-tier defensive technique.

He relied on the explosive power from the "Blood-Burning Dragon Transformation Art" to break the deadlock, ending the fight within three moves.

In just three days.

Ye Xuan swept through all opponents with overwhelming force.

Every victory was clean and decisive, even more exaggerated than his original goal of "dominating the field."

He was like a war god returned from hell, his entire being radiating a chilling aura that warned others to keep their distance.

Wherever he went, none could stand against him.

"Martial Prodigy! Ye Xuan breaks through two realms in a single day, one punch shatters the Vajra Body!"

"From substitute to king! Revealing Ye Xuan's counterattack journey—is he the future of Dragon Xia martial arts?"

"The biggest dark horse of the National League is born! Ye Xuan may take the championship with an undefeated record!"

Only Li Xuan'er.

Every time she saw Ye Xuan's eyes growing colder and more hollow after each victory, the unease in her heart grew stronger.

She could sense it.

The Ye Xuan who used to secretly celebrate winning a training match was drifting further and further away from her.

In his place was a stranger, consumed by power and obsession.

And Ye Xuan couldn't care less.

His gaze had long since passed over the noisy arena, settling on that figure who still hadn't appeared.

Lin Yuan.

Wait for me.

Once I take the national championship, I'll come for you.

When that time comes, I'll use this power bought with my burning life to completely tear off that calm, indifferent mask of yours and show you—

Who is the true prodigy of this generation!
