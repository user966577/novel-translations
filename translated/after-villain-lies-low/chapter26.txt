Huangfu Family, council hall.

The atmosphere was oppressively heavy, like the deathly stillness before a storm.

"BANG!"

A fine purple-clay teacup was crushed to powder in a large, vein-bulging hand!

"Trash! Utter trash!"

The hook-nosed elder—the Third Elder who had championed sending Huangfu Zhuo on the provocation—was now trembling with rage, his aged face the color of pig liver.

Before him, Huangfu Zhuo knelt on the ground like a dead dog, shaking uncontrollably, his eyes unfocused, a trace of dried blood still at the corner of his mouth.

His Dao heart had been shattered by Lin Yuan's single glance. He was ruined.

"Third Elder, please calm yourself."

From the seat of honor, a middle-aged man with a scholarly appearance like a teacher—yet whose eyes flashed with thunder when they opened—spoke slowly.

This was the current patriarch of the Huangfu family, Huangfu Xiong.

"This matter is not entirely Zhuo'er's fault."

Huangfu Xiong's voice was calm.

But beneath that calm lurked killing intent cold enough to freeze the soul. "To shatter an eighth-level Marrow Cleansing expert's Dao heart and damage his meridians with a single glance... this Lin Yuan is far more terrifying than we imagined!"

At these words, the temperature in the hall seemed to drop several degrees.

"Patriarch!"

The Third Elder shot to his feet.

His eyes were bloodshot, his manner like a maddened tiger. "This boy must not be allowed to live! Today he dares humiliate our Huangfu family like this—tomorrow he'll trample over our corpses!"

"The more monstrous he is, the more we must eliminate him before he matures, at any cost! Otherwise, he will become a mortal threat to our clan!"

"Indeed! He must die!"

"Patriarch, give the order! We are willing to form an assassination formation, infiltrate Songzhou, and take that brat's head!"

The hall erupted with righteous fury and killing intent.

When had the Huangfu family ever suffered such humiliation?

Having someone march to their door, stepping on their faces in mockery—and their people couldn't even fight back!

If they swallowed this insult, how could they ever hold their heads up in Dragon Xia Country again?

Yet facing the elders' demands for war, Huangfu Xiong merely shook his head slowly.

He raised his eyes, sweeping his gaze across the agitated crowd, and asked mildly, "How do we kill him?"

That single question silenced the entire hall instantly.

Yes, how?

One elder furrowed his brow and said gravely, "That boy is either at Capital Martial Arts Academy, which is crawling with experts—a dragon's den and tiger's lair—or hiding in the Lin family estate, whose defenses rival those of the Northern Frontier military fortresses!"

"He simply doesn't go out! Point A to point B—we have no opportunity to strike!"

These words were like cold water poured over everyone's heads.

Indeed, Lin Yuan was like a hedgehog curled up in a turtle shell. They might have countless schemes, but they had no way to reach him.

Were they really just going to swallow this humiliation?

Seeing the frustrated yet defiant expressions around him, a cold, cruel arc slowly formed at the corner of Huangfu Xiong's lips.

"Who says we have no opportunity?"

He rose leisurely and walked to the center of the hall, his deep gaze sweeping over everyone.

"Rest assured. The opportunity... will come."

"Before that, we need to prepare."

"Prepare?" the Third Elder asked, puzzled.

"Yes, prepare." Huangfu Xiong's eyes gleamed with the cunning of an old fox. "Prepare a blade—one sharp enough, and obedient enough."

He paused, seemingly enjoying the confusion on everyone's faces, before slowly speaking a name.

"That Ye Xuan... doesn't he have a deep blood feud with Lin Yuan?"

"I've watched his performance in the National League. He's a promising seedling. Vicious enough, crazy enough, and stupid enough."

"Most importantly, he desperately craves power—craves the ability to personally defeat Lin Yuan."

Huangfu Xiong's voice dripped with seductive charm.

"An enemy, no matter how weak, can become the deadliest weapon in our hands if properly used."

"We can work on him..."

"The Patriarch means..."

The Third Elder's eyes instantly brightened.

"Exactly."

Huangfu Xiong nodded, his smile growing even more sinister.

"Send someone to make contact. Give him resources, give him techniques, give him everything our Huangfu family can provide!"

"We'll fatten him into the most ferocious, most rabid hound! Let him bite, let him tear, let him constantly create trouble for Lin Yuan!"

"Let these two dogs tear at each other first."

"And we need only hide in the shadows, quietly enjoying the show."

"When they've worn each other down, when the perfect moment arrives..."

Huangfu Xiong didn't finish, but the undisguised killing intent said everything.

Brilliant!

All the elders in the hall looked at the patriarch with eyes full of awe and admiration.

Using a borrowed knife to kill! Setting the tiger against the wolf!

Without lifting a finger, they could make two mortal enemies wear each other down while they reaped the benefits as the fisherman!

This scheme was absolutely watertight!

"My orders!"

Huangfu Xiong returned to the seat of honor, his voice cold as he issued commands.

"Immediately dispatch our top operative embedded in Songzhou to the National League venue."

"Find this Ye Xuan. Tell him..."

"Our Huangfu family can grant him... the power to contend with a deity!"
