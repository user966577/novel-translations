On the arena.

After basking in the thunderous cheers for a full half-minute, Ye Xuan finally suppressed the wild joy and excitement in his heart.

Just then, he felt a premonition.

From somewhere in the darkness, a faint gaze from the highest corner of the stadium had fallen upon him.

That gaze carried no hostility, no killing intent, not even any emotion.

But it brought an extremely uncomfortable sensation—as if he were an ant being observed during a performance.

Ye Xuan's head snapped up.

His line of sight locked onto that direction like a blade—

The Supreme VIP box!

Though separated by a vast distance and special one-way glass.

He knew Lin Yuan was there!

He could practically see that man looking down at him with his lofty posture!

An even more violent rage ignited from the depths of Ye Xuan's heart!

Coward!

A coward who could only hide in his shell, who didn't even have the courage to compete!

Do you see this?

This—is the stage I, Ye Xuan, deserve!

This—is the glory I, Ye Xuan, deserve!

While you can only hide in the shadows like a rat that fears the light.

Watching helplessly as I climb, step by step, toward a summit you can never reach!

Ye Xuan's lips curled into an extremely arrogant, provocative arc.

He faced that direction and silently mouthed two words.

"Wait—for—me!"

Inside the VIP box.

Lin Yuan naturally saw Ye Xuan's provocative gaze and lip movements.

He couldn't even be bothered to decipher what the other had said.

He just found it somewhat amusing.

A puppet controlled by strings, who didn't even know if he'd live to see the next second, daring to provoke the one controlling the chessboard?

"Heh."

Lin Yuan let out a meaningless chuckle.

He withdrew his gaze and returned his attention to the plate of spirit fruits he hadn't finished.

As if everything that had just happened was merely a monkey in a show glancing up at him.

Nothing more.

Beside him, Gu Ningxue took in everything.

Watching Lin Yuan's calm, almost bored expression.

Then thinking of Ye Xuan's self-righteous provocation, a strong sense of absurdity suddenly welled up within her.

The gap between these two had really... grown to a degree that couldn't be described in words?

One was on the first floor, thinking he stood on the fifth.

The other had long since transcended the atmosphere, overlooking the entire chessboard.

"Match continues!"

As the host's voice rang out again, the brief rest period ended.

The third round draw officially began!

The light screen scrolled rapidly, and soon, the new matchup list appeared.

This time, Ye Xuan's name stood alongside another championship favorite!

【Capital Martial Arts Academy · Ye Xuan VS War God Academy · Shi Lei】

The crowd erupted again!

"Oh my god! Here comes the main event! Ye Xuan versus 'Immovable King' Shi Lei!"

"Now we've got a show! One's a berserker with off-the-charts attack power who charges forward recklessly! The other's an iron wall with insane defense who's absolutely unbreakable!"

"What do you think? Is Ye Xuan's spear sharper, or is Shi Lei's shield sturdier?"

"I'm betting on Shi Lei! His Bright King Glazed Body can reportedly withstand even a full-power strike from an eighth-level Marrow Cleansing expert! Breaking his defense would be harder than ascending to heaven!"

"Exactly! Shi Lei's specialty is attrition warfare! Once Ye Xuan's burst-style fighting drains his spiritual power, he'll be a lamb for the slaughter!"

Amid the almost one-sided discussion, Ye Xuan and Shi Lei—who was built like a brown bear—ascended the arena.

"Ye Xuan."

Shi Lei's voice boomed like a bell. "Your fists are hard. I respect that. But this is where it ends."

He stomped both feet on the ground!

"Bright King Glazed Body—activate!"

Hum—!

A golden light barrier, crystalline as glazed glass yet radiating an indestructible aura, instantly enveloped his entire body!

He seemed to transform into an immovable wrathful vajra. Just standing there gave off an overwhelming sense of despair!

"Is that so?"

The madness in Ye Xuan's crimson eyes intensified!

Strong defense?

Then I'll shatter you—shell and all!

"Blood-Burning Dragon Transformation, Second Stage!"

He roared, and the blood within him began to boil at an unprecedented rate!

An aura even more violent and bloody than before erupted from his body!

Droplets of blood began seeping through his skin's surface, making him look like a demon that had crawled out of hell!

"Die!"

"Dragon Battles the Wilds!"

Ye Xuan's figure transformed into a blood-colored bolt of lightning, instantly appearing before Shi Lei!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

In an instant, he unleashed dozens of punches!

Each one contained enough terrifying power to shatter stone!

The dense rain of fists hammered relentlessly against Shi Lei's golden glazed barrier, producing deafening rumbles!

The entire arena trembled violently!

Yet Shi Lei's Bright King Glazed Body lived up to its reputation!

Under that storm of attacks, though the golden barrier flickered wildly with ripples spreading across it, it remained intact, showing no signs of shattering!

"Useless!"

"Your attacks can't break my defense!"

Shi Lei sneered from within the barrier.

"Is that so?!"

Ye Xuan's gaze grew even more crazed!

"Then let me show you what real power looks like!"

"Dragon—Roars—Nine—Heavens!"

He suddenly stepped back, clasping both fists together and raising them high above his head!

All his spiritual power, along with his burning life essence, converged completely into his fists in that moment!

A ferocious blood-red dragon shadow slowly manifested behind him, releasing a soundless roar that shook the soul!

"Shatter... for me!!!"

BOOM—!!!

This punch seemed to detonate the void itself!

The blood-colored fist aura transformed into a devastating meteor, slamming viciously into the golden glazed barrier!

CRACK—!

A crisp sound, like shattering glass, echoed clearly throughout the venue!

Under the horrified gazes of everyone present.

Shi Lei's pride, his so-called absolute defense—the Bright King Glazed Body—shattered before that savage blood dragon!

"Pfft!"

Shi Lei was struck as if by lightning, spraying a mouthful of blood.

His massive body flew backward like a kite with its string cut, crashing heavily below the arena.

Ye Xuan—victorious again!

One punch!

Still just one punch!

The entire Dragon's Nest fell into deathly silence!

A hundred thousand spectators, countless media reporters, all the competing athletes...

In that moment, they seemed collectively frozen, mouths agape, expressions as if they'd seen a ghost!

After the brief silence came screaming and shouting like an exploding volcano, completely out of control!

"Holy crap!!! Is this real?! Am I seeing things?!"

"One punch! Another one punch! The Vajra Glazed Body was smashed with one punch?!"

"This... this is damage a Marrow Cleansing fourth level can do?! You could tell me he's at the Qi Sea Realm and I'd believe it!"

"Monster! He's a monster! This championship is definitely his!"

In the contestant seating on both sides of the arena.

Qin Zhan's eternally frozen expression showed gravity for the first time.

Liu Ruyan's seductive smile had completely vanished.

Replaced by unprecedented wariness.

Ye Xuan slowly withdrew his fist.

He didn't even spare a glance at Shi Lei lying on the ground.

He raised his head, sweeping his gaze past Qin Zhan, past Liu Ruyan, finally landing on Gu Ningxue...

A wild smile curved his lips.

He slowly raised his hand, extending a single finger.

Everyone understood the gesture.

Next!
