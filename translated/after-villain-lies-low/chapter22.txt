BOOM!!!

The powerful pressure of a Marrow Cleansing Realm eighth level expert swept through the entire back garden like an invisible storm!

The students who had followed to watch found themselves under a terrifying weight pressing down on them, their breathing instantly labored.

The weaker ones turned pale and stumbled backward, their eyes filled with terror.

Was this the genius of the Huangfu family?

Too strong!

His aura alone was enough to make these ordinary students feel despair!

At this rate, forget Marrow Cleansing ninth level—even a Qi Sea Realm expert might not be able to defeat him!!!

All eyes locked onto that lounge chair.

They could almost see it already.

The sleeping Lin Yuan would be blasted off the chair by this terrifying pressure in the next instant.

Then he would collapse to his knees before Huangfu Zhuo like a dead dog, utterly pathetic.

A triumphant, ferocious smile had already spread across Huangfu Zhuo's face.

He seemed to already hear the sound of Lin Yuan's bones cracking, to see the terror and despair on his opponent's face.

However, just as that pressure was about to touch Lin Yuan's body—

A sudden change occurred!

Lin Yuan on the lounge chair didn't even shift his position.

He merely furrowed his brow slightly, as if annoyed at having his pleasant dreams disturbed, and slowly opened his eyes.

What kind of eyes were they?

No anger, no killing intent, not even a hint of emotional fluctuation.

Only a deep vastness like the universe, an indifference like a deity's...

Calm.

He just casually glanced in Huangfu Zhuo's direction.

Just one glance!

BOOM——!!!

An indescribable supreme pressure from the apex of existence itself descended silently like an awakened primordial god!

This pressure made no earth-shattering display—it didn't even cause a ripple in the air.

But it ignored space, ignored distance, ignored all laws!

It struck directly at the depths of Huangfu Zhuo's soul!

In that instant, the ferocious smile on Huangfu Zhuo's face instantly froze!

The powerful aura he was so proud of, that eighth-level Marrow Cleansing pressure, was as fragile as bubbles in sunlight before this godlike pressure. It couldn't hold for even an instant before it "popped" and completely dissipated!

Then, an unprecedented terror—enough to freeze the very soul—crashed down on his heart like hundreds of millions of ancient divine mountains!

He felt as though he was no longer a person, but an ant so insignificant it was less than dust.

And what he had provoked was not another martial artist.

It was a being...

Seated high above the Nine Heavens, overlooking the eternal cycle of reincarnation...

"Urgh..."

From Huangfu Zhuo's throat came a meaningless, terrified moan.

His mind went blank; even thought ceased.

All the blood in his body froze in that moment.

His soul trembled and wailed in madness!

"Thud!"

Under the horrified, world-view-shattering gazes of everyone present.

The Huangfu family genius—Huangfu Zhuo—who had been insufferably arrogant just a second ago.

His legs gave out, and he dropped straight to his knees!

The hard flagstones cracked beneath his kneecaps, leaving two clear depressions and spiderweb fractures!

"Pfft!"

A mouthful of fresh blood sprayed uncontrollably from his mouth, splattering across the ground before him.

His entire body shook violently as if having a seizure, his teeth chattering with a "clack-clack-clack" sound.

He tried to lift his head but found his neck pinned by an invisible mountain, unable to move at all.

He tried to speak but found his vocal cords completely locked by terror, unable to produce a single sound.

His meridians... under that one glance, countless hairline fractures had appeared in his meridians!

His Dao heart...

That proud, lofty martial heart of his had been ground to dust by that godlike gaze!

The entire back garden fell deathly silent!

You could hear a pin drop!

All the watching students stood frozen as if petrified, their faces filled with expressions of having seen a ghost.

What had they just witnessed?

Lin Yuan...

He hadn't even stood up!

He hadn't even moved a finger!

He had just...

Opened his eyes and looked at the other person once!

And then, a genuine Marrow Cleansing Realm eighth-level genius expert had just... knelt?!

Knelt so thoroughly!

So decisively!

So...

Pathetically!

What the hell kind of plot was this?!

This had exceeded their understanding of martial arts!

And the one who had caused all this, Lin Yuan, after seeing that noisy fellow finally kneel and shut up—

Simply felt it was rather boring.

He yawned, rolled over, and muttered something in a drowsy, slurred voice.

"So noisy..."

Then he pulled up his blanket, closed his eyes, and seemed to fall back asleep.

As if everything that had just happened was merely swatting an annoying mosquito.

No, not even that.

Because swatting a mosquito at least required raising a hand.

And he, from beginning to end, had just been lying there.

Huangfu Zhuo knelt on the ground for a full half-minute before that soul-crushing terror finally dissipated.

He gasped for air as if granted amnesty.

Then, endless fear swallowed him whole like a tide!

He didn't even dare look at Lin Yuan again.

He scrambled up from the ground on all fours and fled toward the school gates like a terrified stray dog, crawling and rolling, never looking back!

Just then.

In the crowd, a quick-reacting student finally snapped out of that petrified state.

With trembling hands, he raised his communicator.

He uploaded the video he had just recorded—footage that could shake all of Dragon Xia Country—to the campus forum.

【Epic Scene! Senior Lin Yuan Opens His Eyes, Huangfu Family Genius Kneels on the Spot!】

The moment this title appeared, it instantly blew up the entire forum!

The video spread across the campus network at a viral, unstoppable pace!

"Holy shit! One glance brings an eighth-level Marrow Cleansing expert to his knees? What level of power is this? Is this real?!"

"I witnessed it with my own eyes!!!"

"He didn't even make a move! He just looked at the guy once!"

"Is this humanly possible? This is clearly a deity descending to earth!"

"I hereby declare: from this day forward, Lin Yuan is my one and only god! No, wait—he IS a god!"
