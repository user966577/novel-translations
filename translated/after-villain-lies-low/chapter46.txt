"Your disciples were the ones who struck with killing blows first, ambushing without warning."

"If you're bold enough to go for the kill, you'd better be prepared to die in return."

"Inferior skill is no one's fault but your own."

Facing the hostile glares from all directions.

Lin Jianguo slowly, deliberately picked up the teacup before him and took a light sip.

Only then did he lift his eyelids and respond in a tone so flat it bordered on cold indifference.

"What a fine 'inferior skill'! What a fine 'life and death are fated'! The Lin family is completely unreasonable! Today, I will seek justice for my son!"

Elder Zhao's eyes were bloodshot with rage.

How could such an answer possibly satisfy him?

Without hesitation, his aura exploded outward—he was preparing to attack directly!

The atmosphere between both sides instantly became tense as drawn swords!

Seeing this, Liu Qingtian and Chen Tianhao exchanged a glance, and cold smiles of successful scheming appeared at the corners of their mouths.

They'd been worried about finding an excuse to make trouble, and here one had delivered itself right to their doorstep.

Just at this critical moment!

An ancient voice, one that contained supreme authority, rang out like thunder from the Nine Heavens, exploding beside everyone's ears!

"Silence!"

BOOM——!!!

An indescribable, terrifying pressure descended from above!

The entire observation tower shuddered violently!

Everyone who had been shouting, preparing to attack, or watching the spectacle—all of them, in that instant, felt as though an invisible mountain was crushing them in place!

Even breathing became incredibly difficult!

Everyone present, Lin Jianguo included, displayed expressions of shock on their faces!

They quickly looked toward the source of the voice.

There, at the highest point of the observation tower, a figure had appeared at some unknown moment.

It was an elderly man wearing a simple Tang-style outfit, with snow-white hair and beard, yet his posture remained straight as a pine.

He simply stood there, hands clasped behind his back.

Yet it seemed as though he was the center of heaven and earth itself!

"It's... it's..."

Liu Qingtian's pupils contracted to pinpricks, his voice filled with disbelieving tremors.

"The... the Old War God! Lin Zhan!"

Lin Zhan!

These two words seemed to possess some kind of forbidden magic.

When they tumbled from Liu Qingtian's trembling lips.

The entire observation tower fell into absolute silence!

Everyone's faces bore the same expression—terror!

In Yan Jing City, in all of Dragon Xia Country, who didn't know the great name of the Old War God, Lin Zhan?

This was the man who, fifty years ago, single-handedly fought three Beast Sovereigns and physically blocked that apocalyptic beast tide outside Yan Jing City—the nation's anchor!

He was Dragon Xia Country's pillar of stability, one of the most powerful War Gods on all of Blue Star!

A true, living legend!

But...

Wasn't he supposed to be stationed permanently at the Northern Domain defense line, repelling the invasion of foreign races?

How could he appear here without any warning?!

Liu Qingtian and Chen Tianhao's faces had already drained of all color.

Their arrogance and scheming from moments ago seemed utterly laughable and childish under Lin Zhan's calm gaze.

Even Lin Jianguo was shocked and confused.

He quickly walked to the top of the tower and bowed respectfully to Lin Zhan.

"Father, how... how did you come back?"

Lin Zhan didn't answer him.

His eyes—seemingly clouded but sharp as an eagle's—merely swept lightly over those family heads who had been shouting moments ago.

"Hunting means casualties."

His voice wasn't loud, but it reached every ear with perfect clarity.

"If you can't even bear that small price, don't send your brats here to embarrass yourselves."

"My grandson sleeps when he wants to sleep, kills when he wants to kill."

"Who has objections?"

As his words fell.

An even more terrifying aura exploded forth!

Thud! Thud!

The family heads who had been so arrogant moments ago—their legs went weak under this pressure, and they dropped to their knees uncontrollably!

Cold sweat poured from their bodies, their teeth chattering audibly, none daring to even lift their heads!

Objections?

Who the fuck would dare have objections?!

Reason with a War God? That's like an old man hanging himself—tired of living!

Seeing their reactions, Lin Zhan finally nodded with satisfaction and withdrew his aura.

He paid no more attention to these insects, turning his gaze back to the light screen.

His eyes passed over his grandson, who was strolling leisurely toward Black Wind Valley, and finally settled on a region deep in the wilderness—an area shrouded in thick, dark mist.

As if he could see through all illusions to the darkness lurking in its depths.

Lin Zhan's sudden arrival, though no one knew the reason.

His very presence was itself a statement of position.

The Lin family was not to be provoked!

Lin Yuan was even less so!

Meanwhile.

The Wilderness Hunt had already entered its white-hot phase.

As the hunting grounds continuously shrank, encounters between prodigies became increasingly frequent.

In a rocky valley filled with jagged stones.

"Hahaha! Exhilarating!"

Wang Teng—the Wang family prodigy who had been boasting in the plaza earlier—had just cleaved a third-stage, early-phase Earth-Rending Demon Bear in two with one axe strike!

Drenched in blood, his aura had actually grown stronger rather than weaker, his eyes burning with frenzied battle intent.

"The top three this year will definitely include me, Wang Teng!"

He wiped the blood from his face, preparing to harvest the demon bear's monster core.

However, just then!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several pitch-black chains, dark as ink, shot out from the shadows without warning, wrapping around his limbs and torso like venomous serpents!

"What is this?!"

Wang Teng's expression changed drastically as spiritual energy exploded from within, trying to break free.

But those chains carried a strange power that devoured spiritual energy, rendering his prized brute strength completely useless!

"Hehehe..."

From the cold laughter emerged several figures in wide black robes, slowly stepping out of the shadows.

The aura emanating from them was pure, fear-inducing evil!

"You people... you're from the 'Divine Court'?!"

Terror finally appeared in Wang Teng's eyes!

"Correct, but unfortunately, no prize for you."

The lead black-robed figure let out a mocking laugh.

He raised his hand, about to end Wang Teng's life.

Just then, an indifferent voice came from behind them.

"Wait."

"This prey is mine."

Hearing this, the black-robed figures froze in unison.

They turned respectfully toward the newcomer and dropped to one knee!

A young man with sinister features and eyes full of resentment and satisfaction emerged step by step from the darkness.

"Ye... Ye Xuan?!"

Wang Teng, bound on the ground, nearly had his eyeballs pop out when he recognized the newcomer!

"It's you, you stray dog! What are you doing here?!"

"Stray dog?"

A twisted, cruel smile spread across Ye Xuan's face.

He walked up to Wang Teng, looking down at him like an insignificant ant that could be crushed at will.

"Soon, you'll know who the real... dog is!"
