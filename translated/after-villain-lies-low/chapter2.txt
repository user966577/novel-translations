Li Xuan'er practically fled from Lin Yuan's villa.

Only after sitting in her red sports car did her wildly pounding heart finally calm down somewhat.

Her hands gripping the steering wheel were still trembling slightly, her mind constantly replaying the moment Lin Yuan had stood up.

That terrifying pressure, those cold, unfamiliar eyes...

What was going on?

How had that guy changed overnight?

Her heart was filled with confusion and anger.

The simp who had hung on her every word, who would've ripped out his heart for her—he actually dared tell her to scram?

Something must have gone wrong!

As for that terrifying pressure that had filled her with fear, Li Xuan'er preferred to believe it was her imagination now that she'd calmed down.

Perhaps Lin Yuan had been too angry, and his aura had startled her.

After all, while Lin Yuan was a simp, his cultivation among peers was genuinely top-tier—otherwise he couldn't have held the position of "First Young Master" at Dragon Xia Country's Capital Martial Arts Academy.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got.

Most critically, without the cultivation resources, how was she supposed to explain this to Ye Xuan?

Thinking of Ye Xuan, Li Xuan'er's expression finally improved somewhat.

Unlike Lin Yuan, a good-for-nothing who only relied on his family background, Ye Xuan came from humble origins yet was resolute and talented—the most promising genius she'd ever seen.

She firmly believed that Ye Xuan's future achievements would far surpass Lin Yuan's!

That was why she willingly used Lin Yuan to help Ye Xuan.

This was an investment—investing in a future supreme powerhouse!

With this thought, she hesitated no longer.

Flooring the gas pedal, the sports car roared and sped toward Dragon Xia Country's Capital Martial Arts Academy.

Dragon Xia Country's Capital Martial Arts Academy.

At a secluded training ground behind the mountain.

A young man in black training clothes was drenched in sweat.

His features weren't the most handsome, but his face was chiseled with sharp angles, his eyes keen as an eagle's, his entire body radiating an aura of unyielding resilience.

This was the Child of Destiny from "Supreme Martial God"—Ye Xuan.

"Ha!"

He threw a fierce punch.

The wind from his fist sent shattered stone flying from the half-man-tall boulder before him.

Withdrawing his fist, Ye Xuan frowned slightly, sensing the somewhat sluggish spiritual power within his body, a trace of worry appearing on his face.

He'd been stuck at the peak of Marrow Cleansing Realm first level for quite some time now, unable to touch the threshold of the second level.

With the school-wide competition just a month away.

If he couldn't break through soon, it would be extremely difficult to achieve a good ranking in the competition and earn the academy's top resource rewards.

Just then, hurried footsteps approached.

Ye Xuan turned his head and saw Li Xuan'er walking quickly toward him. His furrowed brow relaxed as he went to meet her.

"Xuan'er, you're here. The goods... did you get them?" His voice carried a barely perceptible hint of anticipation.

He knew Li Xuan'er had gone to find Lin Yuan.

As for using Lin Yuan, he felt little guilt in his heart.

In his view, someone like Lin Yuan who was born with a silver spoon didn't deserve Li Xuan'er.

What he was doing wasn't using someone—it was righteous redistribution.

Taking back resources that should belong to geniuses.

Seeing the expectation in Ye Xuan's eyes, Li Xuan'er's expression instantly soured.

She bit her lip and said reluctantly, "No."

"No?" Ye Xuan was stunned, the smile on his face freezing. "How is that possible? That Lin Yuan... he dared refuse you?"

In his impression, Lin Yuan would give Li Xuan'er anything she asked for.

Forget a few measly pills—if she wanted stars from the sky, Lin Yuan would find a way to pluck them.

"Not only did he refuse!"

Remembering the humiliation from earlier, Li Xuan'er's anger flared. "That guy must've lost his mind today. He actually yelled at me, and... and told me to scram!"

To save face, she deliberately omitted the detail about being intimidated by Lin Yuan's aura, only emphasizing his rudeness.

"What?"

Ye Xuan's pupils contracted sharply.

Lin Yuan told Li Xuan'er to scram?

How was that possible!

This completely contradicted Lin Yuan's simp persona!

"He really said that?" Ye Xuan pressed. "Did you say something that set him off?"

"What could I have said! I just asked him for resources like you told me to, and he went crazy!"

"Besides, I feel like he was... different today, like he became colder, and... stronger."

Li Xuan'er said aggrievedly.

Ye Xuan's expression turned completely grim.

He knew better than anyone about Lin Yuan's background and strength.

Though outsiders called Lin Yuan a wastrel, within the academy, Lin Yuan's cultivation had always firmly surpassed his own.

If Lin Yuan hadn't been focused entirely on Li Xuan'er, neglecting his cultivation, the gap would probably be even larger.

Now, this biggest "ATM" had suddenly stopped working?

For him, this was undoubtedly a massive blow.

Without the Yellow Rank Top-Grade Qi Gathering Pills and Hundred-Year Blood Ginseng to fuel his breakthrough, his hopes of reaching Marrow Cleansing Realm second level before the school-wide competition were extremely slim!

Unable to break through, unable to shine at the competition, unable to earn qualification to cultivate in the academy's secret realm...

His entire series of plans would be thrown into chaos!

"Damn it!"

Ye Xuan slammed his fist viciously against a nearby boulder, reducing the already cracked stone to powder.

He looked at Li Xuan'er and forced down the irritation in his heart, gently consoling her, "Xuan'er, don't be upset. That guy must've had a brain malfunction. Since he won't give them to us, we'll figure out another way."

Though he said this, his eyes had become incredibly dark.

He gazed toward the direction of the Lin family estate in the city center, his look filled with confusion and a trace of cold intent.

Lin Yuan... you!

What exactly is this guy who suddenly stopped being a simp trying to do?

You're cutting off my opportunities!
