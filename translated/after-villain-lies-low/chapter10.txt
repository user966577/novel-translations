"Holy crap! What's going on? Did I hear that right? Lin Yuan registered?"

"Late registration? That's allowed? This isn't fair! This is privilege!"

"Duh! He's Lin Yuan. War God's family, money talks! This little privilege is nothing!"

"Now we've got a show! Peerless genius versus the First Young Master—this is definitely today's most explosive matchup!"

Under countless shocked, confused, disdainful, and curious gazes, the figure that had been lazily sprawled on the sofa finally, slowly, rose to his feet.

Lin Yuan stretched luxuriously, his joints cracking and popping.

He waved at the two pretty maids behind him.

"Alright, pack things up. Time to get to work."

His tone made it sound less like he was about to compete in a tournament deciding the academy's strongest, and more like he was heading out to buy groceries.

The maids bowed respectfully and efficiently packed up the sofa, snacks, and fruit juice before quietly withdrawing.

Only then did Lin Yuan start walking, unhurried, toward the contestant waiting area.

Throughout the entire process, he didn't even glance toward the arenas.

That innate indifference and casualness radiating from his bones made everyone watching grind their teeth.

So pretentious!

This guy had the word "show-off" practically tattooed on his forehead!

On the arena.

Ye Xuan, who had just been riding high with surging battle intent, now wore an expression that was nothing short of spectacular.

First came shock, then overwhelming joy.

Finally, that joy transformed into towering rage and ice-cold killing intent.

He's here!

He's finally here!

This coward, this trash, ultimately didn't dare hide away completely!

"Good... very good!"

Ye Xuan clenched his fists.

He stared fixedly at Lin Yuan's retreating figure, his battle intent reaching its absolute peak in this moment.

He swore he would crush all of this guy's arrogance and dignity on that stage, grinding it to dust beneath his feet!

With Lin Yuan's entry, the tournament's pace suddenly accelerated.

Soon, it was time for Lin Yuan's first match.

His opponent was a burly man at Marrow Cleansing Realm fifth level—a notable figure in the academy known for his strength and defense.

"Hmph! Lin Yuan, so you finally dare to show yourself!"

The moment the burly man stepped onto the stage, he assumed a battle-ready stance, muscles coiled, spiritual energy forming a thick shield across his body's surface.

"I thought you'd keep hiding like a turtle forever! Today, let me weigh you and see how many pounds the First Young Master is actually worth!"

Lin Yuan yawned and lazily walked up to the arena.

He didn't even bother with an opening stance, just stood there casually.

The referee, seeing both parties in position, announced loudly, "Match begin!"

"Hah!"

The burly man roared, stomping down so hard the entire arena shook.

He charged like a human tank, barreling toward Lin Yuan with overwhelming momentum!

Everyone held their breath, ready to witness a fierce collision.

However, the instant the burly man entered within three meters of Lin Yuan—

Everything changed!

The burly man's charging form suddenly went rigid, his expression freezing in place.

Then his eyes rolled back, and with a heavy "thud," he collapsed face-first onto the ground.

Foam frothed from his mouth, his body convulsing, as he passed out completely.

From start to finish, Lin Yuan hadn't moved a single finger.

He simply stood there. Even his facial expression hadn't changed in the slightest.

The entire venue fell deathly silent.

You could hear a pin drop.

Everyone was stupefied, including the referee on stage.

What...

What just happened?

Was this staged?

Some kind of act?

A good fifteen seconds passed before the referee snapped back to reality and rushed forward to check the burly man's condition. His face went pale with shock as he looked up.

"Contestant's... contestant's meridians are in chaos, spiritual energy backlash, loss of combat capability! Lin Yuan wins!"

ROAR—!

The silent spectator stands erupted!

"What the hell? He won just like that?"

"What did he even do? I didn't see anything!"

"Could it be a mental attack? No, that guy shows no signs of spiritual damage!"

Amid all the confusion and chatter, Lin Yuan yawned, strolled leisurely off the arena, and returned to his sofa to continue lying flat.

The matches that followed were even more absurd.

Whether it was someone at Marrow Cleansing Realm fifth level, sixth level, or even a seeded contestant with one foot in seventh level—

The moment they stepped on stage and the match began, they would collapse in the most inexplicable ways.

One tripped over his own feet and knocked himself unconscious.

Another lost control of his spiritual energy circulation and injured himself.

The most ridiculous one had just shouted "Take this!" when his eyes went blank and he started performing a ridiculous dance on the arena, continuing until he collapsed from exhaustion.

Lin Yuan, from beginning to end, hadn't made a single move.

He hadn't even changed his standing posture.

If the first time was coincidence and the second was accident, then five or six occurrences in a row could only mean one thing:

Lin Yuan's strength had reached a terrifying level completely beyond their comprehension!

He didn't need to lift a finger!

Just standing there, using some unknown method, he could make his opponents defeat themselves!

This wasn't even fighting anymore. This was dimensional domination!

Fear spread like a plague through the hearts of every remaining contestant.

By the end, anyone who drew Lin Yuan as their opponent didn't even wait to go on stage—they immediately forfeited.

Are you kidding?

Go up there and make a fool of yourself?

Or experience what it feels like to dance in public?

And so, Lin Yuan advanced to the finals in the most unprecedented, bizarre manner in history—lying his way through.

And his opponent, without question, was the one who had steamrolled his way through the other bracket, displaying heaven-shaking combat power—the Child of Destiny—

Ye Xuan!

The ultimate showdown had finally arrived!

The entire arena's atmosphere reached its absolute peak!

On one side stood the rapidly rising miracle worker, hailed as a commoner legend, the Child of Destiny—Ye Xuan!

On the other side stood the mysterious, unfathomable young master who had lain his way to the finals through inexplicable means—Lin Yuan!

This match would not only determine the tournament's champion but was seen by countless spectators as the ultimate collision between new blood and old aristocracy, between effort and privilege!

"Ye Xuan! Go for it!"

"Ye Xuan! Take down that spoiled rich kid!"

In the spectator stands, people cheered for Ye Xuan.

They preferred to believe that the genius who had climbed up through his own efforts could defeat the "lying winner" who relied on his family background.

Li Xuan'er was among them, nervously clenching her fists, silently praying for Ye Xuan.

Only Gu Ningxue.

She watched the figure rise once more from the sofa, his face full of reluctance as he walked toward the arena, and a powerful sense of unease welled up in her heart.

This man was too terrifying!

On the arena.

Ye Xuan took a deep breath, adjusting his condition to its peak.

He could sense that Lin Yuan was strong—absurdly strong.

But he was fearless!

He had the secret techniques passed down by the Supreme Dao Ancestor, he had experience forged through countless life-or-death battles, he had an unconquerable champion's heart!

He believed he could win!

"Lin Yuan!"

Ye Xuan's voice rang out clear and powerful. "I know you're strong! But today, I, Ye Xuan, will defeat you here, fair and square! I'll show you what a true genius looks like!"

Lin Yuan picked at his ear, apparently bothered by the volume.

He gave Ye Xuan a glance and uttered two words.

"Noisy."

The referee, seeing this, wasted no more words and immediately announced, "Finals, begin!"

The instant those words fell!

Ye Xuan moved!

His aura exploded with full force. Marrow Cleansing Realm second level spiritual power churned without reservation as his right hand formed a fist seal, assuming the opening stance of Mountain-Splitting Fist!

He would use his strongest technique to fire the opening shot of this battle!

Yet just as he struck the pose, preparing to unleash this earth-shattering punch—

The Lin Yuan across from him finally moved.

He didn't punch. He didn't kick.

He simply raised his head, and that indifferent gaze fell upon Ye Xuan for the first time.

BOOM—!

A pressure beyond description in human language, like a heavenly river breaking its banks, like a universe collapsing, descended upon him!

It wasn't mere cultivation aura!

It was absolute suppression from a higher plane of existence!

The innate supreme divine might of the Primordial Sacred Body, transcending all creation!

"Pfft!"

Ye Xuan's stance was only half-formed, his spiritual power not yet fully gathered.

He felt an irresistible force slam into both his divine soul and physical body.

The meridians throughout his body were instantly shattered by this power!

Spiritual energy went into wild reversal, his internal organs struck as if by a ten-thousand-ton hammer!

He sprayed out a mouthful of blood, and his entire body went boneless. His legs buckled as he collapsed straight to his knees with a "thud"!

What happened?

Ye Xuan's mind went blank.

He couldn't accept this!

He couldn't just lose like this!

"AHHHHH—!"

Ye Xuan let out a bestial roar, pouring every ounce of strength into trying to rise, to fight back!

Yet what greeted him was pressure even more terrifying, even more crushing!

The body Ye Xuan had just barely lifted was slammed back down by an invisible force!

His entire form was pressed into a humiliating position, pinned against the ground, cheek pressed tight to the cold stone, unable to move a single finger!

The gap...

Was this what the gap looked like?

All his desperate training, all his life-or-death tempering, his proud talent and willpower...

Before this person, they were nothing but a joke!

An utter, pathetic joke!

Unwillingness, fury, humiliation, despair...

Every emotion churned like the most venomous poison in his heart, tearing at his sanity.

He felt like he wasn't facing a person.

But gazing up at a god standing high above, looking down on all creation with cold indifference!

No matter how hard he struggled, how desperately he fought, he could never touch even the heel of that being!

Lin Yuan looked down at Ye Xuan, pressed flat against the ground, his pathetic struggles proving futile. His eyes held no ripples, as if watching an ant.

He slowly raised his foot and lightly ground it against the floor.

The sound wasn't loud, yet it carried clearly across the silent arena.

"You thought that clawing your way up from obscurity to where you are now made you a Child of Destiny?"

"Sorry, but trash like you isn't even qualified to make me lift a finger."

A single scornful laugh.

Dripping with bone-deep contempt, it drove into Ye Xuan's heart like an ice pick.

As the words fell.

Lin Yuan didn't spare Ye Xuan another glance.

He simply turned and walked off the arena with measured steps.

That tone of utter indifference cut deeper than any venomous curse!

As if...

Even Ye Xuan's existence was nothing but a waste of his time.

This...

Was this what genius looked like???

The entire arena lay in deathly silence.

Everyone had been shocked senseless by this reality-defying scene.

Not until Lin Yuan's figure was about to vanish into the exit corridor did the stunned referee finally snap awake.

His voice trembling, he announced the result that had never been in question.

"W-Winner... Lin Yuan!!!"
