BOOM——!!!

If Lin Yuan's suppression of Ye Xuan with a single thought before had been a depth charge dropped into everyone's understanding—

Then this video of him bringing Huangfu Zhuo to his knees with a single glance was equivalent to detonating a nuclear bomb!

"What the hell did I just watch?! Is this a deity descending to earth?!"

"Drop the question mark! That IS a deity! One glance! Just one fucking glance! A sixth-level Marrow Cleansing genius knelt like a grandson!"

"I know Huangfu Zhuo! The Huangfu family's prodigy, famous for being arrogant and domineering, with incredible combat power! And in front of Lord Lin, he wasn't even as good as a dog!"

"The craziest part? Lord Lin was lying down the whole time! He couldn't even be bothered to stand up! And then he yawned because the guy was too noisy! The swagger is absolutely maxed out!"

"Ye Xuan is fighting for his life for the national championship, and meanwhile Lord Lin is sleeping at home, casually causing a hundred times more buzz than the championship! Some people just can't compare!"

"Don't compare Ye Xuan to Lord Lin, please—that's an insult to a god!"

The online storm swept unstoppably through every corner.

Capital Martial Arts Academy, girls' dormitory.

Gu Ningxue was leaning back on her sofa.

Applying a face mask while browsing posts with great interest.

When she saw the video pinned at number one, her crimson lips curved into a lovely arc.

In the video.

That man still had that lazy, couldn't-care-less-about-anything demeanor.

Yet it was precisely this bone-deep laziness that produced an act that shook the entire world.

"A lion never concerns itself with the opinions of sheep..."

Gu Ningxue thought of that phrase again, and couldn't help but laugh.

"This man is really... getting harder to read, and more and more interesting..."

She closed the video, an unusual light dancing in her beautiful eyes.

She suddenly felt that perhaps she should be more proactive.

Meanwhile.

In Li Xuan'er's room, the atmosphere was oppressive as hell itself.

She had also seen the video.

When she watched Huangfu Zhuo's insufferably arrogant figure crumble to his knees, vomiting blood, under Lin Yuan's single indifferent glance—

She was completely stupefied.

A sense of absurdity and terror a thousand times stronger than when the security guards had humiliated her with "release the dogs" instantly swept through her entire being!

She finally understood.

She had always thought that Ye Xuan's rise meant she had grasped another path to the summit.

Now she realized—

She had merely jumped from an aircraft carrier onto a canoe that could sink at any moment, smugly congratulating herself for her keen eye!

Lin Yuan's power had exceeded her comprehension!

What did Ye Xuan's strength—bought by burning his life—amount to before Lin Yuan's godlike might?

A joke! A massive joke!

No!

She couldn't let this continue!

She had already lost everything!

She absolutely couldn't watch her last shred of hope crumble before her eyes!

Jealousy, resentment, regret, fear...

All these emotions churned within her, finally converging into a single desperate thought.

Ye Xuan!

Yes! There was still Ye Xuan!

He was currently the most dazzling star in the National League, about to claim the championship!

She had given so much for him back then!

She had given him all the resources Lin Yuan had given her!

He couldn't be this heartless!

As long as they got back together, with his current fame and status, there would still be a chance!

Li Xuan'er clutched at this last straw like a drowning woman, a manic gleam reigniting in her eyes.

She leaped from her bed and rushed out of her room.

In the five-star hotel housing the National League contestants, presidential suite.

Ye Xuan had just finished an arduous match and was still basking in the thunderous cheers and adulation from the crowd.

He opened the forum, ready to enjoy the articles praising him.

However, what greeted his eyes was a title that made his pupils contract sharply.

【Epic Scene! Senior Lin Yuan Opens His Eyes, Huangfu Family Genius Kneels on the Spot!】

Lin Yuan?

His heart lurched, an ominous premonition rising.

Compelled by some inexplicable force, he clicked on the video.

When he saw that figure he hated to the bone—lazily opening his eyes and causing a warrior with an aura far stronger than his own to kneel helplessly—

BOOM——!

Ye Xuan's mind was struck directly by a nuclear bomb, instantly blasted into blankness!

"No... impossible! This is absolutely impossible!"

He shot to his feet, looking possessed, and smashed his fist through the million-yuan jade table, shattering it to pieces!

"Huangfu Zhuo is Marrow Cleansing Realm eighth level! Stronger than me! How could Lin Yuan?! How could a single glance make him kneel?!"

"What realm is he at?! Marrow Cleansing ninth level? No! Even at peak ninth level, doing something like this is impossible! This doesn't make sense! This isn't fair!"

He had fought desperately, burned his life, to achieve his current status.

He thought he could finally stand at the same height as Lin Yuan, even surpass him!

But the result?

Reality had given him the loudest and cruelest slap in the face!

The gap between him and Lin Yuan hadn't shrunk—it had widened to a chasm so vast he couldn't even look up at it without despair!

"Pfft——"

Under the assault of rage, he could no longer suppress the churning blood in his body. A large mouthful of blood sprayed out, staining the luxurious carpet.

Just then, from deep within his Sea of Consciousness, the Supreme Dao Ancestor's ancient, slightly weary voice slowly emerged.

"Sigh..."

"I told you long ago that Lin Yuan is unfathomably deep. I told you not to be arrogant. You just wouldn't listen!"

"Did you think that with one forbidden technique, you could ascend to heaven in a single step and trample him underfoot? Foolish!"

"In martial cultivation, foundation is paramount! He was born with a silver spoon, soaking in precious treasures since childhood. The solidity of his foundation is beyond your imagination! How could the gap between you be so easily bridged?"

"Master..." Ye Xuan's voice trembled with despair. "So... after all I've sacrificed, after burning my life... in the end... I'm still not even qualified to be his opponent?"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor was silent for a moment before slowly speaking. "What's done is done. More words are useless. Your only path now is to work harder than him! A hundred times, a thousand times the sweat, to close the gap between you!"

"Hard work... yes! Hard work!"

After a brief flash of despair, Ye Xuan's eyes were once again filled with an even more frenzied, even more obsessive fire!

"I, Ye Xuan, am the Child of Destiny! I will never lose!"

"I will work even harder! Until the day I trample him completely beneath my feet!"

He was about to throw himself into mad cultivation once more.

Just then, the doorbell rang.
