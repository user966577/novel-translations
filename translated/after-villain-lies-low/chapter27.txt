The night before the National League finals.

Ye Xuan was in his hotel room, frantically cultivating, trying to stabilize the realm he had forcibly elevated with secret techniques.

Just then, a ghostly figure appeared silently outside his window.

"Who's there?!"

Ye Xuan's eyes snapped open, every hair on his body standing on end as a powerful sense of crisis washed over him.

The window was gently pushed open.

A man in a black robe wearing a silver mask drifted in soundlessly, as if weightless.

His aura was as deep as the sea, making Ye Xuan's heart skip a beat.

This was definitely a supreme expert!

"No need to be nervous." The masked man's voice was hoarse yet magnetic. "I mean no harm."

With a casual wave of his hand, an antique rosewood box landed gently on the table before Ye Xuan.

"A small token of introduction. Nothing much."

Ye Xuan didn't look at the box. His gaze remained locked on the masked man as he asked warily, "Who are you people? What do you want with me?"

"We... are people who admire you."

The masked man chuckled softly. "As for our purpose... what do you think?"

He didn't say it explicitly, but his gaze drifted, almost imperceptibly, toward the direction of the Lin family estate outside the window.

Ye Xuan's heart jolted!

He understood instantly!

These people were Lin Yuan's enemies!

He opened the rosewood box.

In an instant, a dense, almost tangible wave of pure spiritual energy surged out!

Inside the box lay a fist-sized, blood-red Thousand-Year Fire Lingzhi that seemed to have molten lava flowing within.

Beside it were three crystalline, top-grade spirit stones radiating terrifying energy fluctuations!

Hiss——!

Even Ye Xuan couldn't help but gasp when he saw these items!

Any one of these, if brought out, would be enough to spark a bloodbath!

And now they were being offered to him as a mere "token of introduction"!

The other party's wealth was simply unfathomable!

"You... are you from the Huangfu family?"

Ye Xuan asked probingly.

Given who had recently dared to openly provoke Lin Yuan, and possessed such resources, he could think of no one else but the Huangfu family, who had a blood feud with the Lins.

The masked man gave an ambiguous smile, neither confirming nor denying.

"So? Ye Xuan, we share a common enemy and a common goal. There is no more solid alliance in this world than that."

Ye Xuan's heart pounded.

Reason told him that cooperating with a behemoth like the Huangfu family was like seeking skin from a tiger—one wrong move and he'd be devoured, bones and all.

But...

He couldn't refuse!

He needed resources desperately!

The backlash from the Blood-Burning Dragon Transformation Art was growing more severe.

Without massive quantities of rare treasures to replenish his life essence, forget revenge against Lin Yuan—he might not even see next month's sun!

"Master..." he called out anxiously in his mind. "What should I do? The Huangfu family clearly wants to use me as a knife against Lin Yuan!"

Deep in his Sea of Consciousness, the Supreme Dao Ancestor was silent for a long while before letting out a faint sigh.

"Boy, fortune favors the bold!"

"You're already at a point of no return! The Huangfu family wants to use you—so why can't you use them in turn?"

"They see you as a blade? Then be the sharpest blade there is! First, take everything they offer and convert it into your own strength!"

"Once you become strong enough—so strong even they can't control you—the blade can turn and bite its master!"

"Use them boldly! Right now, this is exactly what you need!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor's words steadied Ye Xuan's resolve.

He lifted his head. The last trace of hesitation in his eyes was replaced by determination and madness.

"Fine! I accept your offer!"

"A wise choice." The masked man nodded with satisfaction. "Rest assured, this is only the beginning. As long as you keep creating trouble for Lin Yuan, our Huangfu family's resources will flow to you without limit!"

With that, his figure dissolved once more into black smoke, vanishing into the night.

Ye Xuan stared at the treasures on the table—items that would drive any martial artist mad—and his eyes blazed with unprecedented ecstasy!

"Hahahaha! Destiny favors me! I, Ye Xuan, am truly blessed by fate!"

"Lin Yuan! Do you see this? Even heaven itself is helping me!"

He immediately set up several isolation formations, then grabbed the Thousand-Year Fire Lingzhi and swallowed it whole!

BOOM——!

A violent surge of fire-element energy exploded within him!

The sensation was like swallowing a live volcano!

Ye Xuan let out an agonized roar, frantically circulating the Blood-Burning Dragon Transformation Art to guide this terrifying energy through his body, washing over his limbs and bones!

The bottleneck in his body, before this domineering force, crumbled like paper, instantly broken through!

Marrow Cleansing Realm third level!

Done!

But it wasn't over!

The medicinal power of the Thousand-Year Fire Lingzhi remained vast and boundless!

Eyes crimson, Ye Xuan grabbed all three top-grade spirit stones and began devouring their energy like a great whale drinking the sea!

RUMBLE——!

His aura surged once more!

That freshly stabilized realm barrier was once again forcibly shattered!

Marrow Cleansing Realm fourth level!

Two realm breakthroughs in a single night!

"AAAAHHH——!"

Ye Xuan howled at the sky.

A terrifying aura several times stronger than before erupted from his body, nearly tearing the hotel roof off!

Feeling the unprecedented, torrential power coursing through him, his face split into an ecstatic grin!

"I truly am the Child of Destiny!"

He clenched his fist, feeling the mountain-shattering, rock-splitting power within, his confidence swelling to unprecedented heights!

"Lin Yuan! You wait!"

"I will catch up to you! And then—trample you beneath my feet!"
