After winning the championship, Lin Yuan's days were the kind that would make even immortals shake their heads in envy.

He perfectly upheld his agreement with his grandfather, taking "lying flat" to the extreme.

Slept until he naturally woke up every day.

Woke up to maids feeding him top-grade spirit fruits.

After eating, he'd go sunbathe on the back garden lawn. When he got tired of that, he'd return to his room's massive bed to sleep some more.

Meanwhile, the system's rewards came in like clockwork.

On time, never missed.

[Ding! Detected that Host has successfully maintained lying-flat posture for three days, contributing to the cause of salted fish everywhere. Reward: Heaven Rank lower-grade pill—Nine Revolutions Golden Pill x1!]

[Ding! Detected that Host has consecutively maintained lying-flat posture for five days with single-minded focus and stable Dao heart. Reward: Ancient formation remnant scroll—"Zhou Tian Star Array: Remnant Chapter"!]

[Ding! Detected that Host has consecutively maintained lying-flat posture for seven days. Achievement "Lying Flat Prodigy" unlocked. Primordial Sacred Body automatic operation efficiency +1%!]

BOOM!

On this day, Lin Yuan was lying on a beach chair by the pool, drinking iced spirit fruit juice.

The spiritual power in his body, under the Primordial Sacred Body's automatic operation, had accumulated to an unprecedented peak!

The next second, it was as if an invisible barrier had been quietly broken through.

The swirling chaos of spiritual power at his dantian suddenly condensed, then rapidly expanded, transforming into a vast, boundless "ocean"!

Qi Sea Realm!

The third major realm of martial cultivation—achieved!

An aura ten times more terrifying than Marrow Cleansing Realm flashed from within him, then was perfectly contained by the Primordial Sacred Body, alerting no one.

Feeling the surging spiritual sea within him, Lin Yuan smacked his lips with satisfaction.

From the peak of Marrow Cleansing Realm ninth level to opening his Qi Sea and stepping into Qi Sea Realm first level.

For ordinary geniuses, even with massive resource support, it would take months or even a year of closed-door cultivation to stabilize their realm.

And he had just laid around for a few days, slept a few times, and broke through naturally.

"Sigh, being invincible is just this lonely."

Lin Yuan yawned and rolled over.

Continuing his lying-flat career.

Meanwhile.

The National College Martial Arts League preliminary rounds were in full swing.

The Dragon Xia Country Capital Martial Arts Academy team, under captain Gu Ningxue's leadership, faced their first formidable opponent—

Yan Jing Martial Arts Academy.

"Ha!"

On the arena, Gu Ningxue moved with ethereal grace.

The long sword in her hand danced up and down, weaving brilliant sword flowers that forced her opponent into continuous retreat.

Her opponent was Yan Jing Martial Arts Academy's ace.

A genuine Marrow Cleansing Realm sixth level genius whose Blazing Fire Palm was fierce and domineering.

Though Gu Ningxue's realm was higher.

Having broken through another level this month to reach Marrow Cleansing Realm seventh level, she still didn't have an easy time.

On the other side, Ye Xuan was also locked in a bitter fight.

With his Marrow Cleansing Realm second level cultivation, he faced a fourth level opponent.

Though he held the upper hand thanks to his rich combat experience and secret techniques, his spiritual power consumption was enormous.

In the end, after an arduous battle.

Capital Martial Arts Academy won with a narrow three-to-two advantage, a hard-fought victory.

After the match, the atmosphere in the rest room was somewhat heavy.

"This won't work—our team's weakness is too obvious."

Gu Ningxue's elegant brows knitted as she pinpointed the problem. "We lack an absolute powerhouse who can deliver the finishing blow. Against opponents like Yan Jing Academy, I have to deal with their ace and can't support the others. Ye Xuan can challenge opponents above his level, but his spiritual power sustain is a big problem."

Everyone stayed silent, knowing she spoke the truth.

If every match was this grueling, forget winning the championship—they might not even make the finals.

At that moment, the same lazy figure surfaced in everyone's mind.

If that man were here...

He'd probably just need to stand on the stage for the match to be over.

"Yeah, if only Lin Yuan were here. It wouldn't be this hard." A teammate couldn't help but sigh, his voice full of nostalgia. "You all saw last time—the way he handled that Zhao Hao, it was like child's play. One slap sent him flying, and that was a sixth level Marrow Cleansing!"

Another teammate nodded repeatedly: "That's not even the half of it. I heard during his entrance exam, one punch shattered the highest-hardness testing pillar. Even the instructors were shocked. If he'd join the team, forget Yan Jing Academy's ace—even stronger opponents would probably be handled easily."

"Sigh, what a shame..." someone murmured. "He probably doesn't care about this kind of competition. With strength like that, he probably finds it boring."

The teammates chattered on, their words full of amazement at Lin Yuan's strength.

That certainty of "with him we'd be set" was like needles, pricking Ye Xuan's heart.

His fists clenched quietly inside his sleeves, knuckles white.

Why?

Why even now were these people still talking about that guy?

He had just fought until his spiritual power was drained to barely win!

Did his efforts mean nothing in their eyes?

Intense jealousy and frustration churned inside Ye Xuan.

Lin Yuan?

Just a coward hiding in his estate enjoying himself!

If he actually got on a high-intensity arena like this league, he might not fight as well as Ye Xuan!

A bunch of short-sighted fools!

Just wait!

Sooner or later, he would make everyone know.

Without Lin Yuan, he, Ye Xuan, was the true pillar of Capital Martial Arts Academy!

After a long silence, Gu Ningxue seemed to have made some decision. She gritted her teeth and pulled out her light-brain.

"Looks like I'll have to try one more time."

In front of everyone, she dialed a number that gave her a headache.

Lin Family Estate.

Lin Yuan was enjoying a massage from the maids when his communicator suddenly rang.

He glanced at the caller ID—

Gu Ningxue.

"Hello?"

He answered lazily.

"Lin Yuan! It's me!" Gu Ningxue's voice sounded urgent. "I'll make this quick—the team's in trouble. We need you! This concerns the honor of our entire academy!"

"Oh."

Lin Yuan's response was a single word.

"You... that's your reaction?"

"Don't you have any sense of collective honor? Besides, I heard Old War God Lin is paying close attention to this league..."

Gu Ningxue nearly choked.

She wanted to keep persuading.

But Lin Yuan cut her off impatiently.

"Beep... beep... beep..."

Hearing the busy signal from her communicator, Gu Ningxue was stunned.

He...

He actually hung up again?!

Before she could react, she tried calling back, only to hear the cold system prompt.

[Sorry, the number you have dialed is busy. Please try again later...]

In the rest room, Ye Xuan watched Gu Ningxue's ashen face, his heart secretly delighted.

He suppressed the smile trying to form at the corner of his mouth and said with feigned depth: "Captain, there's no need to beg him anymore! That coward doesn't deserve to fight alongside us! Without him, I, Ye Xuan, can still lead everyone to victory!"

Lin Yuan's "cowardice," in his view, was the best heaven-sent opportunity for him to claim all the glory!

He had to seize it!
