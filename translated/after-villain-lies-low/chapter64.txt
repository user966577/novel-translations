Inside the Chen family's council hall.

The tense atmosphere that had filled the room was instantly replaced by a powerful spiritual wave so intense it was suffocating.

Everyone who had been dispersing froze in place as if struck by a body-binding spell.

The expressions on their faces shifted from their earlier arguments to utter, disbelieving shock.

"What... what is this commotion?!"

The Grand Elder was the first to break the silence, his voice trembling.

His normally shrewd old eyes were now filled with alarm.

This force far exceeded any artifact within his knowledge—even stronger than the few upper-grade Earth-rank treasures passed down through the family, by countless magnitudes!

"Such powerful spiritual fluctuations! They're coming from the rear courtyard!"

One elder suddenly reacted, crying out in disbelief.

The rear courtyard—wasn't that...

Where the eldest miss, Chen Ruoxi, lived?

She spent all day locked in her refining workshop, tinkering with scrap metal. Could she really cause such a disturbance?

"Good heavens! Look at that!"

Suddenly, someone pointed at the sky outside the council hall and let out a near-scream.

Everyone looked up to see a brilliant beam of golden light, like a meteor streaking across the night sky, shooting up from the Chen family's rear courtyard, instantly illuminating the night sky over all of Yan Jing City!

Within that golden light, nine golden dragon shadows could be faintly seen, joyfully coiling and dancing, their resonant dragon cries shaking the very souls of all who heard them!

"Dragons... dragon cries?! Could this be... could a legendary dragon clan treasure have appeared in our world?!"

A well-traveled elder stared wide-eyed, his voice trembling with endless shock and disbelief.

"Impossible! How could a dragon clan treasure appear in our Chen family?!"

Someone immediately objected, voice full of doubt.

The dragon clan was the stuff of legends.

How could their treasures appear in a small family like the Chens?

Yet the spectacle in the sky was undeniably real.

That powerful dragon might, clearly transmitted to everyone's senses, left no room for doubt.

"Quick! Let's go to the rear courtyard and see!"

Chen Tianhao shot up from his seat, his face flushed with excitement, his voice hoarse.

Without caring about anything else, he was the first to rush toward the hall's exit.

The other Chen family elders quickly recovered and followed close behind, flooding toward the rear courtyard.

Even Chen Yu, who had been slumped in his chair trembling, was stunned by this sudden phenomenon.

He stared blankly at the dazzling golden light outside the window, eyes full of confusion.

What...

What on earth was happening?

When Chen Tianhao arrived at the rear courtyard, breathless, with all the elders in tow, the scene before them left every single one of them utterly stupefied.

There, in front of Chen Ruoxi's modest refining workshop, Lin Ke'er was hugging an ancient, elegant Bagua mirror, grinning from ear to ear.

On that mirror, nine miniature golden dragons moved as if alive, swimming across the surface, radiating a terrifying spiritual pressure that made hearts tremble.

And standing beside Lin Ke'er was their...

Eldest miss, Chen Ruoxi!

Though slightly pale and showing traces of fatigue, her face radiated an unprecedented confidence and brilliance.

Her gaze rested tenderly on the Bagua mirror in Lin Ke'er's hands, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"This... this is..."

Chen Tianhao's eyes went wide as he stared at the mirror, his voice trembling with disbelieving shock.

"Hehe! Uncle, look! This is the Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror that big sister Ruoxi made for me! Amazing, right?" Lin Ke'er proudly held up the mirror, showing it off to Chen Tianhao.

Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror?!

Chen Tianhao's mind was struck as if by divine lightning!

He looked incredulously at the mirror emanating its terrifying pressure, then at Chen Ruoxi standing to the side. His entire being went blank.

This...

This was actually the legendary Heaven-rank supreme-quality treasure—the Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror?!

He rubbed his eyes hard, wondering if he was hallucinating.

An eldest daughter who, in his eyes, only knew how to tinker with scrap metal and whom he'd never valued—she had actually...

Actually refined a Heaven-rank supreme-quality treasure?!

How was this possible?!

The other Chen family elders also drew in sharp breaths, their gazes toward Chen Ruoxi filled with shock, confusion.

And undisguised...

Reverence!

A Heaven-rank supreme-quality treasure!

Across all of Dragon Xia Country, such items could be counted on one's fingers!

And now, one had appeared in their Chen family, refined by their seemingly unremarkable eldest miss?!

This was like something out of a fantasy tale—utterly unbelievable!

"Ruo... Ruoxi, did you... did you really refine this?"

Chen Tianhao's voice was dry. He swallowed hard and asked again.

His tone carried a cautious deference even he hadn't noticed.

Chen Ruoxi nodded slightly and said softly, "Yes. This was something I promised little sister Ke'er."

Hiss——!

Another round of sharp intakes of breath filled the air!

Everyone looked at Chen Ruoxi as if seeing a monster.

They couldn't fathom how this usually inconspicuous eldest miss had achieved all this.

When had her refining skills become so terrifying?!

Even those grandmaster-level figures who had devoted decades to the craft might not be able to refine a Heaven-rank treasure!

"This... this..."

Chen Tianhao opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but found his throat blocked as if by something—not a single word would come out.

He suddenly remembered those contemptuous words he'd spoken in the council hall—

"What does a girl know about family affairs?! Does her opinion matter?! She just needs to follow the family's arrangements, and that's enough!"

Remembering them now.

His face burned as if someone had slapped him hard!

He had always thought his eldest daughter was nothing more than a dispensable chess piece, a tool that could be sacrificed for the family's benefit at any time.

But he never imagined.

This "weed" in his eyes had somehow, unnoticed, grown into a towering tree capable of sheltering the entire Chen family!

An artifact refiner who could produce Heaven-rank supreme-quality treasures.

Her value was simply immeasurable!

Never mind a small Chen family—even those superpowers would treat her as an honored guest!

Thinking of this, Chen Tianhao's intestines were nearly turning green with regret!

If only...

If only he hadn't been so short-sighted, if only he hadn't broken the engagement with the Lin family, if only he'd properly married Chen Ruoxi to Lin Yuan—what would the Chen family look like now?!

They would have long since soared to the heavens on the Lin family's coattails!

But now...

He had not only offended that terrifying existence in the Lin family, but had nearly overlooked the most valuable pearl in his own family!
