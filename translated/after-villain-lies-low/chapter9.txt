Northern Frontier, a thousand miles of frozen wasteland.

Lin Zhan's imposing figure stood amid the wind and snow.

He had just torn apart a King-class Vicious Beast that had tried to breach the defense line with his bare hands, traces of bloody killing intent still lingering on his body.

He was about to sit down and meditate when his communicator beeped again.

Glancing at it, he saw it was the home number.

The old War God's brow furrowed as he tapped to answer.

Uncle Zhong's anxious old face appeared on the screen.

"Old Master, something's happened!"

After hearing Uncle Zhong's report—that his precious grandson was too lazy to even participate in the school tournament and had been labeled a coward by the entire faculty and student body—Lin Zhan's expression instantly darkened.

"Outrageous!"

His thunderous roar made the wind and snow for a hundred miles stand still!

"Connect me to that little brat right now!"

The next second, the special communicator on Lin Yuan's wrist began vibrating frantically.

Lin Yuan was enjoying some iced spirit fruits delivered by a maid. Seeing who was calling, he raised an eyebrow and lazily answered.

A holographic projection appeared before him—his grandfather, radiating killing intent.

"Well, well, Old Man. Got some free time today? Not killing beasts, but checking up on me instead?" Lin Yuan maintained his carefree attitude.

"You little brat!"

"I heard you're not even participating in your school's tournament? What are you trying to do? Disgrace our entire Lin family?!"

Seeing his attitude, Lin Zhan's beard bristled with anger.

"Disgrace? How could that be?" Lin Yuan said dismissively. "I'm actually protecting our family's reputation."

"Bullshit!"

Lin Zhan raged.

"Think about it..."

"I, the magnificent grandson of Lin Zhan, future heir of the Lin family, a peerless genius—going to participate in some kiddie playground competition? Wouldn't that be beneath my status? Fighting a bunch of kindergarteners, even if I win, would that sound impressive? Way too cheap!"

Lin Yuan analyzed with a perfectly straight face.

"You..."

Lin Zhan was so amused by his twisted logic that he laughed despite his anger.

This kid really had an answer for everything.

"Enough of your nonsense! I don't care if it's beneath you or not—you're participating in this tournament today!"

Lin Zhan hardened his expression, his voice brooking no argument.

"But why?"

Lin Yuan grumbled in protest.

"Three reasons!"

Lin Zhan held up three fingers.

"You're my grandson, Lin Zhan's grandson, a son of the Lin family! My family may be arrogant, may be proud, but we will never be called cowards! If anyone dares talk trash, beat them until they shut up!"

"I've guarded the northern frontier for a century, slaughtered beasts until they don't dare venture south, my reputation resounding across the world! And my own grandson is hiding like a turtle at school? Where am I supposed to put my face?!"

"And another thing..."

Lin Zhan went on and on.

Damn it...

All I want is to lie flat peacefully, and I can't even do that???

No choice!

No matter what, he couldn't defy the old man!

"Fine, fine, I'll go..."

"But Old Man, you have to promise me—if I actually take first place, you all have to give me proper space and freedom. I'm not a kid anymore..."

Lin Yuan was utterly exasperated.

"Deal! If you can take first place, you can do whatever you want. Anyone who disturbs you, I'll break their legs!"

Lin Zhan agreed immediately.

Hearing this, Lin Yuan's eyes lit up instantly.

No one bothering him?

This deal was worth it!

Not even his big sister could nag him anymore!

Wasn't it just beating up some kids?

A bit troublesome, sure, but for a month of peaceful happiness, totally worth it!

Plus it would shut the old man up. Two birds with one stone.

"Deal!"

Lin Yuan immediately sat up from his lounge chair, suddenly energized. "Don't worry, Old Man. A mere school championship? Your grandson will take it with ease!"

"Hmph! That's more like it!"

Lin Zhan nodded in satisfaction and cut the communication.

Lin Yuan stretched and instructed Uncle Zhong beside him, "Uncle Zhong, go register me. Tell them Lin Yuan is joining the competition."

At the tournament venue.

Ten massive arenas were hosting intense battles simultaneously.

Spiritual energy flashed brilliantly, weapons clashed, shouts and cheers rose one after another, building into a wave of excitement that surged toward the sky.

Yet at the center of all this commotion, one person stood out as completely out of place.

Lin Yuan sat sprawled in the best seat of the contestant viewing area, perched on a soft sofa that had been specially delivered.

Iced spirit fruits and snacks sat within arm's reach, and two beautiful maids stood behind him, fanning him.

He wasn't even watching the arena battles—just staring at the sky with boredom, as if studying the shapes of the clouds.

This wasn't someone here to compete. This was someone on vacation.

Meanwhile, on Arena One, Ye Xuan was on a rampage.

He was like a tiger released from its cage.

Match after match, his opponents were defeated with single blows—clean, decisive, without a hint of hesitation.

"Holy crap! This Ye Xuan is way too fierce!"

"His progress is insane! I remember a few months ago he was only first-level Marrow Cleansing. Now his aura feels bottomless!"

"What level is he actually at? Does anyone know?"

Exclamations of amazement rose from the spectator stands.

Ye Xuan was using his overwhelming display of strength to rapidly capture everyone's attention.

Soon, he faced a new opponent.

The challenger was named Wang Hao, a notorious little rich kid at the academy whose family had considerable wealth.

He usually loved trailing behind Lin Yuan, and because of this, had always looked down on the commoner-born Ye Xuan.

Wang Hao's cultivation was a solid Marrow Cleansing Realm fourth level.

The moment he stepped onto the stage, he lifted his chin at Ye Xuan, his face full of arrogance. "Ye Xuan, I suggest you roll off this stage right now, save yourself the embarrassment of getting beaten so badly you'll run home crying to mommy!"

Ye Xuan's expression was blank, his eyes cold.

"Lin Yuan isn't here, but his little dogs are already jumping out."

"You insolent—!"

"What the hell are you? You think you're worthy of speaking Young Master Yuan's name? Today I'll show you the insurmountable gap between commoners and us nobles!"

Wang Hao flew into a rage.

As his words fell, he explosively released his aura.

Marrow Cleansing Realm fourth level!

That powerful pressure made quite a few students below the stage change expression.

But Ye Xuan simultaneously released his own cultivation.

Marrow Cleansing Realm second level!

"Hahaha!"

Seeing Ye Xuan's realm, Wang Hao laughed as if he'd heard the greatest joke, doubling over with mirth. "Just Marrow Cleansing second level? And here I thought you'd made some real progress! With this pathetic strength, you dare act arrogant in front of me? Get down!"

Still laughing, his body shot forward, a fierce "Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain Fist" aimed straight at Ye Xuan's face.

The wind from his fist was violent, full of confidence, as if he could already see Ye Xuan being sent flying by his punch.

Yet facing this incoming strike, Ye Xuan didn't even blink.

The instant the fist wind was about to reach him, he moved.

No fancy techniques, just a simple punch thrown forward to meet it.

But this punch carried an unstoppable, all-crushing domineering will!

"Courting death!"

Seeing Ye Xuan actually daring to meet force with force, the disdain on Wang Hao's face grew thicker.

BANG—!

The two fists collided, producing a muffled boom.

The expected scene of Ye Xuan being blasted away didn't appear.

Instead, the smile on Wang Hao's face froze solid.

Then...

Transformed into utter terror!

An overwhelming, irresistible force transmitted from his opponent's fist.

It demolished his protective spiritual energy and shattered the bones of his arm!

"CRACK!"

The crisp sound of breaking bones echoed across the arena!

"AHHH—!"

Wang Hao let out a blood-curdling scream.

His entire body flew backward like a kite with its string cut, crashing heavily off the stage.

Blood sprayed from his mouth as he passed out cold.

One strike, instant kill!

The entire venue instantly fell deathly silent.

Everyone's eyes went wide, mouths gaping enough to stuff a fist inside, faces filled with disbelief.

"I... did I see that wrong? Marrow Cleansing second level... one-punch killed Marrow Cleansing fourth level?"

"How is that possible! This isn't just fighting above his level, this is cross-realm domination!"

"Monster! This Ye Xuan is a genuine monster!"

After a brief silence.

Came a tsunami of uproar!

"At this rate, doesn't he have a shot at first place?"

"Hard to say. Lin Yuan still hasn't shown up! He's Marrow Cleansing sixth level!"

"So what? Ye Xuan at second level can crush fourth level. Against sixth level, he might still have a fighting chance! This tournament is going to be good!"

"Exactly! Plus who knows if Young Master Lin is even going to compete!"

"Maybe he sensed Ye Xuan was too strong and got scared off!"

The spectators discussed excitedly.

Their gazes toward Ye Xuan were filled with endless anticipation.

Then.

The other arenas' matches were equally spectacular.

Gu Ningxue moved with ethereal grace, her "Falling Snow Sword Art" executed with transcendent mastery as she easily defeated her opponent, drawing waves of applause.

Li Xuan'er also took the stage.

Her opponent was a senior at Marrow Cleansing Realm third level.

Facing an opponent at the same level, she won with some difficulty, ultimately achieving victory through more refined techniques.

But her face no longer held its former arrogance, instead carrying a trace of complexity and melancholy.

Ye Xuan's strength brought her both joy.

And an inexplicable sense of loss and unease.

On stage.

Ye Xuan stood proudly.

His gaze shot like lightning, fixing on a leisurely figure in the spectator area.

Lin Yuan...

Are you really not competing?

In his heart, boundless fury surged.

If he truly couldn't defeat Lin Yuan on this stage, Ye Xuan's heart would never find peace.

That was his heart demon!

An absolute, complete heart demon!

Yet at that very moment.

Over the loudspeakers.

A voice suddenly rang out.

"Attention please: Lin Yuan has registered through late entry and will be participating in the school-wide tournament!"

In that instant.

Everyone who heard the announcement stopped what they were doing.

They all turned to stare at Lin Yuan.

Their faces written with shock.

That man—he was back!
