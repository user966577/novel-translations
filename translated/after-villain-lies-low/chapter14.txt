Lin Yuan woke up from his massive bed feeling refreshed, as if the whole world had become different.

Though he was still lying in place.

But his divine sense could clearly "see" countless razor-sharp energies floating in the air, invisible to the naked eye.

That was sword intent!

Sword intent everywhere!

With a thought.

A wisp of formless sword qi condensed at his fingertip, slicing a tiny spatial rift in the air before him.

"Boundless Ocean Sword Intent," Heaven Rank top-grade!

Another divine technique that required no cultivation, directly maxed out!

"Young Master, you're awake."

A pretty maid pushed a dining cart in, arranging a breakfast so lavish it was almost criminal.

Eight-treasure spirit congee emanating rich spiritual energy, fried eggs made from eggs of the fourth-order Vicious Beast "Golden Finch," and a glass of juice squeezed from dozens of rare spirit fruits.

Any single item taken outside would be enough to make ordinary martial artists fight to the death.

And here, it was just Lin Yuan's ordinary breakfast.

Lin Yuan lazily enjoyed the maid feeding him, sighing inwardly.

Ah, being invincible...

Sometimes it was just this simple and unremarkable, yet boring.

In stark contrast to the Lin Family Estate's luxury and ease was another world beneath Yan Jing City.

This was the black market.

A lawless land filled with crime, desire, and blood.

In the dark, damp corridors, people of every unsavory profession mingled. The air reeked of rust, alcohol, and cheap potions.

Ye Xuan used his hood to hide his face, striding quickly through the noisy crowd.

Like a lone wolf, he walked into the black market's mission hall.

In the center of the hall, a massive light screen scrolled through various shady missions.

From finding people and objects, to assassinating enemies—everything was available.

His gaze skipped directly past the ordinary level-one and level-two missions, locking firmly onto the very top of the mission list.

There, only one mission remained.

Written in blood-red characters, marked with the highest danger rating accessible to ordinary people: Level Six!

【Mission Name: Hunt the Nether Leopard】

【Objective: Enter the core region of Black Wind Mountain Range, hunt an adult second-order Vicious Beast "Nether Leopard," and bring back its spirit core.】

【Reward: One million Dragon Xia coins, or equivalent cultivation resources.】

"Hiss—"

Seeing this mission, quite a few desperadoes nearby sucked in cold breaths.

"A Nether Leopard? That's one of the most troublesome second-order Vicious Beasts! It comes and goes without a trace, masters shadow assassination—I heard even Qi Sea Realm early-stage experts have fallen to its claws!"

"This mission has been up here for almost a month. Seven or eight people who took it have died—who would still go court death?"

"A million? You need to be alive to earn it and alive to spend it!"

Just as everyone was discussing.

Ye Xuan wordlessly stepped forward, reached out his finger, and firmly tapped on that blood-red level-six mission.

[Ding! Mission accepted!]

The entire hall fell instantly silent.

Everyone stared at this guy who clearly had a death wish, looking at him like he was insane.

"Kid, don't be impulsive! You can still cancel now!" A kind-hearted one-eyed man nearby couldn't help but warn.

Ye Xuan didn't even turn his head, coldly spitting out two words.

"No need."

With that, he turned and left without an ounce of hesitation.

In his Sea of Consciousness, the Supreme Dao Ancestor's anxious voice rang out: "Boy! Have you lost your mind? With your current strength, challenging a second-order Vicious Beast is no different from suicide!"

"Master, I have no choice."

Ye Xuan's tone was calm yet carried a hint of madness.

"Lin Yuan is like a mountain crushing me until I can't breathe! If I don't fight desperately, I'll spend my whole life living in his shadow! I'd rather die charging forward than live in humiliation!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor fell silent.

He could feel Ye Xuan's resolve, burning almost to the point of conflagration.

After a long while, he sighed.

"So be it! The path of martial arts is about fighting heaven, battling earth, and competing with others for your life! Since your mind is made up, this old man will accompany you in this madness!"

Black Wind Mountain Range, core region.

Ancient trees towered here, miasma filled the air, and even sunlight couldn't penetrate.

The atmosphere reeked of danger and death.

Ye Xuan moved through the dense forest like the most experienced hunter, restraining his aura to the absolute minimum.

Suddenly!

His hair stood on end as a deadly sense of crisis came from behind!

"Watch out!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice exploded in his mind.

Without thinking, Ye Xuan threw himself forward in an awkward roll.

Schick!

A black claw shadow, carrying the shriek of tearing air, swept past almost grazing his back.

His clothes were torn into five gashes down to the bone, and blood instantly stained his garments red.

Ye Xuan endured the searing pain and looked back.

In the shadows of a nearby tree stood a leopard, its entire body pitch black and sleek, as if composed of shadows themselves. A pair of dark purple eyes coldly watched him.

The Nether Leopard!

It moved!

No sound, no warning—its form instantly melded into the shadows and vanished!

Ye Xuan's pupils contracted sharply. He pushed his spiritual power to the limit, alert to his surroundings.

But he couldn't track it at all!

"Pfft!"

Another claw shadow struck from an impossibly tricky angle, leaving a bloody gash on his thigh.

"Damn it!"

Ye Xuan roared in fury, but could only take hits passively.

This Nether Leopard was too cunning!

It refused to engage him head-on, instead using its ghostly speed and concealment abilities to continuously wear him down and toy with him.

In mere minutes, Ye Xuan was covered in wounds, his spiritual power more than half depleted.

"Master! What do I do?"

He asked urgently.

"Don't panic!"

"That beast's strongest ability is its concealment, but every time it attacks, it must use shadows! Watch all the shadows carefully!"

The Supreme Dao Ancestor's voice rang out solemnly.

Under the ancestor's guidance, Ye Xuan forced himself to calm down.

He closed his eyes, abandoning his vision, sinking all his focus into perceiving the surrounding environment.

Wind sounds, rustling leaves, flowing miasma...

Now!

The shadow to his rear left had an unnatural twist!

Ye Xuan's eyes snapped open. Instead of retreating, he advanced, channeling every last bit of spiritual power into his fist and smashing it toward that shadow!

"Mountain-Splitting Fist!"

A shrill scream rang out as the Nether Leopard was forcibly blasted out from the shadow, blood seeping from the corner of its mouth.

It clearly hadn't expected this prey to see through its movements.

Landing his hit, Ye Xuan didn't dare relax for a second. He pressed forward, unleashing a storm of attacks.

One man, one leopard—in this forest, the most primal and bloody fight to the death unfolded!

In the end, when Ye Xuan used his last bit of strength to plunge a dagger into the Nether Leopard's heart, he himself was on the verge of complete exhaustion.

Covered in blood, he collapsed beside the Nether Leopard's warm corpse, gasping for air in great heaving breaths, without even the strength to move a finger.

But he was laughing.

Laughing with pure exhilaration, pure madness.

With trembling hands, he dug out a fist-sized spirit core from the Nether Leopard's body, glowing with a dark purple light.

Superior Nether Spirit Core!

Feeling the pure, vast energy within the core, the flames of hope reignited in Ye Xuan's eyes.

He exchanged this spirit core at the black market for a massive amount of cultivation resources.

Then, dragging his heavily wounded body, he found a secluded cave and began closed-door cultivation.

"Lin Yuan..."

"Just you wait!"

"I, Ye Xuan, will not be defeated!"
