Chapter 133: Beast

"Yun'er, the Pixiu Clan's territory does indeed border the Barbarian Tribes. They're also one of the major clans among the Ancient Myriad Races, ranked in the top hundred. Their relationship with the Barbarian Tribes has never been good."

Qin Junhua nodded, her expression cold: "However, our Su family's relationship with them is even worse, as is the entire Human Race's relationship with them.

The Pixiu Clan belongs to the ferocious beast lineage among the Ancient Myriad Races. They're extremely brutal by nature, enjoy devouring humans, and are innately cold-blooded. Even the Barbarian Tribes serve as food for them.

At the beginning of the spiritual qi revival, more than half of the humans who perished fell to the ferocious beast clans.

The Human Race has campaigned against the Pixiu Clan many times, so we absolutely cannot collude with them lightly.

If it hadn't been for Su Yong being too formidable, with support for him to inherit the patriarch position growing ever stronger within the Su family, I would never have been desperate enough to seek out the Pixiu Clan."

"After your father inherited the patriarch position, he used the Su family's eldest son being killed by the Pixiu Clan as justification to campaign against them once. He seized countless resources and laid the foundation for the Su family's rise. So our relationship with the Pixiu Clan isn't exactly friendly either."

Su Yun was slightly taken aback. Though everyone knew about Qin Junhua's collusion with the Pixiu Clan, this was the first time she had admitted it aloud herself.

Father Su Heng was also a ruthless man.

Qin Junhua's collusion with the Pixiu Clan to kill Su Yong had obviously been tacitly approved by him—likely even with his encouragement behind the scenes.

Yet after becoming patriarch, to completely distance himself from any connection to the Pixiu Clan's killing of Su Yong, he had immediately pushed the Supreme Council to campaign against them. He'd even profited handsomely in the process.

"This Pixiu Clan probably wants to ally with our Su family against the Barbarian Tribes so they can expand. But they know it would be difficult to approach Father directly, or perhaps because Father already made fools of them once, they can't swallow their pride. So they've gone the long way around and infiltrated Human Race territory to find Mother," Su Yun mused to himself, a cold glint suddenly flashing through his eyes.

"Ran'er, bring him over. I'll receive him personally," Su Yun said calmly.

"Understood, Young Master. This servant will go bring him at once." Yun Ran departed respectfully.

At that moment, Qin Junhua suddenly spoke: "Yun'er, remember to get the seal back from them. Leaving it in the Pixiu Clan's hands is a major hidden danger for our Su family."

"When they killed Su Yong back then, they immediately left without returning the seal."

"I understand."

Su Yun nodded. He naturally understood this point as well.

Though the Federation ostensibly prohibited the great clans from colluding with foreign races, that was only on the surface. Once exposed, it would still look bad and could become a weapon for enemies to attack the Su family.

Su Heng had likely understood this too, which was probably one reason he had turned on the Pixiu Clan and attacked them—likely to try to retrieve his mother's seal. He just hadn't succeeded.

Qin Junhua sighed softly and left the great hall. After all, the one in power now was her son.

In the past, her greatest wish had always been for Su Yun to grow up.

But now that Su Yun had truly grown up—even more ruthless than her, more decisive than Su Heng—she found her heart felt strangely hollow.

Just then, Yun Ran entered carrying the black seal. Behind her followed a figure completely shrouded in loose black robes.

"Reporting to the Young Master: the person has been brought."

Su Yun smiled slightly. After collecting the black seal from Yun Ran's hands, he spoke casually: "Ran'er, I need to correct your words. How can you call it a 'person'? You should say 'beast'—as in 'wild beast.'"

"Young Master, this servant misspoke. It's a wild beast." Yun Ran smiled charmingly and spoke softly.

"Insolent human! How dare you mock this Venerable One, comparing this Venerable One to a wild beast! You court death!"

The Pixiu who had just stepped into the great hall let out a low growl, fury in his voice. What status and power did he possess? How dare anyone insult him so brazenly to his face? Terrifying divine might immediately surged outward. But remembering this was Su family territory, he snarled: "This Venerable One doesn't care who you are. Where is Qin Junhua? Bring her here immediately! This Venerable One has enormous benefits to offer her!"

"Whatever benefits you have, you can tell me directly." Su Yun spoke indifferently, sitting grandly in the chair, looking down at the Pixiu Divine Spirit.

"A mere Profound Palace Realm ant isn't qualified to speak with this Venerable One."

The Pixiu's gaze was cold: "This Venerable One came this time not to pick a fight with you people."

In the beast clans, strength was supreme. Only the strong possessed everything.

Since Qin Junhua still wouldn't show herself, he would simply have to act on his own.

*Hum!*

A golden beast claw materialized, each hair gleaming with divine radiance. It blotted out the sky and sun, filling the entire great hall.

This was an ancient pureblood ferocious beast at the Strongest Divine Spirit level. The moment he struck, the entire war city trembled.

"Courting death."

Su Yun's gaze was indifferent. In his hand appeared the Qin family's Patriarch Token. Rolling black radiance erupted as the entire war city suddenly awakened, countless formation patterns materializing.

*Rumble...*

Endless offensive divine arts surged forth, each one containing Divine Spirit power, directly overwhelming the golden beast claw.

"Pixiu ferocious beast! You dare rampage in my Qin family territory!"

"A pureblood ferocious beast—a supreme tonic of immeasurable value!"

"Dragon Banner Formation!"

One after another, Qin family heritage powerhouses appeared around the great hall. Their gazes were cold, their divine might permeating everything as they unleashed endless divine arts in unison.

*Hum... Hum... Hum...*

The God-Devil Pendant appeared above Su Yun's head, cascading down divine and demonic radiance that enveloped him completely, isolating him from all the aftershocks of the collision outside.
