Chapter 56: Liu Ting, How Dare You Betray Me

"Three thousand fortune points rewarded at once." Seeing this enormous reward, Su Yun was secretly delighted.

With such a massive Charm Point reward, his cultivation speed had instantly tripled.

Worthy of being the most powerful female Divine Spirit in the original story—merely conquering her had yielded more Charm Points than killing Su Meng.

Altering Xuanyuan Jian's destiny had even rewarded him with five hundred points—nearly as much as changing the protagonist Ye Ling's fate.

At this moment, watching Xuanyuan Ze and his son depart, Qin Junhua stood silently in place, unable to react for a long while.

In this moment, she suddenly realized that her son had truly changed—changed into someone she could no longer see through, someone unfathomably deep.

Before coming here, he had already summoned the Five Elemental Divine Battalions.

Clearly, Su Yun hadn't trusted that she, his mother, would stand by his side and help him withstand the immense pressure from Xuanyuan Ze. So he had made thorough preparations.

She thought of how her son had dealt with Chaos Heavenly King—domineering and merciless. And when she had fallen silent facing Xuanyuan Ze's aggression, Su Yun had forcefully stepped forward to make his stance clear and drive the Xuanyuan father and son away.

Meticulous planning, acting only after thorough preparation.

"Yun'er, this matter has too great an impact. Should we first appease the Xuanyuan father and son, wait for your father to return, and discuss it together?"

Qin Junhua spoke with no small amount of worry: "If Xuanyuan Ze truly mobilizes the Xuanyuan family's powerhouses and armies to wage war against our Su family, the consequences would be too severe."

"Mother, there's no need!"

Su Yun waved his hand firmly, his gaze indifferent. "Whatever happened here today, Father has certainly already received word and tacitly approved it. You needn't worry."

Su Yun suddenly recalled how in the original story, after the original host was killed by Ye Ling and Liu Ting, Qin Junhua had been deceived by those two and given them enormous resources.

And his father, occupied with battles abroad, couldn't return in time. By the time he did, Ye Ling had already grown to his peak with Qin Junhua's help and slain Su Heng.

One could imagine—though Qin Junhua's methods were ruthless, she ultimately couldn't escape a woman's indecisiveness, which led to Ye Ling exploiting her, causing the deaths of both her husband and son.

Thinking this through, the assassination of Su Yong back then likely had Su Heng's involvement behind the scenes. Perhaps he had even personally orchestrated it from the shadows—it was just that assassinating one's own brother was too unsavory, so he had pushed Qin Junhua to the forefront.

Su Yun suddenly found himself looking forward to meeting this father of his current life—one of China's strongest Divine Spirits.

After all, this person had been one of the legendary figures in the original story.

He had simply been unable to withstand Ye Ling's powerful protagonist halo and was slain by Ye Ling shortly after returning.

"Mother, you must be tired. Please leave this matter to your son."

After bowing to Qin Junhua, Su Yun turned and walked toward the hall's exit.

"Mother, Jian'er is leaving too. Please rest well."

Xuanyuan Jian didn't hesitate either. After curtsying to Qin Junhua, she quickly followed Su Yun's steps.

"Yun'er."

Watching Su Yun's departing figure, Qin Junhua suddenly revealed a radiant smile. She turned to Qin Ying, who had been standing quietly in the corner the whole time: "Ying'er, have you noticed? Yun'er is becoming more and more like his father."

Her words were filled with satisfied joy.

"The Young Master is the most outstanding. Young Miss, your years of effort haven't been in vain." Qin Ying smiled. "Young Miss can return to the Qin family with peace of mind now."

At this, a cold smile appeared on Qin Junhua's face: "Regardless of what happens, my Yun'er must have his share of the opportunities at the Great Qin Immortal Pool. Those people actually want to strip my son of his fortune—I'd like to see who dares."

...

Outside the Imperial Capital, in the wilderness, after the spiritual energy revival, mountains stood tall and ancient trees reached toward the sky. Occasionally, powerful giant birds crossed the heavens, blotting out the sun with their awe-inspiring presence.

At this moment, one man and two women stepped into the mountain forest.

The man's features were handsome with an air of wicked allure. His tall, slender figure was clad in robes woven from heavenly silkworm thread, flowing with seven-colored radiance that added an aura of supreme nobility.

This man was none other than Su Yun.

The women beside him were Xuanyuan Jian and Liu Ting.

"Young Master, Ye Ling is in a cave halfway up this mountain." Liu Ting's eyelashes trembled slightly, her complexion faintly flushed, as if her blood was circulating unusually fast.

After all, Ye Ling was once her closest friend, a man who had stirred her heart.

Yet now, for her family's sake, she had betrayed Ye Ling, revealing his location while he was seriously wounded to Su Yun.

"After Ye Ling's failed ambush on Xuanyuan Li, he was severely injured. He contacted me and asked me to bring him a batch of spirit fruits for healing." Liu Ting spoke in a low voice.

"Liu Ting, you've done well. Tell me—what reward do you want?"

Su Yun's lips curved slightly as he waved his hand.

"Hummm..."

Instantly, terrifying five-elemental divine light blotted out heaven and earth. Dense formation patterns spread wildly across the sky and ground, sealing the mountain from all directions—even beneath the earth—as if cutting the mountain away from this world and locking it in completely.

The next moment, the Five Divine Generals appeared in their war chariots at five positions around the peak, their gazes cold and merciless, murderous aura soaring to the heavens. The terrifying pressure of five Saints spread across heaven and earth, making the vast mountain forest tremble.

"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."

In the distance, dust filled the sky as the Five Elemental Divine Battalions' armies appeared, obliterating all obstacles—mountains, ferocious beasts—leaving nothing behind.

Then fifty thousand soldiers sealed off every direction around the mountain, leaving not the slightest gap.

Xuanyuan Jian's eyes were filled with shock. She had never imagined Su Yun had brought her here to kill Ye Ling.

Moreover, to kill Ye Ling, he had deployed such a massive force.

Such a formation could probably kill even someone who had ignited their divine fire.

"Bang!"

But at that moment, Liu Ting suddenly knelt before Su Yun. She raised her beautiful face, her eyes slightly reddened, and said: "Young Master, I know I've committed a grave error. I dare not ask for anything else—I only wish to become your handmaiden, to serve you and the Madam for the rest of my life."

The "Madam" she spoke of was naturally Xuanyuan Jian, who had become Su Yun's fiancée.

And it was Liu Ting who had personally pushed Xuanyuan Jian to Su Yun's side.

One could hardly imagine how much her heart ached at this moment.

But for her family's sake, she had no choice.

Even though the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine had been returned, without Su Yun's protection, the Liu family's decline was only a matter of time.

In that moment, Xuanyuan Jian stood frozen, murmuring: "Sister Ting, what are you..."

She felt as though she had overlooked something.

Why had Liu Ting immediately reported to Su Yun upon learning of Ye Ling's whereabouts?

Why did Liu Ting clearly still love Su Yun, yet constantly speak well of him to her?

Vaguely, Xuanyuan Jian began to understand.

"Liu Ting, you wretched woman! How dare you betray me!" At that moment, a thunderous roar echoed from within the mountain, shaking the very heavens.

Ye Ling's figure emerged step by step from the mountain, black hair wild, killing intent soaring to the sky.
