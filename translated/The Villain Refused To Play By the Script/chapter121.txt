Chapter 121: He Doesn't Want to Die

"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."

The moment Xuanyuan Jian's voice fell, furious roars echoed from within the rift. Killing intent surged to the heavens, like thousands of troops charging.

Soon, all ten great generals of the Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard had stepped through the rift, arriving at the scene.

In an instant, terrifying killing intent enveloped Xuanyuan Ze and everyone else. The Chaos Bell sealed the heavens, blocking all information.

"Su Yun, you..."

Xuanyuan Ze's gaze was blank, his entire body frozen in place, mouth open but not knowing what to say.

Everything had happened too fast.

It had barely begun. The Kunlun Divine Spirit had only just arrived. They had only just prepared to fight to the death—and Su Yun had arrived.

Then Xuanyuan Jian had come too.

It was as if everything had been prepared in advance, just waiting for him to use the Blood Altar to break open the Divine Farmer Shennong's relic.

At this point, no matter how he resisted, it seemed meaningless.

Unless he could wipe out Su Yun and the Xuanyuan family's army in one fell swoop.

But if he had that kind of power, he wouldn't have needed to build the Blood Altar in the first place.

"Su Yun, you knew all along, didn't you? You knew I was building a Blood Altar, knew I was going to break open the Divine Farmer Shennong's relic?" Xuanyuan Ze's voice was hoarse to the extreme, like the scraping of iron against iron, making one's hair stand on end.

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved upward, but his eyes suddenly grew cold. He said indifferently: "Xuanyuan Ze, you truly are beyond redemption. Having committed such monstrous crimes, you're still trying to splash dirty water on this Young Master.

"Things have come to this point. For the sake of the thousand years of friendship between the Su family and Xuanyuan family, why don't you all just end your own lives? This Young Master guarantees that today's events will never leak out, and the Federation won't receive even a whisper of it.

"The Xuanyuan family will not be implicated because of the monstrous crimes you've committed."

"Su Yun, keep dreaming!"

Before Xuanyuan Ze could speak, Xuanyuan Li suddenly let out a roar. His eyes were blood-red, as if he had gone mad, roaring repeatedly: "All of this is because you want to swallow the Xuanyuan family! I will never let you succeed!

"If we die, there will be no one left in the Xuanyuan family who can stop you from devouring it!

"I, Xuanyuan Li, would rather reduce the Xuanyuan family to rubble than hand over a thousand years of heritage to you!"

With that, Xuanyuan Li turned to Xuanyuan Ze and growled: "Father, let's fight them to the death!

"You're still nominally the Xuanyuan family patriarch, recognized by the Federation. I don't believe they'd dare harm you!

"Don't be deceived by them!

"Fight the Su family to the end!"

Xuanyuan Li's growling voice carried a maddened quality, utterly hysterical.

"Slap!"

Suddenly, Xuanyuan Ze turned and slapped Xuanyuan Li across the face, growling hoarsely: "Do you even understand what you're saying?

"The Blood Altar is explicitly forbidden by the Federation, intolerable to the human race.

"Once word gets out, the entire Xuanyuan family will be implicated because of me, the patriarch.

"I warned you again and again to keep it absolutely secret.

"Why does Su Yun know about all this?"

Xuanyuan Li's eyes filled with disbelief, wide with rage: "Father, you actually hit me.

"I don't know how any of this leaked out either. I had everything planned perfectly.

"I only used trusted confidants and people with deep grudges against Su Yun."

Xuanyuan Ze shook his head in pain. At this point, what meaning did any of this have?

Suddenly, Xuanyuan Ze looked toward Xuanyuan Jian, his voice hoarse: "Jian'er, no matter what, I'm still your father. Xuanyuan Li is your brother. Blood is thicker than water.

"You don't have to acknowledge me as your father.

"But Father begs you—spare your brother. Save his life. He still has a boundless future."

At this, Su Yun smiled.

He hadn't expected Xuanyuan Ze to dote on Xuanyuan Li to such an extent.

"Xuanyuan Li, even now you still refuse to see the truth." Xuanyuan Jian's exquisite face grew even colder.

But at that moment, an indifferent voice came from within the rift: "Xuanyuan Ze, things have come to this point. No one can save you and your son."

The next moment, Xuanyuan Chong suddenly stepped out of the rift. Faintly, one could see wild joy in the depths of his eyes.

With Xuanyuan Ze dead, wouldn't the Xuanyuan family be his to command?

The existence of Xuanyuan Ze and his son had always been a thorn in his heart. Now, at last, it could be removed.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

From within the rift, Xuanyuan family powerhouses continuously emerged, their expressions cold as they watched this scene, watched Xuanyuan Li and his father. Their eyes held intense killing intent—they wished they could kill them immediately.

Building a Blood Altar—if word got out, the damage to the Xuanyuan family would be unprecedented.

They naturally couldn't escape either. They would be implicated.

If before they had merely been dissatisfied with Xuanyuan Ze, believing the Xuanyuan family had declined under his control—

Now they wanted nothing more than to kill Xuanyuan Ze and his son and bury all the facts.

"I never imagined you would be so deranged as to build a Blood Altar for your own selfish interests."

Xuanyuan Chong spoke with pained sincerity: "The ancestors of the Xuanyuan family, for the human race, shed blood and gave their lives, making tremendous contributions.

"Now you do this—where does that leave the Xuanyuan family?

"Fortunately, Young Master Su Yun is merciful. For the sake of his thousand-year bond with our Xuanyuan family, he has agreed that as long as you end your own lives, he won't let today's events leak out.

"Why don't you thank Young Master Su Yun, then end your lives along with Xuanyuan Li?"

The numerous Xuanyuan family powerhouses also spoke with cold expressions, their eyes filled with intense fury:

"Xuanyuan Ze, if you have even a shred of awareness as the Xuanyuan family patriarch, you should end your life immediately and atone for your sins!"

"For the Xuanyuan family to produce you two, father and son—it's a family misfortune!"

"End your lives at once!"

"Otherwise you will be the Xuanyuan family's eternal shame!"

...

Su Yun's smile was radiant.

In the original story, Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li had later become the ancestors who revitalized the Xuanyuan family—the family's pride.

Who could have imagined that now, they had become the Xuanyuan family's sinners, its shame?

The entire Xuanyuan family's powerhouses were demanding they end their own lives.

At this moment, the Kunlun Divine Spirit only felt his heart grow cold.

He understood that he was merely one of Su Yun's chess pieces. In the future, the entire Xuanyuan family would thank Su Yun for sparing them, while resenting him for discovering what Xuanyuan Ze had done.

"Enough!"

At that moment, Xuanyuan Ze let out a growl, his gaze sweeping over the assembled powerhouses. His voice was hoarse: "Everything I've done has been for the Xuanyuan family's future."

If he had been doing it for himself—

He had already reached the pinnacle of China. Resources beyond count were his. Why would he have done all this?

"Father, explaining yourself to these people who only care about their own interests is meaningless. Let's fight our way out." Xuanyuan Li's eyes were filled with bloodshot veins, black hair dancing wildly.

He didn't want to die.

"As long as we live, the Xuanyuan family still has hope.

"We absolutely cannot watch the Xuanyuan family fall into Su Yun's hands."
