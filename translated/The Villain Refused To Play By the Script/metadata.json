  "synopsis": "Su Yun, young master of the divine Su family, was supposed to be a brutal tyrant—a stepping stone for the protagonist Ye Ling to rise to power.\n\nIn the original story, he was obsessively in love with Liu Ting, murdering anyone who so much as looked at her. He was destined to be humiliated, defeated, and eventually killed by the Child of Destiny.\n\nBut Su Yun remembers everything. He knows the plot, knows the traps, and knows exactly how the protagonist is supposed to crush him.\n\nSo he refuses to play along.\n\nBreaking off his engagement with Liu Ting, he watches with cold amusement as the women who once despised him suddenly can't understand why he's changed. Meanwhile, Ye Ling finds his carefully orchestrated rise crumbling—without Su Yun playing the villain, where will his opportunities come from?\n\nWith the power of one of humanity's strongest divine families behind him and a cultivation talent that defies the heavens, Su Yun will snatch every fortune meant for the protagonist, crush every scheme before it begins, and show everyone what happens when the villain stops following the script.",
