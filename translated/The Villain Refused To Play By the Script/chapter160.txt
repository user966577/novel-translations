Chapter 160: Breakthrough

"Naturally, you'll have your share too."

Su Yun casually kissed An Ruoyi's cheek, a flash of excitement passing through his eyes.

After this test on True Feather Divine Spirit, he had discovered something.

Using the Qiankun Cauldron combined with his blood, there was a small chance of producing minor breakthroughs, but potential and destiny would increase dramatically. Most importantly, loyalty to him would greatly increase.

And this last point was the most crucial.

Every ruler's greatest concern was the loyalty of their subordinates—otherwise, the history of ancient China wouldn't have been filled with so many arts of emperorship.

Su Yun was naturally no exception.

But with this discovery, he could dramatically increase the loyalty of those around him.

Moreover, using his blood to enhance the potential of his people could accelerate the growth of his forces.

"But I can't use this indiscriminately. Only the most important people around me, and those who have rendered great service, shown great usefulness, or demonstrated sufficient loyalty, can receive this." Su Yun reminded himself internally, then looked at Su Jian, noticing the burning desire in his eyes, and smiled slightly.

After all this time, he had no doubts about Su Jian's loyalty. Su Jian had also provided tremendous help during this period.

"Uncle Su Jian, please enter the Qiankun Cauldron as well. You've earned this."

Su Yun spoke calmly, a cold glint flashing through his eyes.

With this group of powerhouses, his confidence for the upcoming trip to the Azure Blue Federation had greatly increased.

"Su Jian thanks the Young Master. From now on, I shall go through fire and water for you without hesitation."

Su Jian's eyes flashed with excitement. He flew into the Qiankun Cauldron, and before long, a drop of Su Yun's blood was refined into him, transforming the acquired into the innate. His comprehension of the Sword Dao advanced by leaps and bounds.

"Young Master, I can now battle ordinary Strongest Divine Spirits. At most a year, and I shall break through to Strongest Divine Spirit." After emerging from the Qiankun Cauldron, Su Jian knelt on both knees before Su Yun, bowing deeply.

Looking at Su Yun, his eyes were filled with reverence, as if gazing up at a supreme deity.

Though he was known as the strongest beneath the Divine Spirit level in China, and now considered himself invincible under the Strongest Divine Spirit realm, he knew his path was one of extremes. Without an extraordinary opportunity, his cultivation journey had essentially reached its end.

But after the Qiankun Cauldron refined Su Yun's blood into him, he could clearly feel that the gates of the supreme Sword Dao had once again opened for him. Blue Star's rules had far less hold on him now.

This was truly a heaven-and-earth-transforming supreme method.

If before Su Jian had only followed Su Yun's commands out of respect for the Patriarch Token, for Su Heng's status as Su Yun's father, and for Su Yun's powerful, iron-blooded methods—

Now, he was genuinely convinced from the bottom of his heart, truly loyal to Su Yun.

"What terrifying sword intent."

An Ruoyi, standing nearby, was also deeply shocked. Having just broken through to Strongest Divine Spirit, she found that she now had no certainty of victory against Su Jian.

This was simply earth-shattering.

One could only imagine how immense the benefit of this drop of Su Yun's blood was to Su Jian.

She eagerly flew into the Qiankun Cauldron. Rolling chaotic mist enveloped her delicate form, and Su Yun dripped a drop of blood into it.

"Truly worthy of the system-rewarded Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art, a cultivation method created by Pangu that encompasses all laws of heaven and earth."

Su Yun's gaze was sharp.

Su Jian's transformation had given him complete confidence.

It wasn't just Daoist cultivation methods—even the Sword Dao was enhanced.

With his current powerful physique from cultivating the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art, a slight circulation could produce endless blood. A single drop was utterly painless to him.

"But this must be kept absolutely secret. Only those closest and most loyal can receive this—it cannot be used on a large scale." Su Yun reminded himself internally.

"As my realm improves dramatically, the mysteries contained within my blood will become even more profound, and the enhancement effect on powerhouses will be even greater."

"No matter what, improving my own strength is the priority."

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved. He glanced at An Ruoyi within the Qiankun Cauldron. After merging with this half-step Strongest Divine Spirit who cultivated the Celestial Maiden Scripture, he had gained tremendous benefits. But with the great battle imminent, he had been suppressing the violent surge of power within his body.

One should know that the reason Celestial Maiden Sect disciples were so coveted—even knowing they would merely become vessels for releasing worldly attachments—was because that single union, combined with their Celestial Maiden Scripture, could bring enormous benefits to their partner.

Let alone An Ruoyi. Having reached half-step Strongest Divine Spirit before releasing her worldly attachments, the yin energy accumulated within her body was unprecedented in the Celestial Maiden Sect's history.

Moreover, because she hadn't severed her worldly attachments but had instead placed them entirely on Su Yun, these benefits had been amplified to the maximum.

In the original story, the protagonist Ye Ling, through that one illicit encounter with An Ruoyi—even though she had chosen to sever her worldly attachments—had used the opportunity to ignite his divine fire and achieve the Divine Spirit realm.

Su Yun was quite looking forward to just how enormous his own benefits would be.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

Suddenly, the Mountains and Rivers Profound Palace manifested above Su Yun's head—a massive palace of 900,000 zhang that filled the entire underground palace, even extending into the endless void.

Within it, spirit herbs grew everywhere. Ancient trees could occasionally be seen towering high, spirit flowers blooming, filled with vigorous vitality.

*Hiss, hiss!*

True Feather Divine Spirit and Su Jian simultaneously drew in a sharp breath, horrified beyond words.

A full 900,000 zhang—this wasn't even a Profound Palace anymore; it could be called a small world.

Even geniuses as stunning as themselves, looking across all of Blue Star as peak prodigies of their era, had only managed 600,000 to 700,000 zhang at the Profound Palace Realm.

Profound Palace Realm ultimate—990,000 zhang—had never been achieved by anyone on Blue Star. It was a true legend.

Even among the top ten super races, none had reached it.

A 900,000-zhang Profound Palace was a once-in-several-centuries supreme genius even among the God Race or Demon Race.

Legend had it that the current God Race Emperor had shocked all of Blue Star by reaching 910,000 zhang at the Profound Palace Realm.

And now, the God Emperor was one of the strongest existences on Blue Star.

"Could the Young Master actually reach the ultimate of Profound Palace Realm?" Su Jian murmured, his voice shocked yet filled with anticipation.

After all, the Young Master had already accomplished too many impossible things.

And at this moment, chaotic essence radiated from Su Yun's body. His qi and blood circulated frantically, like mountains collapsing and seas surging. One could see an enormous yin energy within his body being rapidly assimilated and absorbed by his circulating qi and blood.

*Boom, boom, boom...*

In this moment, the 900,000-zhang Profound Palace began a frenzied expansion. After all, at this level, each tiny expansion required difficulty increasing by thousands or tens of thousands of times.

910,000 zhang, 920,000 zhang, 930,000 zhang...

960,000 zhang.
