Chapter 109: Great News

After Su Yun's words fell, the scene remained utterly silent. Not a sound could be heard except for the heavy breathing of the Xuanyuan family's important figures, revealing the intense conflict in their hearts.

No one was a fool.

Su Yun's words were merely giving them a way to save face.

Letting Xuanyuan Jian return to the Xuanyuan family and take the Young Master Token—but in reality, wasn't Xuanyuan Jian still Su Yun's woman?

Forcing Xuanyuan Ze to surrender the Patriarch Token and removing the heir was unprecedented and utterly humiliating, but at least the power still circulated within the Xuanyuan family.

Making Xuanyuan Jian the heir was equivalent to truly handing power over to the Su family, giving Su Yun a legitimate opportunity to meddle in the Xuanyuan family's internal affairs.

This was the Xuanyuan family's greatest failure.

Yet under Su Yun's indifferent gaze and the intimidation of the Su family's Eighteen Battalions, even though they understood this in their hearts, not a single person dared stand up to represent the Xuanyuan family and berate Su Yun, to denounce his wolfish ambitions.

The Imperial Capital was suffocating. Countless eyes were fixed on the Xuanyuan family's important figures.

Each of these people had once been influential figures that all of China looked up to. A single stomp of their feet would make the Imperial Capital tremble.

But now, facing Su Yun's relentless pressure, not one of them dared stand up to resist. Some of them even had ambiguous relationships with the Su family.

"Even Xuanyuan Chong is Su Yun's man. His alternate councilman position was bestowed by the Su family." An ancient Saint sighed.

Those who dared to openly criticize Su Yun—the patriarch and heir—had already been stripped of their power by their combined efforts, or removed from their positions.

The rest of these people thought first of how to protect themselves, and only second about the Xuanyuan family's overall interests.

Right now, there was simply no one in the Xuanyuan family who could suppress them and unite them into a single force.

The Xuanyuan family's decline was inevitable.

"Why is no one speaking? Was there something wrong with this Young Master's proposal?"

Su Yun's voice carried a hint of amusement as he said lightly: "If there's something wrong, everyone here is this Young Master's elder. You may offer your opinions or object.

"Please, speak freely."

"Ha ha ha, Young Master Su Yun is magnanimous!" Xuanyuan Chong laughed, cupping his fists toward Su Yun in respect. "I believe having Xuanyuan Jian temporarily hold the Young Master Token is entirely appropriate. Not only will it deepen the bond between our two families, but Xuanyuan Jian can also summon the power of the clan-protecting divine weapon to stabilize the family's heritage. It's the perfect solution.

"What does everyone think?"

At these words, the scene remained utterly silent. Only a handful of Xuanyuan family direct-line members spoke up in agreement, endorsing Xuanyuan Chong's words and expressing admiration for Su Yun.

With the Su family's Eighteen Battalions watching like tigers, with the ancient divine weapon Chaos Bell's presence looming, with even the current most powerful figure in the Xuanyuan family, Xuanyuan Chong, having to defer to Su Yun—

One wrong word meant death.

Under such circumstances, who would dare speak freely?

Seeing that the scene remained silent, Su Yun's gaze gradually turned cold as a dense killing intent flashed through.

It seemed that without killing a chicken to frighten the monkeys, pushing through the decision to make Xuanyuan Jian the heir within the Xuanyuan family would be very difficult.

He had no intention of dragging this out further, lest complications arise.

But at that moment, an excited cheer came from the void, breaking the silence.

"Young Master! Good news! Good news! The best possible news!"

The next second, Yun Ran stepped out from the void, her face flushed with lingering excitement that wouldn't fade.

A smile appeared on Su Yun's face. "Ran'er, what good news has you so excited?"

"Reporting to the Young Master—the Patriarch, the Patriarch..." Yun Ran was so excited she couldn't speak coherently.

"Don't rush. Take your time," Su Yun said with a smile.

"Young Master, the Patriarch has sent military intelligence from the Americas! First battle victorious! The Patriarch led a million-strong army and defeated a million Barbarian Tribe alliance soldiers, beheading three hundred thousand! One of the Barbarian Tribe's strongest Divine Spirits—the Heavenly Barbarian War God—was severely wounded and captured alive by the Patriarch!"

Yun Ran was excited beyond measure, gesticulating as she spoke: "The entire Azure Federation is shaken!"

Immediately, a cold gleam flashed in Su Yun's eyes as he said gravely: "Is this information accurate?"

"Young Master, the information is absolutely accurate. It was urgent news sent back by the Madam from the Qin family," Yun Ran said, her exquisite face flushed red with excitement. "It was just brought back by the Qin family patriarch, who recently became an alternate councilman, upon his return from the Federation.

"Right now, only the councilmen and alternate councilmen meeting in the Federation know. Soon it will spread throughout the entire human race.

"Young Master, this is a great victory! A great victory!

"This is the first time the human race has triumphed over the ancient myriad races in battle, conquering cities and seizing territory! The Patriarch has already occupied one-fifth of the Americas' landmass and is currently regrouping for the next campaign!

"Not just the human race—all of the ancient myriad races are shaken! The Su family's reputation has rocked the entire Azure Star!

"The Supreme Council's councilmen are discussing conferring the title of Human Race War God upon the Patriarch, and additionally deploying five hundred thousand of the most elite troops under the Patriarch's command to continue the campaign against the Barbarian Tribe and bring glory to the human race!"

"Father, well done!" Su Yun immediately burst into laughter, his voice shaking the heavens as sound waves rolled and clouds churned.

He had never imagined that his arrival would cause such an enormous butterfly effect.

This news had never existed in the original story.

Perhaps it was because he hadn't died at the hands of the protagonist Ye Ling and Liu Ting, and the Su family hadn't fallen into internal chaos, allowing Su Heng to campaign with peace of mind, conquering all before him.

No matter the era, conquering cities and seizing territory was the greatest achievement. Looking through all the dynasties of China's history, which general who could campaign against foreign tribes wasn't remembered for all of history?

Not to mention this was an era of spiritual energy resurgence, with the human race in decline and the ancient myriad races ascendant. To conquer cities and seize territory was an achievement beyond measure—enough to be remembered for eternity.

And what Su Yun cared about even more was the enormous benefits this great victory would bring to the Su family and to himself.

With such tremendous military achievements, the entire human race would be shaken. The Su family's prestige would reach unprecedented heights.

"Glory to the Patriarch! Conquering all before him! Congratulations to the Young Master! Glory to the Su family for a thousand ages!" The Five Elemental Divine Generals dropped to one knee and roared in unison, shaking the heavens.

"Glory to the Patriarch! Conquering all before him! Congratulations to the Young Master! Glory to the Su family for a thousand ages!"

Following them, all eighteen divine generals dismounted from their divine war chariots and knelt, roaring together, churning the winds and clouds.

Then, one hundred and eighty thousand warriors raised their massive spears in unison and bellowed as one: "Glory to the Patriarch! Conquering all before him! Congratulations to the Young Master! Glory to the Su family for a thousand ages!"

This was supreme glory. Every member of the Su family felt boundless pride, their faces shining with honor.

For over a thousand years since the resurgence of spiritual energy, the human race had always been on the defensive.

This was the first time the human race had launched a counterattack—and achieved a resounding victory. Su Heng had even captured one of the Barbarian Tribe's strongest Divine Spirits alive.

At this moment, the entire Imperial Capital fell into stunned silence.

Countless powerhouses stared slack-jawed, their bodies trembling as they listened.

Campaigning against the Barbarian Tribe. Achieving a great victory. Defeating a million Barbarians and beheading three hundred thousand. Capturing a Barbarian strongest Divine Spirit alive.
