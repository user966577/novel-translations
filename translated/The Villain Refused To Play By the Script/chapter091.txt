Chapter 91: Together With You

"Hahaha, how interesting."

Su Yun laughed. "So the dignified Kunlun Daoist Sect sends the elders out after the youngsters get beaten?"

"Very well. I'll give the Kunlun Divine Spirit some small face. You can take Dao Yuan away right now."

"A mere Divine Profound realm cultivator isn't of much use to me anyway."

At these words, everyone was dumbstruck, shocked by Su Yun's domineering attitude.

This was a prodigy with ninety-eight dragon power at the Divine Profound realm. Though his dao heart had shattered, his future was still limitless.

And Su Yun said he wasn't of much use?

These words dealt another massive blow to Dao Yuan, who had just resolved to honor his commitment and pledge loyalty to Su Yun. He suddenly vomited a huge mouthful of blood and plummeted from the sky, crashing heavily to the ground and sending up a cloud of dust.

"I'm utterly humiliated!"

"Master, if I return with you, what meaning would there be in living? To be a laughingstock for my fellow disciples?"

"Your disciple was raised by your own hands. Please end my life."

Dao Yuan's hoarse roar exploded from within the dust, filled with despair. His dao heart had completely shattered.

"Dao Yuan, you..."

"Forget it, forget it. Young Master Su Yun, well played."

"From today forward, Dao Yuan, you are no longer the Kunlun Daoist Sect's Dao Child. However, you remain my disciple and can return to the sect at any time."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit sighed, finally understanding that the Daoist sects had completely lost a disciple with unlimited potential.

But this had been tacitly permitted by him. He couldn't blame anyone.

Let alone the fact that Dao Yuan had sought out Su Yun on his own initiative.

His words were also a form of compensation for his disciple, alleviating some of his guilt. As long as Dao Yuan remained a sect disciple, he would still have some value to Su Yun.

As long as Dao Yuan was useful, it would be tremendously helpful for obtaining the Innate Dao Body and the Kunlun Mirror.

At that moment, Dao Yuan's hoarse voice emerged from the dust again. "Master, your disciple is a sinner to the sect. The matter of the Innate Dao Body and the Kunlun Mirror has already spread. Please be on guard against the Celestial Maiden Sect and Lingxiao Sect interfering."

However, he didn't reveal that the entire situation had been orchestrated by Su Yun, who had used him to expose everything. He seemed to have already embraced his role as Su Yun's servant, completely loyal.

Su Yun's lips curved slightly. This Dao Yuan was interesting.

Indeed, someone with such strong self-esteem and intelligence was extremely difficult to control.

But once he pledged loyalty, he would never betray.

"Dao Yuan, you..."

In an instant, the Kunlun Divine Spirit's gaze darkened, seemingly harboring rolling fury.

Losing Dao Yuan was still within an acceptable range—after all, the Innate Dao Body and Kunlun Mirror were right before his eyes.

But having this matter exposed was completely unacceptable.

"Young Master Su Yun, I wonder if your agreement with Junior Sister True Feather still stands," the Kunlun Divine Spirit suddenly said to Su Yun.

Su Yun's gaze was cold. His lips curved as he nodded. "Naturally it stands. As long as True Feather Divine Spirit accompanies me for three days, Li Yi will be released, my personal guard can join the Kunlun Daoist Sect, and the Kunlun Mirror will be lent to you."

"But don't forget—tomorrow is the deadline."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's gaze became profound. He immediately understood the urgency of the situation. Without even looking at his disciple again, he nodded. "Young Master Su Yun, you're straightforward."

With that, his projection immediately vanished from the sky.

Dao Yuan's eyes dimmed with despair as he closed them. He was a sinner to the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

Events had ultimately developed in the direction he least wanted to see.

And it was because of him that things had been pushed forward so significantly.

At this moment, the entire scene fell into suffocating silence. Everyone stared dumbly at Su Yun in the sky.

The Kunlun Divine Spirit hadn't made any promises in the end.

But by now, who couldn't see that the Kunlun Divine Spirit had agreed to have his Junior Sister True Feather accompany Su Yun for three days—possibly even tonight or tomorrow?

Because news would soon reach the Celestial Maiden Sect and Lingxiao Sect, putting him under immense pressure.

After all, the Innate Dao Body and Kunlun Mirror were simply too important.

But no one had forgotten that all of this had been exposed by Su Yun using Dao Yuan, yet Dao Yuan had voluntarily taken all the blame.

Su Yun had calculated everything.

And in the end, he had lost nothing.

"Hahahaha, the Young Master is mighty!" Su Hong laughed heartily, his voice like a great bell shaking the heavens.

Su Lie smiled. "True Feather Divine Spirit is known as the Daoist Sect's Divine Maiden, famed for her purity. She has countless admirers. Rumor has it that even one of the strongest Divine Spirits from the Western Gods' Mountain once expressed his love for her."

"Three days of service from the Daoist Sect's Divine Maiden—the Su family's reputation will surely shake the entire world of reclusive sects."

"Hahaha, those bastards always act so aloof and above it all. I've been annoyed by them for ages."

...

The Su family's important figures laughed heartily, all smiles. Even those direct-line powerhouses who had been stripped of their authority by Su Yun's iron-fisted methods felt honored.

Through this engagement ceremony, Su Yun had completely won them over with his superb maneuvering.

After all, the Su family had been passed down for over a thousand years, competing with the Xuanyuan family for just as long, yet never had anyone conquered the Xuanyuan family or made their powerhouses submit.

Now it seemed that, barring any major surprises, the hope of absorbing the Xuanyuan family had appeared.

This was an enormous benefit.

They could already envision the Su family taking another step up, becoming a colossus unprecedented in China.

"Everyone, enjoy the food and drink. Jian'er and I will take our leave."

Su Yun smiled slightly, then stepped into a spatial rift with Xuanyuan Jian, gradually disappearing under everyone's shocked gazes.

At that moment, Xuanyuan Jian suddenly leaned close to Su Yun's ear and said, "Su Yun, if you want, I can join True Feather Divine Spirit."

Su Yun was momentarily stunned. He turned to look at Xuanyuan Jian, whose face was slightly flushed, then laughed heartily and wrapped an arm around her fragrant shoulder, leading her into the villa.

He naturally didn't think Xuanyuan Jian was jealous.

Such arrangements were all too common in great families.

The difference between a concubine and a principal wife was like heaven and earth.

Xuanyuan Jian's eyes were bright, her lips curved in a smile.

Having lacked a sense of security since childhood, she felt an unprecedented sense of solidity for the first time.

The stronger and more domineering Su Yun's methods were, the more she adored him.

Being able to conquer True Feather Divine Spirit—there weren't many men in the entire world who could accomplish that.

...
