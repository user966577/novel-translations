Chapter 131: Two Choices

"Duanmu Lei, Athena—I was deceived by you!" Qin Ying roared hoarsely, his face flushed, his eyes filled with despair.

"They didn't deceive you. You deceived yourself with your own ambition."

Su Yun sneered: "You saw Father leave and obtained the alternate council seat, so you assumed you could borrow the power of Mount Olympus and the Duanmu family, combined with my mother Qin Junhua's influence within the Su family, to overthrow us.

I'll admit, Uncle—you have guts. Your calculations were precise, and you struck decisively.

Unfortunately, you never understood your true position. You were nothing more than a pawn that could be discarded at any moment.

To the Su family, you were a slightly larger pawn. But to Athena and Duanmu Lei? You didn't even qualify as a pawn—at best, a foot soldier to be abandoned whenever convenient."

*Boom... Boom...*

At that moment, ancient war chariots thundered across the sky, their roar earth-shaking. A thick scent of blood surged toward Qin City, rolling like a crimson tide.

The Su family headquarters' Thirteen Great Battalions had arrived at the walls of the war city.

One hundred thirty thousand warriors. One hundred thirty thousand ancient war chariots. Their combined killing intent merged into a single point, murderous aura piercing the heavens.

Every warrior was drenched in blood, their weapons stained crimson.

Behind them lay countless corpses, piled high as mountains.

It was impossible to imagine how many Qin family warriors and powerhouses had fallen to them along the way.

"Qin family! Open the city gates, release the Young Master—or we'll slaughter the city!" The ancient Thunder God General's voice rang out.

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*

This generation's Thunder God General commanded a divine spirit war chariot, using ten thousand warriors as formation lines. He stood in the firmament, summoning rolling divine thunder that bombarded Qin City's war fortress, shattering it piece by piece.

*Hum... Hum... Hum...*

The next moment, all thirteen battalions, led by their Divine Generals, deployed formation patterns and bombarded the war city.

Thunder roared across the heavens. Wind and rain swept through the firmament. Rolling divine might permeated everything.

Thirteen ancient Divine Generals attacked simultaneously, crushing the sky itself. The war city trembled violently, on the verge of collapse.

In mere moments, this fortress that had stood for over a thousand years—blessed by generations of Qin family Divine Spirits—shook continuously. Massive cracks appeared across the walls.

Countless formation patterns directly shattered and broke apart.

"Open the gates! Open the gates!"

"Slaughter the city! Slaughter the city!"

One hundred thirty thousand warriors roared in unison, their voices rolling like a tsunami, shaking the heavens.

At this moment, the Qin family's main branch powerhouses within the war city trembled from head to toe. Some were so terrified they burst into tears.

No one doubted whether the war city would be breached.

No one doubted whether the Thirteen Great Battalions would actually slaughter the city.

Because the Su family headquarters' Eighteen Great Battalions had built their reputation through bloody achievements. Every few years, they would rotate through the Myriad Races Battlefield for training, experiencing true blood and fire.

Countless ancient clans had fallen beneath their war chariots.

"Patriarch, please open the gates!"

"The Qin family's resistance is meaningless now!"

"Do you really want to watch as the Qin family is pushed to destruction, as countless clansmen are slaughtered and their corpses pile into mountains, before you're satisfied?!"

Many Qin family direct descendants roared, their voices bloody with grief.

At this moment, many of the Qin family's heritage powerhouses quietly shifted their positions, changing from surrounding Su Yun to surrounding Qin Ying instead. Their ancient eyes were filled with killing intent.

From beginning to end, after these heritage powerhouses had emerged, they hadn't even had a chance to attack Su Yun.

Everything had reversed too quickly.

The Patriarch Token was in Qin Ying's hands. Only he could stop the war city's awakening.

Countless gazes and terrifying killing intent—pressure pushed to the extreme—all converged on Qin Ying.

The war city wouldn't last much longer. It could be breached at any moment. There wasn't much time left for Qin Ying to hesitate.

"Su Yun, Uncle knows he was wrong now. My ambition was too great." Qin Ying's voice was suddenly hoarse as he spoke: "Spare me, spare the Qin family. I promise to turn over a new leaf. After this, I'll immediately order the conscription of one hundred thousand troops from Qin Province. The Qin family will spare no cost to fully support Brother-in-law's campaign against the Barbarian Tribes."

"Destroying the Qin family won't benefit you at all."

Su Yun's gaze was indifferent, his expression detached: "Do you know what I hate most, dear Uncle?"

"Traitors!"

"For traitors, my method has always been death by a thousand cuts."

"You are no exception."

Su Yun's eyes were utterly cold, devoid of emotion. His voice seemed to carry the scent of blood: "You have only two choices now.

First, the war city falls, the Qin family is slaughtered to the last person, and you die by a thousand cuts at my hands.

Second, you open the war city gates yourself. For Mother's sake, I won't exterminate the Qin family to the ninth degree of kinship—I'll only purge a batch of traitors. But you will still be executed by a thousand cuts before the entire Qin family."

"I'll give you one minute to decide."

"Hahahaha! Worthy of being my grandson!" Su Zhan laughed heartily, his voice shaking the heavens, making the entire war city tremble madly and crumble even faster. "This decisiveness—I like it.

When dealing with traitors, it should be clan extermination, death by a thousand cuts. To hell with soft-heartedness and sentimentality! The ruler of my Su family doesn't need such things."

At this moment, Qin Ying's face went deathly pale. His entire body trembled with terror.

Su Yun's words were like a sharp blade, stabbing ruthlessly into his heart.

"Su—Su Yun, I'm your blood uncle. Blood is thicker than water." Qin Ying's voice trembled.

Su Yun's gaze was indifferent. He slowly closed his eyes: "Twenty seconds have passed. You have forty seconds left to consider."

"Junhua, save me!" Qin Ying's eyes were filled with terror as he turned to look at Qin Junhua.

Qin Junhua bit her lip, unable to bear it. But after taking a deep breath, she spoke coldly: "Qin Ying, I told you—we've already severed all ties.

Furthermore, I am first the Su family's matriarch, Yun'er's mother, Su Heng's wife. Only then am I a person of the Qin family.

Let me advise you: don't become the Qin family's eternal sinner."

Her cold words echoed in the air.

Qin Ying's face went pale to the extreme. Under countless gazes, his entire body trembled.

He understood what Qin Junhua meant. He also couldn't influence Su Yun's decision.

In other words, the one who truly held power in the Su family now was Su Yun.

Then who else could he turn to for help?

Time flowed by, second by second. The thundering roar was deafening. Every moment, Qin City's war fortress crumbled further.

At this moment, many Qin family direct descendants and heritage powerhouses had closed in to within ten meters of Qin Ying. Their eyes were cold, murderous intent on full display.

Several ancient Divine Spirits had already quietly taken control of the Dragon Banner, cutting off any possibility of Qin Ying's desperate counterattack.
