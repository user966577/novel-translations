Qin Ying's manic voice echoed across the heavens, filled with hysteria.

"What does the Su family matter? Behind me stands the Duanmu family and Mount Olympus in the West! Combined, they're countless times more powerful than the Su family! They've already promised me they'll protect the Qin family and never stand by while the Su family attacks us!"

"I command you all—spare no cost to capture Su Yun and get that Ancient Divine Weapon! Then we wait for reinforcements from the Duanmu family and Mount Olympus!"

Yet when his words fell, the scene remained deathly silent. The ancient powerhouses who had emerged from the heritage watched with lowered, clouded eyes.

The current generation of direct descendants stared toward the distant heavens with horrified gazes—toward the skies beyond the battle fortress, thousands of miles away.

Faintly, the sounds of battle cries and screams of agony were piercing through the void into their ears.

Surging murderous aura, overwhelming and earth-shaking, rolled toward them from the horizon.

Tumbling dark clouds filled with ancient war chariots.

Thirteen Su family Divine Generals—the Wind God General, Thunder God General, Lightning God General... They drove their divine war chariots, standing in the heavens, looking down at the battle fortress.

These weren't the current generation of the eighteen battalion Divine Generals. They were from the old generation, or even more ancient eras.

Every one of them had an aged face, yet their eyes showed not the slightest cloudiness. Instead, they blazed with terrifying murderous aura, divine might rolling across the sky.

Among them, several had even reached the level of half-step Supreme Divine Spirit.

"The retired Divine Generals from the Su family headquarters' eighteen battalions." A Qin family direct descendant's voice trembled.

Everyone present gazed on with eyes full of terror.

Su Yun hadn't just brought the thirteen battalions that guarded the headquarters—he had even summoned the ancient Divine Generals from the Su family's heritage.

The eighteen battalions of the Su family headquarters had been passed down for over a thousand years. Every generation's Divine General was handpicked from among prodigies, possessing at minimum the aptitude to ignite divine fire—and all were tempered through blood and fire on the battlefields against the myriad races, having walked between life and death.

Every single one possessed terrifying combat power.

"Ancient Divine Weapon. Thirteen battalions. Ancient Divine Generals." Someone muttered, voice quivering.

"Su Yun means to settle the Qin family as quickly as possible."

"I just want to know—what exactly did Patriarch Qin Ying do? Weren't the Qin and Su families supposed to be on good terms?"

This question echoed in the minds of everyone present.

The Su family army had already invaded Qin Province, now barely a thousand miles away, moving with terrifying speed.

Qin Ying had given his orders.

But their hearts were filled with despair.

That was an Ancient Divine Weapon, being channeled by four Divine Spirits—one of them a half-step Supreme Divine Spirit.

With Su Yun under their protection, how could they possibly break through?

More importantly, perhaps in the next moment, the Su family army could arrive at the battle fortress's walls with lightning speed.

Attacked from inside and out, facing such overwhelming force—how long could the Qin family's battle fortress hold?

And once the thirteen battalions reached them, the Su family headquarters would certainly know about it too.

The young master and matriarch had been detained by the Qin family in their battle fortress.

They couldn't imagine what kind of fury the Su family headquarters must be experiencing right now—or what response they would mount.

It probably wouldn't be long before a massive wave of Divine Spirits and half-step Supreme Divine Spirits from the Su family headquarters would descend upon them.

What could the Qin family possibly use to resist?

They were on the verge of despair.

Just moments ago, everything had been fine. They had been celebrating Su Heng's great victory over the Barbarian Tribes. Who could have guessed that the next moment, the Qin family would be facing the Su family's iron fist?

"Is now really the time to be explaining all this? You need only understand that everything I've done has been for the good of the Qin family."

Qin Ying's face was ashen as he roared: "Right now, aside from listening to my orders and capturing Su Yun as fast as possible, you have no other choice!"

"I'm an alternate Council member. No one would dare kill me."

"But once the Su family breaks through the battle fortress, your fates will be a hundred times, a thousand times worse than mine!"

"Kill!"

After those words, Qin Ying let out a low roar. Without further explanation, he directly drove the battle fortress and Dragon-Patterned Battle Standard, launching the supreme dragon soul in an attack toward Su Yun.

He had to admit—he too was a ruthless man.

He made decisions in an instant.

He didn't even bother responding to the many questions from his fellow direct descendants, because he believed none of them were fools. They would figure out soon enough.

"Obstinate fool!"

Su Yun let out a cold laugh, his detached gaze turning toward the direction of the Imperial Capital.

The reason he had waited this long was precisely to see whether everyone in the Qin family was as deranged as Qin Ying—whether they had all betrayed the Su family.

Now it seemed most of the Qin family had no intention of betraying them. They had simply been dragged along by their patriarch.

That made things much simpler.

He just needed to crush the Qin family in one decisive blow, making them understand the vast gulf between themselves and the Su family. Then they would naturally submit.

And right at that moment, a supreme divine might descended from the heavens. An enormous, ancient face slowly coalesced, its gaze cold and detached, its aura domineering to the extreme.

"Hmph!"

The giant ancient face let out a cold snort. The supreme dragon soul instantly shattered. Endless formation runes crumbled. The entire battle fortress shook violently.

"A Strongest Divine Spirit!" Qin Ying roared, his pupils contracting sharply.

"Impossible! Isn't Su Heng supposed to be in the Americas? How can the Su family have another hidden Strongest Divine Spirit?!"

"Strongest Divine Spirits can't be sealed away. When they reach the three-hundred-year limit in their later years, their only option is to venture into the starry cosmos to seek a breakthrough."

"You're Su Zhan!" Just then, one of the ancient Divine Spirits from the Qin family heritage cried out in shock, recognizing the face.

In an instant, the entire scene fell silent. All the Qin family direct descendants' bodies went rigid.

"Su Zhan—isn't that the previous Su family patriarch, Su Heng's father?"

"Legend has it that Su Zhan reached his three-hundred-year limit, and after Su Yong was killed, he lost heart and ventured into the starry cosmos seeking a breakthrough."

"Su Zhan! A Strongest Divine Spirit! A terrifying existence who once fought against a Supreme Divine Spirit of the God Race!"

...

They growled in low voices, staring at the ancient face, their bodies rigid, terror etched to the extreme.

The legends of Su Zhan were too numerous. Their entire generation had practically grown up listening to tales of Su Zhan.

"Su Zhan—how is this possible?!" Qin Ying stood frozen in place.
