Chapter 154: The Courtesan Battalion

"Did you hear? Prince Mo Yu said I shouldn't harm a single hair on your head."

Su Yun's voice was low, harboring endless coldness, making Mingyu's expression turn deathly pale in an instant.

It was over. Everything was over.

Her heart was filled with deep regret. She shouldn't have put on that final performance in front of Mo Yu, expressing that she had betrayed the sect for his sake, trying to raise her status in his heart.

"You've ruined everything I had. Su Yun, I'll kill you."

Mingyu shouted in rage and carelessly tossed aside the Qiankun Cauldron. She already understood that before An Ruoyi, who had achieved Strongest Divine Spirit, she couldn't possibly control the Sect Master Token anymore.

"Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers."

*Hum!* A Celestial Maiden's Profound Palace manifested above Mingyu's head—a massive palace nearly 600,000 zhang tall that almost filled the entire sky. Endless blood-red flowers cascaded from within, containing infinite killing intent. Beautiful yet harboring rolling danger, they enveloped Su Yun.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

Suddenly, the blood-red flowers pierced through the heavens, charging at Su Yun sharper than arrows, tearing through the firmament.

An Ruoyi and True Feather Divine Spirit stood to the side, calmly watching this scene.

Only the two of them understood just how powerful Su Yun was at the Profound Palace Realm.

At least at the same cultivation level, as top geniuses of the previous era, neither of them could possibly withstand a single move from Su Yun.

"Beautiful flowers."

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved slightly. He didn't make the slightest attempt to resist, simply allowing the flowers to bombard him.

*Bang, bang, bang...*

Dense collision sounds echoed through the firmament, like metal clashing. The endless flowers couldn't even get within a centimeter of Su Yun's body before being naturally shattered by the aura around him, dissolving into nothingness.

The next moment, Su Yun's body suddenly vanished from the sky, his form flashing past.

*Rip!*

The sound of tearing cloth made everyone's skin crawl.

When Su Yun reappeared, he was already behind Mingyu, holding a strip of her snow-white dress in his hand.

"The Demon Race prince told me not to harm a single hair on your head. Naturally, I must give him that courtesy—I'll only tear your clothes." Su Yun spoke indifferently, casually tossing aside the torn fabric.

Behind him, Mingyu stood frozen in place, her veil having disappeared, revealing her fair and lovely features.

At this moment, she only felt an icy cold sensation on her upper body.

Her dress had already been torn apart by Su Yun, revealing most of her body.

And all around, who knew how many sect disciples were watching this scene.

In an instant, Mingyu's face flushed crimson, and she let out a shriek.

As the sect's Holy Maiden, An Ruoyi's sole disciple, when had she ever suffered such humiliation?

"Bastard!"

From within the sea of thunder, Mo Yu's voice came mixed with endless pain, a heart-rending roar.

The woman he loved most was being humiliated like this.

"Su Yun, I'm going to kill you." Mingyu's scream was shrill, filled with endless venom. The 600,000-zhang Profound Palace merged into her palm as she turned, using her hand as a blade to slash at Su Yun's head.

"Overestimating yourself!"

Su Yun turned, chaotic light swirling around his hand as he caught Mingyu's palm—as easily as if he were grasping an ordinary woman's hand—and gave it a light twist.

*Crack!*

Instantly, Mingyu let out an extremely painful scream as Su Yun snapped her hand bones, bending them into an inverted triangle.

*Rip!*

The next moment, she only felt her body turn ice-cold.

The remaining clothes on her body had all been torn away.

Only her undergarments remained.

"I'm really quite curious what makes a woman like you capable of making a Demon Race prince so infatuated." Su Yun's gaze was indifferent as it swept over Mingyu's body, no ripple of emotion in his eyes.

Though Mingyu was rather attractive, a top beauty even in the Celestial Maiden Sect known for its beautiful women, it depended on who she was compared to.

Before An Ruoyi and True Feather Divine Spirit, she wasn't worth looking at—let alone compared to women like Xuanyuan Jian and Su Yayue.

No wonder in the original story, the protagonist Ye Ling had slept with An Ruoyi, taken Su Yayue, and shared mutual affection with Xuanyuan Jian, yet had shown not the slightest interest in this Celestial Maiden Sect Holy Maiden. Instead, he had given her to Mo Yu in exchange for Mo Yu's gratitude.

"I'll tear you to pieces and cast you into the Demonic Abyss to be devoured by a hundred million demon souls." Mo Yu howled miserably.

Mingyu's face had already gone from flushed to deathly pale.

She simply couldn't imagine what she would face next.

Mo Yu was right beside her!

Hearing Mo Yu's voice, Su Yun smiled coldly and casually snapped Mingyu's other arm: *Crack!*

"Su Yun, what exactly do you want? If you're going to kill me, just kill me. Why humiliate this prince so?" Mo Yu roared, his voice already carrying a tearing quality.

Having his most beloved woman tortured and humiliated right before his eyes—his mind was nearly broken.

"Yu'er, take her away and send her to the Courtesan Battalion. Let her comfort the troops. I'm sure those hungry men in the army never dreamed they'd get to touch the Celestial Maiden Sect's Holy Maiden in their lifetime." Su Yun waved his hand coldly.

As for Holy Maiden Mingyu, he naturally disdained to touch her himself. A woman who'd been touched by the Demon Race—he considered her filthy.

He wanted to see just how long this pair of lovers could maintain their dignity.

He would completely break their final psychological defenses.

"The Courtesan Battalion."

In an instant, even An Ruoyi's face paled slightly. Mingyu was, after all, her most beloved disciple. Though she'd been betrayed, she still couldn't bear to see her suffer such humiliation.

The Courtesan Battalion was modeled after the ancient Chinese dynasty's Imperial Music Bureau, created by the Su family for the army's use.

After the Su family's campaigns against the myriad races, women—whether noblewomen or females from places the Su family had exterminated—were all sent to the Courtesan Battalion.

They would serve the Su family's army until they died of old age within.
