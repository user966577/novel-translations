Chapter 49: Strength Greatly Increased

"All of you, shut up! I am a Su family man in life and a Su family ghost in death! If anyone dares mention rebellion again, I will kill them myself!"

Su Lie roared, silencing everyone below. His eyes were bloodshot.

"Boom!"

His Saint's might erupted suddenly, turning the faces of those below deathly pale. Not a single one dared speak another word.

"Without my command, no one is permitted to take a single step outside the manor. Violators will be executed without mercy."

Having said this, Su Lie's eyes were crimson—he actually wept tears of blood. Then he slowly closed his eyes, his heart filled with endless regret.

But only he truly understood.

He had no ability to rebel whatsoever.

In fact, the only reason he had been granted the title of Federation Heavenly King or become Vice Chairman of the Military Joint Chiefs of Staff was because he was a direct descendant of the Su family.

Otherwise, forget the entire human race—even within the Imperial Capital alone, hidden dragons and crouching tigers abounded. Saints emerged one after another, many of them stronger than him, with greater military achievements. Yet none of them had received the Heavenly King title.

Why?

Because he was a direct descendant of the Su family.

As long as Su Heng lived, as long as he remained a council member, which person in the Federation would dare meddle in the Su family's internal affairs?

Su Lie was absolutely certain that the moment he contacted those former generals, that would be when they became bitter enemies.

"Who could have imagined that Su Yun would be even more vicious, even more insane and forceful than Qin Junhua? He actually mobilized the Five Elemental Divine Battalions into the Imperial Capital without the slightest concern for the consequences."

Su Lie laughed bitterly.

He understood that he absolutely could not take a single step outside the manor.

Su Yun wanted to use him to establish his authority, and he had to serve as that stepping stone—obediently letting Su Yun trample over him.

He could only watch helplessly as his daughter died.

He believed in his daughter. She would never confess under torture.

...

Time flowed. Six days had passed.

Outside Su Yun's residence, Yun Ran's respectful voice rang out: "Reporting to Young Master, the Shadow Soul Guards have sent word. Ye Ling, Su Meng, and Xuanyuan Jian failed to assassinate Xuanyuan Li outside the Imperial Capital. Although Ye Ling broke through to Divine Profound Realm, he was still severely wounded by Xuanyuan Li and fell into a spatial rift. His whereabouts are unknown."

Inside the residence, Su Yun slowly opened his eyes. Twenty chaotic giant dragons above his head suddenly dispersed. His gaze turned toward the door, where Yun Ran and Dark Lady knelt respectfully.

He pulled up his system panel.

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit Bloodline

Realm: Divine Profound Realm [Twenty Dragons' Power]

Cultivation Method: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art

Weapon: Incomplete God-Devil Pendant [God-Devil Supreme Treasure]

Charm Value: 5,000 [Flowers Bloom at Sight, Can Communicate with All Things] [Cultivation Speed Increased Tenfold]

After six days of focused cultivation, his strength had grown from nine dragons' power to a terrifying twenty dragons' power.

In other words, one day of cultivation had increased his strength by nearly two dragons.

"As expected of the system." Su Yun murmured to himself.

Part of this was related to the powerful yin energy provided by Yun Ran's Heavenly Seduction Body during their dual cultivation. But the main factor was the enormous boost from his Charm Value's cultivation speed multiplier.

This terrifying rate of improvement was as simple as eating and drinking. If word got out, the entire human race would be shocked.

After all, one dragon's power was already the limit for ordinary people cultivating to Divine Profound Realm. The further one progressed, the more difficult it became. Increasing by even one dragon's power was as hard as ascending to heaven, the difficulty multiplying geometrically.

Yet Su Yun's gains from one day of cultivation equaled what an ordinary person couldn't achieve in an entire year.

One could imagine how terrifying this cultivation speed was. It probably wouldn't be long before Su Yun reached the limits of Divine Profound Realm.

At this thought, Su Yun's desire for Charm Value grew even stronger.

After all, the higher one's cultivation realm, the harder it became to improve. The difficulty increased a hundredfold, ten thousandfold.

If he wanted to maintain this cultivation speed, he needed Charm Value—vast amounts of Charm Value—to boost his cultivation rate.

And Su Yun had always believed that although he was the Su family's heir with supreme authority, true strength came from personal power.

Increasing his own cultivation was the greatest foundation for building his future supreme empire.

"Enter." Su Yun said calmly.

His voice merged directly into space, exploding beside Yun Ran and Dark Lady's ears. This was the enhancement from his system ability "Communicate with All Things."

He could condense his voice into a thread and send it directly into an enemy's ear.

If his strength were great enough, a single word could rupture an opponent's eardrums.

Yun Ran and Dark Lady's expressions grew solemn. They entered and bowed respectfully to Su Yun: "Reporting to Young Master, Steward Zhong followed your instructions and defected to Xuanyuan Li in advance, revealing Ye Ling and Su Meng's entire assassination plan and itinerary.

"The forces Su Yong left for Su Meng have all been killed or wounded. Those who escaped have all been eliminated by the Shadow Soul Guards."

Su Yun's lips curved. "And Su Meng himself? Is he dead?"

Yun Ran said: "Ye Ling, Su Meng, and Xuanyuan Jian joined forces against Xuanyuan Li but were still no match. At the moment of death, Ye Ling suddenly produced a mirror that shattered space. All three fell into the spatial rift and are now missing.

"Xuanyuan Li is furious. He has issued a kill order throughout the Imperial Capital and is frantically searching for the three, vowing to kill them.

"He has also sent Saint-level powerhouses to our Su family. The Matriarch personally received them. Steward Zhong presented Su Meng's plans and various pieces of evidence. The Matriarch was furious and declared that the Su family and Xuanyuan family have been friendly for a hundred years and would never assassinate the Xuanyuan heir. She personally ordered Su Meng expelled from the Su family. The Su family will fully cooperate with the Xuanyuan family in hunting him down.

"The entire Su family has been shaken. Many direct descendants have personally visited the Matriarch to plead for Su Meng and Su Ying."

"However, Young Master, we have already learned Su Meng's whereabouts. He has returned to the Imperial Capital and is secretly making his way toward the Su family." Dark Lady's expression was grave.

"Young Master, as you predicted, this battle has killed or wounded nearly all the hidden powerhouses Su Yong left for Su Meng."

Su Yun's lips curved. His gaze was cold as he sneered: "Excellent. Cousin Su Meng returns—how can I, his younger cousin, not personally go welcome him?"

At that moment, Yun Ran suddenly spoke: "By the way, Young Master, Liu Ting requests an audience. She seems to have urgent matters to report. This servant has arranged for her to wait in the side chamber. Do you wish to see her?"

"Let her wait. I must first go welcome my cousin." Su Yun spoke indifferently as he slowly rose and walked toward the Su family gates.

...

Not far from the Su family gates, in a run-down little courtyard.

"Creak, creak, creak..."

The decrepit gate was suddenly pushed open, and a tall figure in black clothes and a bamboo hat walked in, face obscured.

"Cough, cough, cough..."

After closing the courtyard gate, the tall figure seemed to have exhausted all his strength. The willpower holding him together collapsed as he suddenly coughed violently, continuously spitting up fresh blood.

This person was Su Meng, who had narrowly escaped death but was severely wounded.

When he removed his hat, Su Meng's bloodless face was revealed. His lips trembled, veins bulging on his neck as he growled:

"Steward Zhong, why did you betray me?"
