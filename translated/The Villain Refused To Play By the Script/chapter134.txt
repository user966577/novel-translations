Chapter 134: Li Shen—Cooperation?

"Damn it!"

The Pixiu Divine Spirit snarled, erupting with terrifying divine radiance that shattered the various divine arts one by one.

But at that moment, he could clearly sense the palace's surroundings—indeed, the entire war city—awakening. Terrifying divine might was reviving, stirring, while endless killing intent permeated outward.

It was as if a million elite troops were hidden within this city.

In an instant, the Pixiu's hair stood on end.

Even without a Strongest Divine Spirit present, this was absolutely a terrifying force capable of killing him where he stood.

"Stop!"

"This Venerable One understands now—you are the one truly in charge of the Su family right now."

The Pixiu was pragmatic. Seeing that he had come here not to fight the Su family, he immediately roared and voluntarily retracted his beast claw.

Su Yun's lips curved. He waved his hand, and the Qin family's heritage Divine Spirits vanished from the great hall, concealing themselves back into the void.

"Pixiu Divine Spirit, have you forgotten something?" Su Yun smiled as he rose, his gaze looking down upon the Pixiu Divine Spirit.

"Back then, you killed my uncle Su Yong—the Su family's eldest son. My Su family swore an irreconcilable blood feud against you. Father has already issued a kill order against you.

Yet now you dare come to our door.

Young Master here was just worrying about how to accomplish something major. I never expected you to deliver yourself right to me.

Killing a Pixiu Clan Strongest Divine Spirit—now that's a great achievement!"

As these words fell, the Pixiu Divine Spirit was momentarily stunned. An ominous feeling suddenly welled up in his heart.

Had he encountered a hothead?

Looking at Su Yun's appearance, so young—it wasn't impossible.

This young, right in the prime of impetuous youth, he probably didn't understand anything about exchanging interests.

If he really did kill him right here in this war city for the sake of merit, it wasn't out of the question.

"Su family's Young Master, don't be rash."

The Pixiu Divine Spirit growled. Seeing the cold light in Su Yun's eyes, he quickly said: "This Venerable One is a Strongest Divine Spirit of the Pixiu Clan—the Pixiu Venerable, Li Shen. I share deep friendship with your mother Qin Junhua.

Your entire family owes your current position partly to my great contribution—I was the one who killed Su Yong back then.

If you don't believe me, you can contact your mother Qin Junhua right now."

After saying all this, Li Shen's heart was somewhat breaking down.

Su Heng had left, and following the aura of the seal, he had tracked his way to the Qin family, wanting to have a private conversation with Qin Junhua.

But he'd never expected that the one currently wielding the Su family's power was a teenager who hadn't even grown all his hair yet.

He hadn't even seen a glimpse of Qin Junhua.

If he'd known this would be the outcome, he never would have come.

"Enough with the nonsense. Mother is in seclusion, breaking through to Strongest Divine Spirit. I can't disturb her."

Su Yun's lips curved. He clearly captured Li Shen's emotional shift. Feigning impatience, he waved his hand dismissively: "Within human territory, you dare slander my parents for colluding with wild beasts to kill my uncle? That's an even greater crime.

If I don't kill you, I'll be failing the Su family's ancestors."

Su Yun slowly raised his hand.

At these words, and seeing the killing intent flickering continuously in Su Yun's eyes, Li Shen nearly broke down. He immediately roared: "Don't be rash! This time I've come to ally with the Su family against the Barbarian Tribes!"

As his words fell, he saw Su Yun pause, the raised hand slowly lowering.

Li Shen instantly let out a breath of relief.

Having lived for centuries, this was the first time he'd ever dealt with such a greenhorn.

But even so, at least this greenhorn seemed to also control the Su family's power. To complete the mission his clan had assigned him, he had to deal with this kid.

It was too difficult!

Fortunately, this kid didn't seem completely brainless. Hearing about allying with the Su family against the Barbarian Tribes, he at least knew to stop.

But what Li Shen didn't realize was that in his unconscious assessment, he had already begun treating Su Yun as a hothead—a greenhorn who didn't understand interest exchanges. The rhythm of this conversation had already fallen under Su Yun's control.

And this was exactly the effect Su Yun wanted.

Right now, nearly all the great clans in the Human Race, even including the Western powerhouses, knew he was the one wielding the Su family's power. They knew he had some ability and were extremely wary of him.

As long as Li Shen treated him as a hothead, that wariness would disappear. Only then could the conversation proceed more smoothly.

Su Yun sneered. As if just now realizing his mistake, he spoke coldly: "You must be joking. My Su family is a great divine clan of the Human Race. How could we possibly ally with some minor beast clan to fight another barbaric tribe?"

Li Shen's smile froze. He nearly ground his teeth to dust. He truly couldn't understand how this kid who didn't know heaven's height had managed to seize the power of a great clan like the Su family. Yet this fool actually thought the Human Race was supreme and looked down on even the Pixiu Clan, speaking dismissively: "Su family's Young Master, you need to understand something. My Pixiu Clan is also a major clan ranked in the top hundred among the Ancient Myriad Races. Though we don't possess an Ancient Divine Weapon, this generation still has three Strongest Divine Spirits including this Venerable One. We're absolutely not some 'minor beast clan' as you put it.

And the Barbarian Tribes rank in the top fifty among the Ancient Myriad Races. Not only do they have several ancient Divine Spirits, they also possess an Ancient Divine Being.

Though your Su family won the first battle and defeated the Spirit Barbarian lineage, seizing their territory, that was only because you caught the Barbarian Tribes off guard.

Once the Barbarian Tribes reacted, your father's situation hasn't been easy.

As far as this Venerable One knows, quite a few council members in your Human Race's Azure Federation Supreme Council don't support the war against the Barbarian Tribes. They want your father to withdraw.

Furthermore, the God Race already knows about all of this. Regarding the Human Race's campaign against the Barbarian Tribes, they've already issued a reprimand.

Now, if you want to hold the territory you've seized, your Su family's only hope for survival is to cooperate with my Pixiu Clan.

Otherwise, whether your father and his million-strong army can even withdraw from the Americas is a serious question."

Su Yun frowned slightly, his deep gaze fixed on Li Shen: "You just said the God Race issued a reprimand to my Human Race?"

Li Shen sneered coldly. So this kid wasn't completely ignorant after all: "That's right. The God Race—one of the top ten super-clans."

"No wonder Athena made a move against my Su family." Su Yun's gaze grew detached as he murmured to himself.

In the original novel, many of the Western divine spirits had deep connections with the God Race. Quite a few human powerhouses who had obtained ancient divine spirits actually took pride in possessing God Race bloodlines.

This kind of top-level information was only known by those within the Supreme Council. If not for Li Shen's arrival, he really would have been kept in the dark.

And the God Race had always been displeased with the Human Race, wanting to make humans into a vassal clan.

If it weren't for the Human Race producing powerful individuals one after another and resisting fiercely, they would have long since been subjugated by the God Race.
