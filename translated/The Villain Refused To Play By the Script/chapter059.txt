Chapter 59: The God-Devil Pendant, Purple Heaven Palace

Everything happening in the Imperial Capital was of no concern to Su Yun at this moment. The Kunlun Mirror, this ancient supreme divine artifact, he was determined to obtain.

This was a supreme treasure capable of suppressing space and time—no less powerful than the Chaos Bell. Leaving it in Ye Ling's hands was far too wasteful.

Ye Ling's severe injuries, combined with Liu Ting's betrayal, had created this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Su Yun stood in the sky, his gaze cold, positioned before the Chaos Bell. He waved his hand: "Suppress!"

"Dong, dong, dong..."

The Chaos Bell, which suppressed the Su family's reserves, constantly absorbed infinite source stones and existed in a semi-awakened state. Its rolling bell waves directly collapsed the earth, suppressing the Kunlun Mirror.

"My Kunlun Mirror!"

Ye Ling roared, shaking mountains and rivers, his voice filled with blood and anguish—his heart was breaking.

This was the divine artifact second only to the God-Devil Pendant among his possessions, and now it had been snatched away by Su Yun. His heart was shattering.

If not for Liu Ting and Xuanyuan Jian's betrayal, how could he have fallen to this point?

"Su Yun, you stole my divine artifact, stole my women—we are sworn enemies now. It's either you or me!"

"One day, I will eat your flesh and drink your blood to avenge today's grievance."

"Kill!"

Su Yun's eyes showed no emotional fluctuation whatsoever. Murderous intent soared to the sky as he directly activated the Chaos Bell, unleashing a world-shaking strike.

This single strike could fell even a Saint.

"Ahhh!"

But at that moment, Ye Ling roared furiously. He grabbed the God-Devil Pendant at his waist and hurled it toward the Chaos Bell. Facing mortal danger, the God-Devil Pendant automatically awakened, erupting with divine energy to block this strike. Then, without any divine artifact's protection, he charged into the shattered space with his physical body alone.

In an instant, blood and flesh sprayed wildly. Wounds so deep they exposed bone appeared across Ye Ling's entire body almost instantaneously—after all, this was spatial turbulence, no place for a mere Divine Profound Realm cultivator to tread.

Before Ye Ling vanished into the spatial turbulence, one could vaguely see his blood-soaked face and his venomous, hateful eyes.

"Pursue with all your might."

Su Yun's gaze was ice-cold. He spoke: "Five Divine Generals, lead the army in pursuit. I want to see him alive or see his corpse. Even if it's just a wisp of his remnant soul, exterminate it completely."

He would never commit the mistake of being careless at the crucial moment, thinking Ye Ling was already severely wounded and casually sending a few cultivators one realm higher—at the Profound Palace Realm—to pursue him, believing that would already be overkill.

Worthy of being a Son of Destiny—even after he had deployed the Five Elemental Divine Battalions, the five Divine Generals, laid an inescapable net, and even used the Chaos Bell, he still couldn't kill Ye Ling instantly.

"Your subordinates obey!"

The Five Divine Generals immediately rode their war chariots, leading fifty thousand soldiers into the spatial turbulence. Their terrifying murderous aura instantly calmed the chaotic space.

In the heavens, the spatial vortex slowly dissipated. The Chaos Bell gradually faded as well, its terrifying divine might dispersing across this wilderness.

Yet all around, silence still reigned. Countless beast kings had been scared out of their wits. The powerful ferocious beasts within a hundred-mile radius had all been slaughtered by the Five Divine Battalions.

"The Kunlun Mirror. The God-Devil Pendant!"

Su Yun opened his hand, drawing these two ancient divine weapons into his grasp. Satisfaction gleamed in his eyes as he examined them carefully.

At the same time, the System's notification sounded.

"Congratulations, Host. You have plundered a Son of Destiny's fortune-suppressing divine weapons, altering his fate. Reward: 4,000 Charm Points."

"Congratulations, Host. You have changed a Son of Destiny's fate, devouring infinite fortune. Reward: 2,000 Charm Points."

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit Bloodline

Realm: Divine Profound Realm [Twenty Dragons of Power]

Cultivation Method: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art

Weapons: Two Fragments of the God-Devil Pendant [Divine-Demonic Supreme Treasure], Kunlun Mirror [Ancient Supreme Divine Weapon]

Divine Ability: Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes

Charm Points: 15,500 [Mountains and Rivers Pale in Comparison] [Cultivation Speed Increased 20x]

Seeing this enormous reward, even Su Yun drew a sharp breath, stunned by the bounty.

Worthy of protagonist Ye Ling.

He hadn't even been completely killed yet, and the Charm Points rewarded were nearly equal to everything he had accumulated before.

Moreover, it had brought him two ancient divine weapons.

With these two ancient divine weapons in hand, where in the world could he not go?

Even if the Five Elemental Divine Battalions failed to kill Ye Ling, this was still an enormous harvest.

"With cultivation speed increased twenty-fold, Ye Ling, even if you somehow survive, what can you possibly use to compete with me? I could crush you with one hand." Su Yun laughed coldly, cold light glinting in his eyes.

Watching Su Yun stand in mid-air, Liu Ting and Xuanyuan Jian below were almost intoxicated. They felt that mountains and rivers had completely lost their luster before Su Yun's charm—all radiance gathered upon him alone, the essence of heaven and earth concentrated in one person.

That guy Ye Ling—what right did he have to compare with Su Yun?

They could almost hear their own hearts pounding—"thump, thump, thump." Their faces were flushed, their devotion to Su Yun growing ever more complete, utterly prostrate before him.

But how could they know that this was the effect of Su Yun's Charm Points reaching the "Mountains and Rivers Pale in Comparison" level?

They were already wholly devoted to Su Yun, their minds completely open to him without the slightest resistance. They had been directly conquered in mind and spirit by Su Yun's overwhelming charm.

"The God-Devil Pendant—let me see what's so miraculous about you."

Su Yun produced the other half of the God-Devil Pendant and merged the two halves together.

"Hum!"

Instantly, the heavens were obscured by dark clouds. A beam of divine light pierced through space and time as terrifying power spread outward, connecting to some mysterious location.

The shadow of an incomparably vast palace appeared in mid-air.

On the plaque before the palace, three large characters were inscribed: Purple Heaven Palace.

This was none other than the legendary Purple Heaven Palace—the palace of Hongjun Daozu, one of China's supreme Divine Spirits.

"It's actually the legendary Purple Heaven Palace! The dojo of the supreme Divine Spirit, Hongjun Daozu!" Xuanyuan Jian cried out in terror.

"Jian'er, is Hongjun Daozu very powerful?" Liu Ting asked, puzzled.

"Powerful—terrifyingly powerful. He's one of the indisputably strongest Divine Spirits in mythology, no less powerful than the mightiest Western Divine Spirits—Zeus, Jesus, Shiva, and others. Perhaps even more powerful." Xuanyuan Jian's expression was grave as she spoke solemnly.

"Hiss!" Liu Ting drew a sharp breath.

Zeus, Jesus, Shiva—she had heard of these names countless times. These Divine Spirits all had legacies that remained in the current world, all among the most powerful forces globally.

And the strongest among their factions were members of the current Federation's Supreme Council—among the world's most powerful Divine Spirits.

"Could this jade pendant be a divine weapon left behind by Hongjun Daozu? No wonder Ye Ling was so agitated at the auction house." Liu Ting murmured to herself.

If the God-Devil Pendant was indeed a divine weapon of Hongjun Daozu, then Ye Ling's near-madness would be entirely understandable.

"But now, all of this belongs to Su Yun." A flash of pride crossed Xuanyuan Jian's eyes, because the God-Devil Pendant was now in Su Yun's hands.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

But at that moment, the instant the God-Devil Pendant merged into completion, a vast surge of divine energy poured into Su Yun's body, causing his strength to begin rising at a frantic pace.
