Chapter 63: The Unfathomable Su Heng

At these words, the hall fell instantly silent—so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

The expressions of many Xuanyuan family powerhouses suddenly became very stiff, very ugly. They looked at Xuanyuan Ze but couldn't utter a single word.

In the past, the Xuanyuan family patriarch had possessed a permanent Council member seat.

But under Xuanyuan Ze's leadership, the family had continuously declined. Not only had they lost the member seat, but now even the alternate member seat was being stripped away.

As the Xuanyuan family's patriarch, to not even have an alternate member seat—this was an enormous humiliation.

They simply couldn't imagine—if not for Su Heng's assistance in securing an alternate member seat for Xuanyuan Chong—how the world would view the Xuanyuan family.

The Xuanyuan family would become a laughingstock to the entire world.

"Su Yun, what exactly does your Su family want?"

Finally, Xuanyuan Ze erupted. His face was mottled purple with rage. His terrifying aura nearly burst out of control, flooding outward and covering the heavens. The void directly collapsed, spatial turbulence rolling as if it could engulf the entire great hall.

This was the terrifying might of a world-shaking powerhouse who had ignited his divine fire—capable of crushing ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers.

His alternate member seat was gone.

This was simply the greatest humiliation to him—grinding his face into the dirt.

Throughout history, every Xuanyuan family patriarch had simultaneously held the highest position in the Federation among the family's members. The two complemented each other, maintaining the patriarch's supreme authority.

Xuanyuan Chong obtaining an alternate member seat, standing equal to him in the Federation, was already an enormous humiliation.

But even more outrageous—his own alternate member seat as family patriarch was now gone. And it had been stripped away without his knowledge, taken by the Qin family.

Who didn't know that the Su family matriarch Qin Junhua was the eldest daughter of the Qin family's old patriarch, married into the Su family?

To say Su Heng hadn't been pulling strings behind this—even ghosts wouldn't believe it.

He had lost his alternate member seat while Xuanyuan Chong had become an alternate member and was advocating for good relations with the Su family.

And Xuanyuan Jian could communicate with the clan's divine artifact, having a large faction of supporters within the family.

Xuanyuan Ze simply didn't dare imagine what consequences would follow if things continued developing this way.

"Su Yun, you're trying to cut off my father and me at the root!" Xuanyuan Li's expression was savage. He had never imagined that in just one day, things would have progressed to this extent.

"If this matter isn't explained clearly, none of you are leaving. My Xuanyuan family and your Su family—we won't stop until one side is dead." Xuanyuan Ze's voice was vicious, with a hysterical edge.

He made his decision in an instant.

In for a penny, in for a pound. Since Su Yun had such great influence over Su Heng, he would detain Su Yun here in the Xuanyuan family. Let's see if Su Heng dared to make a move against the Xuanyuan family then.

"Hum!"

But it was Su Jian beside them who acted. Using his finger as a sword, he sliced through the void, directly severing the spatial turbulence and separating it into another world.

One sword, creating a world.

The great hall was as still as an ancient well, partitioned off by a sword scar.

In the infinite void, Xuanyuan Ze's aura was directly cut off and contained within, stirring endless waves.

This was something only a world-shaking powerhouse who had ignited divine fire could accomplish.

In that instant, many Xuanyuan family powerhouses were shocked to their cores. From that single sword, they smelled the scent of death.

If this sword had been aimed at them, they would certainly die.

Clearly, Swordless Heavenly King had already ignited his divine fire.

"Su Jian has actually ignited his divine fire, and he's personally protecting Su Yun. Just how high is his status in the Su family?"

Many Xuanyuan family powerhouses were dumbfounded.

After all, a powerhouse who had ignited divine fire was second only to the patriarch even within the Xuanyuan family. Even the young master couldn't command such a person. They were a divine family's greatest reserve strength.

Just how powerful had the Su family become?

After all, Su Jian had once been merely a collateral member of the Su family. He wasn't very old, yet his growth had been this rapid.

"Su Jian, you've actually ignited your divine fire."

Xuanyuan Ze's gaze was shocked. His voice became somewhat hoarse. The vicious light in his eyes remained, but he no longer knew whether he should continue his attack.

In this moment, the expressions of many Xuanyuan family powerhouses had turned grim.

"Xuanyuan Ze, as patriarch, do you truly not consider the consequences of your actions at all?"

At this moment, Xuanyuan Chong had already led a group of powerhouses to stand on Su Yun's side, his expression dark. He spoke coldly: "Su Yun is the Su family's heir. If you attack him, are you trying to force the Su family into a fight to the death with our Xuanyuan family?"

The other powerhouses reacted as well. Except for some of Xuanyuan Ze's direct supporters, they all began voicing their angry rebukes.

"Xuanyuan Ze, how long will you continue being foolish for the sake of your son?"

"In all the generations of our Xuanyuan family, we've never had a patriarch as stubborn and useless as you."

"Our Xuanyuan family has been continuously declining under your leadership. Haven't you reflected on this at all?"

Xuanyuan Chong also laughed coldly: "As I see it, if this continues, sooner or later he'll lead the Xuanyuan family into a bottomless abyss. Perhaps it's time to reconsider who should hold the patriarch position."

He was now an alternate member of the Supreme Council.

This status was like a death-free card. He no longer had the slightest fear of Xuanyuan Ze.

In this moment, the Xuanyuan family's direct-line headquarters had clearly split into two factions, as incompatible as fire and water.

At this moment, Su Yun's gaze was indifferent as he looked down at Xuanyuan Ze. He spoke coldly: "Xuanyuan Ze, I know you're determined to protect Xuanyuan Li's position as heir. But I never imagined you could be this foolish."

"Jian'er, it seems this Xuanyuan family doesn't welcome you anymore. Let's go."

Cold laughter flashed in Su Yun's eyes as he immediately turned, preparing to leave with Xuanyuan Jian.

Even he hadn't expected things to go this smoothly. The Xuanyuan family, which Xuanyuan Li had forged into an ironclad monolith in the original story, had fractured this easily.

He had still underestimated the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul's impact on the Xuanyuan family's internal dynamics—especially with the Su family's support behind it.

His father Su Heng's two moves in the Supreme Council had been like killing blows, almost instantly splitting the Xuanyuan family in two.

Su Yun had a vague suspicion that Su Heng, seeing the Xuanyuan family's continuous decline, had likely wanted to make a move against them long ago given his ambitious nature. He had probably already arranged everything behind the scenes.

And Su Yun's engagement to Xuanyuan Jian, along with awakening the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul and throwing the Xuanyuan family into internal chaos, had given Su Heng the perfect opportunity to deliver a fatal blow.

In the original story, it was probably because the original Su Yun had died, combined with the rise of Su Meng and Ye Ling, that Su Heng had suffered enormous setbacks—allowing the Xuanyuan family to escape disaster.
