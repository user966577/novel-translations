"Decades have passed, yet there are still people who recognize me."

The ancient face spoke, his voice vast and resonant, his divine might so terrifying that even the ancient powerhouses from the Qin family heritage trembled. Some Saint-level cultivators, unable to withstand the supreme divine pressure, had already fallen to their knees.

"I wanted to leave, but unfortunately, that rebellious son of mine wouldn't let me." Su Zhan's words were detached, yet a flash of pride gleamed in his eyes.

Then he turned his gaze to Su Yun and smiled faintly: "Worthy of being that brat's son. You're like him—and even more like a true descendant of the Su family. Ruthless and decisive, willing to cut down anyone who stands in your way, even family."

Su Yun's lips curved slightly, but he said nothing.

In the original novel, there had been no mention of Su Zhan still being alive. Most likely, after the original Su Yun died, Su Heng had abandoned his campaign against the Barbarian Tribes, and Su Zhan—like all those Strongest Divine Spirits before him—had ventured into the starry cosmos seeking a breakthrough.

When he learned that Su Zhan was still alive, even he had been amazed at the depth of Su Heng's ambition and how far ahead the man had planned. Decades ago, he had already resolved to campaign against the Barbarian Tribes, and he had convinced Su Zhan—who had reached his three-hundred-year limit—to remain.

And Su Zhan, despite knowing that Su Heng had colluded with the Pixiu Clan to eliminate his eldest son Su Yong, had still chosen to support Su Heng. Clearly, he too was a ruthless man.

In truth, even without Su Zhan, he could have handled the Qin family.

The reason he had brought out this old man who didn't have many years left was to serve as a deterrent to those with ulterior motives.

"The Duanmu family." Su Yun's cold gaze turned toward the north. His Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes could faintly perceive a towering figure hidden in the endless void, where even the chaotic spatial currents were suppressed by that figure's divine might.

At that moment, Su Zhan also turned his detached gaze toward the northern sky, his voice cold and domineering:

"Duanmu Lei, brat—you've been hiding in the endless void watching my grandson this whole time. Are you looking for a fight with me?"

"This old body of mine should still be good enough to take a few Strongest Divine Spirits down with me."

At this, Qin Ying's body also trembled. He cast his divine sense into the northern sky, searching frantically, but couldn't find any trace of a figure.

"Duanmu Lei, get out here!"

Qin Ying roared: "Have you forgotten the promise you made me?!"

"You said that if the Su family moved against the Qin family, the Duanmu family would never stand idly by!"

In that instant, all the Qin family direct descendants felt their bodies tense. A glimmer of hope sparked in their despairing eyes. The Duanmu family patriarch, Duanmu Lei, was actually here? And he had made such a promise to Qin Ying?

The Duanmu family was a Divine Spirit clan nearly as powerful as the Su family, and they too possessed an Ancient Divine Weapon.

If the Duanmu family would stand up for them, everything might still turn around.

At that moment, supreme divine might spread from the void. A low, majestic voice echoed from the emptiness, resounding across the heavens: "Su Zhan, Su Yun—don't forget that the Qin family is also a great clan of China, and Qin Ying is an alternate member of the Supreme Council."

"This time, though Qin Ying erred by detaining your Su family's matriarch and young master and coveting your Ancient Divine Weapon, all his offenses shall be judged by the Federation."

"If you dare act on your own authority, I, Duanmu Lei, as a Council member speaking on behalf of the Supreme Council, warn you: the Federation will impose the severest punishment on the Su family."

As the words fell, the divine might in the sky abruptly dissipated, vanishing without a trace.

"That's it?"

"He left?"

"What happened to the Duanmu family never standing idly by?"

"Patriarch, what's going on?"

In an instant, all the Qin family members stared in bewilderment, their faces frozen.

They had to admit—those words would carry weight against most of the world's great clans, the Qin family included. They too would have to fear sanctions from the Azure Federation; that was no laughing matter.

But "most clans" didn't include the Su family.

Because the Su family was one of the Federation's founding clans—one of the architects of the current order among the Human Race.

And now he was saying the Federation would impose the severest sanctions on them?

How exactly would they sanction them?

Moreover, Su Heng was currently campaigning against the Barbarian Tribes, earning enormous merit. Unless Su Heng was defeated in the Americas—or died there—who would dare defy all reason to sanction the Su family?

In that moment, Qin Ying was dumbfounded.

So this was what you meant by "never standing idly by."

Just a warning to the Su family?

He felt like he had been played for a fool by Duanmu Lei.

"Duanmu Lei, don't leave! Get out here!" Qin Ying erupted in fury, nearly suffocating as he roared.

Duanmu Lei was the last straw he could cling to now.

With Su Zhan present, plus the Ancient Divine Weapon, and the thirteen battalions that would arrive at any moment—he couldn't think of anyone who could save him besides Duanmu Lei or Mount Olympus, which was an ocean away.

"Duanmu Lei! Athena! Get out here!" Qin Ying was practically delirious, roaring endlessly, yet receiving no response whatsoever.

"Hahahaha..."

Su Zhan and Su Yun burst into laughter almost simultaneously, cold light flashing in their eyes.

The Federation would impose the severest punishment on them.

This was quite possibly the biggest joke they had ever heard in their lives.

Clearly, Duanmu Lei had backed down. He didn't dare openly oppose the Su family.

Deep in the endless void, Duanmu Lei's face was iron-dark as he growled: "Fool. You couldn't even handle something this simple, and you want me to step in for you?"

"You actually tried to forcibly detain Su Yun? You have no idea how high the heavens are!"

"Even my Duanmu family wouldn't dare do that. Blinded by greed—you've ruined my grand scheme!"

Duanmu Lei's expression was grim to the extreme.

In truth, even he hadn't anticipated that Su Zhan would still be alive.

Su Zhan's reputation was simply too formidable.

And at this point, his lifespan had exceeded three hundred years. His end was near; he didn't have long to live.

At a time like this, he had no desire to fight the Su family to the death over some minor Qin family—to go down with Su Zhan in mutual destruction.

"Su Heng, your luck is too good. You actually managed to produce such an outstanding heir." Duanmu Lei muttered to himself, his eyes cold.

He hadn't expected Su Yun to be this decisive and ruthless. The boy showed no consideration that the Qin family was his mother's natal clan—he had simply mobilized the eighteen battalions of Su family headquarters and invaded Qin Province.

Even more unexpectedly, aside from the Kunlun Mirror, Su Yun possessed yet another Ancient Divine Weapon.

Going all-out against the Su family over one Qin family simply wasn't worth it.

"But your greatest flaw is being too arrogant. You actually went to campaign against the Barbarian Tribes. Even if you win one battle, so what? Complete victory is impossible. The Americas are where the God Race holds the greatest influence."

Duanmu Lei's gaze was cold.

But since you've gone, don't bother coming back.

If you think you'll get the Federation's support, dream on.

"Still, Su Zhan being alive is quite troublesome." Duanmu Lei muttered to himself, then swiftly flew toward the west. He needed to discuss this with Athena first.

They couldn't let that old immortal Su Zhan disrupt their plans.
