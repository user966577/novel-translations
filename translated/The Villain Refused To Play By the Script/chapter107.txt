Chapter 107: Forsaken by All

Hearing Xuanyuan Chong's words, the Xuanyuan family's direct-line members were tempted, but still hesitated.

Xuanyuan Ze was still the patriarch after all.

Though they didn't want to go to war with the Su family for the sake of their own interests, removing the heir and forcing Xuanyuan Ze to surrender the Patriarch Token was simply too significant a matter.

"Xuanyuan Chong, I'll kill you, you traitor!" Xuanyuan Ze erupted, roaring hysterically as his divine might exploded. He attacked directly.

He understood that his prestige within the family had already sunk as low as it could go.

He absolutely could not let Xuanyuan Chong continue to stir things up.

With a "hum," a Divine Spirit hand filled the heavens as surging divine might and golden light spread everywhere.

This was the hand of a supreme Divine Spirit, its terrifying power directly shattering the endless sky.

But at that moment, a flash of golden light appeared. An elderly man with fading vitality suddenly materialized before Xuanyuan Chong, blocking Xuanyuan Ze's strike.

"Divine Son, you..." Xuanyuan Ze growled, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Indeed, this elderly man was none other than Xuanyuan Shen—the biological son of the Xuanyuan family's founding ancestor.

Xuanyuan Ze never imagined that at such a critical moment, the first person to step forward and stop him would be Xuanyuan Shen.

This old ancestor had become confused to such a degree?

It's over!

That was Xuanyuan Ze's first thought.

At that moment, Xuanyuan Shen's expression was grim as he stared at Xuanyuan Ze and said coldly, "I never imagined that the current Xuanyuan family had declined and fractured to such an extent, and that the current patriarch could be so foolish."

"Xuanyuan Chong, your decision this time was well made. This ancestor supports you—remove Xuanyuan Li from his position as heir and strip Xuanyuan Ze of the Patriarch Token."

At these words, Xuanyuan Chong was overjoyed. He understood how enormous Xuanyuan Shen's influence was within the Xuanyuan family.

"Thank you, Ancestor. Ancestor is truly wise!"

"With Ancestor here, the Xuanyuan family's future is assured."

Seeing this scene, Su Yun immediately broke into a brilliant smile. With an old ancestor like Xuanyuan Shen around, the Xuanyuan family's future was indeed assured—they would flourish under his hand, though as the Su family's vassal.

Xuanyuan Li's voice became hysterical: "Ancestor, you're confused! If we just hold on, the Su family would never dare fight us to the bitter end!"

"Wretch!"

"If you hadn't done such a fine job, would the Xuanyuan family have come to this point?"

A cold gleam flashed in Xuanyuan Shen's eyes. He slapped Xuanyuan Li across the face from a distance, sending him tumbling.

"Ancestor, you..." Xuanyuan Ze was dumbfounded, his eyes bloodshot, nearly bulging out of his head.

In front of so many people, a slap across the face of the family heir!

The founding ancestor's family rules stated that the patriarch and heir's status superseded all others—everyone had to obey their commands.

This slap from Xuanyuan Shen, the founder's own son, wasn't just across Xuanyuan Li's face—it was across his own face too, utterly destroying what little prestige he had left.

And at that moment, finally, one of the Xuanyuan family's direct-line powerhouses spoke up:

"I support Xuanyuan Chong's proposal."

"I also support it."

"The family's heritage reserves should be immediately deactivated."

"Send people immediately to communicate with the Elite Guard's ten generals. Tell them not to obey Xuanyuan Ze's reckless commands."

"Indeed, going to war with the Su family and Kunlun Daoist Sect now—the Xuanyuan family cannot afford it."

"Besides, our Xuanyuan family is in the wrong this time. This doesn't count as backing down."

...

As one after another of the Xuanyuan family's direct-line powerhouses stepped forward—including even some of the trusted confidants Xuanyuan Ze had personally cultivated—they represented well over half of the family's main branch.

At this moment, Xuanyuan Ze was showing signs of being forsaken by all.

Xuanyuan Shen's prestige as Divine Son was no joke.

Combined with Xuanyuan Chong's positions as alternate councilman and Vice Patriarch, their combined influence rivaled that of Xuanyuan Ze, whose own influence had plummeted to rock bottom.

Moreover, this time it was Xuanyuan Ze who had actively provoked the Su family, causing great dissatisfaction among the direct-line members.

The Xuanyuan family had been declining for years. They had finally managed to establish a marriage alliance with the Su family, even marrying off their alternate heir, barely maintaining their relationship with the Su family—and now this patriarch wanted to stir up trouble?

With all these factors combined, Xuanyuan Ze being forsaken by everyone was simply a natural outcome.

"You... all of you..."

Xuanyuan Ze was going mad. He suddenly raised the Patriarch Token in his hand.

At the same time, Xuanyuan Li struggled to his feet, eyes filled with madness, the Young Master Token appearing in his hand.

The two most powerful Divine Spirit weapons of the Xuanyuan family simultaneously released overwhelming divine might.

"Are you all trying to violate the Xuanyuan family's ancestral teachings?"

Xuanyuan Ze roared, then turned to shout at the Elite Guard outside the city: "Why haven't you entered the city? Are you not even listening to my commands anymore?"

"Hum, hum, hum..."

But at that moment, ten terrifying beams of light suddenly pierced through the void, appearing above the Xuanyuan family headquarters.

These were ten generals in golden armor, their heads completely covered by their helmets, only cold, emotionless eyes visible.

They were the ten generals of the Elite Guard Battalion that protected the Xuanyuan family headquarters.

Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li stared in disbelief, an ominous feeling rising in their hearts: "Ten Generals, why have you entered the city? Quickly give the order to let the—"

But at that moment, one of the generals suddenly stepped forward and bowed to Xuanyuan Shen and Xuanyuan Chong: "Greetings to the Divine Son. Greetings to the Vice Patriarch. We ten generals have unanimously concluded that going to war with the Su family now would mean certain defeat. It is not the time for battle."

"Boom!"

These words struck Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li's minds like a thunderbolt.

The Elite Guard was supposed to obey only those who held the Patriarch Token and Young Master Token.

But now, even the Elite Guard had betrayed them, siding with Xuanyuan Chong.

This meant the Elite Guard was also extremely dissatisfied with them. They agreed to remove Xuanyuan Li as heir and have the Patriarch Token held jointly by the Supreme Council.

"Ten Generals, have even you become this confused?"

Xuanyuan Ze's voice was hysterical, veins bulging on his neck as he roared: "As long as you dare enter the city, the Su family won't necessarily risk fighting us to the death.

"Even if there really is a war, my Xuanyuan family won't fall that quickly. The Azure Federation won't allow the Su family to act so recklessly.

"As long as we dare to fight, there's still hope.

"Kneeling to the Su family this time means kneeling forever. Xuanyuan Chong is the traitor. The Xuanyuan family will be destroyed by his hand—he'll gift-wrap us and hand us to the Su family!"
