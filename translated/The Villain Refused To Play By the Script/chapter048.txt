Chapter 48: The Five Elemental Divine Battalions

"It's the Su family's Five Elemental Divine Battalions." A powerhouse cried out in alarm.

"Heavens, what's happening?"

"Legend says the Su family's Eighteen Battalions cannot be mobilized except in matters of life and death."

"The Eighteen Battalions are the Su family's private army guarding their compound. Every soldier was once among the Federation military's most powerful warriors—battle-hardened elites among elites."

"I've heard each battalion is worth a million-strong army—a terrifying force capable of annihilating an entire ancient clan."

Witnessing this scene, countless powerhouses throughout the Imperial Capital trembled. Their voices shook as the hidden foundations of many great families were startled awake by the terrifying killing intent.

"The last time the Eighteen Battalions were mobilized... I believe it was when Su Yong was killed and Su Heng ascended to the patriarch's position." An ancient powerhouse murmured to himself.

"The Five Elemental Divine Battalions seem to be the force controlled by the Su family's heir—established by the Su family's founding Divine Spirit ancestor to prevent internal strife if anything happened to the patriarch and the heir was threatened."

In that moment, the entire Imperial Capital shook. Countless powerhouses turned their gazes toward the Su family.

The ancient war chariots of the Five Elemental Divine Battalions crossed the sky, their rumbling drowning out all other sounds, rolling clouds churning as if thousands of cavalry were roaring.

The five Divine Generals' gazes were merciless. Each wore armor of a different elemental color, their auras towering to the heavens. They drove their war chariots down from the sky and entered through the Su family gates, soon appearing before Su Yun.

Each of them was a battle-hardened Saint-level powerhouse who had emerged from fields of corpses and seas of blood.

"Thud, thud, thud..."

"Metal Divine General, Wood Divine General, Earth Divine General, Water Divine General, Fire Divine General—we pay respects to the Young Master."

"We apologize for arriving late to escort you. We await the Young Master's punishment."

Their cold, emotionless voices echoed through the Su family's skies.

In that moment, the entire Su family fell silent.

Warriors from the five battalions drove their chariots across the sky, descending continuously through the formation patterns, pouring through the gates in an endless stream. They sealed off every location, their gazes merciless, their killing intent towering. Faintly, one could see visions of bleached bones and seas of blood.

The many powerhouses of the Su family compound were dumbstruck.

Su Yun had actually summoned the five Divine Battalions.

Had he gone mad?

The Eighteen Battalions were a crucial force protecting the Su family compound and could not be mobilized lightly. This was a clan rule left by the Su family's founding ancestor.

"In all the generations of our Su family's history, never has an heir mobilized the five battalions to suppress direct-line powerhouses of the main branch." An elderly direct-line powerhouse's beard quivered, his entire body trembling.

"This beast—bullying elders, suppressing relatives—is utterly heartless and cruel."

"Where are the elder generation powerhouses of our Su family? Why isn't anyone advising the heir? How can we allow him to act so recklessly?"

The many elderly direct-line powerhouses growled repeatedly, so furious their qi flowed in reverse. Yet not a single one dared step forward to advise Su Yun.

Anyone could see that this Su Yun fellow seemed to have gone completely mad. He was determined to kill Su Ying. Whoever dared stop him, he would kill.

Direct descendants of the Su family would be killed all the same.

"Su Yun, you madman! An utter madman! The direct line's many powerhouses will not tolerate your reckless behavior!" Su Ying's face was pale, yet she forced herself to cry out shrilly.

"If you dare kill me, my father Chaos Heavenly King will never let you go!"

"I command."

Su Yun's gaze was cold. The Young Master Token appeared in his hand, his voice devoid of emotion: "Chaos Heavenly King's daughter Su Ying attempted to assassinate this young master. I suspect Chaos Heavenly King's Manor of plotting rebellion. Immediately seal off the manor. No one inside may enter or leave."

"We obey the Young Master's command."

The five Divine Generals' expressions remained icy—like emotionless killing machines. They immediately rose and mounted their chariots, leading their respective battalions' warriors to swiftly seal off every corner of Chaos Heavenly King's Manor. Then, using Five Elements formation patterns, they sealed heaven and earth, surrounding the manor that covered over a thousand acres so tightly that not even a mosquito could escape.

"He's lost it! Completely lost it!"

"Sealing off a Heavenly King's Manor—even Su Heng wouldn't dare do this lightly."

"And what's this about Su Ying trying to assassinate him? This is blatantly throwing dirty water. It's utterly lawless!"

"Chaos Heavenly King has been loyal to the Su family and rendered tremendous service. How can he be humiliated like this by some brat?"

"Is this trying to make the entire Su family lose faith?"

"Hurry and send someone to notify Su Heng! Otherwise, his son is going to turn the Su family upside down!"

The eyes of many elderly direct-line powerhouses had turned red.

Su Lie was one of the representative figures of the Su family's direct line. Making a move against him was shaking the very foundations of the main branch.

Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie erupted in fury. His expression pale, he stepped into the sky, looking down at Su Yun from above, and roared: "Impudent brat! I am a direct descendant of the Su family, Chaos Heavenly King personally bestowed by the previous patriarch, recognized by the Federation's Supreme Council! You dare seal me off? You're challenging the dignity of the previous patriarch! Challenging the dignity of the Federation! Not just the Su family—no one in the entire human race can save you!"

"Impudent! The Su family's heir holds a position second only to the patriarch. How dare you be so presumptuous!"

The five Divine Generals' voices were cold. They drove their chariots, rumbling as they pressed down. The terrifying power of the Five Elements combined slammed onto Su Lie, causing the already injured Heavenly King's body to tremble violently. He spat out a massive mouthful of blood and plummeted from the sky, crashing through a palace.

The Eighteen Battalions answered only to the current patriarch and his heir. No one else had authority over them. Upholding the heir's dignity was their mission.

As for recognition from the Federation's Supreme Council—what did that have to do with them?

They were the Su family's private army.

"Father!" Seeing her father severely wounded, Su Ying's voice was shrill and mournful.

"Su Yun, you defy heaven and earth, you're utterly lawless! The entire Su family will not tolerate you! You will regret everything you've done today!"

Su Yun's expression was blank as he looked down at her. "Su Ying, I'll give you one more chance. Who ordered you to lure this young master to that courtyard in an attempt to assassinate me?"

"Was it Chaos Heavenly King who ordered you, plotting rebellion, trying to seize the Su family patriarch's position while my father is away?"

"Su Yun, you're spouting blood! Where's your evidence? This is throwing dirty water! Slander! The entire Su family is watching! I will never admit to it even in death!" Su Ying roared in fury.

"Bang!"

Su Yun stomped down hard, directly shattering all of her teeth. Then, with surging origin energy, he shattered all the meridians throughout her body, crippling her completely. He spoke coldly: "Ran'er, hang Su Ying outside Chaos Heavenly King's Manor. Roast her with hellfire. You and Dark Lady will interrogate her together. Make certain she confesses everything."

"Chaos Heavenly King's Manor is under grave suspicion. If they dare make any untoward moves, you need not ask for instructions. Take the Young Master Token and have the Five Divine Battalions annihilate the entire manor. Leave no one alive."

"This servant obeys." Yun Ran's expression was solemn as she immediately knelt and accepted the Young Master Token with both hands.

"Dark Lady obeys."

Dark Lady's figure emerged from the void. She knelt on one knee, her face veiled in black gauze, her eyes filled with reverence.

In this moment, Su Yun had truly established his authority.

Su Yun's cold voice, every word and every sentence, made the many Su family powerhouses shiver with cold. They truly wondered if this heir had gone completely insane.

He had actually granted his personal attendant the authority to make independent decisions—even to annihilate Chaos Heavenly King's Manor.

Chaos Heavenly King's Manor now stood at the edge of a cliff. One wrong move and they would be slaughtered to the last.

And to be so heartless—treating Su Ying, his own cousin by blood, in such a manner.

Hellfire was a flame that could burn divine sense and soul directly. It could make a person beg for death without dying, the pain searing into the depths of their soul.

This was torture through cruel interrogation, forcing Su Ying to confess to attempting Su Yun's assassination.

Not only that, but torturing Chaos Heavenly King's daughter right in front of his manor was essentially grinding his face into the dirt, forcing him to act.

And the moment he acted, his manor would be razed to the ground.

"These are servants! How can servants discipline direct descendants of our Su family?" An elderly direct-line figure wailed.

"Using a Su family direct descendant to establish his authority—so vicious! Mother and son are cut from the same cloth. Our Su family will be destroyed by their hands sooner or later!"

Yun Ran and Dark Lady didn't dare delay. They immediately dragged the barely-alive Su Ying toward Chaos Heavenly King's Manor, hung her from a tree outside, and Dark Lady roasted her with hellfire, eliciting screams of agony that pierced to the soul.

"I don't know anything! I don't know anything! Su Yun, if you have the ability, just kill me!"

"Royal Father, come save me quickly!"

"It hurts so much! Royal Father, I can't take it anymore!"

"Pfft!"

Inside Chaos Heavenly King's Manor, Su Lie sat on his throne, his face pale, his eyes bloodshot. He vomited several massive mouthfuls of blood in succession and slumped heavily against the throne.

"Brat, how dare you humiliate me so!"

Below him, the many powerhouses of the manor knelt on the ground, crying out desperately:

"Your Majesty, the Five Divine Battalions have surrounded the manor! Su Yun is intent on killing! We must think of something immediately!"

"Otherwise, our manor is truly finished!"

"Your Majesty, why not give the order? Recall your former generals to the Imperial Capital. With a million-strong army, we refuse to believe we can't handle the mere Five Divine Battalions."
