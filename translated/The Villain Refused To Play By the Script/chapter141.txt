Chapter 141: At Any Cost

"At any cost, we must capture Athena."

Su Yun's detached voice echoed across the firmament.

"As you command!"

Terrifying auras began awakening within the Imperial Capital.

In mere moments, Divine Spirits emerged one after another from within the Su family.

"Su Jian, take the God-Devil Pendant for now." Su Yun raised his hand and passed the pendant to Su Jian.

"Young Master, Su Jian will not fail you." Su Jian's expression was impassive. Holding the God-Devil Pendant, he strode step by step toward the heavens, his terrifying sword aura beginning to radiate from his body.

*Hum... Hum... Hum...*

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

The Chaos Bell's true form squeezed through the firmament, its rolling bell waves directly tearing open the endless void, carving out a passage that led straight to where Athena lurked in the depths of infinite space.

"Ouyang Feng, have you gone mad? You dare attack me?"

Athena roared in fury, divine radiance rolling forth, blotting out the sun. The War Spear in her hand unleashed divine might that pierced through the endless void.

At this moment, she dared approach the vicinity of the Imperial Capital because she had made complete preparations. Even now, though she could be seen from within the capital, her physical form was actually in the depths of the endless void. She could shatter space at any moment and appear tens of thousands of miles away from the Imperial Capital.

Even if the entire Su family mobilized, as long as she wasn't entangled, no one could do anything to her.

Moreover, she didn't believe anyone would dare make a move against her.

She was the War Goddess of Mount Olympus, a supreme Divine Spirit ranked among the top ten.

Yet who could have predicted that Ouyang Feng—this fellow who had kept a low profile for ten thousand years, never seeking conflict—would suddenly infiltrate the depths of the endless void and hold her fast?

"Athena, do you truly think China has no capable people?"

Ouyang Feng's weathered eyes now brimmed with sharp brilliance, his black hair dancing wildly.

"For over a thousand years, the Human Race has produced generation after generation of powerful cultivators, yet we've been unable to break out of Human territory and expand our living space. It's precisely because of people like you who worship the God Race unconditionally—you've been dragging the Human Race down from behind."

"This time, if I stand by and watch you act with impunity, sucking up to the God Race, severing the Su family's external expansion—I would be unworthy of our ancestors and unworthy of the countless people of the Human Race."

"Stay here! I want to see whether your Mount Olympus truly dares make a move against China. The Federation is not yours to dominate!"

"Divine ability—Star Shift!"

Ouyang Feng's black hair danced wildly. His hands moved as if in a dream, continuously sending forth rays of starlight that manifested into an endless starfield, distorting the endless void and enshrouding Athena within.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Su Yun's gaze was detached. Above his head, the Chaos Bell manifested, and the Mountains and Rivers pocket dimension appeared—the Fuxi Formation's purple light soared to the heavens. A Divine Spirit martial soul ten thousand zhang tall materialized in the void, pressing a palm down toward Athena.

In an instant, space shattered. The Ancient Divine Weapon War Spear trembled violently as Athena was held fast.

*Rumble! Rumble!*

Endless stars rotated, space burst apart, and the figures of Su Yun, Athena, and Ouyang Feng simultaneously appeared in the firmament above the Imperial Capital.

At this moment, the divine radiance shrouding Athena was scattered, revealing her breathtaking form.

She wore golden battle armor and held the golden War Spear. Her gaze was merciless. Her slightly curled golden hair danced across the sky, and her terrifying divine might made the very firmament tremble.

"Su Yun, Ouyang Feng, you overestimate yourselves if you think you can keep me here."

Athena's voice was cold. She wielded the War Spear, powerful enough to make one shudder. Whole swathes of stars were shattered by her strikes, and the endless Chaos Bell waves couldn't approach her form.

"The might of Mount Olympus cannot be challenged."

"In the Supreme Council, naturally, Mount Olympus should be paramount."

"The reason the Human Race has been unable to rise for so long is that they are inherently weak. Only by receiving the baptism of God Race blood and completely abandoning the Human Race's laughable so-called pride will there be any chance of rising."

"I absolutely will not allow you arrogant Chinese to disrupt my plans and make the God Race develop a negative impression of the Human Race."

"The reason I originally agreed was to make Su Heng understand that the Human Race is too weak—how could they possibly move against the Ancient Myriad Races? But who knew the Barbarian Tribes would be such trash."

"Regardless, Su Heng must withdraw from the Americas, or forget about getting any support from the Federation of Azure Blue."

Athena's gaze was ice-cold. She shouted once, and the War Spear's radiance pierced through the void, directly shattering Star Shift.

"Powerful in strength, but in her heart merely a pitiful wretch—her spine will never straighten before the God Race."

Su Yun laughed coldly, speaking detachedly:

"Athena, I said I'd sooner or later have you willingly lie on my bed, but I never expected that day to come so quickly."

"Even without your Mount Olympus's help, my China can still conquer the Americas and crush the Barbarian Tribes—then casually crush that so-called God Race along the way."

"Hahahaha!"

Ouyang Feng laughed heartily, starlight flowing through his hair. "Young Su Yun, not bad, not bad at all! I approve of you."

"Without the Federation's power, China can still tear through the Americas!"

"But before that, let's first capture this woman, lest she continue causing trouble for us at the Federation Supreme Council."

"Falling Stars!"

Ouyang Feng laughed as rolling starlight surged forth. He stepped into the heavens, one hand pointing skyward, one hand pointing earthward, as torrential divine might poured into the starry sky.

The next moment, endless meteors were rapidly drawn from the cosmos, blazing with raging flames, blotting out the sky, radiating an aura of destruction.

Like fiery meteors streaking across the heavens, they filled the firmament, crashing down upon Athena.

"Sword of Heaven!"

Su Jian's detached voice thundered across heaven and earth. Using the God-Devil Pendant, he condensed a god-devil sword. With one slash, the will of heaven and earth transformed into a divine sword that crashed toward Athena.

"With my blood, I dye Xuanyuan!"

Just then, a clear, cold voice rang out across heaven and earth. Xuanyuan Jian's breathtaking figure appeared above the Xuanyuan family headquarters. Below her stood numerous Xuanyuan family direct-line powerhouses, Divine Spirits, and a large group of ancient heritage powerhouses who emerged from the depths of the headquarters, channeling endless power into her, fueling the golden sword entwined with a golden dragon above her head.

This golden sword was unmistakably the Xuanyuan family's long-lost clan-guarding divine weapon—the Xuanyuan Sword.

*Hum! Hum! Hum!*

The Xuanyuan Sword blazed with light, dragon roars shaking the heavens. With one slash, space was cleaved in two, striking the War Spear from across the void.

At this moment, numerous Divine Spirits arrived in position, surrounding Athena, continuously unleashing divine abilities to seal the heavens.

"Reporting to Young Master, the Five Elemental Divine Battalions are in position."

"Thunder God Battalion in position."

"Lightning God Battalion in position!"

...

"Xuanyuan family elite guards—all ten War Generals in position."

...

The Su family's Eighteen Great Battalions commanded ancient war chariots, deploying terrifying formation runes across the firmament, encircling Athena.

"Kill!"

The Divine Generals of the Eighteen Great Battalions used themselves as cores to drive the formation runes, unleashing terrifying divine abilities far more powerful than those of half-step Strongest Divine Spirits.

"The order of war cannot be challenged."

Athena's golden hair danced wildly. She was terrifyingly powerful—each strand of hair could slice through space as it moved. With her strength alone she faced so many powerhouses and the Ancient Divine Weapon, barely managing to hold her ground.

But this was already her limit.

The next moment, the divine abilities of the surrounding Divine Spirits, the formation runes of the Eighteen Great Battalions, and the divine abilities unleashed by the Xuanyuan family's elite guards pierced through the firmament, crashing heavily into her golden battle armor.
