Chapter 93: I Don't Want Any of Them

"Senior Brother, is this your compensation to me?"

True Feather Divine Spirit's exquisite face showed no expression. After holding the Kunlun Divine Spirit's gaze for a long moment, she turned to scan the various peak masters and elders around her. Not a single one dared meet her eyes.

Slowly, a bitter look appeared in True Feather Divine Spirit's eyes. She said:

"Our Kunlun Daoist Sect has been passed down for a thousand years, always priding itself on transcending the mundane, severing worldly attachments.

"Yet now, Senior Brother and all of you are asking me to accompany a secular man. Where is the sect's faith?"

Deep disappointment filled her heart—disappointment in the sect, and even more so in these Kunlun Daoist Sect powerhouses, her fellow disciples.

So many powerhouses in the sect, yet not one of them was a real man.

Though she had already mentally prepared herself.

But making her own decision versus being unanimously decided upon and required to go by the sect's members were two entirely different things.

One was voluntarily sacrificing herself.

The other was being demanded—or rather, forced—to sacrifice.

"True Feather, Senior Brother had no choice. As a Divine Spirit yourself, you surely understand how important the Innate Dao Body and Kunlun Mirror are to our sect."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit spoke, his face showing little emotional fluctuation. He continued, "Word has already spread. The Celestial Maiden Sect and Lingxiao Sect will soon learn of it and will certainly interfere, creating complications.

"So Senior Brother had no choice but to act decisively.

"After this matter is concluded, since you've made a great sacrifice for the sect, we've unanimously decided to make you Vice Sect Master. Li Yi will become the Dao Child, and the Innate Dao Body Su Yayue will become a Dao Maiden, taking me as her master.

"When that time comes, you, Junior Sister, will be the hero of the Kunlun Daoist Sect's revival. You will surely leave a significant mark in the sect's history."

"Yes, Junior Sister True Feather, by then you'll be the sect's hero. After the sect flourishes, everyone will be grateful to you."

"The Innate Dao Body has the same physique as our first generation Ancestor. She has the potential to unite all the Daoist sects."

...

The various peak masters and elders around her spoke up with smiles.

"Leave a significant mark. A hero."

True Feather Divine Spirit laughed. "Indeed, a significant mark. In all of the sect's history, there has never been a Divine Spirit who sold her own body for benefits—and was unanimously agreed upon and required to go by the entire sect.

"How honored I am to have set a record.

"But whether it will be remembered gloriously in history or reviled for eternity, despised by all—that remains to be seen."

With that, True Feather Divine Spirit's expression became utterly cold. She swept a cold gaze over everyone present and spoke indifferently. "For the first time, I find your faces disgusting—even more disgusting than the Su family's Young Master Su Yun.

"You claim to transcend the mundane world, yet you're nothing but hypocrites, petty people who will stop at nothing for profit.

"I'll take my leave!"

"True Feather, wait—" The Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression shifted slightly, but True Feather Divine Spirit left the hall without looking back. Only her cold voice drifted back: "I'm going to the Su family."

In an instant, the Kunlun Divine Spirit and all the elders collectively breathed a sigh of relief, smiles appearing in their eyes.

Success!

With the Kunlun Mirror to anchor their foundation and the Innate Dao Body, they could at least guarantee the Kunlun Daoist Sect's prosperity for several more centuries.

This behavior was indeed shameful.

But it was all worth it.

At that moment, a disciple hurried into the hall. "Reporting to the Sect Master, news from the sect—the Celestial Maiden Sect Master and a large group of their powerhouses and Divine Spirits have arrived in the Imperial Capital. They're currently at the Su family gates requesting an audience."

"That female Daoist nun—she arrived so quickly."

In an instant, the Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression changed dramatically.

He never expected that in just one night, the Celestial Maiden Sect had already received the news and rushed over from thousands of miles away.

"This is bad. The Celestial Maiden Sect Master cultivates the Red Dust Dao, which emphasizes entering the world and then transcending it, severing the seven emotions and six desires. That wench An Ruoyi might very well seduce Su Yun and interfere."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit muttered to himself, his expression changing drastically. He suddenly stood up and flew rapidly toward the Su family.

True Feather Divine Spirit had an otherworldly temperament. In terms of scheming, she couldn't possibly match the Celestial Maiden Sect Master An Ruoyi.

The various peak masters and elders also took a deep breath, exchanging glances. All could see the alarm in each other's eyes.

For An Ruoyi to visit the Su family so grandly to see Su Yun, she had very likely already learned everything and come up with a counter-strategy.

This was not good.

They didn't dare hesitate. They quickly left the hall and flew toward the Su family.

They absolutely couldn't let the Celestial Maiden Sect steal the fruit of their labors.

...

"Reporting to the Young Master, the Celestial Maiden Sect Master, Ruoyi Divine Spirit, has arrived with a group of Celestial Maiden Sect elders requesting an audience." Dark Lady spoke respectfully.

Finally here!

A cold glint flashed through Su Yun's eyes. He smiled slightly. "Let them in."

"Ran'er, go bring Yayue here."

"Yes, Ran'er will go at once." Yun Ran immediately flew out of the villa.

Before long, a breathtakingly beautiful woman in a red dress approached gracefully. Her face wore a smile that made people feel close to her. "Young Master Su Yun, I've long heard of your great name. Handsome beyond compare—but meeting you today, I find that the rumors fall far short of how handsome you truly are.

"This is our first meeting, yet Ruoyi can't help but want to get much closer to you."

An Ruoyi's smile was radiant as a flower. Her black hair was pinned up high, revealing her snow-white swan neck. A form-fitting red dress perfectly outlined her serpentine waist.

From a distance, an air of seductive charm washed over one, making hot blood surge uncontrollably from below.

"An Ruoyi, the Ruoyi Goddess—indeed, meeting you is far better than just hearing about you!"

Su Yun laughed, his gaze sweeping over every inch of An Ruoyi's body like a blade.

In the original novel, there had been extensive descriptions of this Ruoyi Goddess's seductive charm and allure. Even the protagonist Ye Ling had been so entranced by this master of Yayue's that his blood ran hot, and they eventually shared a night of passion.

An Ruoyi had given her first time to Ye Ling and, by borrowing Ye Ling's destiny, had forgotten the mundane world, severed the seven emotions and six desires, and achieved the rank of strongest Divine Spirit.

But even though he had mentally prepared himself, seeing An Ruoyi for the first time, he was still stirred by that natural, effortless seductive charm.

"The Celestial Maiden Sect, which cultivates the Red Dust Dao—I wonder if Su Yun has the honor of tasting your sweetness and becoming a guest in your bedchamber?" Su Yun's lips curved, his gaze wicked. He met An Ruoyi's eyes without yielding an inch.

The Red Dust Dao emphasized entering the world and then transcending it, but practitioners would seek out a powerful individual to whom they could entrust the seven emotions and six desires.

In the original novel, An Ruoyi had been too powerful, her dao heart too firm. In the end, she had only been able to use her own disciple Su Yayue's man—a shameful attachment—to finally entrust her emotions before severing them.
