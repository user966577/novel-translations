Chapter 132: The Pixiu Arrives

At that moment, Qin Ying suddenly let out a hysterical roar:

"I'll open it! I'll open it! I'll open the gates!"

"I deserve death! I'm the Qin family's sinner! I deserve death by a thousand cuts!"

"Su Yun, I hope you'll keep your promise and not exterminate the entire Qin clan!"

*Hum... Hum... Hum...*

The Patriarch Token erupted with towering black radiance, spreading throughout all of Qin City. The countless glowing formation patterns on the war city instantly dimmed.

Then, with bloodshot eyes and violently trembling body, Qin Ying threw the Patriarch Token to Qin Junhua.

"Junhua, I leave the Qin family in your hands." Qin Ying's voice was hoarse.

The moment he surrendered the Patriarch Token, it meant he had completely given up any meaningless resistance.

Of course, even if he had resisted, it would have been useless. Those who would have moved against him wouldn't have been Su Yun, but his former subordinates—the Qin family's direct descendants and heritage powerhouses.

If he had died under the siege of the Qin family's powerhouses, he would have been recorded as a disgrace and traitor, and it likely would have resulted in the main branch being slaughtered.

"If you'd known this would happen, you never should have started." A flash of reluctance passed through Qin Junhua's eyes as she took the Patriarch Token, then immediately turned and flew downward.

She finally understood why Su Yun had said those things to her at the start.

Qin Ying was still her elder brother, after all.

The Qin family was still the place where she had grown up.

But Qin Junhua understood that there was nothing she could do, and she couldn't possibly persuade Su Yun.

The Su family was at a critical juncture. All the power and resources Su Heng and the Su family had accumulated over a millennium in the Federation were concentrated in the Americas.

Right now, the Su family was like walking a tightrope over a cliff—they couldn't afford even the slightest mishap.

The clans dependent on the Su family were numerous, and the Qin family was merely one of the stronger ones.

If they didn't make an example by killing the chicken to scare the monkeys, and other clans followed suit, then no matter how powerful Su Yun was, he couldn't possibly kill his way across the entire world.

And Qin Ying, his own uncle, was the perfect target for such an example.

No matter your background or how deep your connection to the Su family's main branch—even if you were the matriarch's elder brother—betrayal meant death.

"Dark Lady, seize Qin Ying. On the war city walls, execute him by lingchi—death by a thousand cuts. Cast his soul into hellfire to burn for a hundred years." Su Yun's indifferent voice echoed across the heavens.

In an instant, every member of the Qin family shuddered violently.

Though they had anticipated this, when the moment actually arrived, a deep terror still welled up from the depths of their hearts.

Qin Ying was Su Yun's blood uncle—someone who had practically watched Su Yun grow up. Blood was thicker than water.

Yet even so, Su Yun showed no intention of leniency whatsoever. Without hesitation, he had sentenced Qin Ying to death—and not just death, but death by a thousand cuts, execution by lingchi.

*Rumble... Rumble...*

The war city's power retracted. The Thirteen Great Battalions ceased their assault, standing in the firmament as their terrifying killing aura and blood-scent permeated inward, chilling every Qin family direct descendant to the bone.

"Dark Lady obeys."

Dark Lady's figure appeared behind Su Yun. Her gaze was indifferent as she led two Shadow Soul Guards to Qin Ying. She spoke flatly: "Patriarch Qin, surrender peacefully."

"Seal his power. Sever his meridians."

Qin Ying's face was ashen, his eyes filled with blood. Veins bulged on his neck. He watched helplessly as two mere Sky Spirit Realm Shadow Soul Guards approached him, placed sealing restraints on him, then took out specially forged small knives and severed his meridians one by one. Blood sprayed everywhere.

He howled in agony, a sound containing endless suffering, yet he didn't dare resist even slightly.

Finally, drenched in blood, he was carried by the two Shadow Soul Guards up to the top of the war city walls. There, before the entire Qin family main branch—every single person—he was executed by lingchi.

His anguished screams made everyone shiver. They echoed down continuously from the wall, reaching every ear. The Shadow Soul Guards even used satellite broadcast to transmit the images throughout all of Qin Province, letting the millions of people under Qin family rule for over a thousand years witness this scene firsthand.

The shock this brought to the people of Qin Province was unimaginable.

A half-step Supreme Divine Spirit—the most exalted existence they had ever known—was being slowly executed by lingchi, inch by inch.

At this moment, within Qin City, the atmosphere was suffocating. Every member of the Qin family's main branch was deathly pale, their bodies trembling, uncertain what future awaited them.

After all, Qin City had completely fallen under Su Yun's control.

Now they could only hope that Su Yun, considering that the Qin family was his mother's natal clan, would show some leniency and spare them.

But just then, an even more brutal pronouncement reached their ears, turning the faces of a small group of direct descendants utterly ashen:

"Qin Ying's treason was a crime against heaven. Execute his three kinship groups—paternal, maternal, and descendants. All shall be killed, none spared."

"The Qin family committed treason, broke faith, abandoned righteousness. The Thirteen Great Battalions shall assume control of Qin City's war fortress. Anyone who dares cause trouble or resist—their entire clan shall be executed."

"The Qin family's military forces and subordinate powers shall all be temporarily administered by personnel dispatched from the Su family."

Su Yun's expression was indifferent as he issued one command after another.

"Su Yun, you've broken your word! This will destroy the Qin family's very foundation!" One Divine Spirit snarled, his eyes filled with blood, madness in his gaze.

He was one of the Divine Spirits who had earlier helped Qin Ying move against Qin Junhua.

And he belonged to the lineage descended from Qin Ying's father—the paternal kinship group. He was among those to be executed.

"Have you forgotten? When your father became head of the Su family, our Qin family contributed enormously! You're burning bridges after crossing them!"

"Your mother is also from the Qin—"

At that moment, terrifying power descended, sealing all of space. Divine radiance cascaded down, and this Divine Spirit was instantly reduced to ash.

It was Su Zhan who had struck. A single blow had annihilated a Divine Spirit who had ignited his divine fire.

"As a traitor, the proper fate should have been clan extermination and blood-washing of Qin Province. The current Su family heir has already shown mercy, yet you don't know gratitude."

"Anyone else who dares complain—the city will be slaughtered!"

Su Zhan's cold words carried endless killing intent and domineering force, shaking the entire city.

"Seize them all."

Su Yun waved his hand indifferently, ordering the Thirteen Great Battalions to first take control of all the Qin family's main branch powerhouses and direct descendants. Then he turned to Qin Junhua and bowed respectfully: "Mother, the Qin family traitors have all been dealt with. The positions of Qin family Patriarch, Vice Patriarch, and the various important vacant positions shall be appointed by you."

"However, this child has one suggestion he hopes Mother will adopt."

"The Qin family has committed a grave error. I hope the Qin family will actively make amends by contributing merit. The Qin family's heritage powerhouses and clan armies should all be dispatched to the Americas."

"When they return victorious, this child will be able to restore the Qin family's reputation. Mother, what do you think?"

After a moment's silence, Qin Junhua slowly nodded: "Mother agrees with your thinking."

She understood—Su Yun was already showing consideration for the Qin family being her natal clan, giving her the authority to decide.

"This child thanks Mother."

Su Yun smiled faintly.

That day, within Qin City, blood flowed like rivers. Over ten thousand heads fell. The scent of blood permeated everything; the very sky seemed stained with a crimson glow.

...

In the Qin family's great hall, Su Yun and Qin Junhua were discussing how to mobilize Qin family resources to support Su Heng. Suddenly, Yun Ran walked into the hall and respectfully presented a black seal:

"Reporting to the Young Master: a black-robed figure is outside, claiming to be an old acquaintance who wishes to pay respects to you and the Matriarch."

"He also said that once the Matriarch sees this seal, she will definitely meet with him."

Su Yun frowned slightly and cast his gaze toward the black seal, then turned to look at Qin Junhua.

He recognized this seal. It was Qin Junhua's personal seal, symbolizing her identity.

But in his memory, this seal had been lost many years ago.

Just then, Qin Junhua's expression turned icy. She stared at the black seal and murmured: "Yun'er, the Pixiu Clan has actually come to our door."

"This seal is what I gave to a Divine Spirit of the Pixiu Clan back then, to allow them to move freely within human territory without being detected by human powerhouses."

Hearing this name, a cold light flashed through Su Yun's eyes. He instantly understood what this black seal represented.

The Pixiu Clan.

Wasn't that the clan Qin Junhua had colluded with to help Su Heng compete for the patriarch position—the foreign clan that had killed Su Yong?

And within the Azure Federation, colluding with foreign races to harm one's own kind was a capital crime, forbidden by the entire Human Race.

"Mother, the Pixiu Clan's territory is in the Americas, not far from the Barbarian Tribes, isn't that right?" Su Yun asked calmly, his Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes piercing through the heavens to see a figure shrouded in black robes standing in the sky outside the war city.

And at that very moment, the black-robed figure seemed to sense Su Yun's gaze and actually looked up to meet his eyes.

Those were a pair of golden eyes, covered in strange, demonic patterns—cold as a serpent's pupils, yet harboring terrifying authority.

Where he stood, spacetime froze, laws concealed themselves. He seemed to stand above the starry cosmos itself.

This kind of authority—Su Yun had only seen it on Su Heng and Su Zhan.

In other words, this was a Pixiu ferocious beast at the Strongest Divine Spirit level.
