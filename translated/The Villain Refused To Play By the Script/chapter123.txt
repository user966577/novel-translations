Chapter 123: I Don't Want to Go Back to the Xuanyuan Family Tonight

Xuanyuan Li screamed: "Once you're dead, the Xuanyuan family will finally have—"

Suddenly, Xuanyuan Li's voice cut off. A large hand had clamped around his neck.

"Your father couldn't do it. You think you're worthy?"

Su Yun's gaze was indifferent. Rolling chaos power spread from his hand, crushing Xuanyuan Li's body inch by inch, causing the blood vessels throughout his body to explode one by one. Blood mist filled the air.

"Su Yun, you..."

"Aaaaahhhhh..."

Xuanyuan Li struggled frantically, his eyes filled with hysteria, but he couldn't break free in the slightest.

They had both just broken through to the Profound Palace Realm.

Xuanyuan Li had even had his body tempered by Xuanyuan Ze's divine fire and had broken through longer ago than Su Yun. Yet the gap was still unimaginably vast.

Before Su Yun, he had no power to resist whatsoever.

At that moment, Su Yun suddenly leaned close to Xuanyuan Li's ear and whispered: "Oh, and I should thank you for helping me eliminate the remnants of Su Meng's faction.

"Actually, Zhong Bo was always my man."

In an instant, Xuanyuan Li's bloodshot pupils contracted sharply. He whipped his head toward where Zhong Bo stood.

Zhong Bo had already killed himself.

"Su Yun, you villain! You do things so viciously—aren't you afraid of retribution?" Xuanyuan Li used every last bit of his strength to let out one final roar.

Then his body, under the crushing pressure of the rolling chaos power, exploded into a spray of blood mist.

"Retribution?"

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved. His gaze was indifferent, utterly unmoved.

He had never planned on going to heaven.

If this world truly had the so-called heaven of the West, sooner or later he would lead an army to conquer it.

He had heard there were inheritors of Jesus in the West!

At that moment, the system's notification suddenly rang out:

"Congratulations, Host. You have slain a Child of Destiny. Reward: 4,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, Host. You have forced a Destiny Divine Spirit to suicide. Reward: 6,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, Host. You have completely altered the destiny of a Divine Spirit family. Reward: 6,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, Host. Your cultivation speed multiplier has reached 50x. Reward: Chaos Divine Spirit battle technique, Heaven-Splitting Nine Strikes."

"Congratulations—"

The system notifications rang out one after another, causing a flash of pleasant surprise in Su Yun's eyes.

Destiny Divine Spirit—that must refer to Xuanyuan Ze.

Though Xuanyuan Ze's destiny qi was stronger than ordinary people's, it was less than Xuanyuan Li's. Yet it had rewarded him with so many charm points.

It seemed that strength was also an important factor for Children of Destiny.

The stronger the Child of Destiny, the more charm points they could provide—not just the strength of their destiny qi alone.

"Open system panel."

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit Bloodline

Realm: Profound Palace Realm [50,000-zhang mountain-and-river Profound Palace, nurturing 'Spirit Veins']

Cultivation Methods: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art, Divine-Demon Scripture

Weapons: God-Devil Pendant [Divine-Demon Supreme Treasure], Kunlun Mirror [Ancient Supreme Divine Weapon]

Divine Abilities: Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes, Greater Thousand Worlds [Divine ability contained within World Tree Fruit], Heaven-Splitting Nine Strikes [Battle technique comprehended by the Chaos Divine-Demon Pangu]

Charm Points: 66,000 [Resonance with the Stars] [Cultivation speed increased 50x]

"Hiss!"

"Cultivation speed has actually reached 50x!"

Su Yun drew a sharp breath, intense pleasant surprise in his eyes.

After reaching the Profound Palace Realm, he could clearly feel that his cultivation speed had slowed slightly.

Clearly, even with the 40x cultivation speed boost, he couldn't maintain his previous insane rate of power increase at the Profound Palace Realm.

But after reaching 50x—

Su Yun could clearly feel that even when he wasn't actively cultivating, the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art and Divine-Demon Scripture continued to run at full power. His strength was increasing even faster than it had at the Divine Profound Realm.

"Ha ha ha ha! Xuanyuan Li, you truly are my lucky star!"

Su Yun laughed heartily, then began examining the system's explanation of the Heaven-Splitting Nine Strikes. The more he read, the more astounded he became.

The Heaven-Splitting Nine Strikes was actually the supreme battle technique that Pangu, the creation god of Chinese mythology, had created to cleave open heaven and earth. The ninth strike could even recreate and establish a new great world.

Because it was a system reward, he had automatically comprehended the essence of the Heaven-Splitting Nine Strikes upon receiving it.

Yet with his current Profound Palace Realm combat power, he could only use the first strike.

"At the Profound Palace Realm I can only use the first strike. What realm would one need to reach to unleash the ninth strike?" Su Yun murmured to himself, his heart filled with shock.

At that moment, a cautious voice interrupted Su Yun's thoughts.

"Young Master Su Yun, my Xuanyuan family has prepared ten million jin of divine source for you, ten billion jin of source stones, and various heavenly treasures. Is there anything else you require?"

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved. Xuanyuan Chong stood not far away, his expression cautious, as if afraid of angering him.

Clearly, Xuanyuan Chong was extremely afraid that he would report the Blood Altar matter to the Federation.

"Uncle Chong, since that's the case, I, Su Yun, will thank the Xuanyuan family on behalf of my father for your generous support." Su Yun smiled, though his eyes held cold intent.

Seeing this, Xuanyuan Chong's body stiffened. He immediately said: "Councilman Su Heng's campaign on the American continent is the glory of the entire human race. The Xuanyuan family will naturally give our full support.

"As long as the Barbarians refuse to surrender, the Xuanyuan family will support you with everything we have.

"Within a month at most, the Xuanyuan family will conscript at least 200,000 troops and send them to the front lines, to be placed entirely under Councilman Su Heng's command."

The expressions of the Xuanyuan family direct-line powerhouses behind him were also quite tense.

Sending out troops and resources was fine.

What they feared was Su Yun reporting the Blood Altar matter to the Federation.

Moreover, going forward, Xuanyuan Jian had Su Yun's strong support and possessed the Xuanyuan Sword martial soul—the clan-protecting divine weapon. She would very likely inherit the patriarch position.

They didn't dare offend Su Yun anymore.

"Ha ha ha ha..."

Su Yun threw his head back and laughed: "With the Xuanyuan family as such a steadfast ally, my Su family need not worry about conquering the Barbarians and expanding human territory!

"If only those fellows in the Federation's Supreme Council were as far-sighted as Uncle Chong, unconcerned with personal interests, the human race could easily rise and dominate the myriad races!

"Uncle Chong, rest assured. The matter of the Blood Altar—heaven knows, earth knows, you know, I know. No one else will ever know."

Xuanyuan Chong and the assembled Xuanyuan family powerhouses let out a collective sigh of relief. They all bowed to Su Yun, saying: "Young Master Su Yun, we won't disturb your reunion with the Young Master any longer. We shall go and gather resources now."

"Mm." Su Yun nodded indifferently, then turned to look at Xuanyuan Jian. The coldness on his face suddenly gave way to a faint smile as he extended his hand toward her.

A blush rose on Xuanyuan Jian's face as she stepped into Su Yun's embrace, saying softly: "Su Yun, thank you for helping me avenge my grievances."

She was referring, of course, to killing Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li.

For these two people who shared her blood, she felt only hatred—not a shred of affection.

With them dead, there was no one left in the Xuanyuan family who could threaten her and her mother's lives.

"You and I are one. No need for thanks." Su Yun smiled faintly.

"Su Yun, don't worry. I'll soon take control of the Xuanyuan family's power." Xuanyuan Jian said softly.

She understood what Su Yun had always wanted most.

Only by controlling the Xuanyuan family would her position in Su Yun's heart become more secure.

"Good that you understand."

Su Yun smiled. "Next, I need to leave the Imperial Capital and make a trip to Qin Province. If you need any help with anything, go find Su Lie. He'll help you handle it."

"Mm."

Xuanyuan Jian nodded gently. A blush suddenly spread across her face as she said: "Su Yun, I don't want to go back to the Xuanyuan family tonight."

"Ha ha ha ha!"

Su Yun laughed heartily, pulling Xuanyuan Jian into his arms as he stepped into the void rift. "If you don't want to go back, then don't go back tonight."

At this point, there was nothing left in the Xuanyuan family that could make him wary.

"I command the Five Elemental Divine Battalions to completely seal off the Divine Farmer Shennong's relic. Without my command, no one is permitted to take a single step inside. Violators will be executed without mercy."

Su Yun's indifferent voice echoed from within the rift.

Following that, the Five Elemental Divine Battalions, having already received their orders, marched out of the Imperial Capital and arrived at this wilderness location. Using formation patterns, they completely sealed off the newly emerged Divine Farmer Shennong's relic.
