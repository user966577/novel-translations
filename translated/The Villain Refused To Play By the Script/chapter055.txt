Chapter 55: I Have Other Matters. Forgive Me for Not Seeing You Out

"Impudent."

Cold light flashed in Qin Junhua's eyes. She snorted coldly, and instantly Xuanyuan Li felt as though lightning had struck him. He vomited a great mouthful of blood and staggered backward several steps.

Her attitude now was worlds apart from her earlier warm use of "Li'er."

But compared to maintaining friendship with Xuanyuan Ze, controlling the bearer of the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul was clearly far more important.

Which mattered more? How could Qin Junhua not see that clearly?

After all, while the Su family and the Xuanyuan family had been intermarried for generations, that was built on the foundation of both families being among the strongest—cooperation benefiting both, conflict harming both.

But the Xuanyuan family had already declined significantly while the Su family blazed like the noonday sun. Right now, gaining control of Xuanyuan Jian was a once-in-a-millennium opportunity to swallow the Xuanyuan family whole.

Moreover, the Su family had long harbored thoughts of eliminating the Xuanyuan family and taking sole control of the Imperial Capital—they had simply been wary of the Xuanyuan family's formidable reserves.

"Xuanyuan Li, considering your status as the Xuanyuan family's heir, I won't argue with you."

Qin Junhua's gaze was frigid. "But don't forget—this is the Su family. It's not your place to act wild here. No one in the entire Imperial Capital dares speak to me this way."

Her indifferent voice carried tremendous power, exploding like divine thunder in Xuanyuan Li's mind, making his face grow paler still.

"Brother Li, why must you do this?"

Su Yun smiled, though cold light filled his eyes. "Our two families have been close for generations. It was precisely to prevent internal strife within your family that I established this engagement with Jian'er. Why must you react so extremely?"

"Now, Jian'er is my fiancée, the Su family's future matriarch. Surely you don't still intend to kill her?"

"If so, I'm afraid your Xuanyuan family cannot bear the consequences."

"And besides—Jian'er possesses the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul. How many people in your Xuanyuan family would support you in killing her?"

Xuanyuan Li's expression was ugly. "Su Yun, I truly underestimated you all along. You're the one who's a smiling tiger with a knife hidden behind your grin. You fooled everyone."

"But if you think you can use this traitor Xuanyuan Jian to swallow my Xuanyuan family, you're dreaming."

"As long as I, Xuanyuan Li, live, don't even think about it. The elite forces under my command would be the first to refuse."

Xuanyuan Li's words had taken on a hysterical edge—he had completely torn off the mask of civility with Su Yun.

His words were thick with threat.

If they didn't hand over Xuanyuan Jian, he would break with them completely.

After all, the threat Xuanyuan Jian posed was simply too great.

Facing Xuanyuan Li's threats, Su Yun smiled slightly, noncommittal. "Brother Li, our two families have been close for generations, our bond running deep. The future stretches long before us."

Just then, Xuanyuan Ze, who had been silent for some time, suddenly stepped forward with an extremely dark expression. He looked at Su Yun and spoke coldly:

"Su Yun, Qin Junhua—do you truly wish to completely turn against my Xuanyuan family?"

"Though my Xuanyuan family has declined, we remain a divine family. The consequences of such a falling-out are something you likely cannot bear."

This statement made Xuanyuan Ze's position absolutely clear.

Even faced with Xuanyuan Jian's martial soul fully awakening, even though she had become the Su family heir's fiancée with powerful backing, he still refused to change his stance—still resolutely standing on Xuanyuan Li's side.

This declaration carried far more weight than Xuanyuan Li's threats.

Because Xuanyuan Li was merely an heir, while Xuanyuan Ze was the Xuanyuan family's patriarch, wielding enormous authority and representing the Xuanyuan family's supreme power.

He was one of the tiny handful of people standing at China's absolute pinnacle.

In that moment, even Qin Junhua felt her heart skip a beat. She had never imagined Xuanyuan Ze would be this determined—that for Xuanyuan Li's sake, he would even adopt a posture suggesting war with the Su family.

She hesitated.

After all, the Xuanyuan family was still a divine family. If the Xuanyuan Sword projection's appearance didn't shake the family's internal dynamics as much as expected, leading the Xuanyuan family to fight the Su family to mutual destruction—that consequence was more than she could bear.

Within the Su family, the only person who stood as Xuanyuan Ze's equal, the only one who could make such a decision, was Su Heng.

"Ha ha ha, Uncle Ze, what are you saying?"

But at that moment, Su Yun suddenly spoke up, stepping in front of Qin Junhua. His gaze was cold as he locked eyes with Xuanyuan Ze, showing not the slightest retreat before this powerhouse who had ignited his divine fire and wielded supreme authority.

"Uncle Ze, I am the Su family's heir. Today, I will speak for the Su family."

Su Yun's eyes were indifferent. The Young Master Token suddenly appeared in his hand. "I—the Su family—am a divine family. Our lineage has continued for generations. Never once has an heir's fiancée been killed."

"Xuanyuan Jian—no matter what, my Su family will protect her."

As his words fell, Su Yun raised his head toward the space outside the hall and spoke calmly: "Uncle Ze, Brother Li—forgive me for having other matters to attend to. I cannot see you out."

This statement made his intention to show them the door abundantly clear.

"Hummm, hummm, hummm..."

At that moment, outside the hall, terrifying five-elemental divine radiance suddenly erupted. The dreadful power surged straight toward the heavens, shaking wind and clouds alike.

At some point, the Five Elemental Divine Battalions that Su Yun had summoned into the Imperial Capital had arrived in the small world and concealed themselves outside the hall.

Sensing this tremendous power, Xuanyuan Ze's expression changed dramatically.

Su Yun's determination and will were this powerful and resolute—he would protect Xuanyuan Jian at all costs.

Though the Five Divine Generals were each only at the Saint level, when the five joined forces to deploy the Five Elements Divine Formation, they could absolutely threaten his life.

"Li'er, we're leaving."

Xuanyuan Ze's expression was ugly beyond measure. He gave Su Yun one long, deep look, then immediately turned and left with Xuanyuan Li.

He understood—killing Xuanyuan Jian today was already impossible.

"Boy, you will regret today's decision. Not even Su Heng dares treat me this way. The Xuanyuan family's dignity will not be trampled upon."

Xuanyuan Ze's voice carried powerful threat and iron resolve.

As the Xuanyuan family's patriarch, he had been forged in blood and fire. His will was unyielding. Against a mere Su Yun, how could he easily back down?

Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li departed.

Su Yun watched Xuanyuan Li's retreating form with indifferent eyes. Through his Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes, he could see the torrential fortune swirling above Xuanyuan Li's head, vast as rivers and seas.

In the original story, Xuanyuan Li too was an extraordinarily powerful Son of Destiny—a figure who stood at China's pinnacle.

Yet in this moment of departure, a large portion of the fortune above Xuanyuan Li's head silently vanished.

"Congratulations, Host. You have conquered a Daughter of Destiny. Reward: 2,500 Charm Points."

"Congratulations, Host. You have altered a Son of Destiny's fate. Reward: 500 Charm Points."
