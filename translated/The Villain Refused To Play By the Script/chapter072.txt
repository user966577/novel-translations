Chapter 72: Listen to Grand-Uncle, Stop

"Take Su Yihui into custody," Su Yun said flatly.

"Yes, sir!"

The Wind God General looked at Su Yihui with cold, emotionless eyes. "You know my methods. Resistance is meaningless. Surrender peacefully."

With that, he struck out at Su Yihui with one palm. Su Yihui didn't resist violently, allowing the Wind God General to seal his power.

He understood that the thirteen battalion generals under the Patriarch's command were even more powerful and terrifying—battle-hardened from wars against countless tribes, any of them could ignite their divine fire at any moment.

The only reason they hadn't was that once they ignited their divine fire, they would have to enter the Su family's reserves and could no longer lead armies. So they generally didn't choose to break through easily, instead accumulating their foundation.

But even so, they weren't something he could resist.

Resistance would only make his fate more miserable.

"Young Master, I was wrong." Su Yihui's eyes were bloodshot, his words carrying a pleading tone. "I shouldn't have been dissatisfied with the Young Master or tried to overstep my bounds. I promise I'll never do it again. Please give me a chance to reform."

"As long as you don't take back the mines and spare my family, I promise that from now on, the resources submitted from the major mines can increase from the original sixty percent to seventy percent."

Su Yun looked at him with cold indifference, then smiled slightly. "Whether you survive depends on your future behavior."

"Dark Lady, take Su Yihui away with Heavenly King Su Lie. Have him confess everything."

Su Yun's gaze turned cold, and he waved his hand dismissively. "I authorize you to use any means necessary. Don't worry about their status as Su family direct-line members."

The Su family's senior figures were all stunned, feeling cold all over, their hair standing on end.

Any means necessary—what did that mean?

Did it mean torture, or threatening them with their families' lives?

Or even more brutal methods?

Su Yun didn't say it explicitly, but everything was implied. He was determined to wrest the mines from the Su Yihui lineage's control and take command of this enormous source of income.

This man had truly gone mad.

Did he intend to dominate the Su family single-handedly, ignoring all the direct-line elders at headquarters?

"Dark Lady obeys."

Dark Lady, the leader of the Shadow Soul Guard, walked into the hall from the void. After bowing to Su Yun, she ignored the murderous glares from the Su family's senior figures.

"Young Master, Su Lie will take his leave now."

Su Lie bowed to Su Yun, then together with Dark Lady and the Wind God General, escorted Su Yihui away.

"Stop right there!"

At that moment, an older direct-line elder roared and stepped forward, unleashing a terrifying Saint-level aura. His voice was low and hoarse, filled with murderous intent. "Are all of you really going to watch this junior strip away everything our ancestors accumulated?"

He was a direct-line member of the Su family headquarters, an elder-generation Federation Heavenly King who had once managed the Su family's internal logistics. Though he had stepped down, he still wielded enormous influence both in the Federation and within the family.

"Let's all attack together! I refuse to believe this little beast would dare—"

"Kill him," Su Yun said softly.

In that instant, a sword gleam of cold light tore through the sky, passing by silently, directly severing his head. Blood sprayed forth.

His head fell to the ground, rolling continuously, leaving a trail of blood on the floor until it came to rest at Su Hong's feet.

In that moment, the Su family's senior figures felt ice cold, their hair standing on end.

Su Jian appeared calmly behind Su Yun, slowly lowering his two fingers.

Using fingers as a sword, he had killed a peak Saint-level elder Heavenly King with a single strike.

Only a supreme powerhouse who had ignited their divine fire could accomplish this.

"He actually dared to kill a direct-line powerhouse."

"Madness. Complete madness."

In that moment, the direct-line powerhouses trembled with fear.

For many years, there had been an unwritten rule within the Su family.

The senior figures standing at the apex, especially direct-line members, had a special privilege: no matter how great their crimes, they could not be executed.

Not for any particular reason—simply because they were direct descendants of the Su family's founder.

They enjoyed vast resources, endless power, and extremely high status, and they even had immunity from death.

Never mind killing a Heavenly King-level direct-line member—even killing Su Ying, the Chaotic Sky King's daughter, had been unprecedented.

That was why these direct-line members were so furious. Today you, Su Yun, dared to have your subordinates torture Su Ying to death. Tomorrow, would you actually make a move against direct-line elders?

And now, Su Yun had actually killed one right before their eyes.

Through his actions, he was telling them: there was no safety in numbers, and there was no immunity from death.

"This man conspired with the Xuanyuan family, working with them inside and out, attempting to overthrow my father's position as Patriarch. That is the crime of treason."

Su Yun looked up at the Thunder God General and said coldly, "I order that none of his bloodline be spared."

"Your subordinate obeys!"

The Thunder God General immediately knelt to receive the order. Then the forces that had surrounded this elder Heavenly King's residence drove their ancient war chariots into the estate.

Thunder roared across the sky, dark clouds rolled, and terrifying sounds of killing filled the air. Boundless killing intent filled everyone's vision.

In that moment, the entire Su family was suffocating, listening to the sounds of slaughter ringing in their ears.

This was the Su family headquarters—the heart of the Su family, where all the direct-line elders resided. A single stamp of their feet could shake the entire world.

For so many years, this many people had never died within the Su family headquarters.

An entire direct-line Heavenly King's estate seemed about to be completely annihilated.

Simply because his family had marriage ties with the Xuanyuan family. Simply because they had business connections.

Faintly, they could hear the crying and screaming from within the estate, the terrified shouts, and the powerless resistance of those inside against the Thunder God Battalion.

But the Eighteen Battalions were among the Su family's most powerful forces. Even a single battalion possessed the terrifying power to exterminate ancient tribes. How could a mere Heavenly King's estate possibly resist?

In that moment, the direct-line elders in the hall felt cold all over.

This Su Yun was truly a madman.

In his eyes, there seemed to be nothing he wouldn't dare do, no rules that could restrain him.

He truly dared to kill—wantonly and without restraint.

"Enough. This is truly enough."

At that moment, Su Hong—who had remained silent since Su Yun's arrival, this elder-generation direct-line powerhouse who had ignited his divine fire—finally spoke.

Su Hong stepped forward, his body wreathed in the terrifying divine might of a supreme powerhouse. Looking at Su Yun, his voice was low:

"Su Yun, even your father wouldn't dare, wouldn't so wantonly slaughter the direct-line members of the headquarters."

"Listen to your grand-uncle—stop!"

"Let's end things here. Let bygones be bygones. We acknowledge your position as Su family heir. From now on, we will fully cooperate with you."
