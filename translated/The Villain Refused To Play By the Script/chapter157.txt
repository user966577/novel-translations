Chapter 157: Where Does Your Nobility Come From?

"The aura of a Strongest Divine Spirit."

"Buddha Ancestor Shitian has finally appeared."

Instantly, countless sect powerhouses felt their hearts surge with emotion.

At this moment, Su Yun also witnessed this scene. His eyes narrowed slightly, a trace of cold cruelty flashing through them.

Buddha Ancestor Shitian was one of China's six Strongest Divine Spirits, but his seniority far exceeded Su Heng's—he was nearly a hundred years older, only slightly younger than Su Zhan.

Following the trajectory of those past Strongest Divine Spirits, in not too many years, he would enter the starry void to seek a way to break through beyond the Strongest Divine Spirit realm.

"I hope you know what's good for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't mind replicating the Tang Dynasty's Buddhist persecution." Su Yun sneered internally.

Now that he controlled the armies of the Su, Xuanyuan, and Ouyang families, and had the Celestial Maiden Sect and Kunlun Daoist Sect in his grasp, destroying the Buddhist Sect—if not as easy as flipping his palm—was at least as simple as reaching into a bag.

At this moment, a golden Buddha a thousand zhang tall appeared in the firmament. His gaze was empty yet serene, as if he had seen through all mortal dust. His voice rumbled: "Amitabha. My Buddha is merciful. Patron Su Yun, your grand ambitions are truly admirable.

The Buddhist Sect, though we preach about the bitter sea being boundless and transcending the mortal world, the Buddha also has his wrathful diamond aspect."

Instantly, the eyes of countless powerhouses throughout the mountain ranges lit up. Was this a warning to Su Yun?

At this point, Buddha Ancestor Shitian continued: "The Buddhist Sect, though a worldly-transcendent sect, is also a sect of China. Patron Su Heng spares nothing of himself, campaigning on the American continent, battling fiercely against the foreign races. This poor monk is deeply moved.

This poor monk agrees with Sect Master Ruoyi and Vice Sect Master True Feather's words. In a few days, I shall dispatch twenty thousand Buddhist disciples, a hundred holy monks, and twenty Divine Buddhas, bringing our sect's Ancient Buddha Weapon, the Diamond Pestle, to accompany Sect Master Ruoyi to the American continent and campaign against the Barbarian Tribe."

"Amitabha. Patron Su Yun, is this acceptable to you?" Buddha Ancestor Shitian looked at Su Yun with a slight smile.

"The Buddhist Sect also demonstrates great righteousness. Su Yun is impressed. When I have time, I shall personally visit the Buddha Ancestor." Su Yun smiled indifferently.

"Amitabha. As long as it's not a million-strong army."

Buddha Ancestor Shitian's magnificent golden form vanished into the air.

In this moment, Su Yun smiled. This bald donkey was quite sensible—a clear-headed Buddha who understood why he had brought a million-strong army to the mountain ranges.

"What the hell!"

"Has Buddha Ancestor Shitian gone mad?"

"He actually wants to join the Su family in campaigning against the Barbarian Tribe. What benefit does this bring to the Buddhist Sect?"

"Could it be that he too was intimidated by Su Yun?"

In this moment, countless sect powerhouses stared in disbelief, thinking Buddha Ancestor Shitian must have lost his mind.

And just then, a deep voice once again echoed through the mountain ranges:

"To establish the heart of heaven and earth, to establish the destiny of the people, to create eternal peace for all generations—the words of our ancestors, we descendants never dare forget."

"Young Master Su Yun, our Confucian School shall dispatch thirty thousand scholars, thirty Great Confucians, bearing the Sage's Stele, to proceed to the American continent."

With those words, the voice fell silent again, not personally manifesting as the Buddha Ancestor had.

Yet that vast, transcendent presence and powerful words had already revealed his identity.

The Confucian Patriarch, currently China's most ancient Strongest Divine Spirit. Having lived nearly five hundred years without dying, he was a legend of China.

He was the only Human Race Strongest Divine Spirit to have lived past three hundred years in the thousand years since spiritual qi resurged.

A cold glint flashed through Su Yun's eyes, the corner of his mouth curving slightly.

In the original novel, this Confucian Patriarch had been the first existence in China to break through Strongest Divine Spirit and ascend to Celestial God status after the world's revival and the great change in rules.

Even Ye Ling, due to his connections with the Demon Race, had suffered setbacks at his hands.

In this moment, the many powerhouses throughout the mountain ranges had become almost numb.

The Buddha Ancestor and Confucian Patriarch had both spoken up, being the first to respond to Su Yun's call. Did they still dare refuse? Unless they no longer wanted to survive in China.

"Our Legalist School..."

...

One powerful worldly-transcendent sect after another spoke up, responding to the call of the Celestial Maiden Sect and Kunlun Daoist Sect.

"Sects willing to help the Su family, uphold China's spirit, and campaign against the Barbarian Tribe may register at the Celestial Maiden Sect or the Kunlun Daoist Sect." An Ruoyi's voice, carrying a hint of amusement, echoed through the mountain ranges.

...

Deep within the Celestial Maiden Sect, beneath the mountains, lay a vast underground palace.

A middle-aged man with a calm expression emerged from the void, using the God-Devil Pendant to control a golden-haired woman who knelt before Su Yun:

"Su Jian greets the Young Master. As commanded, I have brought Athena."

"Uncle Su Jian, please rise." Su Yun smiled faintly.

"Su Yun, you're finally willing to see me." Athena's voice was cold and low, her gaze sharp and unblinking as she looked at Su Yun, then turned to glance at An Ruoyi and True Feather Divine Spirit, a flash of wariness in her eyes.

With her supreme intellect—known as the Goddess of War and Wisdom—she could tell at a glance that these two Strongest Divine Spirits treated Su Yun with great respect.

The speed at which Su Yun's power was expanding made even her slightly alarmed.

Could this man truly manage to unify China's strength and campaign against the Barbarian Tribe?

This was something that even generations of God King Zeus had failed to accomplish. Mount Olympus, for all its power, couldn't unify the entire West.

Athena spoke gravely: "Su Yun, we're not actually enemies. We can discuss this properly."

"Oh? Discuss what? Weren't you trying to assassinate me?" Su Yun smiled indifferently.

"I can't kill you, and you don't dare kill me, so we should be able to discuss terms now." Athena spoke coldly: "I am a goddess of Mount Olympus, and moreover, a divine servant of the supreme God King of the God Race. I'm a Council Member of the Federation Supreme Council. If you dare kill me, not only will Mount Olympus be enraged, the entire West will be enraged. The God Race won't spare the Su family either. When that time comes, not even the Federation will be able to protect you."

Though severely wounded, her War Spear taken, and firmly suppressed by Su Jian using the God-Devil Pendant, Athena remained incomparably proud.

Because she was a divine servant of the God Race's supreme God King—she couldn't possibly bow her head to the barbaric, lowly Human Race, much less to the most barbaric people of China.

"Hahahaha! Well said, well spoken. I like it."

*Clap, clap, clap...*

After his laughter subsided, Su Yun's gaze turned indifferent. Moving like lightning, he delivered dozens of slaps to Athena's face in succession, then kicked her hard in the stomach. Already severely injured, Athena's face went even paler as she spat out a mouthful of blood.

"Su Yun, you..." Athena shouted in rage. This insignificant ant—she had been speaking nicely, and he dared treat her like this?

"Athena, you seem to have forgotten. I said I would make you willingly lie in my bed, not that I don't dare kill you."

"I'm not killing you because I want to taste what a goddess is like—because you still have value for me to use."

"But that is not the reason you can act noble before me." Su Yun sneered coldly.

At this moment, An Ruoyi and True Feather Divine Spirit simultaneously made their move, unleashing rolling divine might that caused the entire vast underground palace to tremble.
