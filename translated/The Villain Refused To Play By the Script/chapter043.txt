Chapter 43: Does Your Family Even Have Any Affection Left?

"You won't fall in love with me?" For some reason, Xuanyuan Jian latched onto this phrase first, her eyes dimming slightly.

This was a man whose heart had been thoroughly broken by Liu Ting. Otherwise, he would never have said such words.

Su Yun had completely shattered her psychological defenses.

Su Yun smiled. "Yes, I won't fall in love with you. But you also need my existence. So think it over carefully. Think about your mother, trapped in that dangerous situation—after all, she's just a neglected concubine."

"If I agree to this engagement, what would I need to do?" Xuanyuan Jian asked instinctively.

Su Yun smiled faintly. "What you need to do is simple: play along with me."

"Play along? What do you mean?" Xuanyuan Jian was confused.

"It means everything—including that kind of relationship—just like a real husband and wife, no different." Su Yun's expression remained calm.

Instantly, Xuanyuan Jian's face flushed crimson. Her mind reeled from an even more massive shock as she erupted in fury: "Su Yun, you scoundrel! You shameless—I..."

"Miss Xuanyuan, wait. There's no need to get angry or refuse just yet."

Su Yun smiled coldly, draping his arms over the back of the sofa. "You should understand that given my status, I'll inevitably need to attend various occasions with a woman by my side to keep up appearances.

"The way things were with Liu Ting before already cost me all my face. That's part of why I want to enter an engagement with you.

"But if it's like before with Liu Ting, where she wouldn't even let me touch her, people would see through us eventually. Then what would be the point of our engagement? Once word got out, where would I put my face?

"Our arrangement would just be playing our roles. Once I truly ascend to the position of Su family patriarch, you can leave whenever you want.

"Getting engaged to me would bring you endless benefits too.

"So I hope you'll think it over carefully. After all, for cultivators with our long lifespans, whether our bodies are pure or whether it's our first time really isn't that important."

"Madman!"

Xuanyuan Jian's mind was in chaos. Her face had flushed so red it seemed blood might drip from it. She cursed him and turned to storm out of the room.

She had only come to express her thanks and perhaps get acquainted with Su Yun. She never imagined it would end like this.

Su Yun's lips curved up as a cold glint appeared in his eyes.

Only now had the scheme he'd been laying begun to unfold.

Though Xuanyuan Jian was beautiful and he valued her highly, from start to finish, she was merely a chess piece on his board—one that could help him infiltrate the Xuanyuan family from within.

Xuanyuan Li was his true target.

In the original story, Xuanyuan Li controlled the Xuanyuan family with ruthless, decisive methods. Combined with Xuanyuan Jian's formidable strength, they had caused the Xuanyuan family to rise rapidly.

In this life, he naturally couldn't allow that to happen. He needed to make the Xuanyuan family tear itself apart from within.

And Su Yun believed that once she calmed down, Xuanyuan Jian would carefully consider this proposal. After all, she couldn't see the future, and her current situation was extremely dangerous.

At the very least, after the assassination attempt on Xuanyuan Li failed, Xuanyuan Jian would definitely make the right choice.

Now he just needed to wait for Ye Ling and Su Meng to make their move against Xuanyuan Li.

"Congratulations, Host. For twisting the fates of the Daughter of Destiny and the Son of Destiny, you are rewarded with 1,500 Charm Points."

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit Bloodline

Realm: Divine Profound Realm [Nine Dragons' Power]

Cultivation Method: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art

Weapon: Incomplete God-Devil Pendant [God-Devil Supreme Treasure]

Charm Value: 5,000 [Flowers Bloom at Sight, Can Communicate with All Things] [Cultivation Speed Increased Tenfold]

"As expected of Ye Ling, the Son of Destiny, and the original story's strongest female Divine Spirit, the Daughter of Destiny. One encounter earned me 1,500 Charm Points."

"But this is only the beginning."

Su Yun's lips curved up. His eyes held almost no emotion as he waved for Yun Ran to come in and help him change clothes.

What followed was a scene that need not be described.

...

After leaving the room, Xuanyuan Jian closed the door behind her, her face flushed, her breathing rapid.

"Jian'er, what did you and Su Yun talk about? Did he bully you?"

Liu Ting put on an angry front. "Let me go argue with him on your behalf. It's one thing for him to bully me, but to bully you too..."

"Sister Ting, Su Yun didn't bully me."

Xuanyuan Jian stopped Liu Ting. Her face still red, she said: "Su Yun told me he wants to get engaged to me."

The moment she heard this, Liu Ting froze. Unconsciously, she clutched the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine contract tightly in her hand.

Heartache!

A pain that tore at her heart and lungs, making it impossible to breathe.

Even though she had anticipated this, she hadn't expected it to come so quickly.

And from Xuanyuan Jian's flushed face, Liu Ting could tell that Xuanyuan Jian didn't feel particularly resistant toward Su Yun.

She herself had played a huge role in this.

She had personally pushed the man she loved most and her closest friend together with her own hands.

"Jian'er, congratulations."

Liu Ting forced a smile. "You and Su Yun are perfect for each other. If you two end up together, your sister will sincerely wish you happiness."

"Really?"

Xuanyuan Jian suddenly looked up. Liu Ting was startled—she could clearly see anticipation in Xuanyuan Jian's eyes.

Su Yun's engagement proposal must have held tremendous appeal for Xuanyuan Jian.

Liu Ting turned away, her smile strained. "Of course. Your sister wronged Su Yun and hurt him. Now that my closest friend can help me take care of him, I couldn't be happier."

Liu Ting was certain Su Yun was watching this very scene. If she showed even the slightest crack, if Xuanyuan Jian grew suspicious...

Then tomorrow would mark the beginning of the Liu family's destruction.

She didn't dare.

"Sister Ting, you're so good to me."

Xuanyuan Jian grew thoughtful, then suddenly broke into a smile. "But I don't have plans for that yet. Have you forgotten about me, Ye Ling, and Su Meng?"

"I do feel some attraction toward Su Yun, but an engagement right now is too fast. I can't accept it."

"I want to resolve all these troublesome matters around me first, then slowly begin things with Su Yun."

"Sister Ting, you were right. Su Yun really is a wonderful man."

As she spoke, Xuanyuan Jian reached out to hook her arm through Liu Ting's, and together they walked out of the auction house. Her eyes were full of smiles, like a young woman who had just fallen in love.

Who could have imagined that this girl was the exceptionally talented second young miss of the Xuanyuan family?

...

"Su Yun, stop right there."

The moment he stepped through the Su family's gates, an angry female voice rang out, making Su Yun pause mid-stride.

He turned to look.

It was a woman with delicate features, fair and tender skin, and an excellent figure.

She appeared to be around thirty, but cultivation had preserved her appearance at around twenty, while retaining a thirty-year-old woman's allure. Quite attractive.

"Sister Ying, it's been a while!" Su Yun smiled slightly, his expression calm.

Su Ying—the granddaughter of Su Yun's grandfather's younger brother. She was also a direct descendant. Her father was a cousin of Su Heng, a Saint-level powerhouse who had been titled Heavenly King by the Federation. Very powerful, with high status in the Su family.

From what he knew, Su Ying's branch had previously been close to Su Yong—Su Meng's father—but had an ordinary relationship with his own father.

Perhaps because of their close blood ties, after Su Heng became patriarch, he hadn't purged Su Ying's branch along with the others.

"Don't call me sister. I don't have a brother like you."

Su Ying's face was filled with anger, her eyes cold as she berated him directly: "Does your family even have any affection left?"

"Su Meng has already been suppressed to that extent by you all. He's no threat to your position anymore. He finally managed to make some small progress through his own efforts, and yet you still won't leave him alone. You beat him half to death and shattered his dao heart."

"A brother like you—I, Su Ying, can't afford to have."

What followed was a torrent of reprimands from Su Ying.
