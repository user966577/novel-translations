Chapter 61: Shock and Fury

"Slap!"

In the great hall of the Xuanyuan family, Xuanyuan Ze sat in the seat of honor and slammed his palm heavily on the table. His eyes blazed with fury as he swept his gaze across the assembled elder powerhouses:

"All of you, shut your mouths! Do you still have any regard for me as your patriarch?"

"Don't forget—I'm not dead yet. It's not your place to make decisions for the Xuanyuan family."

"Su Yun was outrageously arrogant. Not only did he shelter Xuanyuan Jian and Su Meng—the ones who tried to assassinate my son, the Xuanyuan family's heir—he even drove me and my son out of the Su family compound. This is trampling upon the Xuanyuan family's dignity. It's humiliation!"

"If we negotiate peace with the Su family, how will our Xuanyuan family have any face left to stand upon Azure Star? Don't forget—we Xuanyuan family are also a divine clan standing at Azure Star's pinnacle. How can we bow our heads to the Su family?"

Xuanyuan Ze's roaring voice shook the heavens, causing the hall built of divine gold to tremble. It nearly collapsed this edifice that had stood for over a thousand years. Dense divine formation patterns appeared to barely stabilize the great hall.

One could hardly imagine the fury burning in Xuanyuan Ze's heart at this moment.

These Xuanyuan family Heavenly Kings, Kings, Saints, and even the elder powerhouses who had awakened from the reserves—nearly half of them opposed escalating tensions with the Su family. Some even supported the engagement between Xuanyuan Jian and Su Yun, believing it would bring enormous benefits to the Xuanyuan family.

Under their various influences, the orders he had issued from Xuanyuan family headquarters to forces around the world had been delayed by various means. They had failed to pose much threat to the Su family or provide support to those direct-line powerhouses within the Su family whose loyalties leaned toward the Xuanyuan side.

Xuanyuan Li, seated at his father's right hand, also wore an expression dark as iron. He wished he could be like Su Yun—using the heir's token to summon the Xuanyuan family's armies and kill all these people.

But he didn't dare.

Because his father wasn't as domineering as Su Yun's father, and his strength was far inferior. This meant Xuanyuan Li lacked sufficient prestige within the Xuanyuan family. He needed a faction's support to secure his position as heir.

Moreover, this time many ancient powerhouses from the Xuanyuan family's reserves had awakened.

They were extremely displeased that the clan-guarding divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword had been lost. This led them to place high hopes on Xuanyuan Jian, who possessed the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul, making them even less supportive of Xuanyuan Ze's actions.

"Why don't you all understand? One step back leads to another step back. If we retreat one step, the Su family will advance one step. Their goal is to use Xuanyuan Jian to slowly devour our Xuanyuan family, piece by piece, and eventually swallow us whole."

"You old fossils who've lived for hundreds of years—can't you even see something this obvious?"

Xuanyuan Li growled, his eyes filled with extreme fury.

But though he was the heir, he was too young, his strength insufficient, his prestige far from enough. His words carried little weight.

A tall, powerful middle-aged man glanced at Xuanyuan Li with a contemptuous smile. "Swallow our Xuanyuan family? Young Master, you're being far too paranoid."

He sat in the position to Xuanyuan Ze's left, only three seats away from the patriarch. The seats before him were all occupied by elder powerhouses who had awakened from the reserves—one could imagine how high his status was.

This was Xuanyuan Ze's cousin, named Xuanyuan Chong. He was direct-line among the direct-line, a Saint-level powerhouse just one step away from igniting his divine fire. His title was Divine Sword Heavenly King. His military achievements were outstanding, and he held an important position in the Federation military's logistics department—his rank was even higher than Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie's. Thus, his status in the Xuanyuan family was second only to Patriarch Xuanyuan Ze, and his prestige was extremely high.

Most importantly, everyone knew that Xuanyuan Chong had married a direct-line woman from the Su family. His deep connections to the Su family were well known—his rise to a high position in the Federation was inseparable from the Su family's support.

Therefore, he was also one of the main leaders advocating for negotiations with the Su family and opposing war.

"Our Xuanyuan family has risen since the beginning of Azure Star's spiritual energy revival. We've stood at Azure Star's pinnacle for fifteen hundred years, with forces and industries across the world and countless supporters in the Federation. Our roots run deep."

"The Su family wants to swallow our Xuanyuan family? They don't have that big an appetite."

Xuanyuan Chong laughed coldly, then suddenly addressed the assembly: "Moreover, according to information passed to me by my old friend in the Su family, Swordless Heavenly King Su Jian—from start to finish, the Su family has been very respectful to the patriarch and young master, showing them full courtesy."

"Furthermore, Su family's Young Master Su Yun stated plainly that the reason he took Xuanyuan Jian as his fiancée was precisely because the Su family and our Xuanyuan family have been intermarried for generations. He wanted to help our Xuanyuan family recover the Xuanyuan Sword."

"An outsider shows such consideration, yet our own patriarch—he discovered the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul long ago. But to protect the young master's position as heir, he personally sealed the martial soul, preventing us from discovering her ability to communicate with our clan-guarding divine weapon."

"When he discovered the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul had broken through its seal, he flew into a rage. He actually tore off all pretense with Qin Junhua and Su Yun, making wild threats."

Instantly, upon hearing these words, the hall erupted in chaos. Many elder powerhouses began whispering among themselves, deeply displeased with Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li.

At this moment, Xuanyuan Chong laughed coldly and looked at Xuanyuan Ze, whose expression had turned extremely ugly. "Patriarch, Young Master—am I not speaking the truth?"

"Xuanyuan Chong, you're spouting nonsense! It was the Su family who provoked us first, then drove my father and me out of their compound!"

Xuanyuan Ze's expression was dark as he glared furiously at Xuanyuan Chong.

"The rights and wrongs of what happened then—you know them well in your heart, Patriarch."

Xuanyuan Chong laughed coldly, then suddenly bowed respectfully to a golden-robed elder seated just below Xuanyuan Ze. "Ancestor, what is your opinion on this matter?"

The moment Xuanyuan Chong spoke these words, the hall fell instantly silent. All eyes turned to this elder.

He was the biological son of the Xuanyuan family's founding ancestor—the second son, Xuanyuan Shen. A true Divine Spirit-level powerhouse who had sealed himself within the reserves, having lived for over fifteen hundred years.

Even successive Xuanyuan family patriarchs hadn't known that a Divine Son of the founding ancestor still survived within the reserves. Xuanyuan Ze was no exception.

This elder had kept his eyes closed the entire time, seemingly deaf to the arguments around him.

"They've arrived!"

Suddenly, the elder opened his eyes. Divine light flashed within them, seeming to pierce through the void.

At that moment, Su Yun emerged from the void with an indifferent expression, Xuanyuan Jian at his side. Behind them followed two expressionless middle-aged men radiating authority.

One was Swordless Heavenly King, Su Jian.

The other was actually Chaos Heavenly King, Su Lie. He stood respectfully behind Su Yun's left side, showing his reverence for the Su family's Young Master.

These were two powerhouses just one step away from igniting their divine fire.

Su Jian in particular was known as the strongest person in China beneath the Divine Spirits—his strength unfathomably deep.

Their appearance caused even Xuanyuan Ze's eyes to flash with surprise before his expression immediately darkened.

After all, Su Lie's wife was his own younger sister, Xuanyuan Ya. She had always received enormous benefits from the Xuanyuan family.

Moreover, Su Lie's daughter—his niece Su Ying—had been cruelly tortured to death by Su Yun.

He had assumed Su Lie would be the leading figure among the Su family's direct line opposing Su Yun.

But Su Lie's appearance here sent him an extremely ominous signal.
