Chapter 84: Shockwaves

"Since you're willing to pledge loyalty to me, taking the Heart Demon Pill should have no effect on you."

Su Yun's lips curved slightly, his gaze cold. "Besides, I promised your master I wouldn't kill you for these three days—but only that I wouldn't kill you. I have countless methods to cripple you, to make your life worse than death."

He was determined to have True Feather Divine Spirit. How could he allow Li Yi to continue hovering around her so easily?

And Su Yayue was even more important to him—she was the most crucial aid in his plan to conquer the Daoist sects. Since he had decided to send Su Yayue to the Daoist sects, he naturally needed to create a perfect environment for her growth.

He absolutely wouldn't allow anyone to threaten Su Yayue.

Moreover, Li Yi was a Child of Destiny, which would be greatly beneficial to his charm value growth. There was no way he would let Li Yi go so easily.

"Make your choice."

Having said this, Su Yun waved his hand, his eyes revealing a trace of cruelty. "Dark Lady, take him away. Let him know the consequences of having designs on my woman."

Hearing Su Yun call her his woman, Su Yayue's face flushed. Watching Su Yun's utterly domineering manner, her gaze became somewhat intoxicated.

This was simply a perfect man.

Peerless talent, peerless background, and such perfect looks.

This kind of man was exactly what she had always tirelessly pursued.

If she could become Su Yun's woman, she would have nothing to worry about for the rest of her life, and her adoptive parents would benefit immensely too.

As for possibly being sent to the Kunlun Daoist Sect by Su Yun, Su Yayue felt no resistance whatsoever.

This proved that she had value to Su Yun, rather than being a mere ornament.

In Su Yun's personal guard battalion, Su Yayue had seen too many terrifying prodigies, each one far more powerful than herself.

If she had no value to Su Yun, that would truly make her anxious.

"Ahhh..."

At this moment, Li Yi had already been taken away by Dark Lady. From outside the villa came his anguished screams, filled with boundless agony, the pain piercing to the bone, making listeners' hair stand on end.

After all, the Shadow Soul Guards had once been known as hell, an intelligence organization built single-handedly by Qin Junhua.

Such organizations were most skilled in torture and methods of tormenting people.

Back then, Su Lie's daughter Su Ying had been tortured to death by Dark Lady, her body barely recognizable as human when she died.

"No, don't cripple me! I'll take the Heart Demon Pill, I'll take it..."

Li Yi's voice, filled with infinite terror, came from outside. After a brief pause, his hoarse voice carried in: "I, Li Yi, swear by my heart demon to pledge lifelong loyalty to Young Master Su Yun, never to betray him. If I violate this oath, may I suffer the torment of ten thousand insects devouring my heart and die a terrible death."

As his words fell, the system's voice suddenly sounded.

"Congratulations, host. For subduing a Child of Destiny and altering the fate of a powerful Daughter of Destiny, reward: 3,500 charm points."

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit Bloodline

Realm: Divine Profound Realm [100 Dragon Power]

Cultivation Methods: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art, God-Devil Scripture

Weapons: God-Devil Pendant [God-Devil Supreme Treasure], Kunlun Mirror [Ancient Supreme Divine Weapon]

Divine Ability: Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes

Charm Value: 27,500 [Mountains and Rivers Pale] [Cultivation speed increased 28x]

Looking at the system panel, a flash of delight passed through Su Yun's eyes. His cultivation speed had actually increased by another two times.

But he wasn't surprised.

After all, Li Yi was also a Child of Destiny, and one extremely important to his master True Feather Divine Spirit, with significant influence over her.

Subduing him meant also strongly influencing the fate of True Feather Divine Spirit, that Daughter of Destiny.

Combined, a reward of 3,500 charm points wasn't strange at all.

"The benefits of powerful charm value are becoming more apparent," Su Yun's lips curved slightly.

He had seen how True Feather Divine Spirit looked at him just now.

He had proposed such conditions, yet this dignified Divine Spirit of a Daoist sect, with her noble status, hadn't felt the slightest disgust toward him. The terrifying effect of powerful charm value was clear to see.

"Yayue, you may go now."

"Someone, summon Liu Ting."

Su Yun smiled slightly, then waved to Yun Ran, having her kneel before him.

A flush crossed Yun Ran's face, and she immediately complied.

Hearing Su Yun tell her to leave, Su Yayue understood what he was about to do. A flash of disappointment crossed her eyes, but she still complied.

She also understood that Su Yun was sending her away for her own good.

After all, she possessed the Innate Dao Body, completely different from Yun Ran's Heavenly Seduction Body or Liu Ting's Sunflower Water Physique. Doing such things now would be detrimental to her future entry into the Daoist sect.

...

Soon, the three days of the Imperial Capital lockdown passed.

The Su family headquarters' Eighteen Battalions withdrew from the Imperial Capital in an orderly manner, and the Imperial Capital quickly returned to its original prosperity as China's center—even more flourishing than before.

This was because powerful figures from both the Su family and the Xuanyuan family, stationed throughout the world, had all gathered in the Imperial Capital.

Experts from two Divine Spirit families were gathered together—an astounding sight. Terrifying auras vast as the sea occasionally swept across the sky, making countless people feel as if they were suffocating.

Occasionally, an even more majestic and noble aura would flash across the sky and enter the Su family compound.

These were supreme powerhouses who had ignited their divine fire.

Countless families in the Imperial Capital were terrified, unable to understand what great move the two Divine Spirit families were planning, having summoned so many powerhouses.

Could something earth-shaking be about to happen?

And at that moment, shocking news spread throughout the Imperial Capital, then rapidly throughout all of China and the entire world.

"The Xuanyuan family has decided to establish Xuanyuan Ze's daughter, Xuanyuan Jian, as alternate heir."

"Furthermore, today, Xuanyuan Jian will hold an engagement ceremony with the Su family Young Master. The Xuanyuan family has gathered numerous powerhouses to congratulate the Su family, and welcomes all powerful figures and elders of the Imperial Capital to attend as guests."

In an instant, these two pieces of news stirred up towering waves among all the powerful families in China and around the world.

This was especially shocking for the major clans in the Imperial Capital.

After all, the Imperial Capital was China's center and the only place where two Divine Spirit families resided.

The two Divine Spirit families balanced each other, which was what allowed the Imperial Capital to flourish and countless great clans to gather here.

Yet the Xuanyuan family had suddenly made this unprecedented decision, establishing a daughter born of a concubine as alternate heir and marrying her to Su Yun.

Though the two Divine Spirit families had intermarried for generations, everyone understood this was merely surface harmony.

"Secular sects have alternate heirs because they're organized around faith rather than bloodline," an ancient Saint murmured to himself.

"But families are bound by blood. To prevent internal strife, no family in the entire world has ever established an alternate heir."

"Is the Xuanyuan family submitting to the Su family?"

"What happened in these three days?"

"By marrying the alternate heir to the Su family, aren't they giving the Su family an opportunity to support Xuanyuan Jian becoming family head and completely controlling the Xuanyuan family?"

"Impossible. Absolutely impossible. The Xuanyuan family has a thousand-year heritage. How could they make such a foolish decision?"

"If the Su family absorbs the Xuanyuan family—if the two ancient Divine Spirit families combine forces—an unprecedented colossus will be born in China, creating earth-shaking changes to the nation's landscape."
