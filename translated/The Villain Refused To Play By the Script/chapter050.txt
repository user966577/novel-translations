Chapter 50: Please, Let Me Go

Su Meng's voice was heartrending, filled with endless anguish.

He had never imagined that the elder he trusted most, the one he respected most, would turn against him at the most critical moment, defecting to Xuanyuan Li. The assassination plan had fallen apart completely.

Because of Steward Zhong's betrayal, Xuanyuan Li had learned of their plans in advance and had prepared everything, turning their ambush into a counter-ambush.

The trump cards his father Su Yong had left him—in order to protect his escape—had all been killed or wounded.

After this battle, he had truly become utterly alone.

Ye Ling and Xuanyuan Jian, the two best allies he had found, were now missing, their fates unknown.

His plan to help Xuanyuan Jian become the Xuanyuan family's heir and then assist him against Su Yun had also completely fallen through.

More than a decade of effort, all destroyed in a single day.

"I'm not content! Why did I fail?"

Su Meng roared and struggled to his feet, staggering toward the house.

Now his only option was to return to the Su family. Inside this little courtyard was a vast inheritance his father had left him.

He still had a chance to turn things around.

But the moment he stepped into the house, Su Meng's body went rigid. His already deathly pale face lost whatever trace of color remained.

Before him, in the center of the room, a young man with features so handsome they were almost otherworldly sat in a chair, expressionlessly watching him as if he had been waiting for his arrival all along.

"Su Yun, how did you know about this place?"

After a long while, Su Meng spoke hoarsely, his voice filled with disbelief.

This little courtyard was the last retreat he had prepared for himself. It connected directly to his small courtyard inside the Su family compound. He had personally silenced everyone who had helped set up the teleportation formation—even Steward Zhong didn't know about it.

How could Su Yun possibly have known?

Su Yun's expression was blank, his tone indifferent: "Ling Yan, come out."

In that instant, Su Meng's body went stiff. He stared blankly to the side.

A stunningly beautiful mature woman stepped out from nearby, her expression blank as she looked at him: "Su Meng, back when you wanted to avoid everyone's notice, you used your authority as Director of Logistics to use academy resources to hire a formation master to set up the formation here."

"I have records of all the academy resources you embezzled, and I've investigated where every single resource went."

"Ling Yan, you were actually monitoring me." Su Meng's eyes widened in fury. He suddenly spat out several large mouthfuls of blood, glaring at Ling Yan with a bloody mouth, his expression twisted—yet he couldn't utter a single word.

This woman he had once thought treated him so well, the woman he loved to the marrow of his bones, had been monitoring him and investigating him the entire time.

Obviously she had never trusted him—and had probably been ready at any moment to use what she had on him as a gift to earn Su Yun's acceptance.

No wonder at Cloud Mist Pavilion, when Ling Yan had spoken those words, she had seemed so confident, as if she had complete certainty that Su Yun would accept her.

Su Meng finally understood.

So that's how it was.

He had been too naive, too foolish—actually believing Ling Yan had been good to him.

Heartache, sorrow, anguish that tore at his heart and lungs—a hundred different emotions welled up at once.

It was as if the entire world had betrayed him.

"Why, Ling Yan? Why? I was so good to you. I once loved you so deeply. Yet you treat me like this." Su Meng's voice was heart-wrenching.

Ling Yan's expression was blank, her tone matter-of-fact: "As a direct descendant of the Su family in such a sensitive position, and with the Ling family being merely a minor vassal family of the Su family, naturally I had to be careful."

"You did everything flawlessly. I can only blame you for being too greedy—insatiably so. One-third of Lingyun Academy's annual logistics budget was being siphoned off by you. If you weren't a Su family direct descendant, do you think I would have tolerated you this long?"

Su Meng was so furious his teeth cracked, yet he stood there dumbly, unable to say a word.

Ling Yan was right. Everything she had done was for self-preservation. His assumptions had all been self-delusion.

"Su Yun, I'm a direct descendant of the Su family. I'm your closest blood relative, your cousin. You can't kill me. If you kill me, everyone in the Su family compound will lose faith." Su Meng suddenly looked at Su Yun, his voice hoarse.

"Let me go. I'll leave the Imperial Capital right now—no, I'll leave China entirely. I'll never oppose you again, never threaten your position as heir."

"Let you go?"

Su Yun's lips curved. His expression was cold as he walked up to Su Meng and whispered in his ear:

"Now you know to beg for mercy? But begging now only makes me look down on you more."

"By the way, you might not know yet—the Su family has already expelled you. They're cooperating with the Xuanyuan family to hunt you down."

Su Meng stared blankly. "Su Yun, tell me. Was all of this your scheme?"

"That's right."

Su Yun smiled faintly. "I'm the one who told Steward Zhong to defect to Xuanyuan Li and reveal all your plans."

"If you hadn't tried to assassinate the Xuanyuan family's heir, if Xuanyuan Li hadn't discovered you—how could I have openly and justifiably killed you?"

"So it was you who made me lose everything."

Su Meng roared and suddenly used the last of his strength to strike at Su Yun.

At that moment, a cold glint flashed through Su Yun's eyes. He struck out with one palm, colliding with Su Meng. Overwhelming force surged forth.

"Bang!"

Instantly, Su Meng's entire upper body's bones were shattered. His arms drooped limply like rubber.

Su Meng stood frozen in place, eyes wide with fury—but his breathing had already stopped, his life extinguished.

And at that moment, the system's voice rang out simultaneously: "Congratulations, Host. For slaying the Son of Destiny, you are rewarded with 1,500 Charm Points."

"Congratulations, Host. For slaying the Son of Destiny for the first time, you are rewarded with Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes. These eyes can perceive karma and destiny. At great achievement, they can see through past and future."

"Pull up the system panel." Su Yun thought.

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit Bloodline

Realm: Divine Profound Realm [Twenty Dragons' Power]

Cultivation Method: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art

Weapon: Incomplete God-Devil Pendant [God-Devil Supreme Treasure]

Divine Ability: Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes

Charm Value: 6,500 [Flowers Bloom at Sight, Can Communicate with All Things] [Cultivation Speed Increased Twelvefold]

"Killing a Son of Destiny actually boosted my cultivation speed by two times all at once." Su Yun's lips curved, a satisfied gleam in his eyes.

And the system had actually rewarded him with another powerful divine ability.

After hearing the system's description of this ability, Su Yun was deeply shaken. Karma and destiny were two of the most mysterious forces in this world.

Even more remarkably, at great achievement, the Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes could actually see through past and future. This was probably a divine ability on the level of a Creator God.

"As expected, system products are premium products."

However, though the Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes were immensely powerful, with Su Yun's current strength, he could probably only perceive destiny at most.

Even so, that was already terrifying. Even his father Su Heng, having reached the Divine Spirit realm and being known as one of China's six strongest Divine Spirits, could not perceive destiny.

"Ling Yan, sever Su Meng's head and come with me back to the Su family." Su Yun spoke indifferently.
