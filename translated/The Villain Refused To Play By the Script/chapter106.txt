Chapter 106: The Righteous Xuanyuan Chong

"Father, you're right."

Xuanyuan Li growled, "Our Xuanyuan family's thousand-year heritage—even without a strongest Divine Spirit or an ancient divine weapon, we don't necessarily fear the Su family. Even if we can't win, we'll drag them into the abyss with us.

"At worst, we'll be destroyed together."

"Father, things have come to this point—there's nothing left to explain. Why should the patriarch and heir of the Xuanyuan family explain ourselves to Su Yun? Give the order for the Elite Guard to enter the city. I refuse to believe Su Yun would actually dare have the Eighteen Battalions attack."

Xuanyuan Li's eyes were filled with bloodshot veins, killing intent surging. "If the net breaks along with the fish, so be it. Death holds no fear, but the Xuanyuan family will absolutely not kneel to Su Yun today."

"Li'er, this time, Father agrees with you." Xuanyuan Ze's murderous aura was overwhelming. His terrifying Divine Spirit pressure caused the winds and clouds to change color, and the entire Imperial Capital was shrouded in killing intent as dark clouds blotted out the sun.

"I command the Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard Battalion—enter the city and protect Xuanyuan family headquarters!"

The Patriarch Token in Xuanyuan Ze's hand glowed with boundless divine might, golden light piercing the eyes.

This was the strongest Divine Spirit weapon forged by the Xuanyuan family's founding ancestor. Its power was limitless, and it represented the Xuanyuan family's supreme authority, controlling the family's many heritage treasures.

Xuanyuan Ze's murderous aura surged as he assumed a stance that showed he was willing to fight—even willing to activate all of the Xuanyuan family's heritage reserves.

"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."

Above the heavens, killing intent surged as winds and clouds churned. From beyond the Imperial Capital came tremendous rumbling, as if thousands of troops were charging.

The Elite Guard protecting the Xuanyuan family headquarters had been activated.

Like the Su family, the Xuanyuan family's main branch army was one of their most powerful forces.

"Drink!"

"Those who dare take a single step into the Imperial Capital—die!"

"By the Young Master's order, if the Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard dares take a single step into the Imperial Capital, execute them all on the spot. No need to request permission."

"Activate the Eighteen Battalions' formation patterns. Seal the Xuanyuan family headquarters!"

In the heavens, the Eighteen Battalions' divine generals rode ancient divine war chariots, standing upon the formation patterns. Killing intent surged as they continuously issued commands.

"Kill, kill, kill..."

The warriors of the Eighteen Battalions roared in succession, shaking the heavens with overwhelming killing intent.

From within the Su family's main compound, terrifying presences were continuously awakening. Killing intent spread from within like ancient primordial beasts.

"Clang, clang, clang..."

The vast tolling of bells echoed through the infinite void. The terrifying might of the ancient divine weapon caused cracks hundreds of miles long to appear in the sky, as if space itself were a constantly shattering mirror.

At this moment, every person in the Imperial Capital—regardless of their strength—turned deathly pale.

If these two Divine Spirit families truly clashed, no one would be spared.

But right now, the entire Imperial Capital was sealed. Stepping outside the capital meant certain death.

"Not one step back."

Su Yun smiled coldly. "Since it's come to this, my Su family has never feared battle.

"Otherwise, the world would think that after being schemed against, my Su family wouldn't even dare to retaliate. Then I, Su Yun, would be unworthy of being the Su family's heir.

"All Su family forces, hear my command: if the Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard dares take a single step into the Imperial Capital, all Su family subordinate forces around the world shall attack the nearest Xuanyuan subordinate forces. This Young Master shall bear all consequences."

"By your command, Young Master!"

From within the Su family compound, deep and terrifying voices continuously rang out, issuing commands to locations across the entire world.

"Madness! Utter madness!"

"Su Yun, you lunatic—you've dragged even my Kunlun Daoist Sect into this!"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit roared in a voice low enough that only Su Yun could hear, his eyes filled with bloodshot veins. But by now, he had been pushed to the edge of the cliff. He stepped forward, releasing terrifying Dao presence: "All Kunlun Daoist Sect elders and peak masters, hear my command—seal the Xuanyuan family headquarters. Cooperate fully with the Su family to encircle the Xuanyuan family!"

"Drink!"

True Feather Divine Spirit was the first to release her divine might.

Following her were the various peak masters and elders of the Kunlun Daoist Sect, each releasing boundless power. The weakest among them was at the peak of the Saint realm.

After all, the Kunlun Daoist Sect was a terrifying power that had produced multiple strongest Divine Spirits. They were not much weaker than a Divine Spirit family—they simply had little power in secular affairs.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

The Su family and the Kunlun Daoist Sect—the terrifying pressure of these two super-powers suppressed the Xuanyuan family headquarters.

Killing intent roiled. The situation had reached the most critical precipice.

The slightest movement would trigger a heaven-shaking battle.

At this moment, all the important figures in the Xuanyuan family headquarters turned pale, their bodies trembling slightly, their eyes filled with fear.

Only they truly understood the Xuanyuan family's actual strength.

In recent years, they had declined far too much.

If they really went to war with the Su family, they didn't know whether the Su family would decline.

But they knew they would all die—not a single one would survive.

"Enough, Xuanyuan Ze!"

At this moment, Xuanyuan Chong suddenly stepped forward, his expression iron-green, his face extremely grim. He roared, "In my capacity as Xuanyuan family Vice Patriarch and sole alternate councilman, I command all of you to stand down!"

Xuanyuan Chong's terrifying roar shattered the tense atmosphere. The rumbling from outside the city also instantly subsided somewhat.

Then Xuanyuan Chong whirled to face Xuanyuan Ze and growled, "Xuanyuan Ze, Xuanyuan Li—for the sake of your own status and power, you would push the Xuanyuan family into the abyss without hesitation.

"But I, Xuanyuan Chong, absolutely will not allow this to happen.

"Don't think I don't know—the Elite Guard protecting the headquarters has had its budget cut in half over the past few decades, with constant personnel reductions.

"The current Elite Guard is less than half its peak strength. What are you going to fight the Su family and Kunlun Daoist Sect with?

"The Xuanyuan family's thousand-year heritage will absolutely not be destroyed by your recklessness!"

"Xuanyuan Chong, don't forget—I am still the Xuanyuan family patriarch!" Xuanyuan Ze roared, nearly going mad. At this moment, Xuanyuan Chong was actually standing up to oppose him, even exposing his secrets, telling everyone the Xuanyuan family's true cards.

"For the sake of the Xuanyuan family, I cannot allow you father and son to continue your foolishness."

Xuanyuan Chong's gaze was cold. He turned sharply to face the assembled Xuanyuan family direct-line members and growled, "Let me state my position. For the sake of the Xuanyuan family's thousand-year heritage, for the life and death of over a million Xuanyuan family members, I absolutely do not agree to go to war with the Su family.

"I, Xuanyuan Chong, have seen through everything that has happened this time.

"I propose removing Xuanyuan Li from his position as heir and having Xuanyuan Ze surrender the Patriarch Token.

"The Xuanyuan family has reached a moment of life or death. I absolutely refuse to play the coward. Those who support me—step forward!"

Xuanyuan Chong's righteous voice echoed through the heavens.
