Chapter 41: Another Hundred Million?

"Ran'er, go bid on the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine. Make it quick."

Su Yun spoke casually as he put away the God-Devil Pendant.

This half of the God-Devil Pendant only contained an incomplete version of the God-Devil Scripture—and it was the latter half at that. Until he obtained the other half from Ye Ling, it couldn't display much power.

For now, though, he had no plans to eliminate Ye Ling.

The reason he'd bid on this half of the pendant was simple: even if he didn't kill Ye Ling, he needed to cut off his path to rapid growth. Otherwise, dealing with him later would only become more troublesome.

As for the hundred million pounds of origin stones—he'd just blurted out that number.

He had essentially lost all concept of origin stones, because to him, it was just a number.

Setting aside how vast the entire Su family's assets were—even his father Su Heng probably didn't know the exact figure, because it was truly astronomical.

From what he recalled, just the red envelopes his parents and the Su family elders gave him during New Year celebrations added up to hundreds of billions of pounds of origin stones, all stored in the Federation Bank by Qin Junhua on his behalf.

And that was just origin stones—not counting the massive piles of precious heavenly materials, earthly treasures, and rare curiosities.

Though his wealth was immense and Su Yun knew exactly how much he had, he'd never actually used any of it.

Not because he didn't want to, but because he genuinely had no need.

All his cultivation resources were arranged perfectly by his mother Qin Junhua. Whatever he wanted, he only needed to say a word—or not even that—and hordes of people eager to curry favor would rush to present it to him.

Meals, women, shopping—all expenses were covered by people scrambling to pay for him.

In short, ordinary origin stones were just numbers to him. If Su Yun's only goal was to lie flat and do nothing, he had already perfectly achieved his dream.

One origin stone or a hundred million—there really was no difference.

What he pursued now was supreme power and supreme authority. With a wave of his hand, he could make the sun and moon change the sky. With a single word, he could determine the life and death of billions. That was his true dream.

At this moment, all the distinguished figures and family prodigies in the auction hall grew solemn, their eyes burning with desire.

The Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine—this was the real reason they had come, the mission their families had given them.

After all, the Liu family had stood in the Imperial Capital for nearly a thousand years, having produced several Saints over the generations.

And this Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine was the greatest pillar supporting the Liu family's enduring prosperity and endless stream of powerful cultivators.

It was the accumulated efforts of generations of Saints.

The mine could continuously produce pure metal-attribute divine iron, supplying the Federation's frontline armies with their massive demand for weapon forging. It brought in at least tens of millions of pounds of origin stones annually—real cash flow, not just estimated asset value. And after hundreds of years of continuous output, the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine showed no signs of depletion.

This was truly a foundation that could be passed down for generations, keeping a family standing strong for millennia.

This was also why, when the Liu family patriarch learned the mine had been confiscated by the Federation Enforcement Bureau, the peak Heaven Spirit Realm powerhouse had his dao heart collapse from rage, leaving him on the verge of death.

Without the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine, even if the Liu family could relocate from the Imperial Capital to the provinces below, they would have lost their foundation. The family's decline—even extinction—would only be a matter of time.

"The Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine." Liu Ting's eyes reddened as she murmured to herself. This was the Liu family's lifeblood, won through generations of ancestors' struggles.

And it had been lost because of her willfulness.

"Sister Ting, it'll be alright. We'll definitely win the bid." Xuanyuan Jian comforted her softly, then glanced at Ye Ling.

By now, the nearly maddened Ye Ling had finally regained some composure. Taking a deep breath, he remembered the true purpose of coming here—to bid on the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine for Liu Ting.

He would definitely reclaim the God-Devil Pendant from Su Yun, but he needed to find the right opportunity.

The Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine, however, was crucial to salvaging Liu Ting and Xuanyuan Jian's opinion of him. That was the urgent priority.

Wang Yi slowly rose to his feet, his gaze resolute. "My Wang family is determined to win this Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine."

"Heh, then let's see whose family prepared more origin stones!" A prodigy sneered coldly.

A certain Heaven Spirit Realm powerhouse spoke with indifferent eyes, calling out a price without preamble: "Thirty million pounds of origin stones."

The moment this price was announced, the entire hall was stunned.

The elder hadn't even given a starting price.

And in this entire auction, aside from the Su family's young master calling out a hundred million, the highest successful bid had only been thirty million origin stones.

Almost instinctively, they excluded Su Yun's hundred-million bid from consideration—he was simply on a different level entirely.

Opening at thirty million origin stones immediately revealed this powerhouse's determination to secure the mine.

"The Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine only yields about ten million origin stones a year in revenue!"

"It would take at least three years to recoup thirty million origin stones—and that's assuming nothing goes wrong."

"Forty million origin stones."

"Forty-five million."

"Forty-eight million."

"Fifty million."

Prices climbed steadily higher, leaving the onlookers slack-jawed.

Even a family like the Imperial Capital's Wang clan, which had a Saint-level powerhouse, only possessed two or three hundred million origin stones in total assets. And the vast majority of that was in fixed assets. If they had to produce fifty million pounds of origin stones at once, the entire massive family would grind to a halt—they might even go bankrupt.

A family that could produce fifty million origin stones in one go was already among the Imperial Capital's first-tier great families—at least on par with Meng Wudao's Meng family.

Then Ye Ling stepped out of the "Wasteland"-class private room, his expression calm as he called out: "Sixty million origin stones."

He had anticipated the price would climb this high.

In his calculations, fifty million origin stones should have been the ceiling.

Sure enough, after he announced this price, the competing prodigies and family heads fell silent.

Sixty million origin stones had exceeded their psychological limits.

Immediately, they cast sidelong glances at Ye Ling. Being able to produce sixty million origin stones at once already surpassed many of the Imperial Capital's great families.

Ye Ling thoroughly enjoyed their gazes. But beneath his calm facade, his heart ached terribly.

Such a massive sum of origin stones, about to be gone just like that.

Yet he also understood that these origin stones weren't entirely his.

Thirty million belonged to Xuanyuan Jian. Ten million was Liu Ting's. Over ten million was Su Meng's.

The remaining less-than-ten-million was actually his.

He had only taken the lead because he wanted to win back Liu Ting's heart. The one truly going all-in to help Liu Ting was Xuanyuan Jian. Everyone's origin stones were just temporarily in his hands.

This was also why Xuanyuan Jian had reacted so intensely when he'd wanted to use some of the origin stones to bid on the beast hide scroll.

Seeing that no one spoke for a long while, Ye Ling turned to smile at Liu Ting and Xuanyuan Jian. Mission accomplished.

But just then, an indifferent female voice suddenly rang out: "My young master bids one hundred million pounds of origin stones."
