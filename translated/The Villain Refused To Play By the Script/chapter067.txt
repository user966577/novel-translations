Chapter 67: Ancient Demon God Legacy

At this moment, Xuanyuan Ze's eyes were dim with defeat. As a world-shaking powerhouse who had ignited his divine fire, he actually staggered backward several steps. His gaze dropped as he slumped heavily into his chair, utterly drained.

He had never imagined that Xuanyuan Shen, as the Xuanyuan family's founding ancestor's Divine Son, would be the first to challenge him, the current patriarch.

This was slapping the Xuanyuan family's own face to curry favor with the Su family.

Where was the dignity of a divine family?

With an alternate heir established, how far could it be before Xuanyuan Li's position as heir was abolished?

"The Xuanyuan family has been passed down for over a thousand years, and nothing like this has ever happened. How can I, Xuanyuan Ze, face our ancestors?" Xuanyuan Ze shed tears.

Su Yun's lips curved as he cupped his fists. "Senior truly has the wisdom to recognize a gem. This junior Su Yun is impressed."

"Since Senior has nothing more to say to Su Yun, then this junior won't meddle in the Xuanyuan family's internal meeting. I'll take my leave first. If there's anything you need help with, feel free to send someone to the Su family to let me know."

"Jian'er is this junior's fiancée, so I'm practically half a member of the Xuanyuan family myself."

"Ha ha ha ha..."

Su Yun laughed loudly, his laughter unrestrained, and left with Xuanyuan Jian in great strides.

They said the older the ginger, the spicier it was.

But this so-called Divine Son, heir of the Xuanyuan family's founding ancestor—Su Yun couldn't see the slightest trace of dominance or the bearing of a supreme Divine Spirit in him.

And yet he had still dared to put on airs and summon Su Yun to come.

Of course, there was no denying that Su Heng's manifestation of supreme divine power had produced immediate results.

When Su Heng appeared, everyone had seen Xuanyuan Shen trembling from head to toe.

"Su family heir, please take good care of my Xuanyuan family's alternate heir. When my father returns in the future, there will surely be generous repayment." Xuanyuan Shen said.

His underlying meaning was actually invoking his father—the founding ancestor who had created the Xuanyuan family—to remind Su Yun to remember to return the clan-guarding divine weapon, the Xuanyuan Sword.

Otherwise, with his strength, even while residing in the Divine Abyss, without the ancient divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword to sustain him, he wouldn't live much longer.

And Xuanyuan Shen didn't want to die.

"Senior Divine Son, you can rest completely at ease." Su Yun laughed heartily.

Just as the many Xuanyuan family powerhouses watched Su Yun depart helplessly, not daring to obstruct him in the slightest, Xuanyuan Li's hysterical roar suddenly rang out: "Ancestor, you are simply incompetent and senile! You might as well have stayed asleep in the Divine Source!"

"Su Yun, leave Xuanyuan Jian behind! Otherwise, no one leaves the Xuanyuan family today—not a single step!"

"Boom!"

Xuanyuan Li attacked. Thirty divine dragons roared as he threw a punch, shaking the heavens.

This punch was a divine family heir's full-powered strike, radiant with brilliant light.

"Xuanyuan Li, you're seeking death!"

Xuanyuan Jian, who hadn't spoken a word until now, let cold light flash in her eyes. She shouted, using her finger as a sword. Golden light flashed, divine might stirring slightly as the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul's shadow manifested.

"Boom!"

The two strikes collided. The void shattered, aftershocks rolling outward. The powerful ripples left many Xuanyuan family powerhouses shocked.

Xuanyuan Li was one thing.

But Xuanyuan Jian—if they remembered correctly, she was about the same age as Su Yun. At such an age, she already possessed the strength to fight Xuanyuan Li to a standstill. It was absolutely astonishing.

"Father, help me hold off Su Jian and Su Lie!"

Xuanyuan Li's gaze was wild. He growled, and dense black light suddenly blazed in his eyes. He rose into the void, black hair dancing wildly, like a demon god descended. He struck out with his palm, the black light seeming capable of devouring the heavens.

Xuanyuan Jian's expression was calm as she activated her martial soul, unleashing her full strength to clash with Xuanyuan Li.

But the next moment, her face paled slightly. She was forced back three steps by Xuanyuan Li's palm strike.

"This is ancient demon god power." Shock flashed through Xuanyuan Jian's eyes.

She had thought that after reaching thirty dragons of power, combined with her Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul, she would be more than capable of crushing Xuanyuan Li.

But she had never imagined Xuanyuan Li had hidden so deeply. He actually possessed ancient demon god power concealed within him. Clearly, he must have had some incredible fortuitous encounter.

After all, since the spiritual energy revival, anything touched by the word "ancient" was extraordinary.

The Su family and Xuanyuan family had risen by relying on the ancient Xuanyuan Sword and Chaos Bell that had been passed down.

And ancient Divine Spirit legacies, demon god weapons—these too were extremely powerful.

In the current world, several great families dominated Azure Star precisely because they relied on ancient demon god legacies.

In this moment, many Xuanyuan family powerhouses also let out exclamations, discussing among themselves.

As Saints, they could sense it even more clearly. This demon god power had never appeared on current-day Azure Star. It was clearly a demon god legacy that had never been seen before.

Xuanyuan Li, this heir, had hidden so deeply.

"The Xuanyuan Sword was lost. Our Xuanyuan family no longer has an ancient divine weapon to suppress our reserves and awe the world."

"But Xuanyuan Li has actually obtained an ancient demon god legacy. I wonder if he has an ancient demon god weapon as well."

"If he possesses an ancient demon weapon, combined with our Xuanyuan family's thousand years of accumulated reserves, why worry about not being able to rise again?"

"Xuanyuan Li seems to possess enormous potential as well!"

Many Xuanyuan family powerhouses' eyes brightened slightly as they began whispering among themselves, feeling somewhat awed by Xuanyuan Li's display.

Their Xuanyuan family heir, it seemed, was far from as simple as he had appeared. He had hidden very deeply indeed.

Sensing the changed gazes of the many Xuanyuan family elders around him, cold laughter filled Xuanyuan Li's heart. Having revealed his trump card to achieve the effect he wanted, he looked at Xuanyuan Jian with indifference:

"Xuanyuan Jian, living, you belong to the Xuanyuan family. Dead, you should also be a ghost of the Xuanyuan family. If you want to marry out, you should first ask whether I, your elder brother, agree."

"Just stay here obediently. Since your Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul has awakened, for the sake of the clan-guarding divine weapon, I promise I won't harm your life. I'll treat you as a full-blooded sister and give you abundant resources."

"Even if you're to marry into the Su family in the future, it should be I, your elder brother, who sends you off with grand ceremony. How can you leave so shabbily? If word got out, it would only embarrass our Xuanyuan family."

Xuanyuan Li spoke from the heart.

Everything had started because of Xuanyuan Jian. At this point, to completely resolve this matter, he could only start with Xuanyuan Jian.

As long as Xuanyuan Jian agreed to return, everything could be worked out. Su Yun would have no reason to stop her.

"Just come back!"

Having spoken, Xuanyuan Li didn't care how Xuanyuan Jian would react. He extended his hand, demon god might vast and mighty, filling the heavens.

Su Yun had been watching this scene with an indifferent expression the entire time.

Watching the completely different reactions of the many Xuanyuan family powerhouses compared to before, his brow furrowed slightly.

Xuanyuan Li truly was a Son of Destiny with vast fortune. He had hidden extremely deep. If he let things develop and allowed Xuanyuan Li to exercise his abilities, the entire Xuanyuan family would probably gradually unite around him.

If that happened, all his previous efforts would likely be wasted.

Displaying ancient demon god might meant possessing the potential to lead the Xuanyuan family to rise again.

The many Xuanyuan family powerhouses would probably place high hopes on him once more. Trying to shake his position as heir would become much more difficult.

"What ancient demon god legacy? If you think you can secure your position as heir again, keep dreaming!" Cold light flashed in Su Yun's eyes.
