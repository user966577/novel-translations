Chapter 119: You Beast

At the mention of Su Yun, Xuanyuan Li's expression grew even more fierce. "Absolute loyalty. They're all people who have deep grudges against Su Yun, or my trusted subordinates."

He pointed at an elderly man by the lakeside and sneered: "For instance, this one—his name is Zhong Bo. He was once Su Yong's servant. His entire family was killed by Su Yun's parents. He harbors a blood feud against them.

"He could side with anyone, but never Su Yun.

"Back then, I went to great lengths to turn him. I originally planned to use him to turn the people under Su Yong's command. Who knew that fool Su Meng would actually join forces with Xuanyuan Jian to move against me? I had no choice but to eliminate them all."

"Well done."

Xuanyuan Ze nodded.

As long as they wouldn't defect to the Su family, no family near the Imperial Capital would dare target the Xuanyuan family. Of that much, he was confident.

"In that case, let us begin."

Xuanyuan Ze took a deep breath and stepped before the Blood Altar. He bit his tongue and continuously sprayed mouthfuls of essence blood onto the blood-red stone tablet.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

Suddenly, the blood-red tablet began to tremble. The essence blood covered the two characters "Xuanyuan" completely, and a strange power began to spread. The surrounding formation patterns began to glow blood-red, illuminating the sky.

"Gurgle, gurgle..."

Suddenly, a sinister laugh echoed across the heavens, as if some devil had been awakened and was laughing eerily. The altar seemed to come alive, like some ancient demonic beast, beginning to gulp down the blood water around it in great mouthfuls.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

The sky shook. Between the spreading blood light, space was torn open, seemingly connecting to some strange dimension.

"Transfer!"

"Drink!"

At that moment, Xuanyuan Ze growled, his face pale. Vast divine might spread out, covering the entire estate.

"Drink, drink..."

Around the estate, numerous Saints stepped into the sky as well, their Saint-level might surging. They unleashed their techniques directly, uprooting the massive section of land containing the estate and casting it into the void.

The next moment, when they reappeared, they were already in the uninhabited wilderness, over three thousand miles from Tianhai City.

"Ha ha ha ha..."

"We did it!"

Xuanyuan Li laughed excitedly, his gaze fierce as he roared: "Su Yun, just you wait! Every humiliation you've given me, I'll repay a hundredfold, a thousandfold!"

At this moment, Xuanyuan Ze also let out a huge sigh of relief.

In this desolate wilderness, no one would discover that he had built a Blood Altar.

If not for time being so pressing, and the fact that only near cities could he find enough sacrificial victims in the shortest time, he would never have taken such an enormous risk by building a Blood Altar in a city.

The Blood Altar was infamous throughout the entire human race, despised by all humans and gods alike.

If discovered, everything would truly be over. Not only would he lose the patriarch position, but his very life would be in danger. The entire Xuanyuan family would be implicated because of him.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

Suddenly, the Blood Altar shook violently. The blood-red rift in the sky grew even more vast. A towering golden figure appeared within it, clad in imperial robes.

"Where is my sword!"

Faintly, the emperor seemed to awaken, murmuring to himself as if he wanted to step out of the blood-red rift and descend to the mortal world to find his sword.

"Founding Ancestor." Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li's eyes reddened as they knelt together.

"Descendants Xuanyuan Li and Xuanyuan Ze respectfully welcome the Founding Ancestor's divine soul."

With that, they turned their fervent gazes toward an ordinary-looking mountain range not far away and said respectfully: "We beseech the Founding Ancestor to break open this mountain and save our Xuanyuan family from calamity."

Their voices seemed to possess some magic. The emperor's eyes remained closed, but his form stepped out of the blood-red rift and instantly appeared above the mountain range. One foot stomped down.

"Boom!"

In that instant, the heavens seemed to shatter completely, recreating primordial chaos. Hundreds of miles of earth collapsed directly.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

A golden radiance spread from within the mountain, condensing into a barrier that blocked this strike. Yet dense cracks appeared across its surface.

Faintly, deep within the mountains, one could see the projection of a vast palace complex flickering in and out of view.

"Truly worthy of the Founding Ancestor's divine might." Xuanyuan Li watched in awe.

After all, Xuanyuan Ze working together with dozens of Saints hadn't been able to budge this ancient formation in the slightest.

Yet the Founding Ancestor—merely a remnant soul summoned through the Blood Altar, possessing less than a tenth of his peak power—had achieved such devastating effect with a single strike.

"Is the gap between ordinary Divine Spirits and strongest Divine Spirits truly this vast?" Xuanyuan Ze's eyes held bitterness.

He finally understood why Su Heng had looked upon him with such disdain.

Fellow Divine Spirits they might be, but the gap between him and a strongest Divine Spirit was like heaven and earth.

"Li'er, the Xuanyuan family's future rests with you," Xuanyuan Ze said solemnly.

He had used divine fire to temper Xuanyuan Li's body, completely exhausting his own potential. Soon, he would even fall from the Divine Spirit realm.

Everything had been for the sake of cultivating Xuanyuan Li.

"Rest assured, Father. I will definitely revive the Xuanyuan family and make us the strongest family in all of China."

Xuanyuan Li nodded solemnly, his eyes blazing with fervor as he gazed at the palace complex deep within the mountains.

The relic of the ancient human Divine Spirit, the Earth Emperor Divine Farmer Shennong—he had arrived.

The three ancient sovereigns—Heaven, Earth, and Human.

The Xuanyuan family had only received the legacy of the Human Emperor Xuanyuan. Yet that alone had produced the Xuanyuan Founding Ancestor and allowed the Xuanyuan family to stand for over a thousand years.

The Earth Emperor Divine Farmer Shennong's legacy would surely make the Xuanyuan family far stronger than ever before.

"Hum!"

At that moment, the void trembled. In the Xuanyuan Founding Ancestor's remnant soul's hands, a golden giant sword condensed. Divine dragons roared and sword qi ran rampant, instantly tearing apart the void for thousands of miles around.

One sword strike fell, and heaven and earth collapsed.

The golden barrier around the mountain shattered completely.

This single strike seemed to exhaust the last bit of the Blood Altar's power. The Xuanyuan Founding Ancestor's remnant soul rapidly began to dissipate.

But at this moment, Xuanyuan Li and Xuanyuan Ze had no time to pay attention to the Founding Ancestor. Their fervent gazes were fixed on the mountain.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

The mountain continuously collapsed, dust and debris rolling, constantly crumbling. Beams of golden light shot out from within, and an awesome, terrifying presence spread across heaven and earth.

"Ha ha ha ha..."

"Now who can stop the Xuanyuan family's rise!"

Xuanyuan Li laughed uproariously, immensely pleased with himself.

Xuanyuan Ze's face was pale, but it bore a satisfied smile.

But at that moment, a deep voice suddenly echoed across the heavens:

"Xuanyuan Ze, you beast! Unworthy of being a Divine Spirit of the human race!"
