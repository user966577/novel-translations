Chapter 96: Did You Ask for My Opinion?

Su Yun's brow furrowed slightly, his lips curving. "True Feather Divine Spirit, I really don't understand what you mean."

"What do you mean I'm breaking the agreement?"

"My agreement with you was simply for you to accompany me for three days. Nothing more."

"And now, an enchanting, alluring woman of even higher status than you is willing to accompany me for three days. What reason do I have to refuse?"

"Could it be, True Feather Divine Spirit, that you truly think yourself irreplaceable?"

Su Yun sneered and waved his hand. "I already asked you before, but you were evasive. I won't see you out."

His intent to show her the door couldn't have been clearer.

An Ruoyi's face was flushed. Her beautiful eyes stared unblinkingly at Su Yun, nearly intoxicated.

What a domineering man.

In all her years, this was the first time she'd seen a man treat True Feather Divine Spirit this way, berating her without reservation.

She suddenly realized that Su Yun had left an indelible mark in her heart.

At that moment, someone among the Celestial Maiden Sect elders suddenly laughed softly. "Worthy of being the Kunlun Daoist Sect's Divine Maiden. The men are hypocrites, and the women act like whores while demanding to be treated like saints."

"She clearly came to exchange her body, yet she insists on putting on an act of sacred inviolability."

"Divine Maiden True Feather, Young Master Su Yun is showing you the door. Didn't you hear?"

...

The various Celestial Maiden Sect powerhouses tittered mockingly.

As for their own Sect Master offering herself as the price of exchange—that was commonplace for the Celestial Maiden Sect. After all, they cultivated the worldly Red Dust Scripture.

Apart from being somewhat younger in age and temporarily weaker in strength, Su Yun was nearly perfect in all other aspects—irreplaceable, the perfect choice for An Ruoyi to entrust her seven emotions and six desires.

"Su Yun, you..."

"All of you!"

True Feather Divine Spirit's face grew even paler. Her powerful pride told her she should turn and leave right now.

But reason told her that if she left now, the Kunlun Daoist Sect would likely no longer accept her. She would become a sinner of the Daoist sects.

Just as True Feather Divine Spirit was caught in this dilemma, a low voice suddenly came from outside the villa:

"Young Master Su Yun, might you wait before making a decision?"

"Reporting to the Young Master, the Kunlun Divine Spirit requests an audience at the gate." Yun Ran walked in and spoke softly to Su Yun.

Su Yun's brow rose slightly. "Interesting, truly interesting. The leaders of two major Daoist sects have both come to my Su family at the same time."

"Ran'er, let him in."

Soon, the Kunlun Divine Spirit's tall figure strode into the villa, followed by numerous Kunlun Daoist Sect elders and peak masters. Their expressions were cold, their gazes sweeping over the Celestial Maiden Sect powerhouses, filled with killing intent.

Faintly, the two factions seemed to be squaring off, as if they might come to blows at any moment.

The two sects had opposed each other for a thousand years, each looking down on the other, each believing the other practiced a deviant path while only their own was the supreme Dao. They had long wanted to annihilate each other.

Those present had fought each other countless times.

But both sides knew this was the Su family. The Chaos Bell hung overhead, watched by numerous Divine Spirits. This was not a place where they could act recklessly.

Su Yun sat back in his chair, glanced at An Ruoyi, and smiled wickedly. "Kunlun Divine Spirit, I wonder what you still wish to say. I'm getting sleepy."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's heart lurched. He swept his gaze over True Feather Divine Spirit, whose face was pale and eyes filled with fury, and his sense of foreboding intensified.

Before arriving, he had predicted that in this area, True Feather would likely be no match for An Ruoyi. That was why he had deliberately called out while still outside the estate.

But upon seeing the scene, he realized that True Feather wasn't just no match for An Ruoyi in this regard—she had been completely outmaneuvered, unable to let go of her pride.

"Young Master Su Yun, I presume that seductress An Ruoyi has already agreed to your conditions?"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit spoke in a deep voice, killing intent lurking in his eyes. Seeing Su Yun nod somewhat impatiently, he immediately said, "My Kunlun Daoist Sect is willing to add another condition to what Young Master Su Yun proposed.

"Junior Sister True Feather will not merely accompany you for three days—she will become a concubine, serving the Young Master for life.

"Furthermore, Junior Sister True Feather will henceforth be the Vice Sect Master of the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

"What say you?"

At these words, a cold light suddenly flashed through Su Yun's eyes. He laughed. "Is this true?"

This was an unexpected windfall.

True Feather Divine Spirit was a Daughter of Destiny, a half-step strongest Divine Spirit. And if she became Vice Sect Master, combined with Su Yayue and the Su family's support, taking control of the Kunlun Daoist Sect and sidelining the Kunlun Divine Spirit would be merely a matter of time.

Even he hadn't expected the Kunlun Divine Spirit to be this desperate, offering such terms—having the Vice Sect Master become his concubine for the sake of the Innate Dao Body and Kunlun Mirror.

This was practically handing over part of the Kunlun Daoist Sect's power to the Su family.

"Kunlun, have you gone mad?"

An Ruoyi's expression shifted. "The Kunlun Daoist Sect is one of the three great branches of our Daoist sects. For the Vice Sect Master to become a secular person's concubine—where would that leave the Daoist sects' dignity? Won't the other reclusive sects laugh at us?"

The elders behind her stared at the Kunlun Divine Spirit in shock.

They simply couldn't imagine how he had made such a mad decision. And the many elders and peak masters beside him showed no sign of objecting.

"I am the Sect Master of the Kunlun Daoist Sect. I wield the sect's divine artifact. My word is my bond—I will not change it."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's face was expressionless, his voice low.

"As long as Young Master Su Yun agrees, I will right now, representing the Kunlun Daoist Sect and before all these elders and peak masters, grant Junior Sister True Feather the position of Vice Sect Master and have her remain in the Su family to serve you."

In an instant, everyone from the Celestial Maiden Sect gasped.

Madness. This was true, complete madness.

"My Divine Feather Peak has no objection."

"We fully support the Sect Master's decision."

The various Kunlun Daoist Sect powerhouses spoke up one after another, their expressions dark as they glared at the Celestial Maiden Sect members.

This had been agreed upon before their arrival.

If not for the dire circumstances, who would want to endure such shame and humiliation?

But no matter what, they couldn't let the Kunlun Mirror fall into the Celestial Maiden Sect's hands. Otherwise, the Kunlun Daoist Sect's hope of rising again would be completely severed.

Compared to face, substance was more important.

"Senior Brother, did any of you ask for my opinion?"

At that moment, True Feather Divine Spirit's hoarse voice suddenly rang out.

True Feather Divine Spirit's eyes had reddened as she looked at the Kunlun Divine Spirit and the various elders. Disappointment filled her heart.

For the sake of sect interests, these people were actually handing her over, making her—the peak master of True Feather Peak, a half-step supreme Divine Spirit powerhouse—become a secular man's concubine.

This was a tremendous humiliation.

Not just for her, but for the entire Kunlun Daoist Sect—for all the Daoist sects.

Even the Celestial Maiden Sect, which cultivated the worldly path, had never had a sect powerhouse become a secular family's concubine.
