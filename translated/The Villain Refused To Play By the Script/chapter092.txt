Chapter 92: Blood Altar

On the bed.

Su Yun's eyes were half-closed, enjoying Xuanyuan Jian's attentive service, when Dark Lady's cold voice suddenly came from outside the door. "Reporting to the Young Master, Steward Zhong requests an audience."

Su Yun's eyes opened slightly, a cold glint flashing through them. Why had Steward Zhong suddenly come to see him?

Steward Zhong was an important chess piece he had planted beside Xuanyuan Li. He would never use him unless absolutely necessary.

It seemed that Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li, seeing the Xuanyuan family's dire situation, were about to make a major move.

"Have him wait for me in the side hall," Su Yun said, then gestured for Xuanyuan Jian to help him dress before striding toward the side hall.

The moment he stepped into the hall, an elderly man hurried forward and knelt respectfully before Su Yun.

It was Steward Zhong, whom he hadn't seen since Su Meng's betrayal and death.

"Steward Zhong pays respects to the Young Master," Steward Zhong said respectfully.

"Hahaha, isn't this my Su family's great hero?"

Su Yun smiled and personally stepped forward to help him up. After having a maidservant arrange a seat for him, he asked, "Steward Zhong, have there been any movements on Xuanyuan Li's side?"

"Yes, Young Master."

Steward Zhong nodded, his expression suddenly grave. He stood up again and knelt before Su Yun. "Young Master, after you crippled Xuanyuan Li, Xuanyuan Ze used his own divine fire to baptize Xuanyuan Li's body, completely healing his injuries. Not only has he reached ninety-seven dragon power, but he has also broken through to the Profound Palace Realm, opening the Heavenly Demon Profound Palace within his body.

"This time, he had me use Su Meng's old secret passages to covertly infiltrate the Su family. He wants me to use Su Yong and Su Meng's former connections to contact those Su family direct-line members who are unwilling to submit to the Young Master. He plans to meet with them personally to move against you.

"The second matter is that Xuanyuan Ze has discovered an ancient divine relic in the Great Wasteland, apparently left behind by the ancient Human Emperor, the Divine Farmer Shennong. However, the entrance formation is extremely powerful—even Xuanyuan Ze cannot break through it.

"Xuanyuan Ze is preparing a blood altar. He plans to use the blood and souls of living beings as a sacrifice to the Xuanyuan family's ancestral spirits, summoning the founding ancestor's divine might to blast open the Divine Farmer Shennong's relic.

"This time, I used this opportunity to return and report to the Young Master, requesting instructions on how I should proceed."

Steward Zhong's words were filled with absolute loyalty.

Su Yun smiled slightly, naturally sensing Steward Zhong's devotion. It seemed he had already heard about the events at the engagement ceremony.

However, Steward Zhong's loyalty was built upon Su Yayue, so he wasn't surprised.

"Xuanyuan Ze really does dote on his son. He's willing to sacrifice himself for Xuanyuan Li."

Su Yun's gaze became profound, a cold glint flashing through his eyes.

At that moment, Xuanyuan Jian, who had just entered the hall, turned pale. She hadn't expected her father to love Xuanyuan Li to such an extent.

For a Divine Spirit, their ignited divine fire was their primordial spirit, the foundation of their divine existence.

Using divine fire to rebuild Xuanyuan Li's body would cause enormous damage and harm to the divine fire. It might even result in immediate death.

Even if death was avoided, the Divine Spirit would likely fall from the divine realm, with their lifespan greatly reduced. They wouldn't live much longer.

This action meant that Xuanyuan Ze had given up his long life as a Divine Spirit for Xuanyuan Li's sake.

"No wonder he's gone so crazy as to build a blood altar."

"If I remember correctly, a blood altar requires the blood and souls of one hundred thousand humans—and they must be young men and women—as the catalyst to perform the blood sacrifice and bridge space-time."

Su Yun muttered to himself.

This Xuanyuan Ze had already gone mad to such an extent. It was truly insane behavior, sparing no cost.

"Young Master, because the blood altar is too cruel, the Federation's Supreme Council passed a resolution a thousand years ago forbidding the construction of blood altars or performance of blood sacrifices in any form. Violators are to be executed by the entire human race."

Steward Zhong's gaze was cold. "Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li have their eyes on the ancient divine weapon that might exist within the Divine Farmer's relic. To restore the Xuanyuan family, they've completely lost their minds."

"Young Master, should I leak this information?"

Xuanyuan Jian's face had gone deathly pale.

Using one hundred thousand young humans as the price—this was demonic behavior, no different from the foreign races.

Once word got out, the entire human race would not tolerate them.

"No need!"

At that moment, Su Yun suddenly waved his hand, a cold smile on his face. His gaze was cold and emotionless. "This matter hasn't actually happened yet. Without ironclad evidence, we can't move against the Xuanyuan family's patriarch.

"I have my own plans for this. Don't act rashly."

In this moment, Su Yun's gaze was cold and ruthless, devoid of any emotion.

Steward Zhong's expression turned grave. He immediately understood Su Yun's thinking. "I obey."

Xuanyuan Jian closed her eyes, unable to bear it. She understood Su Yun's plan—he wanted to let this become ironclad proof.

She knew this was the best way to completely crush Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li.

Wait and observe.

Once the facts materialized, Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li would be finished.

"As for Xuanyuan Li's plan, Steward Zhong, whichever Su family direct-line members you've identified, just go tell Yun Ran. I'll give orders for them to cooperate with you."

Su Yun sneered. "Trying to attack me from within? Xuanyuan Li is still too green."

"I obey."

"If the Young Master has no further orders, I shall take my leave." Steward Zhong spoke respectfully.

"Wait. Steward Zhong, don't you want to see Yayue? She's in the Su family right now."

Su Yun smiled. "Soon she'll be heading to the reclusive sects. When that happens, who knows when you'll meet again?"

Steward Zhong's expression darkened, a bitter smile appearing at the corner of his mouth. Then he smiled and said, "Young Master, as long as I know Yayue is well, even if I die, I'll have no regrets."

With that, Steward Zhong knelt and bowed deeply to Su Yun. "I have only one request. Please treat Yayue well."

Then Steward Zhong rose and turned to leave.

He understood perfectly that he was merely a chess piece in Su Yun's hands—the kind that could never see the light of day.

As long as Su Yayue didn't know about him as her father, she would always be safe with Su Yun, receiving the best care.

Once Su Yayue learned that her father had once been Su Yun's enemy and that her entire family had died at the hands of Su Yun's parents, her life would be utterly ruined.

Better not to meet than to meet.

Watching Steward Zhong's departing figure, Su Yun's gaze was cold, a glint of iciness flashing through his eyes.

This Steward Zhong was indeed exceptionally clever. No wonder Su Yong had kept him to assist Su Meng.

In the original novel, Su Meng had been able to laugh last and become the Su family patriarch largely due to Steward Zhong's efforts.

...

Meanwhile, in northern Imperial Capital, within a massive estate.

This was the Kunlun Daoist Sect's residence in the Imperial Capital.

In the main hall, the Kunlun Divine Spirit, along with numerous elders and peak masters from the sect, had gathered. True Feather Divine Spirit stood in the center of the hall, her face slightly pale.

"True Feather, after our emergency overnight deliberations, we've reached a consensus. We've decided to have you agree to Su Yun's conditions and accompany him for three days."

"Is there anything you wish to say or do? The sect will do its utmost to satisfy you."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's cold voice echoed through the hall.
