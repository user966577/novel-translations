Chapter 69: Clan Extermination

"Hum, hum, hum..."

Beyond the Imperial Capital, winds rolled and clouds churned. Lightning flashed and thunder roared. Hurricanes howled. Mountains crumbled and earth split. Black clouds obscured millions of miles of land, rumbling sounds booming within them like thousands of troops and horses charging.

One ancient war chariot after another crushed the heavens as it passed. Upon each stood warriors clad in various colored armor, their expressions icy cold, their gazes merciless—like killing machines.

"By order of the Su family's Young Master, the Imperial Capital is sealed for three days. All families, factions, and academies must cease operations. Everyone must remain quietly at home. Entry and exit are forbidden."

"Any who disobey—regardless of who they are—shall be executed on the spot without mercy!"

The cold, indifferent voice exploded from the heavens, echoing through every corner of the Imperial Capital.

Ten massive ancient war chariots stood in the sky. Divine Spirit aura pervaded heaven and earth from each one—all were Divine Spirit treasures.

The Su family headquarters' eighteen battalions—one of the Su family's mightiest forces. Their reputation shook the world. Even the ancient myriad races knew them by name. Who knew how many powerful ancient clans had perished beneath these ancient war chariots.

"Though your Su family is powerful, this is too domineering. Sealing the Imperial Capital—has this been approved by the Federation?" A mighty voice rang out in the void, its origin impossible to determine.

This was at least a world-shaking Saint-level powerhouse speaking.

But at that moment, killing intent flashed in the eyes of the Demon God Battalion's General. His voice was merciless: "In the Imperial Capital, the Su family is heaven. The eighteen battalions obey only the Su family headquarters' commands. Why would we need Federation approval?"

"By the Young Master's order, those who disobey—die!"

"Rumble, rumble..."

The Demon God General drove his ancient war chariot into the void, murderous aura flooding the sky. Before long, deep within a great clan in the Imperial Capital's northern district—one protected by a Saint-level powerhouse—a low, muffled roar suddenly echoed.

"Demon God Kill!"

Heaven and earth suddenly darkened. The shadow of a demon god stood in the sky, wielding a giant spear that pierced through the heavens. It suddenly thrust downward. In an instant, one could only see an elder radiating Saint-level might, terror filling his eyes, as the giant spear directly pierced through his chest.

With a single strike, a Saint-level powerhouse fell.

Clearly, this was the one who had been making snide remarks in the shadows, dissatisfied with Su Yun's orders.

"Kill without mercy!" The Demon God General drove the Divine Spirit ancient war chariot back into the sky. The elder still hung from his giant spear, eyes wide in death, unable to rest in peace.

The next moment, over a thousand warriors of the Demon God Battalion drove their ancient war chariots forth, crushing the heavens as they charged into this great clan.

Before long, rolling blood stained the entire family compound red.

In this moment, the Imperial Capital fell into a suffocating silence.

After all, this was an ancient clan that had been passed down for nearly a thousand years. Deep-rooted and far-reaching, it had produced nearly ten Saint-level powerhouses and wielded considerable influence within the Federation.

Yet the Su family showed no concern whatsoever. They killed without hesitation.

The entire clan—thousands of people—not even chickens or dogs were spared. Domineering to the extreme.

Everyone understood this was killing a chicken to warn the monkeys.

Throughout the entire Imperial Capital, countless powerhouses existed. If they gathered together to resist, the Su family might not dare provoke universal outrage by forcibly suppressing them.

But at this moment, who would dare act?

The bloody lesson lay right before them. Who would dare resist?

Ten Divine Generals of the Su family drove their ancient war chariots, suppressing the heavens. One hundred thousand troops, cold and merciless, murderous aura flooding the sky. Every soldier in each battalion was elite among elites—powerful, well-equipped. They had once made even the ancient myriad races tremble.

The Su family headquarters' army had earned its supreme reputation through iron-like achievements.

Especially in this generation, under Su Heng's leadership, the Su family's strength and reserves had reached their peak. Who knew how many powerful clans and ancient races—even those with Divine Spirits who had ignited their divine fire—had been crushed flat by the Su family headquarters' eighteen battalions.

In an instant, the Imperial Capital that had been flourishing just moments ago—countless people now hurried home in fear.

All major academies, led by Qingbei Academy, declared a three-day holiday. Students remained quietly in their dormitories.

All restaurants, pleasure houses, and similar establishments quickly closed their doors and declined all guests.

"Is the Su family trying to establish their authority in the Imperial Capital?"

"Arrogant and domineering! The Imperial Capital is the heart of China. How can the Su family be allowed to act so wantonly?"

"The Su family may be powerful, but the Imperial Capital has more than one divine family. Where is the Xuanyuan family?"

"Shouldn't they step forward and lead the resistance against the Su family?"

"I heard the Xuanyuan family fell out with the Su family and there's a trend toward all-out confrontation. Though the Su family is powerful and flourishing, Su Yun's tyrannical actions present the perfect opportunity to pressure the Su family."

Countless powerhouses, Saints, and even those who had ignited their divine fire—all turned expectant gazes toward the Xuanyuan family, waiting for Xuanyuan family powerhouses to stand up, raise their arms, and lead the resistance against the Su family.

Moreover, the Xuanyuan family was also a family with vast holdings—forces and industries across the world. Being cut off from the outside world for three days would cause enormous losses.

At this moment, a middle-aged man stepped into the sky. His gaze was authoritative. It was none other than Xuanyuan Chong, who had just become an alternate council member.

Xuanyuan Chong spoke with indifference: "The Xuanyuan family and the Su family have been close for generations. Since the Su family has matters to attend to, the Xuanyuan family naturally should offer full assistance and cooperate completely with the Su family's order to seal the Imperial Capital for three days."

"All clan members, hear my order. Close our doors to guests for three days. Anyone who dares seek an audience, attempting to sow discord between our clan and the Su family, shall be captured immediately and sent to the Su family."

Having spoken, his figure instantly vanished from the sky.

Within the Xuanyuan family's great hall, Xuanyuan Ze shed tears of blood and helplessly closed his eyes. Beside him, Xuanyuan Li—already severely wounded—wept aloud, his voice filled with anguish: "A perfect opportunity, yet they cower before the Su family's tyranny, handing over this chance with their own hands, destroying our own great wall. How will the world view our Xuanyuan family?"

"Our Xuanyuan family and the Su family—sharing the Imperial Capital, ostensibly intermarrying, yet competing openly and secretly for nearly a thousand years, keeping each other in check."

"But now, we retreat again and again. Where is your dignity as direct-line members of a divine family?"

"When we should fight, you instead—for the sake of temporary benefits—willingly kneel before Su Yun."

"Founding ancestor, if your spirit is watching from heaven, open your eyes and look! Our Xuanyuan family will sooner or later perish at the hands of these spineless worms!"

Xuanyuan Li's voice was heart-wrenching, yet it could only echo within the great hall. Not a trace of sound escaped—the many direct-line powerhouses had sealed in his voice.

With the order given, the doors throughout the vast Xuanyuan family estate quickly closed.
