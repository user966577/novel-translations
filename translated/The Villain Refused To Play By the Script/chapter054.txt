Chapter 54: Xuanyuan Li Erupts

"This is the Xuanyuan Sword's projection. The Xuanyuan Sword is finally returning. Our Xuanyuan family's revival is at hand!" An ancient powerhouse from the Xuanyuan family's reserves wept openly, his sobs making the heavens tremble.

These past hundred years, because of the Xuanyuan Sword's loss, the Xuanyuan family had suffered endless humiliation.

Especially sharing the Imperial Capital with the Su family—once they had stood as equals, but now they were forced to bow their heads at every turn.

Even the Xuanyuan family's hereditary seat on the Azure Federation's Supreme Council had been lost, resulting in massive resource losses.

Watching the Xuanyuan family decline bit by bit, countless Xuanyuan powerhouses were consumed with anxiety, yet utterly helpless.

Now, seeing the Xuanyuan Sword's projection appear was like glimpsing a ray of light in absolute darkness. One could only imagine how they felt.

"Wait—that direction seems to be the Su family compound." Just then, a Xuanyuan powerhouse snapped out of his joy and noticed this detail, instantly bewildered.

"Why is our Xuanyuan family's divine artifact projection appearing over the Su family's compound?"

"Could it be that the Su family summoned the Xuanyuan Sword projection? Is heaven trying to destroy our Xuanyuan family?"

"I heard the patriarch and our current heir are both at the Su family's. Perhaps something happened there?"

Various speculations began forming in the minds of the Xuanyuan powerhouses.

"Investigate immediately. Spare no cost. We must find out who summoned the Xuanyuan Sword projection. They must be brought back at all costs." An ancient Xuanyuan powerhouse made the final decision.

...

While the entire Imperial Capital was shaken and the Xuanyuan family descended into chaos—

In the Su family's small world, Xuanyuan Ze stood dumbstruck, muttering to himself: "How is this possible? Why? I clearly sealed the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul with the Blood Fiend Formation, and I've been trying to gradually erode it."

"Why did it suddenly awaken?"

Back then, he had been the first to discover his daughter possessed the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul.

For the sake of his most beloved son Xuanyuan Li's position as heir, he had personally sealed Xuanyuan Jian's martial soul. He had even sought out various ancient forbidden arts, attempting to extract the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul and transfer it to Xuanyuan Li.

Xuanyuan Ze could easily imagine what scene must be unfolding within the Xuanyuan family right now with the Xuanyuan Sword projection's appearance.

Suddenly, connecting this to how Su Yun had clearly known everything yet still dressed Xuanyuan Jian in the Starlight Flowing Radiance Dress—making clear that he would protect her even at the cost of a complete falling out—Xuanyuan Ze turned to look at Su Yun.

He took a deep breath and said coldly: "Su Yun, were you the one who released the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul from her body?"

Without realizing it, Xuanyuan Ze's form of address had changed from the familiar "Yun'er" to simply "Su Yun"—a clear indication of how furious he was.

"Mm."

Su Yun didn't mind Xuanyuan Ze's change in address. He smiled slightly and said: "Uncle Ze, this was also unexpected."

"That's why I said—for the sake of our two families' generations of friendship, I had no choice but to resort to this."

"I understand how important the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul is to the Xuanyuan family. To help the Xuanyuan family's revival, I could only privately establish this engagement with Jian'er. Only by doing so can I save her life."

As he spoke these words, cold light flickered in Su Yun's eyes.

He knew the original storyline intimately—naturally, he knew that Xuanyuan Jian's Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul possessed far more power than she had previously displayed. It had been sealed by Xuanyuan Li.

In the original story, after Xuanyuan Jian and Ye Ling's failed assassination of Xuanyuan Li, they fled the Imperial Capital and wandered the world. By chance, they entered the remnant realm of the ancient Divine Spirit, Divine Farmer Shennong. Using the power of that ancient Divine Spirit's legacy, they broke Xuanyuan Li's seal, awakened the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul's full might, and summoned the Xuanyuan Sword's true projection.

It was through this that Xuanyuan Jian returned to the Xuanyuan family and gained recognition from its elders, saving herself and her family.

Of course, though she saved their lives, the fact remained that she had tried to assassinate Xuanyuan Li. Without backing, she posed no threat to his position as heir.

Eventually, Xuanyuan Li became the Xuanyuan family's patriarch, and Xuanyuan Jian became the mightiest Divine Spirit, leading the Xuanyuan family to crush the Su family.

And Su Yun possessed the Fuxi Martial Soul.

Fuxi was the ancient Heavenly Emperor; Divine Farmer Shennong was the Earthly Emperor, ranked beneath the Heavenly Emperor.

If the Earthly Emperor could awaken the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul, then so could the Heavenly Emperor.

This was precisely why Su Yun had dared to promise he could save Xuanyuan Jian's life.

"In this lifetime, Xuanyuan Jian is mine—completely under my control. It's nothing like the original story." Su Yun's gaze was cold.

"Yun'er, well done this time."

At that moment, Qin Junhua suddenly walked to Su Yun's side, her smile radiant, though her eyes glittered with calculating coldness. Various plans had already begun forming in her mind.

She was a master of political intrigue. In just moments, she had grasped Su Yun's intentions.

As the Su family's matriarch, she understood better than anyone how desperately the Xuanyuan family's internal factions yearned for the Xuanyuan Sword.

Yet now, the only person who could summon the Xuanyuan Sword's true form had entered an engagement with the Su family's heir and been publicly expelled from the family by its patriarch, Xuanyuan Ze.

Xuanyuan Jian had become the Su family's daughter-in-law, naturally gaining the Su family's support.

So then—what choice would the Xuanyuan family's internal factions make?

"This daughter-in-law pleases Mother greatly."

Qin Junhua smiled, suddenly removing a bracelet from her wrist. She beckoned to Xuanyuan Jian. "Jian'er, come here. Mother will put this Chaos Sky Bracelet on you—it was part of my dowry from the Qin family."

"Thank you, Mother." A radiant smile bloomed on Xuanyuan Jian's pale face.

"The Su family and Xuanyuan family have been close for generations. In the future, get along well with Yun'er. For the Su family—and especially to help revive your maternal family—you must work hard. One must never forget one's roots." As Qin Junhua placed the bracelet on Xuanyuan Jian's wrist, she offered earnest advice.

"Jian'er understands. I will never disappoint Mother and Su Yun's expectations. I will strive to revive the Xuanyuan family." Xuanyuan Jian smiled, though tears glistened in her eyes.

Ever since she had been intimate with Su Yun and his Fuxi Martial Soul had awakened her Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul's power, she had given up completely on Xuanyuan Ze and the Xuanyuan family.

Moreover, she was now Su Yun's woman and had sworn a heart-devil oath—she would never betray Su Yun for the rest of her life.

Suddenly, a roar of fury shook the hall.

"Enough! Stop this performance!"

"Qin Junhua, do you truly intend to protect Xuanyuan Jian and make an enemy of my Xuanyuan family?"

It was Xuanyuan Li, finally erupting. His eyes were bloodshot as he watched Su Yun and Qin Junhua speak of their families' generations of friendship—he could bear it no longer.

If they truly valued the friendship between families, why not hand over Xuanyuan Jian? Why take her as a daughter-in-law?

Wasn't this simply trying to crush any hope of the Xuanyuan family's revival?

Wasn't this trying to let Xuanyuan Jian steal his position as heir?

If that day ever came, the Xuanyuan family would become nothing more than the Su family's vassal.

Since childhood, he had aspired to revive the Xuanyuan family. How could he possibly tolerate this?
