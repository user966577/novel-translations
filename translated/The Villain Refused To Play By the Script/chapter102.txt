Chapter 102: You Actually Want to Drag Me Into This?

"Greater Thousand Worlds."

Su Yun murmured to himself, a flash of shock passing through his eyes.

This divine ability could directly condense the power of his entire mountain-and-river Profound Palace, connecting to the Greater Thousand Worlds beyond the infinite void and gathering their power. A single strike could shatter heaven and earth.

The stronger his mountain-and-river Profound Palace, the more power from the Greater Thousand Worlds he could summon.

Moreover, his mountain-and-river Profound Palace had the World Tree Fruit as its foundation, inherently containing the potential to grow into a Greater Thousand World.

Once he reached the strongest Divine Spirit realm, his Profound Palace would likely be a hundred, a thousand times larger than the Su family's pocket dimension—perhaps even more. It could stand alone beyond Azure Star as a true great world, nurturing endless life.

"Husband, the Kunlun Divine Spirit asked Yu'er to inquire when they can meet the Innate Dao Body." At that moment, True Feather Divine Spirit—now Yu'er—spoke softly.

Su Yun smiled faintly. "Only four days have passed. Tell them to wait. When the time comes, I'll naturally let them meet the Innate Dao Body."

True Feather smiled gently, her smile enough to make mountains and rivers lose their color. She was perfect to the extreme, like a supreme goddess who had fallen to the mortal world and been touched by the dust of the red mortal realm. Rather than becoming common, that hint of earthly charm made her even more alluring.

"Yu'er, this Young Master was able to break through to the Profound Palace thanks to you. I must properly reward you."

Before anyone knew it, Su Yun had appeared beside True Feather Divine Spirit. He lifted her into his arms and strode into the residence, laughing.

Xuanyuan Jian and the other women's faces flushed slightly as they followed into the villa.

One should drink to the fullest while fortune favors them, lest golden goblets face the moon empty.

...

The Su family's Young Master took a concubine, wedding the Kunlun Daoist Sect's True Feather Divine Spirit. Grand banquets were held for seven days, and all powerhouses in the Imperial Capital at or above the Profound Palace Realm were welcome to attend as guests.

Countless powerhouses came to pay their respects, and the entire Imperial Capital was filled with the powerful.

Su Yun's reputation as heir had now resounded across all of China, shaking countless powerhouses.

Making a Daoist sect goddess his concubine—this had never happened since the resurgence of spiritual energy.

Meanwhile, news that the Innate Dao Body would carry the Kunlun Mirror and join the Kunlun Daoist Sect spread across China under the Kunlun Divine Spirit's deliberate promotion. The Kunlun Daoist Sect's prestige soared, faintly washing away some of their previous humiliation.

Any astute observer could see that after this, the Kunlun Daoist Sect and the Su family had established a deep relationship.

Under the Su family's intentional support, the Kunlun Daoist Sect's influence would likely expand rapidly. Their rise was only a matter of time.

At the Kunlun Daoist Sect's estate in the Imperial Capital, a steady stream of reclusive sect powerhouses came to offer congratulations.

The Kunlun Divine Spirit was immensely pleased with himself. Ever since the ancient divine weapon—the Kunlun Mirror—had been lost, the Kunlun Daoist Sect had been in decline for too long. When had they ever experienced such prosperity?

But this was only the beginning.

The sixth day.

"Reporting to the Sect Master, a message from Su family's Young Master Su Yun. He requests that you bring the sect's powerhouses to the Xuanyuan family. He says he will have the Innate Dao Body formally become your disciple in the council hall of the Xuanyuan family's pocket dimension." A disciple reported.

"Dao Child Li Yi received word and has already departed with a group of elders for the Xuanyuan family."

"Understood. You may leave."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit frowned, feeling something was off.

The Xuanyuan family's pocket dimension had been created by the Xuanyuan family's founding Divine Spirit ancestor. It was the foundation of the Xuanyuan family's heritage.

And the council hall was where the Xuanyuan family patriarch and the direct-line members held meetings and discussed matters. How could they possibly allow outsiders to hold a discipleship ceremony there?

"Su Yun, what are you up to?"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit grew irritated. Six days had passed, and he hadn't even seen the Innate Dao Body's shadow. Despite visiting the Su family multiple times, he couldn't even get a glimpse of Su Yun or True Feather Divine Spirit.

"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."

At that moment, a terrifying wave suddenly spread across the Imperial Capital's sky. Winds swept away clouds, and darkness fell between heaven and earth.

Countless dense patterns spread across the sky, drawing endless vital energy from heaven and earth. Laws manifested, shaking the world.

"This is..."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's body trembled, his pupils suddenly contracting sharply.

"These are the divine patterns of the Su family's Eighteen Battalions."

"That direction... is the Su family."

Vaguely, if one could observe heaven and earth from above with powerful divine sense, they would see that the patterns filling the sky belonged to eighteen different directions—eighteen different formation patterns intertwined and overlapping, forming incomparable power.

"Drink! Drink! Drink!"

"Kill! Kill! Kill!"

At this moment, terrifying battle cries and thundering hooves echoed from all corners of the Imperial Capital. Killing intent surged, shattering the peace and festive atmosphere that had prevailed for days.

Black clouds rolled, divine thunder and fierce winds—all manner of phenomena raged across the sky as if thousands of troops were charging within.

Endless killing intent spread, instantly shaking the entire Imperial Capital.

The Su family's main branch Eighteen Battalions had entered the Imperial Capital again—and this time, no word had leaked from within the Su family beforehand.

Countless powerhouses were terrified to the point of death.

Because this time, all of the Su family's main branch Eighteen Battalions had gathered outside the Xuanyuan family's headquarters, brimming with killing intent. Terrifying divine might and formation patterns enveloped the Xuanyuan family's main compound.

"Su Yun, you madman! You actually want to drag my Kunlun Daoist Sect into this!"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit seemed to suddenly realize something. He roared, his face turning iron-green.

He finally understood why Su Yun had kept delaying. For six full days, he hadn't even seen the Innate Dao Body or the Kunlun Mirror—Su Yun had been dangling them like bait.

So this was the true purpose.

Su Yun wanted the Kunlun Daoist Sect to help him deal with the Xuanyuan family.

But the Kunlun Daoist Sect was a reclusive sect. They never interfered in worldly disputes or meddled in affairs within the Azure Federation—this was an iron rule.

What was the Xuanyuan family?

An ancient Divine Spirit family that had been passed down for over a thousand years, with deep reserves. Even though they had declined more than the Kunlun Daoist Sect, they still held tremendous influence and power within China and the Federation.

For the Su family to deal with and suppress the Xuanyuan family single-handedly wasn't so easy.

So Su Yun wanted to drag the Kunlun Daoist Sect in to suppress the Xuanyuan family together.

"Madman. A complete and utter madman."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit cursed.

Marrying True Feather Divine Spirit into the Su family as a concubine would at most be condemned as a disgrace to the Daoist sects—it wouldn't affect the Kunlun Daoist Sect's foundation.

But stepping in to help the Su family deal with the Xuanyuan family meant interfering in worldly affairs. All the reclusive sects would be displeased with the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

And the Kunlun Daoist Sect would be completely bound to the Su family.

"Someone! Immediately summon the Dao Child and all the elders back. They are not to interfere in matters between the Su family and Xuanyuan family..."

But before the Kunlun Divine Spirit could finish speaking, suddenly, wave after wave of terrifying Dao presence spread across the sky.
