Chapter 120: Never Expected This

"Who's there!"

Xuanyuan Ze's pupils contracted sharply. He let out a furious roar and immediately rose into the sky, his terrifying divine might and killing intent exploding simultaneously as his divine sense frantically swept across the heavens and earth.

The matter of the Blood Altar absolutely could not be discovered by anyone.

Anyone who knew had to die.

"No need to search. This Sect Master is right here."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit emerged from the void, his expression dark. Beside him stood Su Yayue, True Feather Divine Spirit, and Su Hong.

In the distance, numerous elders and peak masters of the Kunlun Daoist Sect, along with the guard force dispatched by the Su family, were racing toward them at full speed.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's gaze swept over the estate below. When he saw the endless bleached bones in the Blood Altar's lake, his eyes filled with bloodshot veins. Killing intent he could barely contain radiated outward, making the heavens themselves tremble.

Su Yayue's complexion turned deathly pale in an instant.

Born in an era of peace, she had experienced much hardship, but had never witnessed such a brutal scene.

Mountains of bleached bones piled high. The faint wails of countless wronged souls echoed. The stench of blood assaulted her nostrils.

"How many people must have died here?" True Feather Divine Spirit murmured, her eyes filled with cold indifference.

"Since the last great war of the myriad races, the human race has never seen such large-scale slaughter."

"Xuanyuan Ze, your sins are monstrous. Even if the Xuanyuan Founding Ancestor himself returned, he couldn't save you."

Su Hong's eyes were cold as he surveyed the land below and said icily: "I never expected that accompanying Miss Yayue to the Kunlun Daoist Sect would lead us to witness something so sickening.

"Xuanyuan Ze, you truly are a disgrace among Divine Spirit families.

"Our Divine Spirit families have protected the human race for generations.

"The Xuanyuan Founding Ancestor was one of the initiators who established the Azure Federation, fighting bloody battles to protect the human race.

"If he knew his descendants had slaughtered over a hundred thousand humans for their own selfish interests, he would probably rise from the dead in fury."

"The Xuanyuan family doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the Su family."

At this moment, Xuanyuan Ze's face had turned deathly pale. He couldn't utter a single word, his entire body trembling slightly.

"Please, let me explain. Things aren't what they seem." Xuanyuan Ze's voice was hoarse.

But what could he say next?

How could he explain? This was ironclad fact. The Blood Altar and the bleached bones were right there below them.

What could he do?

Every one of these people was a terrifyingly powerful Divine Spirit.

True Feather Divine Spirit, the Kunlun Divine Spirit, Su Hong—any one of them was a powerhouse who had been a Divine Spirit for many years. In a one-on-one fight, he might not even win. Let alone against so many of them.

"True Feather Divine Spirit, immediately notify the Young Master of what's happened here. Report to the Azure Federation headquarters."

Su Hong spoke coldly.

Deep in his heart, he even felt a hint of excitement.

This time, no one could save Xuanyuan Ze.

Eliminating Xuanyuan Ze would be a great merit.

Without a patriarch, wouldn't the next head of the Xuanyuan family be Su Yun's fiancée, Xuanyuan Jian?

"Boom!"

But at that moment, waves of terrifying auras suddenly erupted, sealing off heaven and earth.

Thousands of Xuanyuan family powerhouses flew out, forming massive formation patterns. Ten Saints stood within the estate, releasing their power.

From within the estate emerged two elderly men with murky eyes, yet their presence was terrifying to the extreme. Divine might rolled as they instantly appeared in the sky, completely blocking off all escape routes for the Kunlun Divine Spirit and the others.

These were direct-line members of the Xuanyuan family—supreme powerhouses who had ignited divine fire.

They were also Xuanyuan Ze's loyal followers, accumulated over his many years as patriarch.

"Father, don't hesitate any longer! Today it's either them or us!" Xuanyuan Li's hysterical voice rang out.

He appeared beside Xuanyuan Ze, eyes filled with bloodshot veins, a golden longsword in his hand—its shape bearing eight-tenths resemblance to the ancient divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword.

This was one of the Xuanyuan family's supreme divine weapons, forged by the second-generation strongest Divine Spirit ancestor in imitation of the Xuanyuan Sword. Its power was devastatingly terrifying. Legend had it that the Xuanyuan family's strongest Divine Spirit ancestor had once used it to withstand an ancient divine weapon.

"Father, kill them!"

Xuanyuan Li handed the sword to Xuanyuan Ze, his eyes filled with hysterical madness.

Succeed or die trying.

Unlike Xuanyuan Ze, from the moment the voice had sounded, he had made all his preparations.

"Yes, kill them. No one leaves today. They all die."

Xuanyuan Ze's voice was hoarse. He raised his hand and took the supreme divine weapon. The blood throughout his body suddenly ignited, burning like golden flames.

He had actually begun burning his own divine soul and blood.

"Xuanyuan Ze, resistance is futile. I've already notified the Young Master."

True Feather Divine Spirit spoke indifferently.

"The Su family army will arrive soon."

"I don't believe it!"

Xuanyuan Li growled: "This is the wilderness, over fifteen thousand miles from the Imperial Capital. There's no way Su Yun can get here that quickly.

"As long as we kill all of you, no one will ever find out."

"You think you're capable of that?"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's voice was hoarse. He suddenly stepped forward, divine might exploding in rolling waves. "Today, none of you are leaving. You will face the Federation's judgment."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's eyes were bloodshot.

He had never expected that the "small favor" Su Yun had asked him to do along the way would be something like this.

What he couldn't understand even more was why Su Yun, clearly knowing about all this, hadn't gone to stop Xuanyuan Ze beforehand.

However, the one thing he did understand was that Su Yun wanted him to become completely mired in worldly affairs.

Having stumbled upon Xuanyuan Ze's dirty deeds, he would have to testify against the Xuanyuan family.

The numerous powerhouses within the Xuanyuan family would direct their hatred at the Kunlun Daoist Sect. The Su family would actually become secondary.

"Clang, clang, clang..."

But at that moment, violent bell tolls surged across the heavens. Space shattered as a void passage slowly formed, connecting to the distant Imperial Capital.

The next moment, a voice cold with infinite fury rang out: "Xuanyuan Ze, I never expected that for your own selfish interests, you would commit such an atrocity.

"Today, my Su family will deliver justice for Heaven."

The next instant, Su Yun stepped out of the rift.

Behind him, the rift connecting to the Su family's main compound released endless divine might.

"Clang, clang, clang..."

Bell tolls continued without cease, shattering the heavens. Another spatial passage connected to a different direction.

"Xuanyuan family, take a good look at what your patriarch has done." Su Yun's voice was low, filled with fury.

"Hum!"

The next moment, Xuanyuan Jian was the first to emerge from the rift. Her gaze was cold, the shadow of the ancient divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword floating above her head, the Young Master Token gripped in her hand.

"Father, I knew you doted on Xuanyuan Li. But I never imagined you had become this deranged.

"In my capacity as heir of the Xuanyuan family, I command the Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard to surround Xuanyuan Ze, Xuanyuan Li, and all their accomplices."

This chain of events left Xuanyuan Ze and his son completely caught off guard, frozen in place.
