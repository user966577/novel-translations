Chapter 101: Frenzied Expansion

"Hum, hum, hum..."

The ten-thousand-zhang mountains and rivers trembled wildly, emanating terrifying power. The sky shattered, chaotic spatial currents churning before being directly devoured.

Eleven thousand zhang.

Twelve thousand zhang.

...Fifteen thousand zhang...

The mountains and rivers—or rather, the Profound Palace—expanded frantically. Within it, small blades of grass faintly broke through the soil and grew against the wind.

Vaguely, a deep roar seemed to echo, like an ancient fierce beast bellowing in rage, or like a dragon's cry shaking the heavens.

Each roar was accompanied by mountains and rivers shattering, rapidly expanding.

When the mountains and rivers reached twenty thousand zhang, they had already filled the entire sky and begun spreading deeper into the pocket dimension.

"Tw-Twenty thousand zhang..."

All the Su family powerhouses had completely held their breath, their eyes wide open, their bodies frozen stiff.

They no longer knew what words could describe the shock and excitement they felt at this moment.

When the Buddhist Ancestor broke through to the Profound Palace Realm, his ten-thousand-zhang Buddhist palace had set humanity's record. In all the vast time since then, not a single prodigy had been able to break it.

Yet Su Yun had not only directly shattered that record but had doubled it, reaching twenty thousand zhang.

"Is he even human?"

"Twenty-thousand-zhang mountains and rivers, nurturing the 'spirit' of grass at the moment of breakthrough, brimming with vitality."

"The Young Master was born with the Fuxi Martial Soul's blessing. Could he be the reincarnation of the ancient Heavenly Emperor Fuxi, returning to the human race?"

...

They were shaken beyond control, their gazes toward Su Yun filled with fervent worship.

With Su Yun being such a monster, combined with his ruthless and merciless methods, how could the Su family not rise under his leadership?

"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."

Suddenly, lightning flashed and thunder roared, winds and clouds churned, heaven and earth shifted, and the sky changed color.

The mountain-and-river Profound Palace, still rapidly expanding, suddenly transformed into an ancient colossal beast, madly devouring everything between heaven and earth. Endless vital energy was swallowed into it.

At the same time, the laws of heaven and earth manifested into physical form and were absorbed within.

There were the laws of fire—blazing flames burning across ten thousand miles of sky.

There were the laws of water—massive waves rolling, flooding the world.

At this moment, everyone could clearly sense that the laws of heaven and earth had manifested into physical form, being absorbed by the mountains and rivers, and the laws began to surge violently.

...

Terrifying phenomena spread throughout the mountains and rivers. While shocking everyone, the mountain-and-river Profound Palace began expanding at an even faster rate.

"Twenty-three thousand zhang." One Su family powerhouse murmured, his eyes fixed unblinkingly on Su Yun's mountain-and-river Profound Palace.

The next moment, another Su family Divine Spirit whispered, "Twenty-seven thousand zhang."

"Thirty thousand zhang!"

"Thirty-three thousand zhang!"

"Thirty-six thousand zhang!"

By now, many Su family powerhouses were calling out simultaneously, their voices filled with tremendous shock that made the heavens tremble.

Time passed, second by second.

No one knew how long had passed. When Su Yun's mountain-and-river Profound Palace reached fifty thousand zhang, the Su family's pocket dimension had fallen completely silent. Not a sound could be heard, not even breathing—only the faint drip of water echoing intermittently.

Upon reaching fifty thousand zhang, the fifty-thousand-zhang mountains and rivers finally stopped expanding, standing above Su Yun's head, filling the entire sky. Terrifying power radiated from within.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

Vast chaotic clouds filled the sky, lightning flashing and thunder roaring, spreading beyond the Su family, extending across the entire Imperial Capital.

This was an extremely terrifying phenomenon. Mountains and rivers lost their color as chaotic power seemed to reduce everything between heaven and earth to its primordial state.

The endless power of heaven and earth generated tremendous pressure that left even the Saints gasping for breath. They looked toward the Su family in horror, wondering what had happened now.

Had another supreme powerhouse been born in the Su family?

"Hum!"

At that moment, Su Yun's consciousness withdrew from the World Tree Fruit. He slowly opened his eyes, and his gaze shot across heaven and earth like lightning, illuminating the world as it appeared in the sky above.

"Boom!"

The next instant, rolling seas of thunder, mountains of lightning, fell in waves upon the just-awakened Su Yun, submerging him within them. It was as if heaven and earth themselves were enraged. Black winds rolled, the sky changed color, blocking everyone's vision. Even the Su family's Saints couldn't see through to the scene within.

Such a monster—even heaven and earth could no longer tolerate him and sought to bury Su Yun completely.

This was the furious roar of heaven and earth. There wasn't even the prelude of gathering tribulation clouds—the tribulation lightning simply crashed down from the infinite void.

"Hum!"

Suddenly, two beams of divine light shot from Su Yun's eyes, piercing through the heavens, striking into the infinite void.

This was the supreme power of the Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes, seeing through all mysteries.

After reaching the Profound Palace Realm, Su Yun could finally display some of the Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes' divine abilities.

"What heavenly power? Even if there really is such a thing as the Heavenly Dao, within this Imperial Capital, it will have to bow before me." Su Yun's gaze was cold and indifferent, piercing through the infinite void. The rolling tribulation lightning couldn't even touch his body before being ground down and devoured by his mountain-and-river Profound Palace.

"Clang, clang, clang..."

The Chaos Bell manifested between heaven and earth.

Su Yun directly drove the Chaos Bell's true body, condensing endless bell waves that transformed into a divine dragon. Following the trajectory of his Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes, it struck into the infinite void.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

Terrifying tremors came from the infinite void, alarming all the Su family Divine Spirits.

The next moment, the divine thunder filling the sky completely dissipated, vanishing without a trace. The source of the tribulation lightning had been directly found by Su Yun and obliterated from within the infinite void.

"So this is the power of the Profound Palace Realm."

Su Yun stood in the sky, his gaze cold. He felt boundless power within his body. With a wave of his hand, he could command the fifty-thousand-zhang mountains and rivers to crush everything.

"Congratulations to the Young Master on breaking through to the Profound Palace Realm."

Suddenly, Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie bellowed and was the first to kneel on one knee before the heavens, expressing his reverence for Su Yun.

With Su Lie leading, the other Su family powerhouses, Divine Spirits, and Heavenly Kings all knelt on one knee in the sky.

Su Yun was the Su family's heir. With such heaven-defying talent, he was worthy of the entire Su family's loyalty.

"Rise, all of you."

Su Yun's voice was cold and emotionless. His black hair danced in the wind as a terrifying aura of authority naturally emanated from him.

"Thank you, Young Master."

The Divine Spirits bellowed, then slowly departed from this place.

Xuanyuan Jian and the other women gazed at Su Yun in the sky, their eyes filled with intoxication.

This was how a real man should command the world.

"Open system panel." Su Yun silently commanded.
