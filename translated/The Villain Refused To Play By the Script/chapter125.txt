Chapter 125: Qin Ying's Ambition

Qin Ying's expression was grave, his gaze carrying a hint of darkness, mixed with intense dissatisfaction toward Qin Junhua. Though he was asking her a question, his voice already carried an undertone of coercion.

Over the past month, he had tried to persuade his younger sister more than once. Even various Qin family elders—aunts, uncles, and the like—had come to speak with her.

But no one could sway Qin Junhua.

She was determined to return to the Su family, to help her son and husband.

Qin Junhua's expression was dark, cold gleams flashing repeatedly in her eyes. "Brother, my son and my husband are both in the Su family.

"All this time, Su Heng has treated the Qin family well. The reason you obtained the alternate councilman position, the reason so many Qin family descendants have risen through the ranks in the Federation, the reason the Qin family enjoys its current status—it's all thanks to his support.

"Now you're colluding with the Duanmu family and Mount Olympus, trying to put Su Heng in danger.

"Don't you think you're being utterly ungrateful?"

After speaking, Qin Junhua's expression had grown dark to the extreme. "This time I returned to the Qin family only to secure Yun'er's qualification to enter the Qin family's Divine Spirit secret realm. I never imagined you would do such a thing—two-faced, burning bridges after crossing them. Not only can I not support you, but there's a large faction of powerhouses within the Qin family who will never support you either.

"Back then, it was you who engineered my meeting and romance with Su Heng, all to climb the Su family ladder.

"Now that you've gotten everything you wanted, you're openly burning bridges. Where does that leave the Qin family's reputation?

"As for the Qin family's eldest princess—no need to keep me here. I already am one, and the entire Qin family acknowledges it.

"This time, whether you agree to help the Su family or not, I'm going back."

"Slap!"

"Impudent!"

Qin Ying's face turned iron-green at her words. He flew into a rage, his Divine Spirit might exploding uncontrollably. He slapped the table and shot to his feet:

"Qin Junhua, have you forgotten where your roots are? Forgotten that your surname is Qin? You're actually siding with the Su family?

"Right now, all of the Su family's trusted allies and elite armies are mired on the American continent.

"Su Heng doesn't know his own limitations, daring to campaign against the Barbarian Tribe. He's already provoked the fury of the ancient races. Countless major families in the Federation are dissatisfied with Su Heng.

"The current Su family only appears strong—in reality, it's hollow inside. Continuing to rely on the Su family will only drag the Qin family down with them.

"You're the Su family's matriarch. You've held power in the Su family for years. Now if you'll just help me, my Qin family will definitely get a huge piece of the pie when the Su family collapses.

"Moreover, the Duanmu family patriarch and Mount Olympus have already promised me: as long as Su Heng dies on the American continent, his hereditary councilman seat will go to my Qin family.

"The Qin family's rise is within sight!

"Do I have to tell you this a hundred times before it sinks in?

"For the sake of the Qin family's thousand-year foundation, you must listen to me this time and stay here. You're not going anywhere.

"I am the Qin family patriarch. I am your elder brother."

Qin Ying's words were furious. He didn't want to waste any more words on Qin Junhua.

Since soft methods didn't work, he would use hard ones.

Only by leveraging Qin Junhua's influence in the Su family and her understanding of it could the Qin family seize the maximum benefit when the Su family's great ship came crashing down.

Moreover, Qin Junhua had contributed greatly to the family over the years, so her influence within the Qin family was also enormous.

If Qin Junhua returned to the Su family and single-mindedly opposed him, even the internal affairs of the Qin family would be thrown into chaos.

Mount Olympus and the Duanmu family would also be displeased with him because of this.

So he was determined to never allow Qin Junhua to slip from his control again.

"Qin Ying, your wolfish ambitions and ingratitude—so this is your true purpose after all."

Qin Junhua was even more furious, directly calling him by his name.

"How vast is the human race, how numerous its powerhouses? If not for my husband's help, you couldn't even have gotten the alternate councilman position.

"Yet you're still not satisfied.

"Think about it—with the Qin family's strength, if not for the fact that I'm the Su family's matriarch, why would the Duanmu family and Mount Olympus offer you an olive branch?

"A councilman seat in the Supreme Council—is that something the current Qin family can handle?

"Even if you somehow obtained it, once the Su family falls, what capital would you have to make the Duanmu family and Mount Olympus continue supporting you?

"Qin Ying, can you please wake up? This is pushing the Qin family's thousand-year foundation toward the abyss of destruction!"

"Don't try to stop me. Let me return to the Su family. As long as the Su family stands for even one day, as long as I remain the Su family's matriarch, the Qin family will never be in danger."

Qin Junhua's face was ice-cold, her eyes blazing with fury. Terrifying presence suddenly erupted, causing the heavens to tremble. Divine might rolled as she directly blew the roof off the great hall.

The Qin family's main hall, inscribed with countless formation patterns, had stood for over a thousand years without falling. Now, under Qin Junhua's fury, it came crashing down.

She could endure no longer.

Qin Ying was pushing the Qin family step by step toward the abyss of destruction, and he wanted to drag her husband and son down to die with him.

The Qin family's strength, in this vast game of chess, made them nothing more than a pawn. Jumping back and forth between sides would inevitably end in decapitation.

But Qin Ying seemed utterly unaware that the Qin family was far from qualified to be a player.

"So, Junhua—you're actually a half-step strongest Divine Spirit."

Qin Ying's eyes narrowed, his expression dark as he muttered to himself. "However, Junhua, this is the Qin family's main branch. It's not a place where a single half-step strongest Divine Spirit can run wild.

"Stay here. In the future, when the Qin family reaches its peak, you'll surely understand your brother's good intentions."

"Hum!"

In an instant, terrifying Divine Spirit might erupted from Qin Ying. A black battle standard rose from behind him, unfurling in the wind, emblazoned with a nine-clawed golden dragon.

This was the supreme divine weapon left behind by that strongest Divine Spirit ancestor the Qin family had once produced—the Dragon-Patterned Battle Standard.

Legend had it that the nine-clawed golden dragon upon it was a supreme divine dragon slain by that strongest Divine Spirit of the Qin family—its power rivaling a strongest Divine Spirit's. After he killed it, he used its dragon soul to forge this battle standard.

When pushed to its peak, it could even summon the supreme dragon soul within. Its power was incomparably terrifying—it was the Qin family's clan-protecting divine weapon.

"Rumble..."

Battle intent surged. The heavens crumbled. The nine-clawed golden dragon on the battle standard came alive, letting out a vast dragon's roar. Its dragon eyes were as enormous as stars as one claw reached toward Qin Junhua.

This was the strike of a true ancient supreme divine dragon—blotting out sun and sky, filling the heavens.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

Moreover, at that moment, three Divine Spirits emerged from the surroundings, forming a heaven-earth-man trinity formation. They continuously cast dense formation patterns, completely sealing the sky and isolating space, trying to suppress Qin Junhua.
