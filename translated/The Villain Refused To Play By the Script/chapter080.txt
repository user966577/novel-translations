Chapter 80: Name Any Condition

Li Yi coughed up blood wildly, sent flying dozens of meters before crashing to the ground, creating a crater several meters deep. Thick cracks spread outward for hundreds of meters.

"You overestimate yourself."

Su Yun's gaze was cold. Divine light flashed in his eyes, and he could see above Li Yi in the crater—destiny surging like a river, vast and boundless.

He too was a Child of Destiny.

But the scale of his destiny was far inferior to Ye Ling's or Xuanyuan Li's—even somewhat worse than Su Meng, whom he had slain. It was only because Li Yi had been cultivating longer that his strength was somewhat greater than theirs.

Still, even a mosquito's leg was meat. Su Yun wasn't picky.

At that moment, yin-yang light flashed in the crater, piercing through space. Li Yi had apparently used some treasure to try to escape quickly.

"Think you can leave? Stay!"

Su Yun smiled coldly. He had only just begun his plans for the three great Daoist sects. How could he possibly let Li Yi leave?

And he had no intention of letting Li Yi's destiny escape either.

The Kunlun Mirror in the sky trembled, divine light rolling. Time and space seemed to twist. Li Yi's treasure was directly shattered by the divine might, and he himself was squeezed out of the void.

Su Yun moved in a flash while holding Su Yayue, his hand clamping around Li Yi's neck. His gaze was cold, killing intent sharp.

Li Yi's face turned purple from Su Yun's grip, veins bulging, expression twisted. It felt as though a true ancient dragon's claw was around his neck, about to crush it.

"Su Yun, Su family Young Master, you can't just kill me like this! I'm an alternate Dao Child of the Kunlun Daoist Sect! My master is True Feather Divine Spirit!"

"This is all a misunderstanding. Let me explain."

Li Yi struggled, his voice hoarse.

He never would have imagined that Su Yun possessed the Kunlun Mirror, which could twist time and space.

Otherwise, with the treasure he carried, even a Saint would have difficulty keeping him.

"Kunlun Daoist Sect alternate Dao Child."

Su Yun smiled coldly and tightened his grip. "Even if your Kunlun Daoist Sect's Sect Master came personally, he wouldn't dare abduct a member of my Su family's personal guard battalion right at my Su family's gates. What does an alternate Dao Child count for?"

"Don't kill me! I don't want to die!"

Li Yi could sense the indifference in Su Yun's eyes—he truly didn't care about his alternate Dao Child status. Terror gripped his heart. Divine light suddenly erupted from his body, piercing through the void, seemingly connecting to some mysterious space.

"Master, save me! There's a supreme physique of our Daoist path here—an Innate Dao Body!"

Li Yi roared and howled.

In this life-or-death crisis, he could no longer care about getting first access.

This Su Yun was a madman who completely disregarded his status as the Kunlun Daoist Sect's alternate Dao Child.

"Young Master, this man has impure intentions and designs on Yayue," Su Yayue said.

Over this time, she and Su Yun had met often. Su Yun never put on airs around her and treated her very well, so they had become quite close.

Su Yun smiled coldly. "Yayue, he's just an insignificant ant who doesn't know his place. Pay him no mind."

Li Yi's neck bones crackled continuously, his eyes bulging, bloodshot, face twisted in agony. His eyeballs seemed about to burst, blood seeping from them.

"Yayue, I really was doing this for your own good. Help me..." Li Yi's voice was hoarse and savage.

Every blood vessel in his body had burst. He struggled frantically, but his seventy dragon power, combined with the enhancement from cultivating the Divine Spirit scripture Yin-Yang Dao Scripture—enough to battle prodigies with eighty dragon power—couldn't budge Su Yun's single hand in the slightest.

He couldn't understand how the gap in strength between him and Su Yun could be so vast when Su Yun's aura was clearly also at the Divine Profound realm.

Even someone at the Divine Profound extreme with ninety-nine dragon power couldn't possibly be this monstrous.

At that moment, the sky suddenly filled with Dao essence. A massive spatial vortex slowly opened, and terrifying divine might emanated from within.

"Su family Young Master, please show mercy. Spare this one's disciple."

It was a woman's voice, melodious and pleasant, carrying the majesty that only a powerful Divine Spirit could possess.

With a single word, the sky changed color. Time and space seemed to freeze.

This was a powerful Divine Spirit not inferior to Su Jian—far stronger than Xuanyuan Ze or Su Hong. Only his father Su Heng could firmly suppress her.

"Finally here!"

Cold amusement flashed in Su Yun's eyes. His Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes pierced through space, and he suddenly saw a Daoist nun in robes within some mysterious space, covered by countless terrifying Divine Spirit formation runes.

These were at least dozens of Divine Spirit formations layered together.

Yet her strength was truly boundless. Using heaven-shaking Daoist arts, she had forcibly carved a passage through them, about to break through into the Imperial Capital.

Suddenly, Su Yun's gaze focused. Above True Feather Divine Spirit's head, he saw a vast, boundless sea of destiny, stretching magnificently as if connecting to the infinite heavens. Even the dozens of Divine Spirit formations couldn't block her destiny.

"Her destiny is this vast—not much less than Ye Ling's."

Su Yun's heart stirred. His lips curled slightly as a peculiar light flashed in his eyes.

His goal had originally been to use Su Yayue to learn about the three great Daoist sects, laying groundwork for conquering the Daoist sects and building his supreme empire.

And this Daughter of Destiny, with such vast destiny, must be an important figure of great significance within the Daoist sects.

If he could conquer her, his conquest of the three great Daoist sects would advance significantly.

After a moment's consideration, Su Yun suddenly looked at Li Yi in his grip and smiled coldly. "Your disciple tried to abduct a member of my personal guard battalion. He doesn't know his place. If I let him off so easily, where would my Su family's dignity be?"

He wanted to test how much Li Yi meant to True Feather Divine Spirit.

"Impure of heart, heinous of crime—a capital offense." Su Yun's voice was cold. He suddenly raised his other hand, forming a fist, and punched toward Li Yi's head.

The sky exploded, the void trembled. Space itself seemed to shatter. Faintly, a terrifying dragon's roar accompanied the blow.

No one would doubt that this punch could directly explode Li Yi's head like a watermelon.

"Master, save me!" Li Yi was terrified beyond measure, his entire body contorted, struggling frantically.

At that moment, True Feather Divine Spirit saw this from within the spatial vortex. She actually plunged her physical body into the dozens of Divine Spirit formation runes, forcibly enduring their bombardment to break out of the spatial vortex.

She coughed up blood. These were dozens of Divine Spirit formations after all. Even with her extraordinary strength, forcibly breaking through had left her with considerable injuries. Her face was pale.

But she had no time to hesitate. She immediately waved her hand—space isolated, Dao essence pervading—gradually wearing away the power behind Su Yun's punch.

However, she didn't dare harm Su Yun in the slightest.

"Su family Young Master, I understand that my disciple's actions have offended the Su family's dignity. What must I do for you to spare him?"

True Feather Divine Spirit's face was pale, carrying a sickly beauty. Her temperament was transcendently otherworldly as she descended to the ground, standing opposite Su Yun.

"Whatever price I can bear, you may name it. I will satisfy you."
