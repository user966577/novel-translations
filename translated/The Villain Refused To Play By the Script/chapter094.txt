Chapter 94: An Ruoyi, You Seductress

An Ruoyi was momentarily stunned, caught off guard by Su Yun's gaze and words. She didn't know how to respond.

She had been the one to initiate this flirtatious exchange, intending to disturb Su Yun's mind.

She never expected that Su Yun would dare to tease even her, a half-step strongest Divine Spirit. It seemed her Red Dust Dao hadn't affected his mind in the slightest.

Truly worthy of being the supreme monstrous prodigy who had broken through the Divine Profound extreme.

An Ruoyi's heart stirred with caution.

The various elders who had followed her in were similarly shaken.

They understood all too well how powerful An Ruoyi's Red Dust Dao was. Even a Saint meeting An Ruoyi for the first time might have their mind captured by her seductive charm.

Yet Su Yun had only been momentarily dazed before breaking free, and had even taken the initiative to tease her back.

Such strength of mind and will was simply astonishingly powerful.

Soon, An Ruoyi recovered her composure. Covering her mouth with a laugh, she said, "With Young Master Su Yun's status, as long as the Young Master is willing—forget being a guest in my bedchamber, even if you wanted Ruoyi to personally serve you, it would be Ruoyi's honor.

"But Ruoyi's willow-like figure may not catch the Young Master's eye. If you fancy any of the elders, peak masters, or disciples behind me, feel free to speak up. It would be their supreme honor."

Su Yun smiled slightly, his gaze somewhat cold. He swept his eyes over the various elders behind An Ruoyi. "I'm really not interested. I only have eyes for Ruoyi Divine Spirit."

The Celestial Maiden Sect's various elders and peak masters, while certainly beautiful, were far from devastatingly gorgeous. Not a single Daughter of Destiny among them.

He naturally had no interest.

At these words, the scene instantly fell into dead silence.

The elders and peak masters An Ruoyi had brought along immediately darkened, their faces turning iron-green. Some looked ready to step forward and slap Su Yun twice.

Every single one of them was at least Saint level. Two had even ignited their divine fire.

And Su Yun had directly said he wasn't interested?

They had all cultivated the Red Dust Dao, graceful and alluring, seductive and charming. Wherever they went, powerful cultivators would follow in droves, prostrating themselves beneath their skirts.

The atmosphere An Ruoyi had carefully crafted upon entering had been shattered by two sentences from Su Yun.

What An Ruoyi had planned to say next was stuck in her throat. She didn't know how to continue.

Beneath this man's devilishly handsome appearance lay someone far too domineering and heedless, giving no face whatsoever to her subordinates.

An Ruoyi had heard that Su Yun demanded True Feather Divine Spirit accompany him for three days and assumed he was a lustful man.

And wasn't that exactly what the Celestial Maiden Sect excelled at?

In terms of beautiful women and sheer numbers, the Celestial Maiden Sect crushed the Kunlun Daoist Sect. And because they cultivated the Red Dust Dao, they had virtually no psychological barriers about such matters.

This was why she had brought so many Celestial Maiden Sect powerhouses.

She had thought that as long as Su Yun wanted women, he could pick anyone besides herself—even several at once would be fine. They needed to enter the world anyway. Using a prodigy like Su Yun to entrust the seven emotions and six desires, they might become even more powerful after severing them.

But who could have imagined that Su Yun would flatly state he wasn't interested in any of them?

Domineering. Forceful.

After a moment of stunned silence, An Ruoyi suddenly smiled again, taking the initiative to ease the awkward atmosphere. After all, she was the one who needed something from him.

The Innate Dao Body was simply too important.

Moreover, though the Celestial Maiden Sect possessed an ancient divine weapon, they had never gotten along with the Kunlun Daoist Sect. If they could disrupt Kunlun's acquisition of the Kunlun Mirror, it would be an enormous gain.

"Young Master Su Yun, you really are quite the joker."

An Ruoyi laughed. "Ruoyi has come this time with a request."

"Ruoyi has heard that a member of the Young Master's personal guard possesses the Innate Dao Body. I wish to personally take her as a disciple and cultivate her myself. I wonder if the Young Master would agree?"

The faces of the surrounding elders remained iron-green and gloomy.

They hadn't heard even a hint of joking in Su Yun's words.

But being under someone else's roof meant bowing one's head. They were the ones who needed something from Su Yun.

Su Yun's lips curved, but he didn't answer. Instead, he looked toward the outside.

At that moment, a voice cold as ice, harboring fury, came from outside.

"An Ruoyi, you seductress."

The next instant, True Feather Divine Spirit appeared expressionlessly not far from An Ruoyi. Her face was slightly dark, her gaze furious as she stared at An Ruoyi.

She hadn't expected An Ruoyi would arrive even faster than her.

"Oh my, isn't this our Daoist Sect's Divine Maiden, True Feather Divine Spirit?"

An Ruoyi covered her mouth and laughed, enchantingly beautiful. "I wonder what brings the Divine Maiden True Feather to the Su family? Oh, I almost forgot—your disciple offended the Su family and was captured.

"Could it be that you've come to exchange yourself for your disciple?

"Tsk tsk tsk, what a noble and selfless master, bravely sacrificing herself for her disciple. How admirable, truly admirable."

"This is our Daoist Sect's Divine Maiden, with countless admirers throughout the world. Even I, a woman, can't help but be moved!" one Celestial Maiden Sect elder laughed.

"So the Divine Maiden can also degrade herself and join us—these 'seductresses' as their Kunlun Daoist Sect calls us!"

"I'm quite curious what the Divine Maiden sounds like when she's panting in pleasure. What a beautiful sight that must be!"

...

The various Celestial Maiden Sect powerhouses giggled flirtatiously, their voices like orioles and swallows.

"A pack of seductresses! Silence, all of you! The Daoist Sect's reputation has been ruined by women like you!" True Feather Divine Spirit's exquisite face was as cold as ten-thousand-year-old black ice. She bellowed in rage, her terrifying might nearly bursting forth uncontrollably.

"Heh heh, True Feather, we're seductresses, but what are you here for?" An Ruoyi's face lost its enchanting smile. She sneered coldly, her terrifying divine might emanating to match True Feather Divine Spirit's, showing no fear.

In terms of power, the Kunlun Daoist Sect had lost their ancient divine weapon, while the Celestial Maiden Sect still possessed theirs. Their foundation was far deeper than Kunlun's.

The terrifying divine power clashed. Even though both consciously limited the range, the entire villa still trembled and cracked, fissures spreading continuously.

"Enough!"

"Within the Su family, it's not your reclusive sect Divine Spirits' turn to act so brazenly."

At that moment, Su Yun's cold voice thundered out.

In his hands appeared the Patriarch Token and the Young Master Token, connecting to the infinite heavens.

With a hum, a massive vortex appeared in the sky. The enormous shadow of the Chaos Bell floated within it, its surface projecting mountains, rivers, sun, and moon with boundless might, directly grinding away both their divine powers.
