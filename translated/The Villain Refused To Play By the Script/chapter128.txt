"Patriarch, what's going on?"

"Why are you trying to suppress the Su family's young master and Miss Junhua? Have you lost your mind?"

"You even activated our heritage!"

"The Su and Qin families are related by marriage!"

"How could you move against the Su family's young master just for an Ancient Divine Weapon?!"

...

Apart from a small group of Qin Ying's confidants, most of the Qin family's direct descendants had been kept completely in the dark. Seeing this scene, they were going insane.

The Qin family's heritage had been fully summoned. The family now stood at the edge of a cliff.

And at this moment, they had also torn away all pretense with the Su family.

Most critically, they still knew nothing about what was actually happening.

"Yun'er, your mother has doomed you."

Qin Junhua's eyes had turned red. She had already given up hope.

Inside Qin City, all the powerhouses were from the Qin family headquarters. Even with an Ancient Divine Weapon, having so many ancient powerhouses here—they could simply wear them down, grinding them to death bit by bit.

Qin Ying was using this hysterical, insane approach to drag the entire Qin family onto his sinking ship. If they didn't obtain the Ancient Divine Weapon, the ancestors in the heritage would all die, and they would face the Su family's furious retaliation on top of it.

These Qin family direct descendants might have good relations with her, but what choice they would make next was already obvious.

Furthermore, with the battle fortress awakened and space sealed, the Su family's reinforcements couldn't arrive in time. Unless Su Heng returned immediately, there might be a glimmer of hope.

But Su Heng was in the distant Americas.

No matter how she looked at it, this was a dead end.

"Hahaha! My dear nephew, your mother is right—she has doomed you. Now be a good boy and hand over the Ancient Divine Weapon. That way, you might at least save your life."

Qin Ying's smile was savage, his eyes filled with bloodshot veins and extreme madness.

He had to admit—he was a ruthless man.

He had made this decision in an instant.

He didn't even bother responding to the questioning from the other direct descendants, because he believed none of them were fools. They would soon figure out what had happened.

"Madman! Qin Ying, you're nothing but a madman!"

By now, some of the direct descendants who had pieced together the truth were cursing furiously.

"Even if you obtain the Ancient Divine Weapon, how can the Qin family possibly match the Su family? Once the Su army arrives at our gates, what will we use to resist?"

"Su Heng is a Strongest Divine Spirit and a Council member!"

"You're pushing the Qin family into the abyss!"

"The Qin family's excellent situation is about to be ruined by your hand!"

...

The direct descendants cursed continuously, yet they were already subtly spreading out, surrounding Su Yun, Qin Junhua, and the others. Their stance was obvious.

At this point, their only option was to capture Su Yun and seize the Ancient Divine Weapon—that was the only chance for survival.

"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Not bad. Not bad at all."

Clap, clap, clap...

At that moment, Su Yun suddenly smiled and began to applaud. His cold gaze swept over everyone, his smile radiant.

Yet beneath that smile lurked dense killing intent.

"It seems you really do think that you can keep me here with just this." Su Yun laughed.

"My dear nephew, what do you think?" Qin Ying raised an eyebrow, his smile savage.

"Dear nephew, weapons don't have eyes. Hand over the Ancient Divine Weapon, and spare your uncle from accidentally hurting you—your mother would be heartbroken."

"After all, you do have half Qin family blood in your veins. As long as you listen to your uncle, I promise I won't kill you."

Su Yun smiled coldly: "I told you—this time next year will be your death anniversary."

With that, he turned to Qin Junhua and smiled gently: "Mother, don't worry. None of us will be harmed. It's just that what your son is about to do next might be rather bloody. You probably won't want to watch."

"But I trust you'll understand."

Boom, boom, boom...

Right at that moment, from the distant heavens, endless murderous aura and blood-red clouds began rolling toward the Qin family's battle fortress.

"Reporting to the Patriarch..."

Just then, a low, horrified voice came from outside the headquarters: "Thirteen of the eighteen battalions from the Su family headquarters—excluding the Five Elemental Divine Battalions—have suddenly invaded Qin Province from outside its borders. Wherever they pass, rivers of blood flow."

"A third of the Qin family army has already been slaughtered. The forces deployed elsewhere can't be recalled in time."

"I beg the clan and all the powerhouses at headquarters to evacuate immediately."

The voice was choked with blood, as if speaking these words had exhausted every last ounce of strength.

Then they watched as a powerhouse emanating faint Saint-level pressure collapsed to the ground.

His body was covered in wounds, blood staining the earth. His breathing had completely stopped.

In that moment, none of the Qin family's direct descendants had the presence of mind to mourn his death. They stood there dumbstruck, the words he had spoken echoing endlessly in their minds.

Thirteen battalions from the Su family headquarters were killing their way toward the Qin family's battle fortress.

In that instant, they felt ice spread through their entire bodies. Their hair stood on end as if they had plunged into a frozen abyss.

The reputation of the Su family headquarters' eighteen battalions was simply too terrifying.

Any single battalion had enough power to exterminate an entire ancient race.

"Thirteen battalions from Su family headquarters mobilized—impossible! This is absolutely impossible! How could it be this fast?!" Qin Ying suddenly roared: "I don't believe it! I refuse to believe it!"

"Su Yun is just a young master—how could he possibly mobilize such enormous forces?!"

At this moment, he too felt ice run through his veins. Su Yun's cold smile kept flashing through his mind.

If thirteen battalions from the Su family headquarters really were coming together, the Qin family would struggle to resist.

Combined with the Ancient Divine Weapon, plus Qin Junhua, Su Jian, and the other two Divine Spirits, the Qin family might be caught completely off guard and annihilated on the spot.

"Impossible! If the eighteen battalions from Su family headquarters had been mobilized to Qin Province, the Duanmu family would definitely have informed me!" Qin Ying muttered to himself. Then his eyes suddenly blazed blood-red as he glared at Su Yun: "No matter if it's true or not—once I capture you, the Su family won't dare touch me!"
