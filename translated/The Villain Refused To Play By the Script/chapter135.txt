Chapter 135: A Hothead?

"Su family's Young Master, this Venerable One has come this time bearing tremendous sincerity, wanting to ally with you against the Barbarian Tribes." Li Shen smiled.

"Oh? Your Pixiu Clan isn't afraid of offending the God Race?" Su Yun asked casually.

"Naturally not!"

Li Shen sneered: "The God Race is merely one of the top ten super-clans, nothing more."

Su Yun immediately understood—the Pixiu Clan clearly had another super-clan backing them.

"What kind of cooperation are you proposing?" Su Yun asked casually.

"Very simple. Cede half of the Spirit Barbarian lineage's territory that you currently occupy to my Pixiu Clan, and we'll jointly resist the Barbarian Tribes' counterattack!" Li Shen spoke matter-of-factly.

The next moment, a cold voice rang out directly:

"Men! Seize Li Shen!"

*Hum... Hum... Hum...*

In an instant, rolling divine might erupted. The war city awakened once more as countless Divine Spirit formation patterns materialized.

"Wait!"

Li Shen's expression changed drastically, and he roared.

The negotiations had been going perfectly fine—how had this kid changed his face so suddenly? He'd wasted all that effort talking for nothing?

"You wild beast! My Su family paid an enormous price in casualties to seize the Spirit Barbarian lineage's territory, and you have the nerve to demand half right off the bat! Do you think I'm an idiot?"

Su Yun sneered: "It seems you're determined to give me this great achievement."

Li Shen went numb instantly. So that was the reason.

But in negotiations, wasn't it normal to start with an outrageous price and then bargain down slowly?

This kid turned hostile at the drop of a hat—what was that about?

Could you at least let people finish speaking?

He really was a hotheaded youngster.

"Su family's Young Master, if you think the terms are too high, we can still negotiate. Don't make a move." Li Shen ground out the words.

He swore, if this weren't Human Race territory, and if his clan didn't also want to move against the Barbarian Tribes to expand their power—this being a mission the clan leader had assigned—he would have already erupted.

In all the Ancient Myriad Races, hardly anyone dared treat him like this.

"There's nothing left to negotiate!"

Su Yun seemed to grow even more impatient. He turned around and handed the God-Devil Pendant to Su Jian: "I don't want to see this wild beast anymore. Capture him as fast as possible."

"Yes, Young Master." Su Jian's gaze was cold as he strode forward, activating the God-Devil Pendant. Instantly, endless divine and demonic shadows towered into the firmament.

"A half-step Supreme Divine Spirit who cultivates the sword dao." Li Shen's heart lurched.

Divine Spirits who specialized in the sword were already extraordinarily powerful in combat. With an Ancient Divine Weapon in hand as well, even in single combat, he couldn't say for certain he could win.

*Rumble...*

The war city awakened. Black radiance rolled. Dragon Banners flew, blotting out sky and sun.

Thirteen ancient Divine Generals erupted with divine might. Heaven and earth inverted; wind and clouds changed color.

"My Pixiu Clan won't demand a single inch of territory! We only ask that Patriarch Su Heng send someone to meet with our clan leader. When the time is right, we'll launch a joint attack on the Barbarian Tribes!" Li Shen spoke rapidly.

This was the bottom line his clan had given him for negotiations. Of course, if he could directly negotiate some Spirit Barbarian territory from Su Heng, that would be ideal.

But he was terrified that if he spoke too slowly, this hothead Su Yun would just act without giving him a chance to say anything.

Sure enough, he saw Su Yun, who had been about to turn and leave, stop in his tracks. The youth turned around and flashed him a brilliant smile: "Why didn't you say so earlier? Why did you have to force me to make a move?"

Seeing that smile, Li Shen's face turned iron-dark. He desperately wanted to leap up and slap Su Yun across the face, roaring: "This is negotiation! Don't you understand? You idiot!"

If this weren't Human Race territory, and if his clan also wanted to move against the Barbarian Tribes to expand—this being the clan leader's assigned mission—he would have already left.

"The God Race is just a super-clan, nothing special. My Human Race ancestors once fought the combined armies of the Ancient Myriad Races—did they ever so much as furrow their brows?"

Su Yun sneered: "Barbarian Tribe territory—my Su family will take it."

"But since your Pixiu Clan wants to ally with us, Young Master can agree on behalf of my father. Leave something that can contact the Pixiu clan leader, and my father will reach out to you soon."

"Alright, you can leave now."

Watching Su Yun wave his hand dismissively like he was shooing someone away, Li Shen's face was iron-dark. He raised his hand and tossed Su Yun a golden token: "Then by convention, shouldn't you also give me something to contact you? Otherwise, how will the Barbarian Tribes coordinate with your Su family?"

"And since we're now allies, shouldn't that black seal be returned to me?"

Su Yun looked at Li Shen as though looking at an idiot: "Have you forgotten that it's your Pixiu Clan that wants to ally with my Su family? Since that's the case, just wait patiently."

"You..."

Li Shen was furious. This kid clearly wanted all the benefits while leaving no leverage for the Pixiu Clan whatsoever. Did he think they were nothing? Back then, even Qin Junhua hadn't dared speak to him like this.

But one glance at all the god-level powerhouses around them, their killing intent bristling, and Li Shen took a deep breath.

He understood now—there was no reasoning with this hothead. Today, he could only grit his teeth and swallow this humiliation.

If he kept talking, and if this hothead's patience snapped and he got himself trapped here, he'd have nowhere to cry.

"Su family's Young Master, my clan will be waiting for your father to contact us. I hope it won't be too long."

Li Shen coldly tossed out one sentence, then flew toward the exit, his face iron-dark.

He hadn't gained a single advantage. Instead, he'd been humiliated thoroughly. He didn't even know how to explain this to his clan when he got back.

But what he didn't know was that after he left, Su Yun's gaze became profoundly deep. Cold light flickered through his eyes from time to time:

"Pixiu Clan, Barbarian Tribes, God Race, Western divine spirits, Athena, Duanmu Clan..."

"The Ancient Myriad Races are truly intertwined in complex ways."

"It seems getting the Supreme Council to decide on supporting Father's continued campaign won't be easy."

Cold light continuously flickered through Su Yun's eyes as he spoke coldly: "Ran'er, return to the Imperial Capital. Notify everyone—I'm going to personally visit Federation Headquarters to attend the Supreme Council on Father's behalf."

Hearing that Su Yun was going to attend the Supreme Council, Yun Ran's pupils contracted sharply. Without a moment's delay, she immediately responded: "Yes, Young Master. This servant will go arrange it at once."

She didn't dare tarry and immediately flew out of the great hall.

The Supreme Council—that was where the Human Race's strongest Divine Spirits gathered, where the people of greatest influence convened.
