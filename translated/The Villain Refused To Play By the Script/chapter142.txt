Chapter 142: Zeus Descends

*Rumble! Rumble!*

A vast sea of divine abilities engulfed her. In the blink of an eye, she had already endured no fewer than ten thousand divine strikes.

*Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!*

Athena spat blood continuously, retreating again and again, terrifying wounds appearing across her body.

"Chinese Divine Spirits, you gang up on me—you have no sense of honor."

"I am a Federation Council member. How dare you harm me!"

Even at this point, having suffered significant injuries and her complexion deathly pale, Athena still roared in fury, continuously driving the War Spear to unleash terrifying divine abilities.

"Federation Council member—we're beating a Federation Council member."

Su Yun laughed coldly. "The Federation of Azure Blue was established to resist the Myriad Races—to make the Human Race powerful."

"But now it's become a place for dragging down Human expansion through endless bickering. Better to have no such Federation."

"Today, I will capture you, and let's see what the Federation can do to China."

"Greater Thousand Worlds!"

A flash of chaotic light passed through Su Yun's eyes. The Mountains and Rivers Profound Palace appeared above his head—vast and boundless, as if connecting to the edge of the world. It had now reached the terrifying size of 800,000 zhang.

*Hum! Hum! Hum!*

Heaven and earth seemed unable to bear such a terrifying Profound Palace world. Everything trembled, the firmament cracking apart.

Torrential primal energy flowed from the Mountains and Rivers world, piercing through the void to connect to an unknown space.

The next moment, rolling power surged from the void, augmenting the Chaos Bell.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

The Chaos Bell rang thunderously, shaking heaven and earth. Chaotic power spread forth, condensing into a massive axe in the firmament.

"Heaven-Splitting Nine Strikes, first form." Su Yun shouted once, directly using the Patriarch Token and Young Master Token to drive the Chaos Bell, wielding the chaotic axe.

*Boom!*

In an instant, heaven and earth fell into darkness. Gales raged, space descended into chaos.

The awakened Chaos Bell's power was such that even the Strongest Divine Spirits had to retreat before it. Now, augmented by the Greater Thousand Worlds, unleashing the supreme divine ability Heaven-Splitting Nine Strikes—in an instant, it shook spacetime for tens of thousands of miles.

A terrifying power directly pierced through Blue Star's firmament, shocking all of China.

At this moment, gods throughout the world were alarmed, gazing toward China in shock.

In the distant Western world, there stood a mountain peak a million zhang high, upon which towered enormous divine statues.

*Hum!*

At the mountain's summit, a tall man who seemed to be in slumber, immersed in endless lightning liquid, slowly opened his eyes and looked toward China.

He was none other than the King of the Western Gods—Zeus.

"What a terrifying divine ability."

Zeus murmured to himself, his gaze piercing through endless space. At first glance, he saw Su Yun wielding the massive axe beneath the Chaos Bell.

The next moment, he saw Athena.

These Chinese people were actually besieging his Mount Olympus's War Goddess—this was absolute sacrilege!

"Outrageous!"

Zeus erupted in fury. His terrifying divine might directly pierced through the Divine Thunder Pool, plunging ten thousand miles of void into darkness. The King's divine power rolled forth, lightning raged, thunderous roars deafening.

"These Chinese barbarians dare lay hands on the noble Divine Spirits of Mount Olympus."

Upon Mount Olympus, the gods raged, all noticing this scene from their vast distances.

"I am Zeus, the King of Gods. I command you to stop!"

Zeus's detached voice directly pierced through the firmament, resounding above the Imperial Capital.

"The God King!"

A flash of joy passed through Athena's eyes.

Su Yun's gaze was detached, completely unmoved. He raised one hand and slashed down viciously.

*Boom!*

The chaotic axe, flowing with torrential chaotic radiance, struck heavily against Athena's golden armor, cleaving her War Goddess armor apart.

*Pfft!*

Athena spat blood and was sent flying, immediately engulfed by the rolling meteors Ouyang Feng commanded.

*Rumble! Rumble!*

The sound was deafening, shaking the heavens.

At this moment, the Imperial Capital fell silent. Countless powerhouses were stunned by what they saw.

"The noble War Goddess has actually been suppressed by the Su family's young master."

"This is madness!"

"Isn't he afraid of truly provoking the Western world into another Crusade?"

"He's gone mad! Completely mad!"

"Even the legendary world's Strongest Divine Spirit, Zeus the God King, has been alarmed—yet Su Yun still won't stop."

"Even the perpetually low-profile Ouyang family patriarch, Ouyang Feng, is helping Su Yun."

At this moment, countless powerhouses turned pale, terrified to their very bones.

*Hum! Hum! Hum!*

Terrifying divine might permeated the firmament. The next moment, a vast consciousness descended, condensing into an enormous pupil in the sky. Lightning raged within that pupil, as if belonging to a supreme deity who held the power of life and death over all beings.

"Audacious insects."

Zeus spoke, and the firmament trembled. Rolling divine might caused the heavens to shatter, plunging ten thousand miles of void into shadow.

"For Su Heng's sake, I spare your life. Release Athena immediately."

Zeus's lightning eyes glanced at Su Yun, then turned to Ouyang Feng, speaking coldly: "Ouyang Feng, your family has never participated in Federation struggles. By interfering now, do you wish to make an enemy of Mount Olympus? Are you not afraid we'll break through China and flatten your Ouyang family?"

His voice was domineering beyond measure. Upon arrival, he immediately adopted the stance of a superior, berating Su Yun and threatening Ouyang Feng.

And everything seemed as if it were only natural.

Because he was Zeus, the God King—the most powerful Divine Spirit of the Human Race, known as the God King.

"How utterly laughable. A mere divine spirit consciousness descends and dares issue commands? How ignorant."

Su Yun actually laughed, his gaze cold to the extreme. He directly drove the Chaos Bell, and the Greater Thousand Worlds ability drew endless power from the void.

*Hum! Hum! Hum!*

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

The chaotic axe swelled, reaching ten thousand zhang in size. Chaotic power rolled as it slashed down.

"Heaven-Splitting Nine Strikes, second form." Su Yun roared, his complexion slightly pale. Borrowing the awakened Chaos Bell and the Greater Thousand Worlds ability, he barely managed to execute the second form of Heaven-Splitting Nine Strikes.

But one should know—the first form alone had already severely wounded the War Goddess Athena.

Even barely executing the second form, that power was unimaginably vast.

*Rumble! Rumble!*

At this moment, heaven and earth completely shattered, falling into utter chaos. All anyone could see was that heaven-piercing chaotic axe crashing toward Zeus's face.

"Good heavens!"

At this moment, everyone in the Imperial Capital was utterly shocked, their expressions terrified, stunned by Su Yun's madness and audacity.

He actually dared strike at Zeus, the God King—the most powerful Divine Spirit of the Human Race.

What lawlessness!

"Star Banner!"

At this moment, Ouyang Feng's weathered voice thundered across heaven and earth. A star-patterned banner appeared in his hand, containing what seemed like endless void within.

This was the Ouyang family's clan-guarding divine weapon—the Star Banner.

"In China, it's not your place, Western God King, to issue commands." Ouyang Feng's gaze was ice-cold as he fiercely drove the Star Banner.

*Rumble!*

An incomparably massive star was summoned forth, spinning ponderously, filling the firmament. Together with the chaotic axe, it crushed toward Zeus's face.

"Such audacity!"

Zeus roared, but he was merely a divine spirit consciousness that had descended. His true body was unfathomably far from the Imperial Capital—how could he possibly withstand such a terrifying assault?

With a *boom*, his face was directly obliterated.

The massive axe and star followed the trajectory of his divine consciousness, directly striking into the endless void, seemingly hitting some unimaginable place.

*Boom!*

Above Western Mount Olympus, a chaotic axe and a vast star appeared simultaneously. Though their power had weakened immeasurably due to the vast distance, that terrifying might still caused the mountain to shake, massive boulders tumbling to the earth, the mountain cracking and collapsing.

"Damn it!"

Zeus roared, divine thunder shaking the heavens. He strode down from the mountain peak, shattering the chaotic axe and vast star with one palm.

"You dare attack my Mount Olympus? Do you seek death?" Zeus's enraged voice emerged from the void, resounding across the firmament for tens of thousands of miles, making the massive Imperial Capital city tremble.

"Zeus, if you dare come in person, I'll suppress you here in the Imperial Capital just the same." Su Yun's gaze was cold. "China is not yours to rule."

Ouyang Feng held the Star Banner, his gaze weathered. "The Federation of Azure Blue was established to resist the descent and invasion of the Ancient Myriad Races—to make the Human Race strong."

"But don't think, Mount Olympus, that we Chinese fear you."

"When the Federation was founded, the first tenet was that all Human factions must respect each other, never invade one another, present a unified front against outsiders, and that no Divine Spirit of any faction may intrude upon another's territory without permission—doing so would be considered provocation."

"Yet your Mount Olympus has been ambitious, repeatedly trying to conquer China, tearing up the Federation's founding principles with your Crusades."

"China has made concession after concession for the sake of Federation unity, and you actually think we're easy to bully."

"Today, Athena dared enter China without the unanimous consent of the four great families, sowing discord, even coming to the heart of China—the Imperial Capital—attempting to assassinate the heir of a Chinese Divine Spirit family and sabotage Su Heng's campaign in the Americas."

Ouyang Feng's weathered voice, filled with fury, echoed across the firmament.
