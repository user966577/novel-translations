Chapter 71: Death, Sometimes It's Simple

"You're trying to threaten me by causing chaos within the Su family?"

Su Yun's lips curled slightly. "If I'm not mistaken, your name is Su Yihui. You're of the same generation as my father, and your ancestor was the third son of the Su family's founding Divine Spirit. I should call him Great Ancestor, and by seniority, I should address you as Uncle, correct?"

"Since you know that, why haven't you ordered the Wind God Battalion troops surrounding my residence to withdraw?" Su Yihui's eyes flashed with satisfaction. "Do you have any idea how many source stone mines the Su family controls? If you seal off the Su family headquarters and the Imperial Capital for even one day, without my orders, the losses will be astronomical."

"Do you know how many source stones the Su family's Eighteen Battalions consume each month? It's an astronomical figure."

"Is that so?"

Su Yun smiled, then suddenly said, "In that case, Uncle Su Yihui has truly worked hard and rendered great service. It's time you enjoyed your retirement."

"Su Lie, come out."

Su Yun looked toward the outside of the hall. Everyone's expressions grew serious upon hearing this name, and they followed his gaze.

A tall middle-aged man slowly walked in from outside the hall. His face was expressionless and his bearing stern. He completely ignored their stares, knelt on one knee before Su Yun, and said, "The Chaotic Sky King, Su Lie, pays respects to the Young Master."

In that instant, the entire room fell into suffocating silence.

Su Lie had actually knelt to Su Yun. What was going on?

Just days ago, Elder Fu, who had watched Su Lie grow up, and his daughter Su Ying had died at Su Yun's hands. Shouldn't Su Lie be the one most opposed to Su Yun?

They had assumed Su Lie hadn't come because his injuries were too severe and he was in seclusion recovering.

They never imagined that Su Lie had actually submitted to Su Yun.

Suddenly, Su Yihui spoke in a low voice, "Su Lie, were you the one who told Qin Junhua about our plan to put her under house arrest?"

At these words, everyone's pupils contracted sharply as they all realized this possibility.

Otherwise, with Su Heng absent, how could Qin Junhua have known anything? How could she have commanded Su Heng's trusted subordinates to trap them here?

Su Jian and the other powerhouses should have been in seclusion.

"What do you mean 'Qin Junhua'? She is the Su family's Matriarch."

Su Lie frowned and said coldly, "With the Patriarch absent, the Matriarch temporarily presides over the Su family. You held this supreme council meeting to put the Matriarch under house arrest—that itself is a heinous crime. As a member of the Su family's direct line, naturally I couldn't stand by and watch you act so treasonously and carry out such rebellion."

As he spoke, Su Lie couldn't help but glance at Su Yun. He saw the smile on Su Yun's face, as if everything had been within his expectations, and his heart grew cold.

After last time, he had accumulated deep fear of Su Yun, and he was utterly disappointed in these direct-line members of the headquarters.

He had let his daughter Su Ying confront Su Yun, and these people had all sat by watching. They watched with their own eyes as the Five Elements Divine Battalion sealed off his residence, and not a single one dared to speak up for him.

He, a Heavenly King, had lost all face.

As for a daughter and a servant, they honestly weren't that important to him. With his power and status, he could have as many as he wanted.

So he hated them!

This time, when these people invited him, he chose to submit to Su Yun directly and told Qin Junhua everything they were doing.

So it really was him!

In that instant, the direct-line powerhouses were all stunned.

No wonder Su Yun and Qin Junhua had reacted so quickly. They had barely gathered together—they hadn't even begun discussing how to depose Su Yun and what their next steps should be—when Qin Junhua had already sent powerhouses to trap them here.

No wonder Su Yun had directly mobilized the Eighteen Battalions and sealed off the entire Imperial Capital.

He was going to capture them all in one fell swoop.

"Su Lie, you traitor!" Su Yihui roared.

If not for Su Lie's betrayal, how could so many of them have lost so badly, defeated by a young man who had just come of age?

"Su Lie, I've reviewed your previous record. You once helped Su Yihui manage the source stone mines and various other resources. From now on, these will be under your management."

Su Yun's gaze was cold, but he smiled and said, "Take Su Yihui away and have him hand over all the relevant documents and information. After all, with so many mines, we can't let operations below shut down.

"Su Yihui was right—that would be a huge loss."

"If there are any problems, I'll hold you responsible."

In that instant, the Su family's direct-line members gasped in shock. They never imagined Su Yun would be this bold.

The Su Yihui lineage had controlled the Su family's mines for nearly a thousand years. They had countless trusted subordinates in various mines, with deep roots everywhere.

Nominally, these mines belonged to the Su family headquarters, and revenue needed to be submitted.

But in reality, the Su Yihui lineage were the true controllers of these mines.

Something even Su Heng and Qin Junhua hadn't dared to do during their purge of the Su family—Su Yun actually dared to do. Had he gone mad?

Wasn't he afraid that once word got out, Su Yihui's many trusted powerhouses would go on strike or even rebel?

If such a massive source of income was lost, the operational balance the Su family had maintained for a thousand years could be directly broken, plunging the entire clan into chaos.

But Su Lie beside him was overjoyed. Such an enormous benefit had just fallen into his lap. He understood this was Su Yun rewarding him for his allegiance.

The Su family had been passed down for a thousand years. To maintain such a massive clan, hundreds of thousands of private soldiers, and the expenses of both branch and direct-line descendants—the assets involved were unimaginably vast.

Even the source stone mines alone, which only accounted for one-fifth of the Su family's annual income, were already an astronomical figure with enormous profits.

If Su Lie had to choose between being a Federation Heavenly King and this position, he would definitely choose to control the Su family's mines and give up the Heavenly King title.

"Su Lie obeys! I will never disappoint the Young Master and Patriarch's expectations. I will manage all the mines well and serve the Young Master loyally." Su Lie was ecstatic. This benefit was simply boundless.

His conviction that submitting to Su Yun had been the right choice grew even stronger.

Then, Su Lie looked expressionlessly at the stunned Su Yihui and said flatly, "Yihui, come with me. Let's handle the handover. Haven't you always said that managing so many mines was exhausting? The Young Master is merciful and has lifted this burden from you. Now you can enjoy your retirement."

Su Yihui flew into a rage. "Su Lie, I'll retire your head! Traitor! Scum! Ungrateful wretch!"

"You want to take my mines? You're dreaming! Don't even think about it!"

Then Su Yihui turned to Su Yun and roared, "Su Yun, you're acting so recklessly and wantonly! The Su family will be destroyed in your hands sooner or later! If you want my mines, you're dreaming! If you have the guts, just kill me!"

"I'll curse you even in death!"

"You want to die?"

Su Yun smiled. "Dying is simple enough. But sometimes it's not that simple. If you're smart, out of consideration for blood ties, I can spare your lineage. But if you resist too much, I can't guarantee your family will survive."

"Wind God General."

"Your subordinate is here!" Outside the hall, the Wind God General's gaze was merciless. He drove his ancient war chariot directly into the hall.
