Chapter 38: Complete Domination

In the hall, all eyes were fixed on Ye Ling.

Just when everyone thought the dust had settled and the beast hide scroll belonged to Ye Ling, a hoarse, brutal voice suddenly echoed through the auction house: "I bid three million two hundred thousand and one pounds of origin stones."

This time, the auction house erupted in commotion. Everyone looked up toward the private room next to Ye Ling's.

Bidding just one pound more than Ye Ling.

It was a disheveled young man wearing a black vest, tall as a small mountain, his eyes wild and aggressive like a beast's.

"Hiss, it's actually Meng Wudao, the young master of the Imperial Capital's Meng family."

"This one's a vicious character. Not only does he have a deep background—his family has multiple Saints presiding over it, with assets and foundation far exceeding the Wang family by who knows how many times—but his own talent is formidable too. He possesses the Martial Soul of the ancient ferocious beast Taotie. Absolutely savage."

"I heard he's only twenty years old, yet he's already reached Divine Profound Realm. His strength is terrifying. Word is he once slapped a Divine Profound great achievement expert into meat paste with a single palm."

Meng Wudao turned to look at Ye Ling, baring his teeth in a savage grin. "Brat, you were acting pretty arrogant there."

The provocation couldn't have been more obvious.

Meng Wudao was showing everyone through his actions that he simply didn't like Ye Ling's arrogance. Why else would he bid exactly one pound more?

This was perfectly in character with his savage, domineering personality.

In an instant, Ye Ling's expression darkened completely. He spoke coldly, "Four million pounds of origin stones."

He raised the price by a full million pounds, then looked at Meng Wudao with cold indifference.

"Four million and one pounds of origin stones." Meng Wudao grinned and beckoned to Ye Ling with his finger.

This gesture struck directly at Ye Ling's powerful ego, turning his face iron-green. He growled, "Five million pounds."

"Five million and one pounds of origin stones." Meng Wudao replied carelessly.

For his family, five million pounds of origin stones was nothing. More importantly, this was Su Yun's order. The chance to build a connection with the Su family's young master was worth not just five million, but fifty million.

Once again, he had added exactly one pound, his dismissive attitude maximizing the insult.

You were so arrogant in front of Wang Yi, weren't you, Ye Ling?

Let's see you be arrogant now.

"I bid six million!" Ye Ling roared, his eyes bloodshot.

"Six million and one."

"Seven million pounds of origin stones." Ye Ling panted heavily, his breath coming in harsh gasps.

"Seven million and one pounds of origin stones." Meng Wudao turned to flash Ye Ling another grin and made a thumbs-down gesture.

Ye Ling felt like he was going insane. He truly couldn't understand how his luck had turned so rotten. Everything had been going so smoothly just recently. And now, wanting to bid on something to please Xuanyuan Jian, he had spent a full seven million pounds of origin stones on a tattered beast hide—and still couldn't secure it.

His eyes crimson, Ye Ling gasped for breath and was about to continue bidding.

"Ye Ling, enough. You can't beat Meng Wudao."

But at that moment, a cold voice came from behind him. Xuanyuan Jian had somehow walked out of the private room and now stood behind Ye Ling, her expression icy.

She understood the Meng family and knew something of Meng Wudao's character.

The Meng family had deep foundations and ancient heritage, with multiple Saints presiding over it. Their power was absolutely terrifying—far beyond what a mere Ye Ling could contend with.

"Jian'er, I wanted to win it for you..." Ye Ling opened his mouth but didn't know what to say.

"Your behavior was too arrogant. That's why you drew this man's attention. If you keep bidding, you'll only humiliate yourself further." Xuanyuan Jian glanced at Meng Wudao, then turned and walked back into the private room.

"And don't forget your real purpose for being here."

Ye Ling's face was iron-green, filled with deep humiliation. But ultimately, he followed Xuanyuan Jian back into the room.

He understood that right now, he was no match for Meng Wudao.

Several million origin stones meant nothing to Meng Wudao, but for him, it was an unbearable burden. If Meng Wudao suddenly stopped raising the price, he would probably vomit blood on the spot.

If that happened, Liu Ting and Xuanyuan Jian would likely sever ties with him completely. After all, accumulating such a large sum of origin stones had involved their efforts as well.

"Coward. Weakling."

At that moment, Meng Wudao's hoarse voice reached Ye Ling's ears, making his body tremble with the severity of the humiliation.

In the Heaven-class private room, Su Yun slowly opened his eyes, his gaze indifferent. He nodded slightly.

Yun Ran immediately understood. She walked out of the room and called out, "My young master bids ten million pounds of origin stones."

"Hissss!"

Instantly, the hall filled with sharp intakes of breath. Just when everyone thought the matter was settled, someone else had bid—and raised the price by three million origin stones in one go. What wealth! And it clearly demonstrated absolute determination to obtain the beast hide scroll.

"Who is this woman's young master? This is ten million origin stones we're talking about. Many people here in this auction don't have that much in total assets."

"Did you see? She actually came out of the Heaven-class private room. That room hasn't been occupied by anyone qualified to enter for many years."

"I've seen her. She's the personal attendant of Su Yun, the young master of the Su family." Someone spoke up at that moment.

In an instant, the hall fell completely silent, the heated atmosphere freezing in place.

The Su family—the heir to one of China's most powerful families, the future successor to a seat on the Supreme Council.

A legendary figure destined to one day wield power over the fate of the human realm—a Divine Spirit.

At that moment, Meng Wudao cupped his fists and bowed toward Yun Ran. "Meng Wudao of the Meng family greets Lady Yun Ran."

His voice had lost that cruel, domineering edge, becoming solemn and respectful.

Everyone understood that his bow was directed not at Yun Ran, but at the Su Yun behind her.

Though the Meng family was powerful, compared to the Su family, they were still miles apart.

Then he cast a cold glance toward Ye Ling's private room and sneered before turning to enter the "Flood"-class room behind him.

That sneer seemed designed to tell Ye Ling: his appearance had been solely to suppress Ye Ling's arrogance—not to actually compete for the beast hide scroll.

The moment Su Yun made his move, Meng Wudao had immediately withdrawn, which was proof enough.

After a long while, the hall remained completely silent.

Seeing that no one else was bidding, the old man's eyes gleamed with satisfaction. He waved his hand and declared, "Since no one else is bidding, I announce that this beast hide scroll belongs to the honored guest in the Heaven-class private room."

As his voice fell, the beast hide scroll flew into Yun Ran's hands. She carried it into the room.

According to Azure Blue Auction House rules, payment was required before receiving the auctioned item.

But no one would doubt that the Su family's young master couldn't afford a mere ten million pounds of origin stones. For someone qualified to occupy the Heaven-class private room, even if this sum seemed enormous to ordinary people—even to the wealthy—it was pocket change.

At that moment, Ye Ling stood frozen, his expression dazed, his complexion shifting from green to red and then to a sickly purple.

He had been completely dominated by Meng Wudao. And Meng Wudao, facing Su Yun, hadn't even had the courage to make another bid—as if emphasizing some unspoken message through his actions.

By comparison, Ye Ling's earlier arrogance now seemed like a colossal joke.
