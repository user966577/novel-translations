Chapter 88: You're Too Weak

The numerous Su family important figures couldn't help but curl their lips, imagining a scene unsuitable for children.

These secular sects had always considered themselves above worldly matters. These Divine Spirits especially were even more arrogant.

Had they ever imagined that one day, they might be lying in their Su family Young Master's bed?

"Young Master Su Yun, you..."

Dao Yuan could no longer maintain his composure. He roared in fury, the black hair behind him moving without wind.

He hadn't expected that he had merely mentioned Li Yi and hadn't even gotten to the rest before Su Yun had revealed everything in front of so many people.

His original purpose had merely been to get Li Yi back. He had never thought about exposing the matter of the Innate Dao Body and the Kunlun Mirror.

Dao Yuan could imagine that this information would soon spread to the other two great Daoist sects through the people present.

When that time came, the Kunlun Daoist Sect's attempt to monopolize the Innate Dao Body and the Kunlun Mirror would become extremely difficult.

Dao Yuan immediately realized that Su Yun had done this deliberately.

He had very likely intended to spread this information all along but couldn't find an excuse because of his agreement with True Feather Divine Spirit. But Dao Yuan's arrival had given him the opportunity to use Dao Yuan to reveal everything.

And he had conveniently thrown dirty water on Dao Yuan. Next, the powerhouses in the sect would blame all of this on him.

"Young Master Su Yun, don't you think your actions violate morality?"

Dao Yuan roared in fury, his black hair dancing wildly. "You had an agreement with True Feather Divine Spirit, giving her three days to consider. Why would you reveal everything?

"I came here only because your father, Divine Spirit Su Heng, once said that peers competing should be handled by peers, with the older generation not interfering. So I wanted to spar with you and retrieve Li Yi.

"Yet you act like this, scheming against me."

Dao Yuan's calm face had turned iron-green.

At this moment, Su Yun merely smiled slightly. "Dao Child Dao Yuan, I don't understand what you're saying. You clearly came here to provoke me, violating my agreement with True Feather Divine Spirit. That's why I revealed everything."

Though Dao Yuan had guessed correctly, Su Yun naturally wouldn't admit it.

His target had always been the three great Daoist sects, even the entire Daoist sect. Dao Yuan's sudden arrival had merely given him the opportunity.

Having said this, Su Yun's gaze turned cold. "My father did indeed say those words, but you alone aren't worthy. I don't want to bully someone weaker."

At these words, everyone was stunned.

Su Yun was simply too arrogant.

If they remembered correctly, Su Yun had only just come of age not long ago, while Dao Yuan's age clearly seemed considerably older than Su Yun's.

Yet Su Yun was saying he'd be bullying someone weaker?

"Su Yun, you are simply arrogant beyond measure."

Instantly, Dao Yuan—who already felt he'd been schemed against—flew into a rage. "Since that's the case, do you dare fight me? If you lose, release Li Yi and hand over the Innate Dao Body and the Kunlun Mirror."

"Why wouldn't I dare?"

Su Yun laughed. "But if you lose, these are such enormous stakes—what do you have to offer in return?"

"How could I possibly lose?"

Dao Yuan smiled coldly. "Since my debut, I have never been defeated among my peers."

"Very well then. If I lose, I will pledge my life to serve you as a slave."

"A Kunlun Daoist Sect Dao Child as a slave—this stake isn't much less than yours, is it?"

Everyone was dumbfounded.

A Dao Child of an ancient Divine Spirit-level power was actually betting his entire life? Had he gone mad?

If he happened to lose, the Kunlun Daoist Sect would probably go insane from top to bottom.

"Naturally that's far from enough. You're not worthy of being compared to the Innate Dao Body and the Kunlun Mirror."

Su Yun smiled coldly, then put his hands behind his back and spoke lightly. "However, I agree."

A domineering, imperious aura suddenly emanated, pervading the sky.

Everyone nearly suffocated. Using the Innate Dao Body and an ancient divine weapon as stakes—this kind of massive gamble was rare since the resurgence of spiritual energy.

And where did Su Yun get such enormous confidence?

If he happened to lose, it would be an unimaginable, tremendous loss for the Su family.

"Simply arrogant beyond measure. Witness my Dao arts."

"Heaven Thunder Tribulation!"

Dao Yuan felt he was about to go mad with rage. He had never seen anyone among his peers dare to look down on him like this.

In that instant, surging vital energy gathered. Terrifying dragon roars rose and fell, shaking the heavens.

A full ninety-eight Dao Spirit dragons roared across the sky, seeming to fill heaven and earth.

"Ninety-eight dragons—what kind of monster is this?"

"I remember that the current Su family patriarch Su Heng, when he was at the Divine Profound realm, had only ninety-five dragons. Yet even so, he achieved supreme dominion, cultivated to become a strongest Divine Spirit, and led the Su family to its peak."

"Ninety-eight dragons—this is simply a once-in-a-century monster."

"Even without the Innate Dao Body, this Dao Yuan would very likely be able to unify the Daoist sect."

The various important figures around were terrified beyond belief.

They had all experienced the Divine Profound realm and deeply understood how difficult it was to increase strength after reaching one dragon's power at this realm.

Even increasing by just one dragon's power was as hard as ascending to heaven.

And ninety-eight dragon power—this difficulty was already not much less than directly cultivating to the Heaven Spirit realm or even the Saint realm.

Among the myriad ancient races, even those as powerful as the God and Demon races had extremely few who could reach this level.

Dao Yuan stood in the sky, his gaze merciless, Dao essence surging. He seemed to have become one with heaven and earth.

The ninety-eight dragons intertwined, roaring ceaselessly, condensing into a dark cloud that filled the sky. Within it, lightning rolled and crackled, the terrifying aura of heavenly punishment making even the Saint-level powerhouses present feel their scalps go numb.

This aura was actually identical to the Saint-level heavenly tribulation they had survived with great difficulty—just slightly smaller in scale.

What kind of monster was this Dao Yuan, that he could even simulate the might of heaven and earth?

"Heaven Thunder Tribulation, kill!" Dao Yuan roared, his black hair dancing wildly, his aura terrifyingly powerful.

In that instant, rolling divine thunder flooded toward Su Yun, directly drowning him from everyone's sight.

Beneath heavenly punishment, all was invisible.

This was the might of heaven and earth.

The numerous powerhouses nearly suffocated.

"Just this?"

Su Yun smiled coldly. He had experienced true heavenly tribulation—what was this counterfeit?

The next moment, the numerous powerhouses' eyes nearly popped out of their heads.

What had they just seen?

Su Yun actually made no attempt to resist. Instead, he strolled through the Heaven Thunder Tribulation, bathing in the rolling tribulation lightning as he walked, stepping onto the tribulation cloud and sending out a palm strike.

In an instant, the sky shattered.

The rolling dark clouds were suddenly swept clean.

Then Su Yun appeared instantly before Dao Yuan and slapped him hard across the face.

"You're too weak!"
