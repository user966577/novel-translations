Chapter 118: Absolute Loyalty

"Ha ha ha ha! Good, good, good!"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit was overjoyed, laughing heartily and saying "good" three times in succession.

Though it had been a difficult journey with enormous costs, being able to bring the Innate Dao Body into the sect made everything worthwhile.

After all, the Innate Dao Body was the physique possessed only by the founding ancestor who established the Daoist sects.

Behind him, the various elders and peak masters' eyes shone as they gazed at the Kunlun Mirror in Su Yayue's hands. Their bodies trembled with excitement, and some elders were already moved to tears.

"After several hundred years, our sect's divine weapon has finally returned."

"The ancestors in our heritage reserves are saved."

A group of old men shed tears of joy.

The Kunlun Daoist Sect's revival was finally within sight.

All the frustration they'd suffered at Su Yun's hands was worth it for this moment.

"Yu'er, Su Hong, please personally accompany Yayue to the Kunlun Daoist Sect."

At that moment, Su Yun suddenly smiled and turned to look to the side.

A woman and a man—two figures had appeared at some point in a corner of the palace, standing in the shadows.

"Yes, Husband. Yu'er will definitely protect Little Sister Yayue." True Feather Divine Spirit was veiled, but one could faintly see the joy in her eyes.

Her opportunity had arrived.

The Kunlun Divine Spirit was about to depart for the American continent.

The sect would be hers to command as Vice Sect Master.

All the costs she had paid—even becoming Su Yun's woman—had been worth it.

Together with Su Yayue, once she controlled the Kunlun Daoist Sect, her position in the Su family would become even higher and more secure.

"By your command, Young Master."

Su Hong bowed respectfully.

"Su Hong, this Young Master has important business and cannot get away. As the person of highest seniority in the Su family, you will represent this Young Master and Father, escorting Yayue to the Kunlun Daoist Sect, along with generous gifts.

"When my Su family's princess travels, we absolutely cannot let people from the reclusive sects look down on us." Su Yun spoke flatly.

"Reporting to the Young Master: everything is prepared."

Su Hong said respectfully: "From the Eighteen Battalions of the main branch, we have drawn ten Saints, one hundred peak Heaven Spirit Realm cultivators, one thousand Profound Palace cultivators, along with three Divine Spirit weapons, twenty Saint-level weapons, and various heavenly treasures."

"Mm." Su Yun nodded in satisfaction, his eyes filled with cold intent.

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression wasn't pleasant. Su Yun had dispatched such powerful forces to protect Su Yayue—even he would have to think twice before acting.

This was clearly a display of distrust toward him, or rather, toward the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

But he understood that Su Yun was guarding against anyone in the sect who might harm Su Yayue.

"Young Master Su Yun, we have pressing matters to attend to. We shall take Yayue back to the sect first."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit forced a smile.

"Mm."

Su Yun nodded with a smile, then suddenly added: "However, I have one more small matter I'd like the Sect Master to help with on the way."

"..."

"We are allies. Please speak freely, Young Master Su Yun."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit nodded numbly.

His mind held only one thought now: agree to everything, leave the Imperial Capital as quickly as possible, and get as far away from Su Yun as he could.

Su Yun was clearly trying to squeeze out every last bit of his remaining value.

...

After the resurgence of spiritual energy, the earth had transformed dramatically. Countless beasts had been baptized by the vital energy of heaven and earth, gaining benefits far greater than humans.

As a result, beyond the wilderness, ordinary small villages and even small towns couldn't rely on their own small communities' strength.

Only large cities, concentrating vast resources and powerful beings, could establish themselves in the wilderness on their own.

Tianhai City was one of China's medium-sized cities.

A mid-sized city about 15,000 miles from the Imperial Capital, with a population of over a million, it was home to numerous Saint-level major families. Powerhouses abounded, and it held considerable fame throughout China.

Today, the sun shone brightly and everything seemed normal.

But without anyone noticing, Tianhai City received a visitor—a major figure whose single stomp could make the entire city tremble.

Xuanyuan Ze emerged from the void expressionlessly and strode into a large estate at the very edge of Tianhai City, bordering the wilderness.

The estate was heavily guarded, with sentries every five paces and patrols every ten. Every guard wore battle armor, was battle-hardened, and was at least at the Heaven Spirit Realm.

Terrifying presences occasionally flickered across the sky.

These were the fearsome auras of Saint-level powerhouses, hidden in the void.

At least ten Saint-level supreme powerhouses stood guard.

To put this in perspective, all of Tianhai City combined probably couldn't muster five Saints. Yet this single estate concealed at least ten.

This was force enough to level Tianhai City.

The moment he stepped into the estate, a thick stench of blood assailed his nostrils, as if black winds were sweeping across the sky above.

Yet all of this was completely sealed within the estate by formation patterns, not a single wisp of blood scent escaping.

Soon, Xuanyuan Ze arrived at the center of the estate.

Before him was a massive lake of blood, with stark white bones floating on its surface. Guards continued to arrive, throwing corpses into it.

The blood lake was extremely hot, bubbling like magma.

Crimson mist covered the sky.

At the center of the lake stood a massive blood-red altar, covered in dense, intricate runes. Faintly, one could see endless wronged souls being drawn from the lake into it.

Atop the altar sat a blood-red stone tablet, carved with the two characters "Xuanyuan."

"Blood Altar."

Looking at the altar in the center of the lake, Xuanyuan Ze's expression remained blank as he murmured to himself.

Xuanyuan Li, who had been guarding the lake's perimeter, hurried over when he saw his father arrive. "Father, we're at 150,000 now. Everything is ready—nothing can go wrong."

Xuanyuan Ze frowned. "I told you 100,000 would be enough. Why did you kill 150,000?"

"Father, this is our last hope for a comeback. We can't afford any mistakes."

Xuanyuan Li's expression grew somewhat fierce. "We must break open the Divine Farmer Shennong's relic. Otherwise, the Xuanyuan family will be completely destroyed at our hands. We'll become sinners of the Xuanyuan family.

"Our Xuanyuan family has protected the human race for generations. These people's deaths are also contributions to the Xuanyuan family.

"Their deaths are worth it.

"Once your son revives the Xuanyuan family, I will invite Buddhist monks to perform rites for them and erect memorial stones."

Xuanyuan Ze's frown deepened. Finally, he sighed and said: "No word has leaked out, has it? The Blood Altar is explicitly forbidden by the Federation."

"Rest assured, Father. Your son has personally supervised and handled everything."

A ruthless gleam flashed in Xuanyuan Li's eyes. "Most of these people came from small villages and towns in the wilderness. We've covered our tracks—made it look like beast kings destroyed them.

"Only a small portion came from Tianhai City and surrounding major cities.

"In times like these, tens of thousands dying every few days is perfectly normal. No one will discover anything."

"Mm."

"Can you guarantee absolute loyalty from the people we're using? That little wretch Su Yun has never given up on us. The Xuanyuan family's internal affairs have already been infiltrated by him."

Xuanyuan Ze spoke gravely.
