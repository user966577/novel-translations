Chapter 117: This Is Win-Win?

Threatening?

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved slightly as a cold gleam flashed in his eyes. He said flatly: "Kunlun Divine Spirit, the outside world currently believes the Kunlun Daoist Sect and my Su family are allies. Since we're allies, how could I possibly threaten you?

"I'm merely discussing with you what the next step should be—how my Su family and the Kunlun Daoist Sect can continue cooperating to maximize our mutual benefits."

As he spoke, Su Yun's smile grew radiant. "Kunlun Divine Spirit, this is win-win for both of us!"

Looking at the smile on Su Yun's face, the Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression turned iron-green. He desperately wanted to ask Su Yun: When you say win-win, do you mean you win twice?

What benefits?

This was obviously just painting him a pretty picture.

The Barbarian Tribe had only lost one battle—their foundation wasn't damaged. Their counterattack would only grow more fierce. If the Kunlun Daoist Sect got involved now, forget about spreading their faith—they'd pay an enormous price instead.

Unless the Su family could truly establish a firm foothold on the American continent.

Otherwise, if they couldn't withstand the Barbarian counterattack and had to retreat, the Kunlun Divine Spirit didn't believe for a moment that the Su family would offer any compensation to the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

This Su Yun was simply a man who devoured people whole without spitting out the bones.

But he understood that continuing to argue would be pointless—at most, they'd tear off all pretense of civility.

Yet even tearing off pretense wouldn't change one fact: the Kunlun Daoist Sect had already been deeply infiltrated by Su Yun without anyone noticing.

Most critically, True Feather Divine Spirit hated him and had actually turned to follow Su Yun's commands, working against him.

Going forward, he had to find a way to make True Feather Divine Spirit stop following Su Yun's orders. Then Li Yi would naturally stop siding with the Su family.

But at this point, he could only take a gamble. After all, the Kunlun Daoist Sect had already been bound to the Su family without realizing it. If he refused now, not only would all his previous efforts be wasted, but the sect would face storms from both within and without.

It might even decline completely, or be destroyed entirely.

"Su Yun."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit took a deep breath, calming himself, and said gravely: "Just now, I spoke impulsively."

"I can personally lead a group of powerhouses to the American continent to help Councilman Su Heng civilize the Barbarians.

"But you must guarantee that in the future, only my Kunlun Daoist Sect will be allowed to spread our faith and take disciples there."

In truth, spreading the Dao to the myriad races and propagating their faith across Azure Star had always been a goal of the Daoist sects. But with the entire human race in decline, there was no way to spread the Dao to the myriad races.

The myriad races simply looked down on human religions.

This was the first time a human powerhouse had defeated a powerful ancient race outside human territory.

If the Su family could truly establish a firm foothold on the American continent, countless powerful reclusive sects would come knocking, hoping to spread their faith outside human lands and seize the initiative.

The main issue was that this was merely the first battle's victory. There were too many unknowns, and no one wanted to get involved.

If Su Yun hadn't pressed at every turn, even threatening to tear off all pretense, the Kunlun Divine Spirit would never have gotten involved either.

But since he couldn't escape—

The Kunlun Divine Spirit had to confirm one thing: if they really did help the Su family establish a foothold on the American continent, and the Kunlun Daoist Sect paid the price in blood, would Su Yun turn around and deny everything?

That's right—the Kunlun Divine Spirit was afraid of Su Yun now.

In just seven short days, Su Yun had repeatedly gone back on his word and pressed at every turn.

He had never met someone who could turn on others so ruthlessly.

"Ha ha ha ha..."

Suddenly, Su Yun burst into laughter. "Kunlun Divine Spirit, naturally that's the case. As long as my Su family can establish a firm foothold on the American continent—even conquer the entire Barbarian Tribe—

"I, Su Yun, guarantee that your Kunlun Daoist Sect will be the only Daoist sect that can spread its faith among the Barbarians. No—the only reclusive sect, period."

Su Yun spoke with absolute certainty.

The entire Kunlun Daoist Sect would soon be under his command.

Why would he let some other reclusive sect spread their faith, inviting those baldies or those pedantic Confucians to preach? He'd have to be insane.

If not for the many urgent matters requiring his attention, after dealing with the Xuanyuan family, the first thing he'd have brought under his control would have been the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

"I don't believe you. Swear a Heart Demon oath," the Kunlun Divine Spirit said, still shaken and fearful, not daring to trust Su Yun's words.

Even though all he saw in Su Yun's eyes was sincerity.

This fellow had looked exactly the same way the last time he'd made a promise.

Despite his young age, his scheming ran too deep.

After all, if the Su family did turn on them when the time came, what could a reclusive sect like his do against a Divine Spirit family with real power in the Federation?

"Fine, fine, fine. I'll swear the oath." Su Yun laughed. With the Kunlun Divine Spirit personally leading the expedition, Father Su Heng's pressure would be greatly reduced.

He would also have time to gather resources and conscript troops to send to the American continent.

Most importantly, with the Kunlun Divine Spirit gone, wouldn't the Kunlun Daoist Sect be run by True Feather Divine Spirit and Li Yi? Before long, the Kunlun Daoist Sect would be his.

"I, Su Yun, swear..."

Seeing Su Yun make a Heart Demon oath, the Kunlun Divine Spirit let out a long breath.

This way, Su Yun couldn't casually burn bridges.

"Yayue, this Kunlun Mirror is entrusted to you."

Su Yun's gaze was deep as he took out the Kunlun Mirror and placed it in Su Yayue's hands.

With Su Yayue controlling the Kunlun Mirror, she could threaten the Kunlun Daoist Sect's heritage. This would be enormously helpful for her advancement within the sect.

After all, those old fellows in the heritage reserves were just like Xuanyuan Shen, the Divine Son—none of them would act without seeing profit first. Gaining their support would mean half the battle of conquering the Kunlun Daoist Sect was already won.

"Thank you for your trust, Young Master. Yayue will definitely not fail your expectations. For the Su family, I would go through fire and water."

"Take your master now." Su Yun smiled faintly, his gaze deep and cold. He had already refined the Kunlun Mirror. Unless someone could do what he had done to Ye Ling—suppress him with the awakened ancient divine weapon Chaos Bell and beat him down to a mere wisp of remnant soul—no one could take the Kunlun Mirror away. With a single thought, the Kunlun Mirror would fly back to him through the void.

"Young Master, you have shown Yayue great kindness. Yayue will forever be a member of your Personal Guard Battalion."

Su Yayue's eyes reddened slightly.

From childhood to now, aside from her adoptive parents, no one had ever treated her this well—even entrusting her with an incomparably precious ancient divine weapon.

One could say that Su Yun had changed the course of her entire life.

Deep in her heart, she had long since considered herself Su Yun's person.

"Yayue greets her master."

Su Yayue walked before the Kunlun Divine Spirit and bowed. Her tone held little joy.

If not for Su Yun's instructions, she wouldn't have wanted to join the Kunlun Daoist Sect at all. She didn't want to leave Su Yun's side, didn't want to leave the Imperial Capital.
