Chapter 70: I Have Other Matters. I'll Leave First

Countless powerhouses throughout the Imperial Capital watched, dumbstruck. Especially those Saint-level old monsters who had lived for hundreds of years—they were completely bewildered.

The Xuanyuan family was cooperating with the Su family's orders?

Put nicely, it was cooperation.

Put bluntly, it was following the Su family's commands, acting on orders.

They had even said that anyone who dared try to sow discord between the two families would be directly captured and sent to the Su family.

This completely contradicted the Xuanyuan family's usual way of doing things.

No one knew what had happened internally within the Xuanyuan family. Such a monumentally impactful decision—why wasn't it Patriarch Xuanyuan Ze who came out to announce it? Why had it become Xuanyuan Chong?

But everyone understood that the Imperial Capital—this heart of China where countless resources and powerhouses gathered, this place protected by two ancient divine families—had changed.

The Xuanyuan family's decline and the Su family's rise—the momentum of the Su family dominating everything could no longer be stopped.

"Xuanyuan Ze, I'll f*ck your ancestors!"

"Damn it all! We're here holding meetings, coordinating with you to oppose Su Yun, yet you announce you're cooperating with Su Yun's orders and closing your doors for three days!"

"Are you trying to roast us over a fire?!"

Among the many Su family direct-line members holding their meeting, a large group saw this scene. After their initial shock, they began jumping up and down, cursing furiously.

They were going mad.

Many of these direct-line members had extensive dealings with the Xuanyuan family. Their interests were deeply intertwined, their families intermarried for generations.

That was why, this time, they had convened a meeting to strip Su Yun of his heir position—to coordinate with Xuanyuan Ze's mobilization of the entire clan.

Qin Junhua had discovered their actions and launched a massive counterattack. They were already under tremendous pressure. But they had thought that with the Xuanyuan family's external pressure, Qin Junhua definitely wouldn't dare tear off all pretense with them.

But who could have predicted that the Xuanyuan family would pull the rug out from under them, actually capitulating to Su Yun's tyrannical, insane orders?

Weren't they pushing them toward a dead end?

That Su Yun guy was a madman. He had been ready to kill even Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie—torturing Su Lie's daughter to death right in front of him.

And at that time, he had only controlled the five battalions of the Su family headquarters.

"Didn't you say you had already communicated with the Divine Generals of the thirteen battalions besides the Five Elemental Divine Battalions? That they wouldn't interfere in Su family headquarters' internal matters?"

The elder seated in the place of honor spoke with a low voice containing explosive fury.

His name was Su Hong. One of the strongest members among the headquarters' direct line. His status was even higher than Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie had been. His seniority was so high that even Su Heng had to call him "grand-uncle."

He had come forward this time because he too disapproved of Su Yun and Qin Junhua's domineering methods. Combined with the repeated invitations from the various direct-line members, he had come to preside over matters.

"Grand-uncle, who could have predicted that Su Yun could mobilize the eighteen battalions?"

"That Su Heng actually trusts his son this much. He's barely just come of age, yet he's already handed him the Patriarch Token!"

"Isn't he afraid his own son will push the Su family into the abyss?"

"In all of the Su family's history, nothing like this has ever happened!"

"The Su family has been passed down for a thousand years, deeply rooted. Does Su Yun's family really think they can dominate everything within the Su family?"

Many direct-line powerhouses spoke up, filled with righteous indignation.

"Worthless fools! This old bag of bones is probably going to be done in by you lot!"

Su Hong erupted in fury, slamming the table and rising to his feet. His snow-white beard bristled upward.

At a time like this, these people actually still wanted to push him to the forefront.

"I have other matters to attend to. I'll leave first."

Instantly, the faces of all the direct-line members went pale. They spoke up in unison: "Grand-uncle, you can't leave at a time like this!"

"Once you leave, that madman Su Yun will come and swallow us alive!"

"Don't forget your son and grandson both married women from the Xuanyuan family. Once you leave, they're finished too!"

"You're a supreme powerhouse of the Su family who has ignited divine fire. Your seniority is so high. With you here, he definitely won't dare act too recklessly."

"With you here, we all have considerable influence in various parts of the Su family. Su Yun definitely won't dare go too far."

"Blame that damned Xuanyuan Ze!"

Under their persuasion, Su Hong's steps faltered slightly. His gaze became somewhat hesitant.

At that moment, a loud laughing voice suddenly came from outside:

"This junior was still a mile away, yet already heard many uncles, aunts, and elders constantly mentioning Su Yun's name. To receive such care from all of you—Su Yun truly feels honored beyond measure!"

As the words fell, an extraordinarily handsome young man who seemed to merge with heaven and earth strode into the great hall with the gait of a dragon and tiger. A smile played at the corner of his lips as he walked directly to the front of the assembly—to the main seat where Su Hong had just been sitting.

"If I'm not mistaken, this must be Grand-uncle Su Hong?"

"Please, sit, everyone sit. Su Yun also wants to hear what great matters all you uncles, grand-uncles, and aunts have gathered here to discuss." Su Yun said with a smile, gesturing for them to sit down.

All the direct-line powerhouses were stunned.

Su Hong also stood frozen in place, his expression iron-dark, not saying a word.

The words Su Yun had spoken were obviously mocking and humiliating them.

Discuss what?

As if you, Su Yun, don't know what we're discussing?

Then what are you here for?!

Were the five Divine Generals—Fire Elemental, Thunder God, Lightning God, Wind God—driving their Divine Spirit ancient war chariots outside the hall just for decoration?

He had sealed off the entire Su family headquarters.

He had sealed off the entire Imperial Capital too, with layers upon layers of encirclement. He was obviously targeting them, preventing them from transmitting news from headquarters to the Su family forces distributed throughout the world.

They couldn't help but glance toward their own residences. They saw that the eighty thousand soldiers from the eight divine battalions had practically filled the sky. Murderous aura flooded the heavens as their residences were surrounded like iron barrels.

It seemed that with a single order from Su Yun, they would surge into their residences—just as the Demon God Battalion had exterminated that Imperial Capital clan—and slaughter their children, wives, and concubines, leaving none alive.

"Su Yun, don't forget this is the Su family headquarters. The Su family's center of power. The place that controls the entire world. Acting so tyrannically and launching mass killings—aren't you afraid of causing internal chaos within the Su family?"

A peak Saint-level direct-line powerhouse, half a step from igniting his divine fire, spoke in a low voice. He seemed like a volcano that could erupt at any moment.

His name was Su Yihui. A peak Saint-level powerhouse, of the same generation as Su Heng. Though his position in the Federation wasn't high, within the Su family he held significant power. He was in charge of the source stone mines, divine iron mines, and divine gold mines that the Su family controlled across the world.

What he managed brought in revenue that accounted for nearly a fifth of the Su family's annual income. His position and power were therefore extremely high.

Because he—and his father, and grandfather—had all held this position, controlling enormous financial resources passed down through generations, he wielded tremendous influence among the Su family's forces distributed throughout the world. Many factions were dependent on him.

Even looking at the entire world, though Su Yihui was merely at peak Saint level, his power and status exceeded that of many who had ignited their divine fire.

That was why, even though he had been close friends with Su Yong twenty years ago, after Su Yong's death he had quickly severed all ties. And Su Heng, for the sake of internal stability within the Su family, hadn't eliminated his lineage during that great purge.
