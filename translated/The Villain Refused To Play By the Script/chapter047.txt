Chapter 47: One Sword

"Su Lie."

Suddenly, a calm voice echoed above Chaos Heavenly King's Manor.

The voice was calm—so flat it contained no emotion whatsoever. Yet the moment it sounded, the sky ceased to flow. Wind fell silent. Tree branches stopped swaying.

In that moment, heaven and earth seemed to fall into a state of deathly stillness.

Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie was forced directly out of the spatial fold, appearing at the manor gates.

His gaze was cold as he looked toward the front of the manor. A man in white had appeared there at some point, watching him with calm eyes.

The man simply stood there. His features were ordinary. Yet he seemed to have gathered all the light between heaven and earth.

"Swordless Heavenly King, do you intend to stop me?" Chaos Heavenly King's eyes flashed with wariness as he spoke coldly.

This man was named Su Jian—also a direct descendant of the Su family's main branch, titled Swordless Heavenly King.

Unlike Su Lie, he had never held high positions in the Federation or led troops into battle. Instead, he had earned the Federation's Heavenly King title purely through his own strength, having single-handedly slaughtered an entire ancient clan.

Su Jian was also known as the strongest person beneath the Divine Spirits in all of China.

"The Young Master's authority must be upheld by someone." Su Jian's voice held no fluctuation.

Chaos Heavenly King's expression suddenly darkened. He said coldly: "Su Jian, don't forget that you were once merely a branch family member. It was the main branch that gave you the noble status of a direct descendant. You come to stop me today—have you considered whether you can bear the consequences?"

His voice was thick with threat.

"Everything I have was given by the Patriarch. Back then, Su Yong couldn't take it from me. You certainly can't either." Facing the threat, Su Jian's voice remained calm, his expression still as a dried-up well.

Instantly, Su Lie's expression darkened further. Ever since Su Heng had taken power, he had vigorously promoted his own people while suppressing the direct line, causing great dissatisfaction among them.

This was why they had been subtly protecting Su Meng all along—as a warning to Su Heng's faction not to go too far.

"Enough talk. Are you truly going to stop me from retrieving my daughter today?"

"I'm saving your life. At this point, how can you still not understand? Do you really think the Young Master wouldn't dare kill a Heavenly King like you?" Su Jian shook his head.

"Heh heh!"

Su Lie laughed coldly, his tone indifferent: "I am his elder, a direct descendant of the Su family, a Federation Heavenly King, Vice Chairman of the Federation Military Joint Chiefs. Even his mother can't do anything to me—let alone some wet-behind-the-ears brat."

"Today I'm going to teach him how to show proper respect to his elders."

"Get out of my way."

Su Lie roared. His black hair danced wildly as the sky trembled and clouds churned. His Saint's might made heaven and earth cower.

Su Jian raised his head, his gaze calm. "If you can take one sword from me, I'll let you pass."

"A mere branch family member, so arrogant."

"Where I stand, chaos reigns boundless."

Su Lie roared and unleashed his Chaos divine ability. The laws of heaven and earth suddenly fell into chaos. The sky became murky. Stones grew from nearby trees. A stream flowed upward toward the heavens. Sky and earth inverted.

All rules and order seemed to have been thrown into disarray.

And Su Lie had become the sole god of this chaotic world.

"With sword in heart, all swords are mine."

Having spoken, Su Jian showed no sign of releasing any power. He simply pressed two fingers together and slashed upward from below.

In that instant, heaven and earth seemed to dim slightly. A sword scar appeared from the ground to the endless sky, cleaving the heavens in two.

With a "hum," the chaotic world was directly shattered by the sword scar. Heaven and earth instantly returned to normal.

"Pfft!"

Su Lie suddenly vomited blood and staggered backward more than a dozen steps. Each step was impossibly heavy, shaking the earth and leaving a crater where he stood.

When he steadied himself and raised his head, his face had gone deathly pale. A fine line of blood ran from between his brows all the way down to his waist, perfectly straight.

His royal robes had been sliced open by that one sword, fluttering in the wind.

"Drip, drip, drip..."

Fine droplets of blood seeped from between his brows and flowed along the thin sword mark, all the way down, dripping to the ground.

That one sword had not only shattered his chaotic world of rules but had nearly cleaved him in two.

"Su Jian, one day you will pay the price for protecting Su Yun today."

Chaos Heavenly King's face was pale. He gave Su Jian one cold look, then turned and walked back into his manor.

"Young Master, you've finally grown up. We old fellows can rest easy now."

Su Jian murmured to himself. On his calm face, the corner of his lips curved slightly upward, as if smiling. He glanced at Su Yun, then his figure vanished instantly.

As for Chaos Heavenly King, he had never even registered in Su Jian's eyes.

"Su Jian is one of Su Heng's strongest subordinates, yet he actually stepped forward. Could it be that he's acknowledged Su Yun?"

In the sky, the many Su family powerhouses who had just arrived witnessed this scene and couldn't help but draw sharp breaths.

Su Jian was currently one of the Su family members most likely to ignite divine fire and prove the Dao to become a Divine Spirit.

Yet although he had been promoted entirely by Su Heng, he had never made his position clear regarding Su Yun, the Su family's heir.

No one had expected that when Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie tested Su Yun, the first person to step forward and stop him would be Su Jian.

Su Jian's stance represented many things—after all, he was merely one of Su Heng's trusted subordinates.

Could Su Yun's performance have already earned their acknowledgment?

If so, Su Yun's position would become unshakeable.

This would be an earthquake for the Su family—indeed, for all Su family forces across the globe—enough to cause ripples throughout the world.

After all, Su Heng had led these very subordinates to secure the position of family patriarch and expand the Su family's influence several times over, reaching the current pinnacle.

"Fortunately, it was Su Jian who appeared. Otherwise, we really might not have been able to stop Chaos Heavenly King."

"If he had truly clashed head-on with Su Yun and the Five Elemental Divine Battalions, the entire Imperial Capital would have been shaken."

"That really would have been impossible to resolve."

The many direct-line powerhouses let out long breaths of relief, then immediately returned to their respective residences.

They hadn't realized that because of Su Yun's unexpectedly ferocious counterattack—his posture of being ready to fight at any cost—their first instinct had been to stop Su Lie rather than persuade Su Yun, so as not to let things escalate.

And at that moment, outside the Su family estate gates, wind and clouds shifted colors. Five colors—gold, wood, water, fire, and earth—rose between heaven and earth. Terrifying formation patterns connected heaven and earth, linking five directions a hundred miles outside the Imperial Capital to five gates at the Su family entrance.

The formation patterns connected heaven and earth. On the other side, clouds churned and divine light blazed. It seemed as though thousands upon thousands of troops were galloping and roaring, producing sounds like rolling thunder.

"Rumble..."

Suddenly, five massive ancient war chariots crushed across the sky, rumbling as they passed through the formation patterns, making the very heavens tremble.

Atop each chariot stood a armored general, face completely concealed.

Behind them, clouds churned with murderous intent rising to the heavens. Through gaps in the mist, armor occasionally glinted—countless powerful warriors.
