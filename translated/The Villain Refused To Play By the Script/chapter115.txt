Chapter 115: Adopting a Daughter on Father's Behalf

"Take them all into custody and bring them back to the Su family. Interrogate them thoroughly. I want to know how they infiltrated the Imperial Capital without a sound—and who was helping them from behind."

A cold gleam flashed in Su Yun's eyes.

The Barbarian Tribe and the human race were separated by vast mountains and seas, and had always been hostile with no contact whatsoever.

Without expert assistance, how could Ling Man and the four Barbarian gods have infiltrated human territory, traveled unobstructed all the way to China, and even entered the Imperial Capital without anyone noticing?

Moreover, this person must hold a high position in the Azure Federation, with at least one extremely powerful force backing them.

Otherwise, it would have been impossible to accomplish all this in such a short time.

After all, his father Su Heng had only recently defeated the Spirit Barbarian lineage of the Barbarian Tribe on the American continent—at most ten days ago. Yet in that brief span, the Barbarian princess had brought four Barbarian gods and infiltrated China, entering the Imperial Capital.

"Whoever you are, I will make you pay the most devastating price." Su Yun's gaze was cold.

He couldn't deny it—this was the greatest crisis he had faced since coming to this world.

Four half-step supreme Barbarian gods working together, using a supreme Barbarian weapon to seal off space. If he hadn't just happened to obtain the World Tree Fruit, broken through to the Profound Palace Realm, and gained the heaven-defying technique Greater Thousand Worlds—not to mention the two ancient divine weapons in his possession—he wouldn't have had even the slightest chance of escape.

Once he fell into Barbarian hands, his father Su Heng's campaign would have essentially been over.

The hard-won stability within the Su family, along with their favorable situation, would have plunged into chaos because of his disappearance.

At that moment, the system's voice rang out:

"Congratulations, Host. You have altered the Xuanyuan family's destiny and enhanced the destiny qi of the Destiny's Beloved. Reward: 4,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, Host. You have altered the Kunlun Daoist Sect's destiny. Reward: 3,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, Host. You have captured a Destiny's Beloved. Reward: 2,000 charm points."

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit Bloodline

Realm: Profound Palace Realm [50,000-zhang mountain-and-river Profound Palace, nurturing 'Spirit Veins']

Cultivation Methods: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art, Divine-Demon Scripture

Weapons: God-Devil Pendant [Divine-Demon Supreme Treasure], Kunlun Mirror [Ancient Supreme Divine Weapon]

Divine Abilities: Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes, Greater Thousand Worlds [Divine ability contained within World Tree Fruit]

Charm Points: 52,000 [Mountains and Rivers Lose Color] [Cultivation speed increased 40x]

"Cultivation speed has increased another four times."

Su Yun nodded in satisfaction, his gaze lingering on the two heaven-defying divine abilities the system had rewarded him.

If not for Greater Thousand Worlds' heaven-defying power—connecting to the great worlds hidden in the infinite void and granting him limitless power to drive the God-Devil Pendant and Kunlun Mirror—he couldn't have withstood even a single move from the four supreme Barbarian gods, let alone break through the supreme Barbarian weapon's spatial barrier.

As expected, anything from the system was guaranteed to be top quality.

"Next, it's time to venture beyond the Imperial Capital. Qin Ying, I'm very curious whether this incident has anything to do with you."

A cold, murderous gleam flashed in Su Yun's eyes.

What he hated most were traitors.

The Qin family had actually changed sides at the critical moment, dragging down the Su family.

If they refused to repent, he wouldn't mind going on a killing spree.

But before leaving, he still needed to handle a few matters.

...

The next day.

Su family main hall.

Su Yun sat expressionlessly in the seat of honor.

At that moment, Yun Ran walked in and reported respectfully:

"Reporting to the Young Master: the Kunlun Divine Spirit has led the Kunlun Daoist Sect elders here to request an audience."

Su Yun didn't even open his eyes. "Let them in."

"By your command!" Yun Ran withdrew.

"Ha ha ha, Young Master Su Yun, this Divine Spirit has arrived as promised!"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's voice preceded his arrival, his laughter echoing from outside the great hall. "Today is the seventh day—you can't delay any longer!"

With that, the Kunlun Divine Spirit strode into the hall, his eyes bright. Today, he had specially changed into a brand-new yin-yang Dao robe, giving off the impression of a transcendent master.

Behind him, the various elders and peak masters filed in, their eyes filled with excitement.

Today, they would finally bring the Kunlun Mirror and the Innate Dao Body back to the sect.

The Kunlun Daoist Sect's rise was imminent.

But upon entering the hall and seeing the empty space, they vaguely sensed a solemn, killing atmosphere that made their hearts sink.

This didn't look like they would be receiving disciples smoothly.

It seemed that today, Su Yun still had no intention of letting them pass easily.

"Yayue, come out."

At that moment, Su Yun opened his eyes, a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth as he turned to look to the side.

The next moment, a young woman of exquisite beauty emerged from behind the hall—lightly powdered, her cheeks slightly flushed, her bearing ethereal.

Today, she wore a red floor-length gown. Two maidservants followed behind, holding up her train as she walked gracefully forward.

"Truly worthy of the Innate Dao Body that only the Daoist Sect's founding ancestor possessed."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit and all the elders and peak masters' eyes lit up. They instantly sensed the Dao essence emanating from Su Yayue's body—a quality of being one with the Dao of heaven and earth.

This was simply the supreme physique for cultivating Daoist scriptures.

"Yayue greets the Young Master," Su Yayue said softly, bowing to Su Yun.

"Ha ha ha, after today, you should call him 'Elder Brother.'"

Su Yun's indifferent expression changed to a brilliant smile. He stepped forward to help Su Yayue to her feet, then turned to the Kunlun Divine Spirit and said: "I, Su Yun, am a man of my word. I will never go back on it. Today I will definitely have Yayue take the Sect Master as her master.

"However, before that, I'd like to ask everyone to serve as witnesses."

Instantly, the smile vanished from the Kunlun Divine Spirit's face. What new scheme was Su Yun cooking up now?

A man of his word?

Su Yun, are you sure you're talking about yourself?

They had agreed that once True Feather Divine Spirit was married to him as a concubine, his personal guard Su Yayue would take him as her master.

But what had happened in the past two days?

The Kunlun Daoist Sect—a venerable reclusive sect—had been forced to intervene in the dispute between the Su family and the Xuanyuan family, boarding the Su family's ship.

Heaven only knew how much pressure he had faced.

"Yayue, my father Su Heng and my mother Qin Junhua are not present."

Su Yun spoke gently: "Today, before your future master and all these elders as witnesses, I shall adopt you as a daughter on my parents' behalf. You shall enter my Su family as a direct-line member. Are you willing?"

"Yayue is willing," Su Yayue replied immediately, her cheeks flushed.

Heaven knew how excited she was inside.

She had grown up in the Imperial Capital, raised under Su family rule, listening to Su family legends all her life.

Even the Lingyun Academy her parents had scraped together to send her to was run by the Ling family—a vassal family of the Su family.

Once upon a time, she had never dared to imagine that she could become Su Yun's personal guard, let alone become a direct-line member of the Su family—adopted by the patriarch Su Heng as a daughter, becoming the younger sister of the Su family's heir.
