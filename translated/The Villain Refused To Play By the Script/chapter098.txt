Chapter 98: As Long as My Husband Likes It

True Feather Divine Spirit's face grew even paler. Intense shame flooded her heart in an instant.

She was a prodigy from the same era as Su Heng—a Daoist Divine Spirit of noble status.

Yet today, she was being called "Yu'er" by a man decades younger than herself.

All of this was because those people from the Kunlun Daoist Sect had forced her into it.

The more ashamed she felt, the more her hatred for them grew.

She hated her own past inaction, having voluntarily yielded the Sect Master position to the Kunlun Divine Spirit.

If she had been like An Ruoyi—the Sect Master of the Kunlun Daoist Sect—who among these people would dare pressure her like this?

At this moment, True Feather Divine Spirit found herself filled with intense longing for the Kunlun Daoist Sect's Sect Master position.

She had made such a tremendous sacrifice for the Kunlun Daoist Sect, nearly destroying her reputation. Why shouldn't the Sect Master position be hers?

"As you command. Whatever my husband likes to call me, Yu'er shall answer to."

True Feather Divine Spirit seemed to have figured something out. A smile appeared on her face.

From now on, she was Su Yun's concubine.

The internal politics of the Kunlun Daoist Sect would never accept a secular family's concubine becoming the Sect Master—unless she possessed overwhelming background and power.

In that case, Su Yun would be her strongest backing.

Since she had agreed to all this, True Feather Divine Spirit suppressed her hatred and let go of her pride.

"Hahahaha..."

Su Yun laughed heartily and turned to Yun Ran. "Ran'er, take True Feather Divine Spirit to bathe and change clothes. Teach her all the basic etiquette for serving me, then wait for my arrival."

A cold glint flashed through his eyes.

With True Feather Divine Spirit in his hands, was taking control of the Kunlun Daoist Sect still far away?

"Yes, Young Master."

Yun Ran's eyes shone with a hint of pride. After all, this was the Young Master she had vowed to serve for life.

Making a Daoist Divine Spirit a concubine—this was unprecedented in human history.

"Sister Yu'er, let's go."

Yun Ran smiled openly. As Su Yun's personal attendant who had followed him the longest, calling True Feather Divine Spirit "Yu'er" was perfectly appropriate.

Divine Maiden of the Daoist sects? Divine Spirit? So what?

Once she entered the Su family's gates, she was merely Su Yun's concubine and had to follow the Su family's rules.

"Alright, Ran'er."

True Feather smiled radiantly. She glanced at the Kunlun Divine Spirit and the various elders and peak masters whose expressions had darkened, then followed Yun Ran out of the hall.

"True Feather."

"I did this for the sect, for Master's dying wish."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression was dark as he muttered to himself.

No one had expected True Feather Divine Spirit to adapt so quickly.

Having grown up together since childhood, he could clearly sense the intense hatred True Feather harbored toward him.

But so be it—let her hate!

With the Kunlun Mirror, the sect's foundation could continue to exist, at least until the Innate Dao Body matured and unified the Daoist sects.

By then, the sect would only be stronger. Even if True Feather killed him with her own hands, it would be worth it.

At that moment, An Ruoyi's mocking voice reached them:

"Kunlun Divine Spirit, the title of 'seductress' will probably have to be passed to your sect from now on."

"My Celestial Maiden Sect concedes."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit sneered. "Still better than you women who've disgraced the Daoist sects' reputation throughout the world with your fickleness."

With that, the Kunlun Divine Spirit turned to Su Yun and smiled. "Young Master Su Yun, may I take Li Yi, the Innate Dao Body, and the Kunlun Mirror now?"

"Li Yi can certainly be handed over to you first."

Su Yun said indifferently. "Dark Lady, bring Li Yi out."

"Yes!" Dark Lady's voice came from outside the hall.

Before long, Li Yi—pale-faced, covered in wounds—stumbled into the hall. Upon seeing the Kunlun Divine Spirit and the others, his eyes reddened. He dropped to his knees with a thud.

"Li Yi now knows everything that happened. Here, I bow in gratitude to the Sect Master, all the elders, and peak masters for saving my life. Li Yi will never forget this kindness."

"Hahahaha, a teachable lad indeed."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit laughed heartily, the gloom over True Feather Divine Spirit swept away from his heart. With a wave of his hand, he lifted Li Yi from afar. "Li Yi, this time you've rendered great merit to our Daoist sect by discovering the Innate Dao Body and the Kunlun Mirror. And your master has made tremendous sacrifices for the sect. After discussing with all the elders and peak masters, we've decided to establish you as the Dao Child of our Kunlun Daoist Sect."

Li Yi had been personally raised by True Feather Divine Spirit, who cared for him deeply.

Making him Dao Child would also somewhat compensate for his guilt toward True Feather Divine Spirit.

Moreover, Li Yi was extremely talented—not much inferior to Dao Yuan. With focused cultivation, he wouldn't fall too far behind.

Most importantly, making him Dao Child could also reduce True Feather Divine Spirit's resentment toward the sect and get her to speak favorably of the Kunlun Daoist Sect before Su Yun.

After all, the Innate Dao Body was Su Yun's personal guard. The Kunlun Mirror was only being borrowed for seven days to stabilize their foundation.

And maintaining good relations with the Su family would also bring enormous benefits to the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

Considering all this, making Li Yi the Dao Child was the most correct choice.

"Li Yi, the sect's future belongs to you young people."

"From now on, work together with the Dao Maiden—the Innate Dao Body—to revive the sect and unify the Daoist sects."

...

The various peak masters and elders smiled approvingly, quite satisfied with Li Yi's performance.

After all, Li Yi knew everything, yet harbored no resentment toward them. Instead, he was sincerely grateful. Making him Dao Child was indeed the perfect choice.

"Li Yi thanks the Sect Master, all the elders and peak masters. I will definitely work hard and not disappoint everyone's expectations."

Li Yi's body trembled slightly, as if greatly moved. But no one saw the cold glint that flashed through his lowered eyes.

He had already taken the Heart Demon Pill. Everything now revolved around Su Yun's will.

Even if these people hadn't spoken, Su Yun's first task for him was to do everything possible to become the Kunlun Daoist Sect's Dao Child.

Su Yun smiled coldly and continued, "Kunlun Divine Spirit, and all the Kunlun Daoist Sect seniors—once I hand over the Kunlun Mirror to Yayue, she will manage the Kunlun Mirror on my behalf.

"When I consummate my relationship with True Feather Divine Spirit, I shall hold a grand banquet. All of you may tour my Su family freely and experience the prosperity of the Imperial Capital. Seven days later, Yayue will return to the Daoist sect with all of you."

Instantly, the Kunlun Daoist Sect members' bodies trembled, excitement flashing through their eyes.

Su Yun was actually going to give the Kunlun Mirror to Su Yayue to manage? This was wonderful news!

They hadn't expected Su Yun to hand over the Kunlun Mirror to them—after all, it was an ancient divine weapon.

But giving it to Su Yayue, who was the Kunlun Daoist Sect's Dao Maiden—how was that any different from giving it to the Kunlun Daoist Sect?

With the Kunlun Mirror, the Kunlun Daoist Sect would have an ancient divine weapon. Why would they fear the Celestial Maiden Sect or the Lingxiao Sect? In terms of powerhouses alone, they surpassed both sects. They would practically become the leader of the three great Daoist sects overnight.
