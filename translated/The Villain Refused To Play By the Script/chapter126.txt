"Since you won't cooperate, Big Brother has no choice but to forcibly suppress you for the sake of the Qin family's future." Qin Ying's eyes were cold and detached.

"Qin Ying, you madman!"

Qin Junhua roared in fury, continuously unleashing terrifying divine abilities that made the heavens tremble. She pushed the power of a half-step Supreme Divine Spirit to its absolute limit.

Her divine abilities collided with the dragon claw, each impact causing heaven and earth to shatter. Yet despite this, she couldn't budge the claw in the slightest.

"Junhua, stop resisting," Qin Ying said softly, attempting to break her will. "The powerhouses in the Qin family headquarters have all been sent away on Big Brother's orders, and the space has been sealed off. They won't be coming back to rescue you."

"Give up!"

"Stay in the Qin family with Big Brother. With our combined strength and the power you control, we could dominate all of China and make the Qin family's rise a reality."

Boom, boom, boom...

Under the intense collision, Qin Junhua's face had grown visibly pale, and blood was seeping from the corner of her lips.

Qin Ying was also a half-step Supreme Divine Spirit, and he had planned and set up everything in advance.

Combined with the Dragon-Patterned Battle Standard and three Divine Spirits, this kind of force was simply more than she could withstand.

In the end, she had been too careless. She had overestimated herself and underestimated how utterly deranged Qin Ying had become, foolishly thinking her strength and influence within the Qin family would protect her. She had stayed behind hoping to persuade Qin Ying to abandon his plans.

That moment of soft-heartedness had doomed her.

And it might doom Su Heng and Su Yun as well.

After all, she was the Su family's matriarch, and with Su Heng away for years, she had been the one managing all internal affairs and the family's global enterprises.

If Qin Ying held her captive, the Duanmu family and Mount Olympus could use her name to inflict devastating damage on the Su family.

"Qin Ying, you bastard! From this day forward, I, Qin Junhua, sever all ties with you. We are no longer siblings!" She screamed, her eyes bloodshot, her dark hair whipping wildly.

She would never allow herself to become a tool that could harm Su Yun and Su Heng.

Even if it meant death!

"Whether you acknowledge me as your brother doesn't matter. You just need to remember that you carry the surname Qin and the blood of the Qin family in your veins."

"Suppress her!" Qin Ying's eyes remained utterly indifferent, completely ignoring her words.

Boom, boom, boom...

The Dragon-Patterned Battle Standard billowed in the wind, towering tens of thousands of feet into the sky. The supreme dragon soul fully awakened, spreading across the firmament for thousands of miles as the entire canopy of heaven shuddered. Endless dragon might pressed down toward Qin Junhua.

"Qin Ying, the Qin family will eventually be destroyed by your hand!" Despair filled Qin Junhua's eyes.

She was filled with regret and heartache.

Why had she been so careless? Why hadn't she brought more powerhouses from the Su family, or even borrowed a supreme divine weapon for protection?

Just then, a cold voice thundered across the heavens:

"Qin Ying, you dare lay a hand on my mother? You truly don't know what death looks like!"

"Who's there?!"

Qin Ying's pupils contracted sharply. Who could possibly have appeared at the Qin family headquarters at a time like this?

"Yun'er, is that you?" A flash of surprise broke through Qin Junhua's despairing eyes.

No one in this world knew Su Yun's voice better than his own mother.

Whooom, whooom, whooom...

The instant the voice faded, the sky suddenly turned dark. Violent winds howled as massive black clouds rolled across the heavens.

An ancient jade pendant shattered through the fabric of space itself and appeared above the Qin family headquarters.

Then Su Yun emerged from within, followed by Su Jian and two other Su family Divine Spirits.

The three Divine Spirits' eyes were cold and detached as they channeled their power into the God-Devil Pendant. Endless divine energy poured into the artifact.

In an instant, one terrifying ancient god-demon apparition after another materialized in the sky—countless figures standing tens of thousands of feet tall, their primordial aura sweeping across heaven and earth.

"Su Yun, Su Jian, Su..." Qin Ying's brow furrowed deeply. As Su Heng's brother-in-law, he was quite familiar with these important figures of the Su family headquarters.

He just couldn't understand how they had appeared in the Qin family headquarters without any warning whatsoever.

The Qin City and headquarters had been reinforced by generations of Divine Spirits channeling their power to lay down formation runes. It had long since become a terrifying battle fortress that even the strongest Divine Spirits would think twice before attacking.

But when his gaze shifted to the God-Devil Pendant, his pupils contracted violently. His entire body tensed as an intense wave of terror washed over him:

"That's..."

"An Ancient Divine Weapon!"

"How is this possible?!"

Qin Ying was nearly suffocating as he growled the words.

Feeling this endless, terrifying primordial aura, his whole body had gone rigid.

How could the Su family possibly have another Ancient Divine Weapon?

An Ancient Divine Weapon was something even the Qin family—a lineage stretching back to the Qin Dynasty—had never possessed.

The number of great clans and factions in all of China that possessed Ancient Divine Weapons, counting both those known and hidden, definitely didn't exceed ten.

And among the families that owned them were only a handful of Divine Spirit clans: the Su family, the Duanmu family, and what remained of the Xuanyuan family, plus a few reclusive sects. That was all.

He had calculated everything perfectly.

Ancient Divine Weapons were treasures that anchored a family's heritage. They would never be deployed lightly unless the family faced an existential crisis.

Even Su Heng, in his campaign against the Barbarian Tribes in the Americas, hadn't dared use the Su family's Chaos Bell.

That was precisely why he had been so brazen in moving against Qin Junhua.

Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined that Su Yun would have an Ancient Divine Weapon of his own—and that he would use it to tear through the void and breach the Qin family headquarters directly.

Roar, roar, roar...

The ancient god-demons filling the sky howled, their terrifying sound waves directly suppressing the Dragon-Patterned Battle Standard. The dragon soul within was forced down, and though it roared continuously, it couldn't break free.

"Mother, your son was a step too late. I've made you suffer." Su Yun spoke gently.

Qin Junhua's eyes held a bitter expression as she shook her head. "It's nothing. Your mother was too careless. I overestimated myself and underestimated how deranged Qin Ying has become. I was too soft-hearted, and that's what led to this situation."

"Yun'er, Qin Ying has colluded with the Duanmu family and Mount Olympus in the West. They're planning to move against the Su family. Leave this place immediately and get this message to your father. Tell him to withdraw the army back to the Human Race at once."

"Your mother suspects that Mount Olympus, the Duanmu family, and the Ancient Myriad Races are working together to destroy the Su family."

"Go now! Mother will hold Qin Ying off for you."

Su Yun's eyes narrowed slightly. "So they've even allied with the Duanmu family and Mount Olympus."

He knew of these two factions—they had always been at odds with the Su family.

The Duanmu family was one of China's Divine Spirit clans, standing alongside the Su, Xuanyuan, and Ouyang families as the four great Divine Spirit families. Each controlled an Ancient Divine Treasure.

And the founders of each family were among the original architects of the Azure Federation.

The Duanmu family controlled the northernmost reaches of China. They had always resented the Su and Xuanyuan families for occupying the central heartlands, and they had long been at odds with the domineering Su family. Ironically, they had better relations with the Xuanyuan family.

As for Mount Olympus, it wasn't a single Western faction but rather a collective term for all the Western deities.

It encompassed the forces of War Goddess Athena, God King Zeus, Lord of the Underworld Hades, and many other Divine Spirit powers.

Now it seemed that Athena wasn't merely opposing continued support for the Su family's American campaign in the Supreme Council—she had actually allied with the Duanmu family, the Qin family, and others to destroy the Su family in one fell swoop.
