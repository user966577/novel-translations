Chapter 152: I'll Go With You

"The Kunlun Daoist Sect has gone mad—they've deployed all their heritage. And they know my Celestial Maiden Sect inside and out. The sect's grand formation won't hold much longer."

Holy Maiden Mingyu's face was pale. Gone was the forceful manner she'd shown before the elders. Her eyes were rimmed with red as she gazed into the residence, appearing for all the world like a fragile little woman.

As her words fell, before long, the tall, dark figure she longed for day and night—the one with whom she'd severed her mortal attachments—slowly emerged from within the residence.

He was a tall, handsome man with fair skin, two yak-like horns growing from his head—a demon.

Were it not for those two black horns atop his head, he would pass for a perfectly fine-looking man among humans.

His pair of slightly reddened eyes in particular gave off an eerie, bewitching feeling, as if gazing into an endless abyss that could swallow one's very soul.

"Yu'er, thank you for everything you've done for me."

Mo Yu's voice carried a magnetic quality. He reached out and stroked Mingyu's glossy black hair. "Will you come with me?"

"I can't leave. I have to stay and buy you time. Otherwise, once the Sect Master Token and Qiankun Cauldron are lost, the sect's grand formation will stop working, and the Su family will definitely catch you."

Mingyu shook her head, gazing at the man with deep affection. "You don't understand how the Human Race treats your Demon Race. If they catch you, you'll die for certain."

"I'm the Celestial Maiden Sect's Holy Maiden. Even if they catch me, they won't do anything to me."

"If you won't go, then I won't go either."

Mo Yu smiled faintly. "You betrayed your sect for me, betrayed your master. How could I abandon you?"

"At worst, we'll die together."

"Let us together witness just how powerful this so-called Su family young master, Su Yun, truly is."

"Besides, don't forget, Yu'er—I'm a Divine Spirit. With my powerful demon bloodline and the Qiankun Cauldron in your hands, they may not be able to keep us here."

"Let us fight together for your sect until the end, then leave together. Come back with me to the Demon Race. I'll make you the most supreme woman on this planet."

Mo Yu spoke with deep affection, his eyes brimming with emotion.

Meeting Mingyu had made him realize he too possessed a gentle side. Mingyu was his everything.

"Mo Yu, I truly didn't misjudge you."

Mingyu spoke softly, a flash of satisfaction passing through the depths of her eyes—though she concealed it so well that even the Divine Spirit Mo Yu couldn't detect it.

What was the Celestial Maiden Sect's Holy Maiden? Compared to Mo Yu, it was nothing.

Mo Yu was a prince of the Demon Race, possessing the qualifications to inherit the Demon Emperor's throne.

This was precisely why she hadn't hesitated to betray her master, betray the Celestial Maiden Sect.

What were the demons? Currently one of Blue Star's top ten super Ancient Races—far more powerful than the entire Human Race combined.

Once Mo Yu inherited the Demon Emperor's throne, given his devotion to her, she would become the future Demon Empress, ruling over Blue Star.

When that day came, she could destroy ten Su families with a wave of her hand. The Federation Supreme Council members would have to bow before her.

"Master, your disciple Mingyu swears she will one day avenge you."

Mingyu silently vowed in her heart, then looked at Mo Yu with reddened eyes, tears brimming as she spoke with deep emotion: "But Mo Yu, your great vengeance remains unavenged. You're destined to inherit the Demon Emperor's throne and rule Blue Star. How can you sacrifice yourself here with me for the sake of our sect?"

"Leave quickly. I'll hold them off for you."

"Yu'er, without you, even if I become Demon Emperor, there won't be any joy left. I'd be nothing but a walking corpse."

"From the day you saved my life, I swore in my heart to protect you."

Mo Yu's gaze was utterly resolute as he looked toward the firmament, a flash of terrifying demonic intent passing through his eyes.

A mere million soldiers? The Demon Race had never feared battle.

But just then, Mingyu's trembling voice suddenly rang out:

"Mo Yu, I can't let you sacrifice yourself for me. You don't understand how powerful the Su family is. I'm willing to go with you."

She had drawn things out long enough. How could she possibly allow Mo Yu to put himself in danger?

If something happened to Mo Yu, all her efforts would be wasted.

"Really? Yu'er, you're willing to come back to the Demon Race with me?"

Mo Yu's eyes lit up with delighted surprise.

One should know Mingyu had refused him many times before. If not for Mingyu, he would have returned to the Demon Race long ago.

"Yes. I'm willing to go with you."

"Mo Yu, from today onward, you are my everything."

Mingyu spoke with reddened eyes, tears suddenly streaming down her face as she gazed toward the firmament and knelt. "Master, your disciple has failed your trust. Your disciple swears she will one day avenge you, avenge the Celestial Maiden Sect, and personally slay that beast Su Yun with her own hands."

Across the firmament, slaughter rolled. Terrifying divine might shook all the mountains of western China.

*Hum! Hum! Hum!*

The Kunlun Mirror unleashed endless killing radiance, piercing through spacetime to crash against the Celestial Maiden Sect's grand formation. The hundred-thousand-zhang Celestial Maiden Peak trembled again and again.

Every moment, countless lives were extinguished.

In mere moments, several Celestial Maiden Sect elders had already been slain, their blood staining the heavens.

*Hum! Hum! Hum!*

Terrifying auras continuously awakened. Beneath Celestial Maiden Peak, ancient women with weathered, decaying auras emerged one after another. Their presence was utterly terrifying as they strode into the firmament, engaging in bloody battle with the Divine Spirit powerhouses of the three great families.

More and more powerhouses fell.

Throughout the Celestial Maiden Sect, nearly ten thousand female disciples were terrified to the extreme, crying out in fear.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Before long, the terrifying toll of the Chaos Bell—spanning the vast distance from the Imperial Capital to northern China—crashed heavily against the sect's grand formation. A Celestial Maiden Peak mountaintop directly collapsed, and two ancient Celestial Maiden Sect Divine Spirits were killed instantly by the impact.

"Mingyu! Where have you run off to? Activate the sect's grand formation! Unleash the Qiankun Cauldron's battle power!"

One elder let out a blood-curdling roar. She had been struck by the Chaos Bell's resonance and was drenched in blood, nearly falling on the spot.

*Hum!*

But just then, a beam of residual radiance from the Kunlun Mirror pierced through the firmament and directly obliterated her head. Her divine soul was instantly annihilated, leaving only her powerful body to crash into the earth amid pools of blood, the impact splitting the ground into countless fissures.

And this scene was but one corner of the vast battlefield.

At this moment, Kunlun Daoist Sect powerhouses were continuously joining the fray. Augmented by the Kunlun Mirror, their vital energy surged and their combat power became boundlessly formidable, driving the Celestial Maiden Sect powerhouses into continuous roars of fury.

An Ancient Divine Weapon was essential for suppressing a sect's heritage—it could keep heritage powerhouses asleep longer and augment the ancient powerhouses, allowing them to display their peak combat power.

Without an Ancient Divine Weapon's augmentation, facing a side that had one was almost certain defeat.

Not to mention the Celestial Maiden Sect also faced the siege of three great families' million-strong army, with the Chaos Bell lending support from afar.

In mere moments, the Celestial Maiden Sect was already on the verge of collapse.

At this moment, countless powerhouses throughout the mountains watched this scene, chilled to the bone.

"A completely one-sided battle."

"At this rate, no matter how deep the Celestial Maiden Sect's heritage runs, they can't sustain such losses."

"The Su family hasn't even launched a direct assault yet. How did the Celestial Maiden Sect dare activate their grand formation and start this provocation?"

"One of the three great Daoist powers, a sect that has produced two Strongest Divine Spirits—so utterly unable to withstand a single blow."
