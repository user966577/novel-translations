Chapter 73: I Hate People Who Pull Rank By Seniority

Terrifying divine might and majesty churned within the hall. Even the sky above seemed to have stopped moving.

This was a Divine Spirit who had ignited the divine fire—a supreme powerhouse capable of plucking stars and seizing the moon with a wave of their hand.

Su Hong's aged face bore eyes that seemed to contain boundless stars within their murky depths. His body seemed to stand in another world entirely.

A powerhouse of this level, looking across all of Azure Star, stood among the most elite handful. With a wave of their hand, they could pluck stars and seize the moon. With a single thought, mountains and rivers would crumble.

Within the Su family, Su Hong was also among the most elite powerhouses.

If Su Heng weren't a supreme Divine Spirit, Su Hong could even stand as equals with the Patriarch, requiring no bow.

Moreover, Su Hong's seniority was extremely high. By generation, even Su Heng had to call him Grand-Uncle. This gave Su Hong an extraordinarily high status within the Su family headquarters—far higher than ordinary Divine Spirits who had ignited their divine fire.

"Let bygones be bygones?"

Su Yun's lips curled. "Grand-Uncle Su Hong, I truly don't understand what you mean."

"Conspiring with foreign enemies, plotting to depose the heir—in any family, this would be a heinous crime. Yet from your mouth, it sounds so light and casual."

"Oh!"

Su Yun suddenly drew out his voice in exaggerated surprise. "I understand now. Grand-Uncle, your sons and grandsons all married women from the Xuanyuan family. The Xuanyuan family sends you a large batch of resources every year."

"So for the Xuanyuan family's sake, you can't let me remain in this heir's position either?"

"Now that you see you can't suppress me, you want to pull rank by seniority and just let things go?"

"Su Yun, you..."

Su Hong's dignified face immediately stiffened, turning iron-gray. He hadn't expected Su Yun would show him—a grand-uncle who had ignited the divine fire—no respect at all. Qin Junhua was ruthless enough, but since entering the Su family's gates, she had never dared speak to him this way face-to-face.

"Su Yun, you wretch! Is that any way to speak to your grand-uncle?"

"Grand-Uncle Su Hong has the highest seniority in the Su family today. Everyone in Su family forces worldwide holds him in the utmost reverence!"

"Outrageous! A violation of all moral principles!"

"Kneel down immediately and apologize to Grand-Uncle! Otherwise, when word gets out, the whole world won't tolerate you!"

The direct-line members seized on this, hurling angry accusations, making it seem as if Su Yun's refusal to kneel and apologize to an elder would be an unforgivable offense worthy of divine retribution.

"Su Yun, even your father and mother wouldn't speak to me this way."

Su Hong's expression had become extremely ugly. "Considering your youth, I won't hold it against you. Have your mother come see me. I want to speak with her."

Normally, Su Hong would have turned and left already.

With his status, position, and strength, he figured Su Yun wouldn't dare do anything to him.

But unfortunately, as Su Yun had said, his sons and grandsons were deeply connected to the Xuanyuan family. He was afraid that once he left, Su Yun would have no more reservations and would begin a massacre.

That was something he absolutely didn't want to see.

"Heh heh. Hahahaha..."

Suddenly, Su Yun laughed loudly, then abruptly stood up. His terrifying aura exploded forth. Ninety-nine Chaos Dragons roared across the sky, rolling waves of chaotic energy billowing outward.

"All of you, shut up!"

His low voice carried tremendous authority. Combined with the ninety-nine Chaos Dragons in the sky, everyone present was stunned.

Ninety-nine Chaos Dragons—the extreme pinnacle of the Divine Profound realm.

Among all the most powerful Divine Spirits in Su family history, it seemed only the first-generation founder had possibly reached this level.

There were very few who could reach the extreme of the Blood Qi realm.

But the extreme of the Divine Profound realm existed only in legend. In all the Su family's history since the spiritual energy revival, not a single person had achieved it.

"Grand-Uncle? Since when has the Su family headquarters operated on seniority?"

Su Yun sneered coldly. In his hand suddenly appeared a token—the Patriarch Token.

"I originally planned to deal with you last, considering your age, leaving you some face."

"But there's one thing I hate most: people who try to pull rank by seniority in front of me."

"Thunder God Battalion, Lightning God Battalion—seal Su Hong's residence! Everyone inside is to be arrested! Especially Su Hong's sons, daughters-in-law, grandsons, and granddaughters-in-law. Not a single one is allowed to escape. If even one gets away, I'll hold you responsible!"

The Patriarch Token emanated terrifying divine light, causing all the direct-line bloodlines present to feel their blood surge chaotically, their faces turning pale.

They never imagined Su Heng would give Su Yun the Su family's most important treasure after the Chaos Bell. No wonder he could mobilize the Eighteen Battalions.

No wonder even after they had communicated with all the generals, the generals still obeyed Su Yun's orders.

The Patriarch Token was a supreme divine artifact forged by the Su family's founder. All Su family members who saw its bearer must render absolute obedience—this was ironclad law.

The Eighteen Battalions only obeyed the Patriarch Token and the Young Master Token.

While the Young Master Token could only partially command the Chaos Bell, the Patriarch Token could directly control the Chaos Bell and even summon the Su family's reserve powerhouses from beneath it.

The Patriarch Token represented the Su family's supreme authority.

"Thunder God General, Lightning God General—we obey!"

The two generals' gazes were cold and emotionless. They glanced at Su Hong, whose face had grown slightly pale, then immediately drove their divine ancient war chariots, leading two battalions and twenty thousand soldiers to directly blast open Su Hong's divine residence. The army surged in, capturing everyone inside.

The intense sounds of battle echoed across the sky, thoroughly shaking the entire Su family headquarters.

Even Su Hong's residence had been stormed by the Eighteen Battalions. Among those who dared to resist were two of Su Hong's old subordinates, both Saint-level powerhouses—directly killed by the Thunder God General and Lightning God General, reduced to bloody mist.

It was a scene of carnage.

It was an utterly shocking scene.

Su Yun had actually dared to move against a Divine Spirit's residence, and not just move against it—even Su Hong's sons and grandsons had been arrested and taken away by the Shadow Soul Guard for interrogation.

All of this happened in an extremely short time, so fast that no one could react.

Before the power of the Eighteen Battalions, even a Divine Spirit's residence was utterly defenseless.

"Su Yun, you... you..."

Su Hong's face was pale, iron-gray. Suddenly he roared, divine light exploding from his body. He raised his hand as if to slap Su Yun across the face.

"Outrageous! Rebellious child! I'll teach you what it means to respect your elders!"

This was a Divine Spirit's strike. The sky crumbled. The aura shook the heavens.

With a hum, a white shadow flashed past. Su Jian had moved to block this strike. His gaze was cold as he stared at Su Hong. "Su Hong, don't do something you'll regret for the rest of your life."
