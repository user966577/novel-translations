Chapter 104: Su Yihui, You're Full of Shit

"Xuanyuan Ze, if you dare go to war with the Su family, my Kunlun Daoist Sect will spare no effort to support them."

At that moment, a hoarse, deep voice echoed across the sky.

The next instant, the Kunlun Divine Spirit appeared in the heavens, his eyes bloodshot, his robes billowing, divine might rolling, killing intent sharp—as if a kind of madness was spreading.

"Kunlun Divine Spirit, your Kunlun Daoist Sect is a reclusive sect. Are you truly going to help the Su family go to war with my Xuanyuan family?"

Xuanyuan Ze's face was iron-green as he growled, "Are you not afraid the Federation will exterminate you?

"Don't you know that China has never allowed your reclusive sects to interfere in worldly affairs? Don't forget, my Xuanyuan family still has an alternate councilman."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's eyes were also bloodshot. He laughed coldly. "Xuanyuan Ze, don't think I don't know anything. You're no longer an alternate councilman, and the Xuanyuan family's alternate councilman Xuanyuan Chong may not obey your orders.

"I've said it—if you dare go to war, my Kunlun Daoist Sect will definitely help the Su family."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's words were equally domineering.

But his heart was filled with rage—rage directed at Su Yun.

He had been forced into this.

Yet with matters having developed to this point, with the Vice Sect Master and Dao Child already having stepped forward, if he didn't appear and things truly escalated into battle, the situation would become even worse.

So he could only help Su Yun suppress the Xuanyuan family. Ideally, there would be no actual fighting.

Even now, he still didn't understand why Su Yun had suddenly surrounded the Xuanyuan family's main compound. No matter how he looked at it, this situation held not the slightest benefit for the Su family—it would only result in unnecessary casualties.

If they truly fought the Xuanyuan family and won, the Azure Federation would definitely hold the Su family accountable. The Su family wouldn't come out well.

"Kunlun Divine Spirit, you..."

Xuanyuan Ze growled but couldn't finish his sentence.

After all, even now, so many powerhouses in the Xuanyuan family's main compound, yet only he, the patriarch, had come forward—that itself was proof.

The direct-line members inside were unwilling, or rather afraid, to go to war with the Su family.

At this moment, a trace of fear quietly arose in his heart.

"Su Yun, by surrounding my Xuanyuan family's main compound for no reason whatsoever, aren't you afraid of provoking the wrath of all the Divine Spirit families across China?"

Finally, a hint of retreat appeared in Xuanyuan Ze's tone.

He had backed down!

No longer confronting Su Yun head-on, he was instead invoking the other Divine Spirit families.

"He's backed down. Good."

Countless powerhouses breathed a slight sigh of relief.

"Hahahaha..."

Su Yun laughed loudly, his gaze cold. He suddenly said, "Xuanyuan Ze, you dare claim I have no reason?

"A large batch of traitors from my Su family's direct line is currently in the Xuanyuan family, together with your son, plotting to split my Su family apart. Did you really think I knew nothing?

"Any attempt to split my Su family is a provocation against the Su family. Even war would be worth it.

"I'll give you one minute. Hand them all over. Otherwise, I'll have no choice but to send my subordinates into the Xuanyuan family to search personally."

After Su Yun's words fell, the entire Imperial Capital fell into dead silence.

Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li had actually been plotting to split the Su family.

In other words, the Xuanyuan family had initiated provocation against the Su family first. That was why the Su family had created such a massive disturbance.

If that was truly the case, everything made sense.

Colluding with Su family traitors to split the Su family—for the flourishing Su family, this was a humiliation and an insult. Going to war with the Xuanyuan family would be entirely justified.

"No wonder Su Jian and Su Hong are fully supporting Su Yun."

"The Xuanyuan family was playing with fire!"

"They brought this upon themselves."

"If this is really the case, even if the Su family destroys the Xuanyuan family, the other Divine Spirit families won't have grounds to object."

"Don't forget, Su Heng is a councilman. The Federation probably won't punish the Su family much."

...

Countless powerhouses in the Imperial Capital discussed among themselves.

The situation had instantly reversed.

After all, the Su family was at its zenith while the Xuanyuan family was in constant decline. Anyone would know whose side to take, especially since the Xuanyuan family had initiated the provocation.

At this moment, the Kunlun Divine Spirit's brow furrowed slightly. So the Xuanyuan family had initiated the provocation against the Su family. He turned to look at Xuanyuan Ze and keenly noticed a flash of panic in his eyes before he quickly composed himself.

"Su Yun, I don't understand what you're talking about."

Xuanyuan Ze's expression was cold as he said, "You're trying to smear me and the Xuanyuan family heir. When did we ever collude with your Su family's traitors to split the Su family?

"Accusations without evidence.

"If you want war, go ahead. My Xuanyuan family will accompany you to the end."

At that moment, Su Yun's lips curved into a slight smile. He looked down at Xuanyuan Ze with disdain and sneered, "Is that so?

"In that case, don't say this Young Master didn't give you any face.

"Xuanyuan Chong, bring them all out."

"Crack, crack, crack..."

As his words fell, the Xuanyuan family's tightly sealed gates slowly opened. Xuanyuan Chong and a group of Xuanyuan family direct-line members stepped out of the gates, bowing to Su Yun: "Greetings to Young Master Su Yun."

Then Xuanyuan Chong looked coldly at Xuanyuan Ze and berated him: "Xuanyuan Ze, look at what you and your son have done! You're not fit to be the Xuanyuan family's patriarch. I suggest you resign voluntarily and hand over the Patriarch Token."

At this point, the other Xuanyuan family direct-line elders also wore ugly expressions as they spoke up:

"Xuanyuan Ze, what you've done this time is practically roasting the Xuanyuan family over a fire."

"Utterly foolish."

"No wonder my Xuanyuan family has been declining, our influence constantly shrinking. With a patriarch like you, how could things possibly improve?"

...

Various rebukes rang out continuously. In front of the entire Imperial Capital, they gave Xuanyuan Ze, the patriarch, no face whatsoever.

Xuanyuan Ze's expression was ugly beyond measure, but before he could speak—

"Bring out Xuanyuan Li and the Su family traitors. Hand them over to Young Master Su Yun for personal judgment." Xuanyuan Chong's cold voice continued.

The next moment, a large group of guards escorted Xuanyuan Li, the heir, out. Behind him followed a large group of Su family direct-line elders.

And at the very front stood Su Yihui—formerly one of the leading figures among the Su family's direct line, who had controlled all of the Su family's mineral assets and held tremendous prestige throughout China.

"Thud!"

At that moment, the instant Su Yihui saw Su Yun, he suddenly fell to his knees. His eyes were filled with terror as he said, "Young Master, it was Yihui who was momentarily foolish, who lost his mind. I shouldn't have conspired with Xuanyuan Li to split the Su family. I beg you to spare my life."

Witnessing this scene, the Imperial Capital fell into instant silence. Countless powerhouses could barely breathe.

Once again, they felt just how terrifying Su Yun's authority within the Su family had become.

After all, Su Yihui had once been such a super-influential figure that a single stomp of his foot would make the Imperial Capital tremble.

"Su Yihui, you're full of shit! When did I ever say I wanted to split the Su family? You were the one who said all of that!"

Xuanyuan Li's pupils contracted sharply as he roared in fury.
