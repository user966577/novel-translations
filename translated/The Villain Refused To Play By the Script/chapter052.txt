Chapter 52: I Had No Choice But to Resort to This

"Junhua, we've known each other for decades. This much I still trust about you."

Xuanyuan Ze's expression was noncommittal as he smiled indifferently.

Everyone in the Imperial Capital knew that Qin Junhua had once colluded with a Divine Spirit of the Pixiu Clan, leaking Su Yong's location. That was how Su Yong had fallen into the Pixiu Clan's ambush and died on the spot.

The Pixiu Clan was one of the Su family's greatest enemies, having warred with the Federation multiple times. Several Su family Divine Spirits had died at their hands.

If she could collude even with such an enemy to eliminate Su Yong, one could only imagine how ruthless and cunning Qin Junhua truly was.

Su Meng had always been a thorn in Qin Junhua's side. She was surely using this incident to completely uproot Su Meng and the remnants of Su Yong's former forces. Who knew how delighted she must be feeling?

"However, Junhua, let's set aside the matter of Su Meng for now."

"I've heard from Li'er that Yun'er has recently been getting quite close to my second daughter, Xuanyuan Jian."

"Though Xuanyuan Jian is my daughter and possesses extraordinary talent, this time she colluded with outsiders to assassinate my family's heir—an act of supreme treachery. I have already ordered her expulsion from the Xuanyuan family and issued a kill order. I hope, Junhua, that you can persuade Yun'er not to get too close to this traitorous daughter, lest it damage the relationship between our two families."

With that, Xuanyuan Ze turned to the youth beside him and said: "Li'er, tell Aunt Junhua everything you know."

"So Yun'er has been getting close to Xuanyuan Jian."

Qin Junhua pondered this, though her face betrayed no emotion. She smiled slightly and looked at Xuanyuan Li. "Li'er, Auntie watched you grow up. Speak freely."

The youth was tall and well-built, his features bearing seven parts resemblance to Xuanyuan Ze. His gaze was proud and arrogant. He strode before Qin Junhua and gave a slight bow. "Aunt Junhua, my people have reported that at the Azure Sky Auction, Brother Yun repeatedly showed favor to Xuanyuan Jian. After the auction ended, he spent quite some time alone with my sister in a premium private room. He must have developed considerable interest in her."

As he spoke, deep wariness flickered in Xuanyuan Li's eyes. After all, the Xuanyuan family and the Su family both resided in the Imperial Capital, yet the Xuanyuan family was steadily declining while the Su family's power blazed like the noonday sun. If Su Yun truly became involved with Xuanyuan Jian, it would pose a tremendous threat to his position.

This was simply a heaven-sent opportunity.

He had to use this chance to completely sever any connection between Su Yun and Xuanyuan Jian.

"Li'er and Brother Yun have known each other since childhood—we're closer than blood brothers. I don't want some traitor from the Xuanyuan family to create any rift between us, which could then affect relations between the Su family and the Xuanyuan family."

Xuanyuan Li's voice was filled with sincere emotion. After speaking, he gave Qin Junhua a deep bow.

But hearing this, cold light flickered covertly in Qin Junhua's eyes.

This Xuanyuan Li—everything he said contained subtle threats, using this incident and the relationship between the two families to pressure her into intervening with Su Yun, keeping him away from Xuanyuan Jian.

Nevertheless, this matter had indeed created significant ripples within the Su family.

The Xuanyuan family and the Su family had been intermarried for generations, their interests deeply intertwined.

Within the Su family, there were many powerful factions that had married into the Xuanyuan family over multiple generations, wielding enormous influence.

Moreover, Xuanyuan Jian's assassination attempt on Xuanyuan Li had sent shockwaves through the Xuanyuan family, filling them with righteous indignation. If Su Yun truly had any connection with Xuanyuan Jian, this would be a thorny situation indeed.

At that moment, a light laughing voice suddenly came from outside the hall:

"Uncle Ze, Brother Li, welcome! Forgive me for not greeting you sooner."

"Su Yun."

Cold light flashed in Xuanyuan Li's eyes as he immediately turned toward the hall's entrance.

He harbored great ambitions. From childhood, his goal had been to lead the Xuanyuan family to surpass the Su family.

As the Xuanyuan family's heir, his natural counterpart was the Su family's future heir—Su Yun. He had always paid close attention to Su Yun.

At this moment, an extraordinarily handsome young man with an elegant figure entered the hall. His bearing was noble, and a smile played at the corners of his lips—the kind that made people instinctively feel a strong sense of closeness to him.

"Yun'er." Qin Junhua smiled, her eyes filled with doting and profound satisfaction.

With her cultivation, she could naturally tell at a glance that Su Yun's strength had grown considerably once more.

"Brother Yun, it's been too long. Your elder brother has missed you dearly." Xuanyuan Li suppressed the cold light in his eyes, laughed heartily, and spread his arms to embrace Su Yun.

But suddenly, his body froze in place, his pupils contracting sharply as fury kindled in the depths of his eyes.

Following Su Yun into the hall was a young woman wearing a star-studded gown. The dress sparkled with countless points of starlight, making the already stunning beauty appear supremely noble—like a celestial maiden descended from the ninth heaven.

This woman was none other than Xuanyuan Jian.

"The Starlight Flowing Radiance Dress."

Xuanyuan Ze's formerly smiling face had turned extremely grim.

The Xuanyuan family and the Su family had been intermarried for generations and knew each other intimately. He was very familiar with the Starlight Flowing Radiance Dress.

It was created specifically for each generation's heir's principal wife.

Only one existed per generation. It required the Su family's current patriarch to personally journey into the cosmos and use supreme divine powers to extract the flowing stardust—a long and painstaking process to forge into an extraordinarily powerful Divine Spirit treasure.

According to Su family ancestral tradition, each generation's heir's principal wife would wear the Starlight Flowing Radiance Dress on her wedding day, displaying the future matriarch's supreme elegance and the Su family's profound heritage.

Now, Su Yun had openly brought Xuanyuan Jian into the hall and dressed her in the Starlight Flowing Radiance Dress. The meaning was already self-evident.

And just moments ago, he had told Qin Junhua that he had expelled Xuanyuan Jian from the family and would hunt her down with full force.

He refused to believe that Su Yun, as the Su family's Young Master, didn't know about Xuanyuan Jian's assassination attempt on Xuanyuan Li.

"Qin Junhua, are you grinding my Xuanyuan family's face into the dirt?" Xuanyuan Ze's expression had turned ugly beyond measure. His terrifying Divine Spirit aura nearly burst from his control, flooding outward and stirring storms throughout the small world.

Seeing this scene, Qin Junhua was momentarily stunned. Then her expression turned cold. In front of her son, she couldn't care less about the Xuanyuan family's attitude.

Moreover, she was silently speculating about what Su Yun intended to do, what deeper meaning lay behind his actions.

After all, ever since Su Yun had broken off his engagement with Liu Ting, continuing through his forceful suppression of Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie, she had noticed that her son's mind had become somewhat unfathomable—she could no longer fully read his intentions.

"Brother Yun, what is the meaning of this?" Xuanyuan Li's face was dark, his voice thick with murderous intent.

"Your son pays respects to Mother."

Su Yun first led Xuanyuan Jian before Qin Junhua and bowed, then smiled slightly and turned to Xuanyuan Ze and his son, speaking calmly: "Uncle Ze, Brother Li—the reason I had Jian'er wear the Starlight Flowing Radiance Dress is precisely because the Su family and the Xuanyuan family have been close for generations, our bond running deep. I had no choice but to resort to this."

Xuanyuan Li's expression was nearly contorted. You say you know our families have been close for generations?

"Jian'er, greet your father and brother." Xuanyuan Jian's face was expressionless as she curtsied slightly.
