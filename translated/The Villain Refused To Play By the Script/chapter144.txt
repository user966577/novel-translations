Chapter 144: Su Zhan

In the dark starry void, the figure of an aged, hunched old man appeared, smiling faintly at Su Yun.

"The current generation heir of the Su family, your grandson Su Yun, pays respects to Grandfather."

Su Yun bowed respectfully while carefully observing Su Zhan. After all, this was the only Strongest Divine Spirit in the current Su family besides Su Heng, and he was also the family patriarch—wielding tremendous influence within the Su family.

He was also currently the only person within the Su family who could threaten Su Yun's position.

It wasn't that he didn't trust him. After all, this was his first time meeting Su Zhan.

He didn't yet understand this so-called grandfather of his.

Su Zhan's gaze was aged and turbid, but occasionally a flash of cold electricity would pass through his eyes, carrying an undertone of domineering power that allowed one to glimpse his former glory when he shook the world.

"The Su family has endured for over a thousand years, always standing tall, because every generation has produced a formidable leader."

Su Yun thought to himself.

From the fact that the original Su Yun, that wasteful character, had allowed Su Meng to collude with outsiders and usurp the patriarch's position—causing the Su family to decline and be overtaken by the Xuanyuan family—one could imagine how difficult it was to maintain a family's prosperity for over a thousand years.

Even the greatest advantages, placed in the hands of a fool, would be squandered completely.

The reason he could act so domineeringly, apart from his own capabilities, was largely due to the tremendous heritage and prestige accumulated by Su Heng and generations of Su family patriarchs. That was the foundation that allowed him to be so unrestrained.

If Xuanyuan Li had dared to cause such havoc, the Xuanyuan family would have long been wiped out by the Su family and other patriarchs joining forces.

"Your grandson hasn't paid respects to Grandfather in nearly twenty years. Please forgive me, Grandfather." Su Yun said.

"No matter, no matter!"

Su Zhan waved his hand, smiling warmly. His body emanated an aura of decay and deterioration, as if his life was nearing its end.

"This was also part of my planning with your father. If word leaked that I was still in the Su family, it would have made many people wary."

"And your previous performance... you didn't have the qualifications to see me."

Su Zhan's eyes carried a hint of a smile, and he spoke quite bluntly.

His meaning was clear—Su Yun's previous performance had been far too wasteful. He was completely unworthy of being the Su family's heir. Su Zhan had been very disappointed.

"Thank you for Grandfather's praise. Your grandson will continue to work hard in the future to revitalize the Su family."

Su Yun smiled faintly.

The other meaning in Su Zhan's words was obviously that he was praising Su Yun's recent performance as excellent—worthy of Su Zhan personally appearing to help. Otherwise, he wouldn't have acted decisively when Ling Man and the four half-step Strongest Barbarian Divine Spirits had attacked him.

"This isn't praise. You've accomplished something that I and all previous patriarchs wanted to do but couldn't." Su Zhan laughed heartily.

"The Xuanyuan family has shared the Imperial Capital with our Su family for over a thousand years. On the surface, we intermarried and had deep relations, but in reality, we restrained each other to prevent either family from growing too dominant and monopolizing China's central Imperial Capital."

"If you hadn't taken control of the Xuanyuan family, if Xuanyuan Jian weren't your fiancée who is completely loyal to you, if you hadn't gained the Xuanyuan Sword and indirect control over China's center—do you think Ouyang Feng would really support you unconditionally as he claimed?"

"The Imperial Capital is the center of China, representing China's fortune."

"If the Su family and Xuanyuan family declined and fell under Western control, all of China's fortune would decline. Then the Ouyang family couldn't possibly remain prosperous while keeping to their corner. That's what Ouyang Feng fears most."

"Ouyang Feng is a clever man. Duanmu Lei is rather stupid to go colluding with Mount Olympus."

Su Zhan laughed coldly. When speaking of Mount Olympus, a flash of disdain passed through his eyes: "Nothing but a bunch of traitors who've sold out their own kind."

"Our Human Race stands alone against the invasion of the Myriad Races, and we haven't been defeated. Yet they actually want to bring in God Race bloodlines, to voluntarily become the God Race's vassals in exchange for protection. They've completely disgraced the Western ancestor Divine Spirits."

Su Yun's heart stirred slightly. He asked: "Grandfather, you mentioned earlier that the God Race's strange divine abilities brainwashed Athena, but it's not impossible to undo."

"How can it be undone?"

"Back in my day, Grandfather once fought against a Strongest Divine Spirit of the God Race, so I have some understanding of how strange their divine abilities are. Athena was probably subjected to the God Race's divine abilities from childhood, having various concepts about the God Race being supreme and inviolable implanted in her. So even though she's now achieved Strongest Divine Spirit, deep in her heart, she still worships the God Race."

"Usually she seems normal, but once God Race interests are touched, she becomes even more furious than the God Race itself. She doesn't even need orders from the God Race—she blindly follows them, actively protecting God Race interests. It's even more terrifying than taking a Heart Demon Pill or swearing a heart demon oath."

"But though the God Race's divine abilities are strange, all things in the world have their counterbalances. There are two methods to remove the God Race's control over Athena."

A flash of pride passed through Su Zhan's eyes. One should know that the Human Race's physical bodies were inherently weak—at the same level, they were never a match for the Ancient Races, let alone fighting to a draw with a Strongest Divine Spirit of a superior race like the God Race.

"Please instruct me, Grandfather. Athena is extremely important for my upcoming participation in the Federation Supreme Council." Su Yun said, inwardly astonished by the God Race's strange divine abilities.

These things weren't mentioned at all in the original novel.

All he knew was that the protagonist Ye Ling had personally defeated God Race powerhouses again and again, suppressing Athena step by step until he finally broke the nightmare in her heart—only then did she submit at his feet, or rather, between his legs.

A superior race indeed. Silently and invisibly, they could make Strongest Divine Spirits of other races unconsciously protect God Race interests—terrifying to the extreme.

If those Divine Spirits on Mount Olympus had all been brainwashed by the God Race in this way, they were essentially a nuclear bomb hidden within the Human Race. Once war broke out between the Human Race and the God Race, if these people suddenly detonated, the Human Race would be caught completely off guard—if not killed, then crippled.

"The first method is to release Athena and defeat God Race Divine Spirits in front of her again and again, forcibly breaking her worship of the God Race." Su Zhan described the first method.

"That won't work. It would take at least ten to twenty years." Su Yun shook his head. That method was exactly what Ye Ling had used in the original novel.

But Ye Ling, as the protagonist, had taken fifty years to grow to Strongest Divine Spirit.

Time waited for no one. The Federation Supreme Council meeting would be held in a month at most.

He could afford to wait, but Su Heng on the American continent couldn't.

Hearing Su Yun's words, a flash of surprise passed through Su Zhan's eyes. He was astonished by his grandson's ambition—his words implied that given ten to twenty years, he could personally defeat God Race Strongest Divine Spirits.

He was amazed by Su Yun's confidence.

One should know that when Su Zhan grew from Profound Palace Realm to Strongest Divine Spirit, it had taken forty years, and he had been the most outstanding prodigy of his era.

But cultivators needed precisely this kind of fearless, powerful confidence, so Su Zhan had no intention of dampening Su Yun's spirits.
