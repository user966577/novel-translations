Chapter 35: Breaking Through to Divine Profound, Power of Two Dragons

Su Yun was no stranger to divine spiritual essence—after all, his father Su Heng was a Divine Spirit. But this was an essence utterly different from Su Heng's.

More ancient, weathered, and grand. It seemed to have witnessed the passage of countless ages, tempered by the flow of time, making this essence purer and more majestic.

Of course, this didn't mean this Divine Spirit was stronger than Su Heng. After all, every Divine Spirit had their own Dao.

Su Heng was one of the six strongest Divine Spirits in all of China.

But after sensing this divine spiritual essence, Su Yun could clearly feel it surrounding him, constantly merging into his body through subtle influence.

"A perfect opportunity to break through to Profound Palace Realm."

Su Yun's eyes suddenly brightened. Without hesitation, he immediately closed his eyes and began circulating the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art.

Using divine spiritual essence to break through to Profound Palace Realm was unprecedented in human history.

Divine Spirits were supreme existences that had transcended the mundane.

In the mortal world, the most revered individuals were called Saints.

But Divine Beings no longer belonged to the mortal world.

When Su Yun had seven times the cultivation speed, he'd sat in this Heaven-class private room for so long without sensing this divine spiritual essence. Only after reaching eight times the cultivation speed could he finally perceive it.

One could imagine how difficult sensing divine spiritual essence truly was—something ordinary cultivators simply couldn't achieve.

"Ran'er, protect me while I cultivate. I'm about to break through to Divine Profound Realm."

"As you command, Young Master!" Yun Ran replied immediately, moving to stand guard before Su Yun.

Qiao Zhiqiang wisely kept his distance.

In cultivation, the Qi-Blood Realm focused primarily on tempering the physical body, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent Divine Profound Realm.

The Divine Profound Realm meant comprehending heaven and earth, drawing origin energy into one's body, controlling the primordial energy of heaven and earth, and gaining the ability to fly.

The stronger the physical body in the Qi-Blood Realm, the more origin energy it could channel—and thus, the greater one's strength.

Anticipation gleamed in Su Yun's eyes. He had broken through the limits of the Qi-Blood Realm, something unprecedented in human history. How powerful would he become upon reaching Divine Profound Realm?

"Hummm, hummm, hummm..."

A terrifying droning sound reverberated within Su Yun's body. This was the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art operating, his powerful and condensed qi-blood circulating throughout his body, producing a terrifying commotion that rumbled like divine thunder. The space around his body shook continuously, producing ripples of condensed spatial distortion.

This sight left Qiao Zhiqiang utterly dumbstruck. "Is this really power that someone in the Qi-Blood Realm should possess? It feels like an ancient pure-blooded divine dragon sitting there in meditation—no, even a dragon in its infancy wouldn't be this terrifying."

The room gradually fell silent, but the spatial turbulence grew even more intense. Terrifying ripples struck the walls, causing the entire private room to shake. Fortunately, this was a VIP room with powerful dao patterns reinforcing the walls. Otherwise, given the commotion Su Yun's cultivation was producing, the entire building would have collapsed.

After an unknown amount of time, chaotic radiance suddenly erupted from Su Yun's body. Heaven and earth's origin energy went into violent upheaval, producing sounds like mountains crumbling and seas surging. Rolling origin energy flooded into Su Yun's body like a tsunami. In an instant, all the origin energy in the private room was completely absorbed.

Without hesitation, Yun Ran waved her hand and produced two mountain-sized origin stone peaks, each nearly fifteen feet tall and incredibly wide, crystalline and jade-like. Each one probably weighed close to a million pounds.

In an instant, dense origin energy filled the room like thick fog—only to be immediately devoured by Su Yun's body.

Qiao Zhiqiang stood slack-jawed, mouth agape, too shocked to speak, staring blankly at the spectacle.

He was a peak Heaven Spirit Realm powerhouse himself, yet he had never witnessed such a terrifying scene of someone breaking through from the Qi-Blood Realm.

Suddenly, thunder rumbled from within Su Yun's body. Chaotic radiance blazed with dazzling brilliance, as if an ocean of chaos was hidden within him. Rolling qi-blood churned like a chaotic divine dragon, overturning clouds and seas, absorbing and devouring endless origin energy.

Breaking through to Divine Profound Realm actually produced such miraculous phenomena—it was simply unheard of. Qiao Zhiqiang was shocked beyond measure, finding this scene utterly inconceivable. "Such power just from beginning the breakthrough... Could it be that he'll immediately possess the power of one dragon?"

The Divine Profound Realm meant controlling heaven and earth's origin energy, condensing various mystical abilities, summoning wind and rain, and producing all manner of divine techniques.

To measure the strength of a Divine Profound cultivator, people on Earth generally used the condensed forms of ancient giant elephants and divine dragons.

Condensing one ancient giant elephant with origin energy marked entry into the Divine Profound Realm—and represented the weakest level.

Ninety-nine elephant forces could condense into one ancient divine dragon—the power of one dragon—representing great achievement in the Divine Profound Realm and qualification to break through to the next level.

But this was far from the limit of Divine Profound Realm.

Many exceptionally powerful prodigies could possess dozens to nearly a hundred elephant forces upon first reaching Divine Profound Realm. Legend even spoke of monstrous geniuses who reached the limits of Qi-Blood Realm and possessed the power of one dragon immediately upon breakthrough.

"ROAR!"

Suddenly, origin energy erupted. Rolling chaotic power surged from Su Yun's body, slowly condensing in the void above.

The next moment, a terrifying chaotic divine dragon appeared—its gaze cold and emotionless, every dragon scale seemingly solid and lifelike. It raised its head and released a dragon's roar, shaking the very space around it.

"One dragon's power." Qiao Zhiqiang's voice trembled. He never imagined he would witness such a legendary scene.

Possessing the power of one dragon immediately upon breakthrough—for someone of his status as president of the Azure Blue Auction House, this was nothing more than a legend.

This meant Su Yun had reached the absolute pinnacle of the Qi-Blood Realm.

Though Yun Ran's eyes showed some surprise, she remained calm. After all, she had witnessed Su Yun suppressing Su Meng. That kind of power could only come from someone at the limits of the Qi-Blood Realm.

It was only to be expected that the Young Master would possess one dragon's power upon breaking through from the Qi-Blood Realm.

"ROAR!"

But at that moment, terrifying chaotic profound energy continued flowing from Su Yun's body, condensing into yet another chaotic giant dragon in the void.

"ROAR, ROAR..."

Two dragons stood side by side—cold and powerful, their draconic bodies radiating an overwhelming sense of power, far stronger than ordinary giant dragons by an immeasurable degree.

The roar of their dragon cries caused the entire room to shake violently, triggering countless formation patterns on the walls to manifest and release divine light.

"Two dragons' power." Qiao Zhiqiang suddenly raised his hand and gave himself a fierce slap. The stinging pain told him he wasn't dreaming.

"Possessing two dragons' power immediately upon breakthrough—even legends wouldn't dare spread such a tale." Qiao Zhiqiang's mouth went dry.

"Young Master." Even Yun Ran could no longer maintain her composure. The violent flickering of her eyes betrayed the shock within her heart.

"ROAR, ROAR, ROAR..."

But this wasn't the end. Suddenly, three more dragon roars echoed in succession as three chaotic divine dragons condensed simultaneously, as if divine dragons were emerging from the abyss to soar through the heavens.

At this moment, Qiao Zhiqiang had gone completely rigid, frozen like a statue, utterly speechless.
