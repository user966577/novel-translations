Chapter 99: World Tree Fruit

"Hahaha, then we shall graciously accept."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit and the various elders and peak masters laughed heartily, quite satisfied. They shot cold glances at the Celestial Maiden Sect members—particularly An Ruoyi—before turning to leave.

That glance was full of smug satisfaction.

The Kunlun Divine Spirit and his people congratulated themselves on the decisive choice they had made this time.

After all, if Su Yayue had taken the Kunlun Mirror and joined the Celestial Maiden Sect, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

Watching the Kunlun Divine Spirit and his people depart with such self-satisfaction, An Ruoyi's expression was quite unpleasant. Her subordinate elders and peak masters were equally grim.

In the contest of feminine wiles, they had actually lost to the Kunlun Daoist Sect's decisiveness.

In essence, this time the Kunlun Daoist Sect had won substance but lost face.

"Young Master Su Yun, this time you've buried a big trap for my Celestial Maiden Sect."

An Ruoyi forced a smile.

The bit of confidence in her heart had been shattered when Su Yun announced his choice of True Feather Divine Spirit.

This was the first time she had chosen someone to entrust her seven emotions and six desires to. She never expected Su Yun to reject her so decisively and coldly.

"Ruoyi Divine Spirit, my bed is still open to you at any time."

Su Yun smiled coldly and wickedly. "I have pressing matters to attend to, so I won't see you out. However, you're still welcome to attend my concubine-taking banquet."

With that, Su Yun turned and strode away, soon disappearing from An Ruoyi and the others' sight without a hint of reluctance.

"A heartless, domineering man."

An Ruoyi sighed, suddenly reaching up to touch her own red lips. That kiss from before still left her heart pounding.

She couldn't deny that this domineering young master had already left an indelible mark in her heart.

"Let's go."

An Ruoyi's expression returned to cold indifference.

As for attending Su Yun's concubine-taking banquet—was she supposed to stand there as a laughingstock?

With the Innate Dao Body and Kunlun Mirror returning to the Kunlun Daoist Sect, and with their new connection to the Su family, she would need to plan carefully.

...

That evening, fragrant rose petals covered the villa, filling it with spring colors.

The otherworldly Divine Maiden, under the instruction of Yun Ran, Xuanyuan Jian, and Liu Ting, descended into the mortal world. Her face flushed, she spent the night.

Three days later, early morning.

Su Yun sat cross-legged on the bed. True Feather Divine Spirit's powerful yin energy, befitting a Divine Spirit, surged through his body. The Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art and the God-Devil Scripture operated simultaneously, absorbing this powerful yin energy.

Terrifying sounds of blood and qi circulation rumbled like an ancient fierce beast roaring within Su Yun's body. The deafening noise alone caused the void to crack. The villa, despite its powerful formation runes, shook violently as if it might be torn apart at any moment.

The women watching were terrified, nearly suffocating.

They understood that Su Yun was preparing to break through to the Profound Palace Realm.

But the commotion from this Profound Palace breakthrough was like heaven and earth splitting—enough to frighten a crowd of cultivators to death.

Even breaking through to the Saint realm probably wouldn't be this dramatic.

Surging vital energy gathered, condensing into liquid, flooding the entire massive villa—a vast and boundless tide.

A hundred giant dragons floated within the villa, filling the sky, their roars shaking the heavens.

"Worthy of being the Divine Maiden of the Daoist sects, a half-step strongest Divine Spirit powerhouse. Even though she doesn't have Ran'er's special physique or cultivate a cauldron scripture, her body still contained tremendously powerful yin energy. This first time, it took me a full three days to completely absorb it."

Su Yun sat with eyes closed, speaking in his heart.

This time, the benefits were enormous. The powerful yin energy had neutralized the yang energy in his powerful Fuxi divine soul, cleansing his body and condensing his Divine Spirit bloodline. This was the perfect opportunity to break through to the Profound Palace Realm.

"The Profound Palace Realm is the true threshold of cultivation on Azure Blue Star." Su Yun said to himself.

"The Divine Profound Realm merely allows one to command heaven and earth vital energy."

"But that's all it is—just commanding it."

"The Profound Palace Realm, however, involves opening a Profound Palace within one's body, devouring the power of the heavens and storing it within the palace. With a wave of one's hand, one possesses the power to overturn mountains and seas."

"The gap between these two realms is like heaven and earth."

Thinking this, a cold glint flashed through Su Yun's eyes.

An eighteen-year-old at Profound Palace Realm, breaking through with the power of one hundred Chaos Dragons—he was eager to see what kind of surprise it would bring.

This was something even Ye Ling, the protagonist in the original novel, had never achieved.

Su Yun didn't dare be careless. Opening a Profound Palace was extremely dangerous. Even with his powerful body, he couldn't afford to be reckless.

At that moment, the system's voice suddenly sounded:

"Congratulations, host. For conquering a Daughter of Destiny and altering her fate, reward: 5,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, host. For altering the fate of two major sects, reward: 5,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, host. For receiving 10,000 charm points at once, bonus reward: one World Tree Fruit."

In an instant, Su Yun gasped. He never expected that taking True Feather Divine Spirit as a concubine would earn him a full 10,000 charm points.

The reward for altering the fate of two sects was actually equal to conquering a Divine Spirit-level Daughter of Destiny.

"Open system panel." Su Yun immediately said.

Even with Su Yun's composure, he couldn't help gasping repeatedly. His cultivation speed had jumped by five times! He immediately checked the World Tree Fruit's properties.

After reading the system's description of the World Tree Fruit, Su Yun was shocked.

This World Tree was actually the heaven-opening divine tree from Western mythology—one leaf, one world.

And the World Tree Fruit was what the World Tree bore. It could help cultivators open their Profound Palace.

In ancient times, the most powerful ancient gods and demons would use World Tree Fruit to help their juniors open their Profound Palaces, laying the most solid foundation.

"System, consume the World Tree Fruit."

Su Yun's expression turned grave. He spoke in his mind, and immediately felt an emerald-green fruit brimming with powerful vitality appear in the center of his chest.
