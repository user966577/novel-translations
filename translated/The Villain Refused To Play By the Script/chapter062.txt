Chapter 62: The Notification Will Come Down Soon

However, Su Yun didn't spare Xuanyuan Ze a glance. His expression was indifferent as he addressed the elder:

"Su Yun pays respects to Senior Xuanyuan Shen. My father asked me to convey his greetings to you and present a grand gift."

"Ran'er, bring it out."

Yet many of the Xuanyuan family's important figures wore ugly expressions. Su Yun was being so disrespectful to the Divine Son, standing in the sky without coming down to bow.

At that moment, Yun Ran emerged from the void and placed a purple-patterned box on the table. When she opened the lid, a head appeared before everyone's eyes—eyes frozen wide in a death glare, face deathly pale.

"Su Meng!"

Seeing this head, Xuanyuan Li let out a low cry, disbelief flashing in his eyes.

"Correct. This is the Su family traitor who tried to assassinate Brother Li—Su Meng."

Su Yun smiled slightly. "To prove to the Xuanyuan family that the Su family has no intention of harming your clan, this young master personally killed him."

"This is the first gift."

At these words, the pupils of many Xuanyuan family powerhouses contracted sharply.

After all, the Xuanyuan family had mobilized nearly all their intelligence resources yet hadn't received the slightest news of Su Meng's whereabouts. No information had leaked from within the Su family either.

They had never imagined that Su Yun had already found Su Meng and personally killed him.

This demonstrated that the Su family's intelligence capabilities far exceeded the Xuanyuan family's by an unknown margin.

At this moment, Xuanyuan Chong suddenly laughed coldly: "Just now, I wonder who was saying that the Su family was sheltering Su Meng, the one who tried to assassinate our Xuanyuan family's heir?"

Many of the important figures instinctively glanced at Xuanyuan Li.

Xuanyuan Li's expression was dark as water. His fists were clenched, but he said nothing.

He had completely failed to anticipate that Su Yun would choose to kill Su Meng at such a critical juncture.

As far as he knew, Su Meng and Xuanyuan Jian were close friends. To help Xuanyuan Jian, Su Meng had used all the forces his father had left behind to assassinate him, and those forces had been completely decimated.

He had assumed that even if Su Yun was extremely displeased with Su Meng, he would spare him because of the engagement with Xuanyuan Jian—perhaps even protect him.

After all, Su Meng had lost his subordinate forces and been expelled from the Su family. He no longer posed much threat to Su Yun's position as heir.

That was why he had publicly claimed that the Su family was sheltering both Xuanyuan Jian and Su Meng.

This grand gift from Su Yun was clearly slapping him in the face, demonstrating that the Su family had absolutely no intention of sheltering anyone who tried to assassinate him—even if that person was a Su family direct-line member.

The only reason they were sheltering Xuanyuan Jian was because she had become engaged to Su Yun and possessed the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul.

"The second gift."

At this moment, Su Yun smiled slightly. A letter of appointment appeared in his hand, which he had Yun Ran deliver to Xuanyuan Chong.

"Father sent me word. After deliberation, the Council has decided to promote Xuanyuan Chong to alternate member of the Supreme Council."

Su Yun's calm voice exploded like thunder from the ninth heaven in the ears of the Xuanyuan family's powerhouses.

An alternate member of the Supreme Council—what kind of concept was that?

After all, the human race's Supreme Council had only eighteen full members and one hundred and eight alternate members.

The eighteen member seats were all held by humanity's strongest Divine Spirits, each commanding powerful ancient forces.

Of China's seven strongest Divine Spirits, only three currently held Supreme Council member seats. The remaining four were merely alternate members.

Even China's strongest Divine Spirits could only serve as alternate members—one could imagine how fierce the competition was. Countless powerhouses throughout the world coveted these positions.

Even the current Xuanyuan family patriarch Xuanyuan Ze was merely an alternate member due to the loss of the Xuanyuan Sword and the family's continuous decline. And that was only because he could rely on the prestige the Xuanyuan family had accumulated over generations—otherwise, he probably wouldn't even have an alternate member seat.

"Alternate member!"

Xuanyuan Chong stared blankly at the appointment letter in his hands, frozen like a statue, unable to react for a long time.

After all, he hadn't even ignited his divine fire yet. He was infinitely far from being among the strongest supreme Divine Spirits. Barring unexpected circumstances, he could never have reached an alternate member position in his lifetime.

This position symbolized noble status and supreme power.

After all, on the entire Azure Star, with its billions of humans, only one hundred and eight people could hold this position.

This meant that within the Xuanyuan family, his status could now equal Xuanyuan Ze's. He could even potentially rival the patriarch.

Many Xuanyuan family powerhouses were also deeply excited.

Xuanyuan Chong becoming an alternate member meant the Xuanyuan family now had two alternate members. This gave them greater voice in the Supreme Council and the ability to fight for greater benefits for the family.

"Xuanyuan Chong offers his thanks to Young Master Su Yun."

Suddenly, Xuanyuan Chong's voice trembled as he bowed to Su Yun. "Please convey Xuanyuan Chong's gratitude to Councilman Su Heng. This kindness—Xuanyuan Chong will never forget it for the rest of his life."

At these words, the pupils of many Xuanyuan family powerhouses contracted slightly, though they weren't particularly surprised.

If it meant becoming an alternate member, forget a slight bow—they would be willing to kneel.

What shocked them even more was Su Heng's enormous power—to call it turning clouds with one hand and rain with the other was no exaggeration.

This was an alternate member seat on the Supreme Council, yet he could give it away just like that.

"Xuanyuan Chong, do you even know what you're saying?"

Xuanyuan Ze's face was ashen. He shouted angrily and rose abruptly to his feet: "Do you still consider yourself a member of the Xuanyuan family? How dare you address an outsider as 'Young Master'?"

He understood clearly—Su Yun and Su Heng were targeting him, weakening his influence within the Xuanyuan family and his supreme authority as patriarch. They were propping up Xuanyuan Chong to rival him, perhaps even supporting Xuanyuan Jian as heir to the family.

Xuanyuan Ze understood it all, yet he was helpless. This was an open stratagem, executed in broad daylight.

On the surface, having two alternate members even enhanced the Xuanyuan family's status—no matter how you looked at it, it was an enormous benefit.

Unless he could also wield influence in the Supreme Council like Su Heng, turning clouds with one hand and rain with the other.

But clearly, he didn't have that ability.

Still, Xuanyuan Chong, caught up in his excitement, simply ignored Xuanyuan Ze. He understood that his alternate member seat had come from Su Yun. To secure this position, he needed to curry favor with Su Yun.

As for whether this would affect the Xuanyuan family's internal dynamics—Xuanyuan Chong felt that wasn't his concern. He wasn't the patriarch. That was Xuanyuan Ze's problem to consider. Otherwise, what was the point of having a patriarch?

"Ah, Uncle Ze."

At this moment, Su Yun suddenly sighed. "I've finished delivering the good news. Now I must tell you some rather bad news."

"Father sent word—at this Supreme Council meeting, your alternate member seat has been given to the vice patriarch of the Qin family."

"The notification will come down soon."
