Chapter 58: The Chaos Bell, Imperial Capital in Upheaval

"An ancient Divine Spirit weapon! Su Yun, this is an ancient divine artifact—the Kunlun Mirror! Legend says it's a divine artifact that controls space and time, possessing supreme divine abilities to reverse the flow of time and traverse past and future."

Xuanyuan Jian cried out in alarm, her pupils contracting sharply. Possessing the ancient divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul, she had some understanding of ancient divine weapons and immediately recognized the Kunlun Mirror.

One of the supreme divine weapons of ancient legend.

Though she had long anticipated that Ye Ling possessed some extraordinary treasure, she had never imagined it would be this supreme divine weapon.

Seeing the Kunlun Mirror's divine radiance pierce through the void, about to carve open a spatial tunnel, Xuanyuan Jian—who had already fully embraced her identity as Su Yun's fiancée—didn't hesitate. She immediately stepped forward, golden light flashing in her eyes as her Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul manifested, connecting to some mysterious void.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

The projection of the ancient divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword appeared. Terrifying sword qi pierced through the infinite void, striking directly against the Kunlun Mirror, sending it into violent tremors.

"Clang, clang..." The two ancient divine weapons collided, their divine might boundless, shattering the void—a terrifying scene.

Ye Ling vomited blood profusely, his face pale to the extreme. He was already severely injured, and the Kunlun Mirror was far beyond what he could currently wield.

"Xuanyuan Jian, do you truly have no regard for our past connection? Must you be this heartless?" Ye Ling roared, his eyes full of blood vessels. He had never imagined that in just a few days apart, Xuanyuan Jian could have grown so tremendously.

"Rumble..."

At that moment, the five Divine Generals rode their war chariots across the heavens, joining forces to unleash five-elemental divine abilities, manifesting supreme divine might that struck the Kunlun Mirror down from above Ye Ling's head.

Terrifying Saint-level might pervaded the air. Without the Kunlun Mirror's protection, how could a mere Divine Profound Realm cultivator like Ye Ling possibly resist? The Saint-level pressure directly caused his body to crack open, blood rolling down and staining the earth red.

"The Kunlun Mirror—I'll take it."

At that moment, Su Yun shouted loudly, black hair wild. The Su family Young Master Token appeared in his hand, divine radiance brilliant, connecting to the infinite void. A spatial vortex leading to some unknown location slowly emerged.

"Dong, dong, dong..."

Bell waves rolled like physical waves, shaking the myriad realms of heaven and earth.

In an instant, terrifying primordial mist descended from within, incomparably heavy—a single wisp could collapse ten thousand miles of earth.

Rolling black clouds blotted out heaven and earth as a massive Chaos Bell appeared between heaven and earth. Upon it, the shadows of all creatures, the sun, moon, mountains, and rivers manifested—as if it encompassed the entire cosmos.

The terrifying divine might covered a radius of millions of miles.

In that moment, the entire wilderness fell silent. Countless supremely powerful beast kings trembled, not daring to move even slightly before the great bell.

This was supreme divine might.

"This is the Su family's clan-guarding divine artifact—the Chaos Bell!"

"A fully awakened ancient supreme divine weapon."

"The Su family has actually brought out this supreme divine weapon—this is the ultimate weapon that once annihilated supreme Divine Spirits."

"Could it be that divine spirits of the myriad races have invaded? Has Divine Spirit Su Heng summoned the Chaos Bell to obliterate them?"

In that moment, countless powerhouses throughout the Imperial Capital were dumbstruck, their entire bodies trembling.

This was a terrifying weapon that could flatten the Imperial Capital. It wasn't merely the Su family's clan-guarding treasure—it was one of the entire human race's supreme divine weapons, deterring the myriad races.

Within the Su family compound, a large group of direct-line powerhouses from the Su family's main branch had gathered. The sudden eruption of this power startled them. When they saw it was the Chaos Bell, they were stupefied:

"The Chaos Bell can only be summoned by the Patriarch Token and Young Master Token left by the founding ancestor."

"Insane! He's insane! Su Yun, that madman—he just completely offended the Xuanyuan family, and now he's summoned the Chaos Bell! What is he trying to do?"

"The Chaos Bell suppresses our Su family's reserves. It must not be used except in the face of extinction-level threats."

"Outrageous! He actually dared to use it without convening a family council!"

"This lunatic must not become our Su family's heir."

"If our Su family falls into his hands, decline is inevitable sooner or later. Where is Chaos Heavenly King? His daughter was killed by Su Yun—why hasn't he come forward?"

...

This group of Su family main-branch powerhouses was going mad. The Su family had been passed down for so many generations, yet never had there been such an unbridled, audacious heir who completely disregarded family rules.

Xuanyuan family patriarch Xuanyuan Ze had already sent an ultimatum: if they didn't hand over Xuanyuan Jian, the Xuanyuan family would spare no cost to fight the Su family to the bitter end.

Throughout the world, Xuanyuan family subordinate forces were mobilizing. Countless powerhouses were being summoned. Terrifying reserve powerhouses from the Xuanyuan family were emerging. Even the Federation's Supreme Council had been alerted.

Within the Su family's main branch, a large group of powerhouses was stunned senseless.

They had lived in comfort and luxury for so many years, always at the height of the Su family's power. When had they ever seen such a situation?

Wasn't everything fine the way it was?

If the two families went to war, they didn't know if the Su family could win, but they—the main-branch direct line—would likely not escape unscathed. Some of them would surely die.

They didn't want to die.

Moreover, over the years, as major figures in the Su family's main branch—whether their parents' generation, their own generation, or the younger generation—all had intermarried with the Xuanyuan family at some point. They had cooperated extensively, their interests deeply intertwined, their connections to the Xuanyuan side running deep.

If the two families went to war, who knew whether this madman Su Yun would use that as an excuse to move against them.

And most importantly, Su Yun, as the Su family heir and leader of the younger generation, showed them—these elders—not the slightest respect. He completely ignored them. He had made so many major decisions without ever once seeking their opinions.

"Immediately convene the family's highest council to discuss removing Su Yun from his position. We cannot allow him to continue acting so recklessly—otherwise, the Su family will sooner or later be destroyed by his hands." A white-haired direct-line elder roared.

"But neither the Patriarch nor the Young Master are here. Without their approval, this doesn't follow protocol."

"We can't worry about that now. The Patriarch is attending the Federation meeting and can't return. Besides, he certainly wouldn't allow Su Yun to act so recklessly—he won't hold it against us."

"The urgent priority is to mend relations with the Xuanyuan family and avoid battle."

"Summon all the Divine Generals from the fifteen battalions of the Su family's main branch except the Five Elemental Divine Battalions. Without their support, we cannot accomplish anything of importance."

"Also, have Chaos Heavenly King restrain Qin Junhua. We absolutely cannot let that vicious woman ruin our plans."

"This matter has enormous implications, but his daughter was tortured to death by Su Yun and Steward Fu was killed. He certainly won't refuse."

"So be it!"

At this moment, the entire Imperial Capital was in turmoil. News of the Xuanyuan family and Su family conflict had already shaken the entire Imperial Capital—even causing earthquakes throughout all of China.

The appearance of the Chaos Bell had only intensified these tremors.

Within the Xuanyuan family, because Xuanyuan Ze had used the Patriarch Token to deliver an ultimatum to the Su family, combined with the Xuanyuan Sword projection's appearance, powerful figures from ancient eras were continuously emerging from the family's reserves. Their terrifying presence shook the entire Imperial Capital.

Rumor had it that a biological son of the Xuanyuan family's founding Divine Spirit had emerged from the reserves to personally preside over a meeting concerning the entire family's survival.
