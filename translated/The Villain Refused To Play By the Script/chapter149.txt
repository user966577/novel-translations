Chapter 149: Think Twice

"I've made myself quite clear."

Su Yun spoke indifferently: "Hidden within the Celestial Maiden Sect is someone from the Demon Race. Colluding with the Demon Race is treason against the Human Race. Hand over the demon. The entire Celestial Maiden Sect will cease resistance and surrender the Qiankun Cauldron to me for safekeeping. Allow my army to garrison within. Only then can we continue discussing anything further."

"Su Yun, you're dreaming! My Celestial Maiden Sect represents Daoist orthodoxy, with a thousand years of heritage. How could we allow your secular army to garrison within?"

An Ruoyi's anger surged. She shouted: "This is absolutely impossible!"

"You're throwing dirty water on our heads. I've searched the entire Celestial Maiden Sect—there isn't a trace of demonic aura anywhere. You're framing us without cause!"

"Kill me if you will, fight me if you dare—if you're going to let the Celestial Maiden Sect surrender without resistance like this, I, An Ruoyi, would be a sinner in our sect's history."

"And don't forget, Su Yun—your four great Divine Spirit families may be powerful, but you made an agreement with our secluded sects a thousand years ago. As long as we don't interfere in worldly affairs, we maintain mutual non-aggression."

"You've rashly attacked my Celestial Maiden Sect. Aren't you afraid of provoking all the secluded sects and plunging China into chaos?"

An Ruoyi raged, her black hair dancing wildly. The anger that had been building inside her all this time was nearly impossible to suppress.

She had simply been sitting at home when disaster fell from the sky.

The man she favored, the one she'd chosen to sever her mortal attachments with, had suddenly summoned a million soldiers to slander her for harboring demons and now wanted to exterminate her entire sect.

She had become the biggest joke in her sect's history.

"No demons hidden? Searched the entire sect? Really?"

Su Yun's gaze was cold as he looked down at An Ruoyi. "Then did you ever search your own residence?"

"As for the agreement our ancestors made with the secluded sects—what does that have to do with me?"

"Now look around—is there a single secluded sect that dares speak up on behalf of your Celestial Maiden Sect?"

"Su Yun." An Ruoyi was truly furious. She shouted: "Are you saying I'm the one harboring a demon?"

"If you want to kill me, just kill me. Why humiliate me like this?"

"I'll leave first."

With those words, An Ruoyi spun around, her face flushed with shame and fury, about to stride out of the palace.

But at that moment, Su Yun's indifferent voice reached her ears:

"You wouldn't harbor a demon. But what about your disciple, Holy Maiden Mingyu?"

Instantly, An Ruoyi froze where she stood. Her mind suddenly connected Mingyu's abnormal behavior in the palace.

Impossible!

Absolutely impossible!

How could Mingyu possibly collude with the Demon Race, betraying the sect, putting her own master in such an impossible position?

At this moment, Su Yun slowly rose and walked to stand before An Ruoyi. Their faces were so close that An Ruoyi could feel Su Yun's bone-chilling breath.

"Ruoyi, I'll be honest with you. I didn't want to treat you this way, but I'm busy and don't have much time to waste on you."

"The Celestial Maiden Sect must submit to me. You and the Qiankun Cauldron must be under my control."

"The Celestial Maiden Sect is harboring a demon. I can move against you without any powerhouse daring to criticize me."

"If you dare take one step out of this palace today, that will be the moment the entire Celestial Maiden Sect is exterminated."

His bone-chilling voice, laden with intense killing intent, reached her ears and made An Ruoyi's entire body turn cold.

She knew in her heart that the Celestial Maiden Sect couldn't withstand Su Yun's million-strong army.

The gap in heritage was simply too vast.

Not to mention the Celestial Maiden Sect had fewer than ten thousand members altogether, while Su Yun commanded a million well-trained soldiers. Once war broke out and the sect's grand formation was breached, what awaited the sect would be a one-sided slaughter.

"So your target is me and the Qiankun Cauldron—and you want to control the Celestial Maiden Sect."

"No wonder you were willing to give the Innate Dao Body and the Kunlun Mirror to the Kunlun Daoist Sect for True Feather Divine Spirit's sake."

"Your target is the entire Daoist tradition. You want to move against all the secluded sects, don't you?"

An Ruoyi's voice had grown hoarse.

Su Yun's gaze was indifferent, ice-cold: "That's not something you should be speculating about. Now, call your disciple Mingyu out here."

"I'm short on time. You have three minutes to think it over."

With those words, Su Yun indifferently closed his eyes.

Since only the Qiankun Cauldron could undo the God Race's brainwashing of Athena, then the Celestial Maiden Sect and the Qiankun Cauldron had to be in his control. That was why he had mobilized a million soldiers to campaign against the Celestial Maiden Sect.

After all, since even Athena had been brainwashed by the God Race, there were probably more than a few gods on Mount Olympus who had been as well.

The Qiankun Cauldron was too important.

"Su Yun, you're too domineering and ruthless."

An Ruoyi bit her silver teeth, her black hair gently dancing. Looking at Su Yun so close before her, killing intent flickered faintly in her eyes.

If nothing went wrong, at this distance, one strike would be enough to kill Su Yun.

Kill Su Yun, and everything would turn around.

Though in her heart she also vaguely suspected that her disciple Mingyu might really have colluded with the Demon Race, right now Mingyu held the Sect Master Token.

If even she walked out, the Celestial Maiden Sect would have no pillar left to resist.

She could sacrifice herself and submit to Su Yun.

But handing over the Celestial Maiden Sect and the Qiankun Cauldron? She couldn't possibly do that.

"Demoness, considering our years of acquaintance, I advise you not to be rash."

Just then, a clear, cold voice rang out within the palace.

As she finished speaking, a woman wearing a veil, her bearing transcendent, dressed in a flowing white gown, emerged from the darkness behind Su Yun. Her cold eyes fixed on An Ruoyi.

This woman was none other than True Feather Divine Spirit, who had escorted Su Yayue back to the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

"True Feather, why are you here?"

An Ruoyi's pupils suddenly contracted sharply. She immediately noticed the transcendent Dao rhyme emanating from True Feather Divine Spirit.

"You've actually broken through to Strongest Divine Spirit."

"How is this possible? You had fallen into the mortal dust."

An Ruoyi's delicate body froze in place, her eyes filled with disbelief.

The Celestial Maiden Sect and the Kunlun Daoist Sect had been rivals for over a thousand years and knew each other inside out.

The Kunlun Daoist Sect emphasized transcending the mortal world.

True Feather Divine Spirit had become Su Yun's concubine, and after losing her virginity, her Dao heart should have suffered a severe blow. Logically speaking, breaking through to Strongest Divine Spirit should have become nearly impossible unless she abandoned her cultivation and started over.

Yet True Feather Divine Spirit had somehow defied logic and broken through to Strongest Divine Spirit before her.

"Thanks to the Young Master's blessings."

True Feather Divine Spirit spoke softly, a flash of tenderness passing through her eyes as she looked at Su Yun's cold expression.

She spoke the truth.

After merging with Su Yun, she had been amazed to discover that Su Yun's cultivation method was miraculously powerful. Not only had it not harmed her own method—it had actually brought her tremendous benefits.

When Su Yun broke through to Profound Palace Realm, the laws of heaven and earth had manifested in physical form, and she too had benefited greatly.

After returning to the sect, she had stayed by Su Yayue's side, cultivating with the aid of the sect-guarding divine weapon Kunlun Mirror's Dao rhyme. All these factors combined had allowed her to break through to Strongest Divine Spirit in one fell swoop, joining the ranks of the Human Race's most powerful.

And all of this was because of Su Yun.

Moreover, because the Kunlun Divine Spirit had led a group of sect powerhouses and close confidantes to the American continent, her breakthrough to Strongest Divine Spirit had greatly increased her prestige. With Su Yayue and her disciple Li Yi's support, she had essentially gained control of the Kunlun Daoist Sect.
