Chapter 153: I Like It

In this moment, all the sect powerhouses felt a powerful shock wash over them, making them shiver with cold, deeply experiencing just how vast the gap was between worldly sects and secular families that held power and controlled endless resources.

This was the first time in a thousand years that a Divine Spirit family had campaigned against an ancient sect.

All along, sects like the Kunlun Daoist Sect and the Celestial Maiden Sect had been considered equal in standing to the four great Divine Spirit families.

But only now did they truly understand the difference.

No wonder the Buddhist Sect, Confucian School, Daoist traditions, and other ancient powers—even though they had produced more than one Strongest Divine Spirit and possessed Ancient Divine Weapons—had never dared to cross boundaries and interfere in worldly affairs or spread their teachings among mortals.

Within the mountain ranges, on a mountain peak shrouded in golden light hundreds of miles away, inside the Buddhist Thundersound Temple, a great Buddha wreathed in infinite Buddha-light let out a soft sigh:

"The Celestial Maiden Sect is finished!"

"In this era of great upheaval, even worldly-transcendent sects cannot remain above the fray?"

...

In this moment, within the myriad mountains, countless supreme Divine Spirit powerhouses all wore heavy expressions.

The Kunlun Daoist Sect now obeyed the Su family.

The Celestial Maiden Sect was about to be exterminated.

Each incident struck alarm bells for them.

Who would be next?

The Buddhist Sect, the Confucian School, the Legalist School...?

"Yu'er, I, Mo Yu, swear that after I slay my elder brother and inherit the Demon Emperor's throne, I will definitely avenge you. I'll make that Su Yun kneel before you and leave him at your disposal."

Mo Yu's expression was ice-cold as he spoke: "Let's go. If we don't leave now, it'll be too late."

"Mm, Mo Yu, Yu'er believes you."

"Let's go—back to the Demon Race."

Mingyu wiped away her tears and shot a hate-filled glance at Su Yun. Because of this man, all her plans had been thrown into chaos.

She had originally intended to inherit the position of Sect Master, then use the Celestial Maiden Sect's power to secure an even higher status with Mo Yu. Now, all she had left were the Sect Master Token and the Qiankun Cauldron.

"Su Yun, just you wait. I will never let you off."

Just as Mingyu took Mo Yu's hand, preparing to leave with him, a seductive, gentle voice suddenly echoed across the firmament:

"Yu'er, where are you planning to go? Why didn't you tell your master first?"

*Hum!* A vast, noble, and supreme aura suddenly emanated from Su Yun's palace behind the million-strong army, spreading across the heavens.

The terrifying aura instantly permeated outward, freezing the firmament, causing even the charging million-strong army to momentarily pause.

"All Celestial Maiden Sect disciples, elders, and seniors—hear my command. Cease resistance and lay down your weapons." An Ruoyi's seductive voice carried a terrible majesty.

In this moment, the many Celestial Maiden Sect elders, peak masters, and Divine Spirits had their pupils contract deeply, a flash of intense joy passing through their eyes.

This aura—they knew it all too well.

This was the aura one possessed only upon breaking through to Strongest Divine Spirit in the Celestial Maiden Sect.

"The Sect Master has broken through to Strongest Divine Spirit! Our Celestial Maiden Sect is saved!" One peak master wept with joy, tears actually falling from her eyes.

"That Mingyu, that damned wretch, actually took the Sect Master Token and the Qiankun Cauldron and ran off to who knows where!"

"I must have been blind to have supported her becoming Holy Maiden back then!"

The elders and peak masters roared in fury one after another, having already reached the limits of their endurance. The moment they heard An Ruoyi's command, they immediately laid down their weapons and ceased resistance.

This meaningless, nearly hopeless resistance—they'd had enough of it.

The Sect Master Token had only ever been a medium of power.

Now that An Ruoyi had broken through to Strongest Divine Spirit, she was the Celestial Maiden Sect's anchor.

In this moment, the entire northern mountain ranges fell silent.

An Ruoyi had actually broken through to Strongest Divine Spirit, becoming the third Strongest Divine Spirit in the mountain ranges after the Buddha Ancestor and the Confucian Patriarch.

But just then, within the mountain ranges, in both the Buddhist Sect and the Confucian School, two terrifying gazes flashed.

"I command the army to cease combat, withdraw to original positions, and blockade the Celestial Maiden Sect." Su Yun's voice immediately followed.

As he finished speaking, Su Yun emerged from the palace with his arm around An Ruoyi's fragrant shoulder, True Feather Divine Spirit following behind, his cold gaze sweeping over the Celestial Maiden Sect.

At this moment, from within the Buddhist Sect and the Confucian School, low voices echoed: "The Daoist tradition has actually produced two Strongest Divine Spirits."

These two voices were from the Buddha Ancestor and Confucian Patriarch themselves.

They were also among China's six current Strongest Divine Spirits.

"Master actually broke through to Strongest Divine Spirit at this moment." Mingyu's pupils contracted sharply in an instant, a flash of fear in her eyes. She immediately said: "Mo Yu, it's too late—we have to go."

With that, Mingyu waved the Sect Master Token in her hand. The Qiankun Cauldron rumbled and trembled, shooting out divine light that pierced through endless void and opened a spatial passage. She was about to step into it with Mo Yu.

"Treacherous disciple."

At that moment, An Ruoyi spoke coldly, bringing Su Yun and True Feather Divine Spirit with her as she stepped through the Celestial Maiden Sect's grand formation in one stride, appearing deep within Celestial Maiden Peak.

The sect's grand formation had originally been created by the Celestial Maiden Sect's Strongest Divine Spirit.

After her breakthrough, she could see through the grand formation at a glance—naturally, it couldn't stop her.

*Hum!*

Watching Mingyu and Mo Yu step into the spatial passage, a cold glint flashed through An Ruoyi's eyes. With a wave of her hand, the Sect Master Token in Mingyu's hand immediately began to tremble, erupting with divine light.

*Pfft, pfft, pfft...*

In an instant, the divine light pierced through Mingyu's palm, blood mist spreading everywhere.

The divine light also hooked onto the Qiankun Cauldron, causing it to rumble and shake. A force capable of transforming heaven and earth emanated forth, directly collapsing the spatial passage.

As the spatial tunnel shattered, terrible spatial turbulence sliced countless bloody marks across Mingyu and Mo Yu's bodies like sharp arrows. Both were simultaneously blasted out of the passage by the Qiankun Cauldron's might, crashing heavily to the ground.

"Demonic Eagle Kill."

Just then, an ice-cold, bloodthirsty voice echoed from within the dust cloud. Terrifying demonic mist spread outward as Mo Yu's horns grew atop his head and eagle wings sprouted from his back. He instantly transformed into a killing beam, charging toward Su Yun.

This was an extremely cold-blooded man. Facing two Strongest Divine Spirits, his first thought was to kill Su Yun first.

"Qiankun Cauldron."

"Boundless Qiankun!"

Mingyu gave a low shout, both hands gripping the Sect Master Token tightly, her eyes filled with blood vessels as she wrestled with An Ruoyi for control of the token while forcibly driving the Qiankun Cauldron to unleash a supreme divine technique.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

In an instant, the Qiankun Cauldron shook, space distorted, wind and clouds shifted. Terrifying killing beams directly pierced through Mo Yu's body as he hung in mid-air, and sprays of black blood burst outward.

"Master, you..." Mingyu screamed, watching Mo Yu get severely wounded by the Qiankun Cauldron. She immediately understood this was her master An Ruoyi's doing.

Mo Yu was her last hope.

She had placed all her bets on Mo Yu.

"A mere Divine Spirit-level demon dares act fierce among my Human Race."

True Feather Divine Spirit spoke coldly, waving her hand as rolling dark clouds gathered.

"Heaven Thunder Kill!"

*Boom, boom, boom...*

Endless purple divine thunder engulfed Mo Yu, shattering the black scales on his body inch by inch.

Miserable, wild howls of anguish echoed from within the sea of thunder.

Though he was also a Divine Spirit with supreme talent and unmatched combat power, before two Strongest Divine Spirits and an Ancient Divine Weapon, he wasn't nearly enough—he had no room for resistance at all.

"Su Yun, if you dare harm a single hair on Yu'er's head, I, Mo Yu, swear I will tear you to pieces." Mo Yu kept roaring, even with his own life in danger, still threatening Su Yun.

"Very touching. I like it."

Su Yun smiled indifferently, then suddenly descended from the firmament, walking step by step toward Holy Maiden Mingyu while speaking: "For the sake of a Demon Race prince, you didn't hesitate to betray your sect, putting your master in danger without a care—this kind of personality, I like it."
