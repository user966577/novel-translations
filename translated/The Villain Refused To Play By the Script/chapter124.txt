Chapter 124: Qin Province

The next day, the entire Imperial Capital was in an uproar.

The Xuanyuan family patriarch, Xuanyuan Ze, had resigned in disgrace, voluntarily stepping down from the patriarch position. Xuanyuan Jian and Xuanyuan Chong would jointly hold the Patriarch Token.

Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li would henceforth live in seclusion within the Xuanyuan family's pocket dimension.

When this news broke, the entire Imperial Capital was shaken to its core—like a massive earthquake. Countless major family powerhouses and Saints stood dumbfounded, frozen in place, unable to recover for a long time.

Even though there had been signs.

Everything had happened too fast—so fast that it caught everyone completely off guard.

"Xuanyuan Ze voluntarily stepped down from the patriarch position? How is that possible?"

"The Imperial Capital has changed."

"The Su family has completely taken control of China's center."

"And in such a short time."

"Xuanyuan Jian is Su Yun's fiancée. Xuanyuan Chong is an alternate councilman that Su Heng personally elevated. How is this any different from the Su family directly controlling the Xuanyuan family?"

"From now on, the Imperial Capital will have only one voice—Su Yun's voice."

...

Upon learning this news, the patriarchs and heirs of the Imperial Capital's many major families stood in silent contemplation.

When the Xuanyuan family had still been standing, they could dance between the two Divine Spirit families and choose neutrality.

But now, what were they supposed to do?

Soon, two pieces of news emerged from the Su family.

"The Su family is campaigning against the Barbarians. The Su family and Xuanyuan family jointly call upon all major families of the Imperial Capital: those with money, contribute money; those with strength, contribute strength."

"Young Master Su Yun of the Su family will travel to Qin Province to visit his mother's family, the Qin family's main branch."

Xuanyuan Chong even stepped forward to represent the Xuanyuan family, saying: "The Xuanyuan family is taking the lead—deploying 200,000 troops and resources... to assist Councilman Su Heng's campaign on the American continent.

"This is the glory of the human race, the glory of all China.

"We hope all families in the Imperial Capital will enthusiastically contribute."

When this news broke, all the major families of the Imperial Capital fell into silence.

Now, everything was crystal clear.

The Xuanyuan family was already under Su Yun's control.

The Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard of the main branch only had 100,000 troops, yet they were committing 200,000. For the Xuanyuan family, this was a decision that would cut to the bone.

If they hadn't received Su Yun's signal, if they hadn't been forced into a corner, how could the Xuanyuan family possibly pay such an enormous price for the Su family's territorial expansion?

"My Meng family is willing to dispatch two Saints, five hundred Heaven Spirit Realm cultivators, and three thousand Profound Palace cultivators, led personally by heir Meng Wudao, to assist the Su family in the campaign against the Barbarians." The first to speak was the ancient Imperial Capital family, the Meng family.

"My Ling family will commit our entire force. We will not return until the Barbarians are conquered." Ling Yan spoke on behalf of the Ling family, making their stance clear.

The other Su family vassal families also made their positions known one after another.

At this point, all the major families of the Imperial Capital could only smile bitterly.

Clearly, Su Yun was pressuring them.

The scene of the Eighteen Battalions sealing off the Imperial Capital last time was still vivid in their memories.

At this point, they had no choice but to cut off their own flesh.

That afternoon, the patriarchs of the many Imperial Capital major families all went to the Su family to pay their respects, forming a long line at the gate.

No one wanted to become the example Su Yun made to warn the others.

And that same evening, within the Su family's main compound, Su Yun led an army and quietly departed.

...

After the resurgence of spiritual energy, the Eurasian continent had fallen into chaos. Countless ancient great races had descended, shattering the continent into fragments. Masses of small nations had no power to resist and were exterminated by the ancient races.

After over a thousand years of development, China's territory had expanded over a hundredfold compared to before the spiritual resurgence.

Qin Province was one of China's provinces, with a population of nearly twenty million. Looking across all of China, it ranked in the top twenty largest provinces.

And the Qin family was rooted in Qin Province, having flourished there for over a thousand years.

The Qin family was an ancient martial family dating back to the pre-Qin era. After the resurgence of spiritual energy, they had also produced a strongest Divine Spirit and held tremendous influence throughout China.

That Qin Province was named "Qin" showed just how enormous the Qin family's influence there was.

One could say that without the Qin family's consent, even the Azure Federation's orders couldn't penetrate Qin Province in the slightest. The Qin family had managed it for generations like an impenetrable fortress.

And in this generation, because the patriarch Qin Ying had obtained an alternate councilman seat, the family's prestige had reached an unprecedented peak.

At the center of Qin Province.

An enormous city stood—over three thousand feet tall, forged from steel, its surface carved with countless dense formation patterns. From a distance, it looked like an ancient primordial beast crouching upon the earth, devouring the vital energy of heaven and earth.

This was the Qin family's main branch, Qin City—the center of power for all of Qin Province, with countless powerhouses.

Within the main hall of the Qin family headquarters, a low, furious voice suddenly rang out, causing the entire sky to tremble:

"Junhua, how long are you going to persist in this delusion?"

Inside the great hall, a middle-aged man with a dark expression sat in the seat of honor. Terrifying divine might radiated from him, causing the space within the entire hall to continuously shake.

"When you married into the Su family back then, it was merely an expedient measure.

"Now that I've obtained the alternate councilman seat and the Qin family has the support of even more powerful forces behind us, why must you continue opposing me for the sake of the Su family?

"This time, you don't need to return to the Su family. Stay in Qin Province. You're still the Qin family's eldest princess, second only to me. How about that?"
