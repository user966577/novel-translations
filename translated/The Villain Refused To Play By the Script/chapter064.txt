Chapter 64: Detain My Son? You Think You're Worthy?

"This is the benefit of having a Divine Spirit father."

Su Yun's lips curved. Otherwise, if he wanted to deal with Xuanyuan Li, he would certainly have had to go through more trouble.

Su Jian's gaze was calm as he looked down at Xuanyuan Ze. He spoke evenly: "The matter of attempting to attack our Su family's Young Master—Su Jian will certainly report it truthfully to the Su family and inform the Patriarch."

"As for wanting to detain the Young Master—are you prepared to die?"

Su Jian's calm voice carried incomparable dominance. Like a sharp sword, it swept across the heavens, causing the expressions of many Xuanyuan family powerhouses to turn pale.

Su Jian was known as the strongest person beneath the Divine Spirits, with unparalleled combat power—one of Su Heng's mightiest subordinates.

Now that he had ignited his divine fire, one could hardly imagine how terrifying his combat power was. Even Xuanyuan Ze, who had ignited his divine fire years ago, probably wasn't his match.

As he said—wanting to suppress him? Without the clan-guarding divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword, without any supreme Divine Spirits, was the Xuanyuan family prepared to see many of its people die?

"Su Jian, how dare you be so arrogant!"

Xuanyuan Ze's face was ashen, but he dared not attack again. He understood that while he might be able to keep Su Jian here, there was no way he could stop Su Jian from protecting Su Yun's escape with his life.

The declining Xuanyuan family couldn't bear the consequences of a desperate fight with the Su family. The many powerhouses present wouldn't support him either.

"Cough, cough, cough..."

At this moment, the golden-robed elder who had remained silent—Xuanyuan Shen—suddenly coughed. His voice contained powerful divine energy and authority, instantly suppressing all the noise in the hall.

"Might this old man say a few words?"

Xuanyuan Shen rose to his feet, trembling, and under the gazes of all the Xuanyuan family powerhouses, actually walked step by step to stand before Su Yun.

"Senior Xuanyuan Shen, I'd advise you to return to the Divine Source and rest well. Consuming your lifespan like this, you probably won't live much longer."

Su Yun greeted him, but his gaze held no emotion whatsoever—cold and indifferent. He didn't retreat even a single step, simply meeting Xuanyuan Shen's gaze directly.

Actually, Su Yun had some impression of this so-called Divine Son, Xuanyuan Shen.

In the original story, the Xuanyuan family had once faced an existential crisis. At the critical moment, this so-called Divine Son Xuanyuan Shen had stepped in, but he had been slain by the enemy. His role in the story was extremely minor.

His strength wasn't as impressive as his identity as the Xuanyuan family founder's Divine Son might suggest.

The Xuanyuan family's rise had mainly occurred after Xuanyuan Li inherited the patriarch position.

So regarding this so-called Divine Son Xuanyuan Shen, Su Yun felt no reverence whatsoever. Even when told that Xuanyuan Shen had summoned him to come, he had arrived without the slightest fear.

If Xuanyuan Shen truly had ability and strength, why would he have watched Su Yun arrive and turn the Xuanyuan family's meeting into such a state—the factions nearly at each other's throats?

"Su Yun, you're too bold! How dare you speak to our Xuanyuan family's founding ancestor this way!" Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li erupted in fury simultaneously.

Many Xuanyuan family powerhouses also contracted their pupils slightly, shifting their gazes to the founding ancestor Xuanyuan Shen.

But the anticipated scene of the ancestor displaying divine might and turning the tide didn't materialize. Faced with Su Yun's words, Xuanyuan Shen actually seemed to freeze for a moment, as if he hadn't expected Su Yun to dare speak to him—a Divine Son—this way, without the slightest reverence.

For a moment, Xuanyuan Shen fell into silence again.

Su Yun was right—without the ancient divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword to suppress him, emerging from the Divine Source meant his life force was continuously draining away at a frantic rate. He truly wouldn't live much longer.

This time he had emerged, his true goal was to use the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul to summon back the ancient divine weapon his father had left behind, using it to sustain himself.

But the Xuanyuan family's decline, combined with Su Yun's dominance, had left him at a loss for what to do.

Su Yun turned, looking at them with indifferent eyes. He spoke calmly: "I suddenly feel the Xuanyuan family's patriarch and heir really should be replaced."

At these words, Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li's expressions immediately darkened.

Another family's heir, making wild proclamations at the Xuanyuan family headquarters' supreme council—this was the greatest provocation to the Xuanyuan family.

In an instant, many Xuanyuan family powerhouses who stood on their side were also furious beyond endurance.

"Impudent!"

"How dare you be so arrogant in our Xuanyuan family!"

"This is the Xuanyuan family, not your Su family's small world. It's not your place to criticize our patriarch and heir!"

"Get out! Get out immediately! Otherwise, even if you're the Su family's heir, we'll definitely keep you here today!"

...

Everyone who could stand in the Xuanyuan family headquarters' supreme council was at least Saint-level—terrifyingly powerful.

In an instant, no fewer than ten Saint-level powerhouses erupted in fury, releasing their auras and causing the heavens to tremble.

Each one of them was a figure who could make the entire Imperial Capital shake with a single stomp. Their combined eruption was unimaginably terrifying.

"Is that so?" Su Yun laughed coldly.

"What do you lot even count as?"

Su Jian and Su Lie's gazes darkened as they immediately stepped in front of Su Yun, releasing their auras to sweep across the heavens.

At this moment, Xuanyuan Ze held a Divine Spirit weapon in his hand, his expression dark as he stood at the fore. He spoke coldly: "Su Yun, this is a provocation against my Xuanyuan family. If we don't keep you here, how will my Xuanyuan family have the face to stand in China?"

Having spoken, he looked toward Xuanyuan Shen. His eyes showed some disappointment in this founding ancestor, but he still said: "Ancestor, matters have reached this point. Our Xuanyuan family has no path of retreat. Please make your stance clear."

At this moment, Xuanyuan Chong's gaze turned cold. He stepped forward forcefully and shouted: "Have any of you considered that attacking the Su family's Young Master will push our Xuanyuan family into the abyss?"

"For the survival of the Xuanyuan family, whoever dares lay a hand on Young Master Su Yun today—don't blame me for disregarding past relations!"

Having spoken, Xuanyuan Chong looked toward Xuanyuan Shen and roared: "Divine Son, you are the founding ancestor's son. Are you truly going to watch these people drag the Xuanyuan family into the abyss?"

Facing these two leading figures of the current Xuanyuan family, Xuanyuan Shen froze. Struggle flickered in his clouded eyes. He had no idea how to choose.

Though he was a Divine Spirit-level powerhouse, he wasn't familiar with these internal struggles. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been sealed into the Divine Source to become part of the Xuanyuan family's reserves.

Could he possibly say that his main purpose in emerging this time was just to summon back the divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword to sustain himself and live a bit longer?

In this moment, the Xuanyuan family headquarters had completely split into two factions—swords drawn, killing intent soaring.

Then, suddenly, a terrifying voice exploded through the void:

"Who dares lay a hand on my son?"

"Boom!"

In an instant, the faces of all the powerhouses present—including Xuanyuan Ze—turned deathly pale. They felt only a terrifying supreme pressure pervading the heavens.

This was true supreme divine might.

"A supreme Divine Spirit comparable to Father." Shock flashed through Xuanyuan Shen's clouded eyes.

"Su Heng—it's you!" Xuanyuan Ze's voice was filled with alarm.

And at that moment, the void twisted. Rolling elemental energy coalesced into an enormous face, divine might flooding the heavens, causing all the powerhouses below to tremble in terror.

"Xuanyuan Ze, you want to detain my son? You think you're worthy?"

The enormous face spoke, its sound waves rolling and shaking the heavens. They directly caused Xuanyuan Ze to spray blood and stagger backward several steps.
