Chapter 83: Heart Demon Pill

"Master, I only said those things so I could survive and properly serve you in the future."

Li Yi continued speaking, pleading bitterly. "You raised me with your own hands. Can you really bear to watch me die here? I still have a limitless, bright future. I don't want to die here like this."

"Hahaha, True Feather Divine Spirit, you see? Even your disciple says so." Su Yun laughed.

True Feather Divine Spirit's face was pale, her heart filled with extreme disappointment in Li Yi.

But Li Yi was ultimately someone she had raised with her own hands. Their bond was deep. It was precisely because she couldn't bear to watch Li Yi die here like this that she hadn't left yet.

Otherwise, with her strength, she would have turned and left the moment Su Yun proposed such conditions.

"Su Yun, can you give me some time to consider? Until then, please don't harm my disciple." True Feather Divine Spirit's voice trembled.

In truth, her conviction was already wavering. After all, Su Yun's analysis was logically clear, and the conditions were so good they were almost impossible to refuse.

She just couldn't let go of her pride.

And in the future, once word got out, how would those people in the sect and in other Daoist sects view her?

"Of course. I'll give you three days to consider."

Su Yun smiled coldly, holding the flushed Su Yayue as he strode toward the Su family gates. Two soldiers followed close behind, dragging Li Yi, who quickly disappeared from True Feather Divine Spirit's beautiful eyes.

"Master, please, you must save me," Li Yi's feeble, pleading voice came from within.

The Su family gates closed heavily. The terrifying auras of the eighteen generals and Su Jian vanished instantly, making True Feather Divine Spirit feel as if a weight had been lifted.

A bitter smile crossed True Feather Divine Spirit's lips before she quickly vanished from the spot.

This matter was too significant. She simply couldn't let go of her pride.

Moreover, the Kunlun Mirror was in the Su family's hands, and an Innate Dao Body had appeared. She needed to notify the sect first and discuss it together.

If the Innate Dao Body fell into the hands of the other two great Daoist sects—the Celestial Maiden Sect and the Lingxiao Daoist Sect—it would be a major blow to the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

...

In the pocket dimension, at Su Yun's villa.

Li Yi was casually thrown onto the floor by two soldiers. After coughing up a large mouthful of blood, he looked up to see Su Yun sitting in a chair with his eyes closed.

Beside Su Yun was the Su Yayue he had been yearning for, along with an extremely seductive maidservant massaging his temples. Though she was very young—not much older than him—her aura was extremely powerful.

She was likely at least a Heaven Spirit realm expert, a once-in-a-generation prodigy whose talent was no less than his own.

To have two such heaven-blessed women as mere maidservants.

Li Yi felt even more deeply how powerful Su Yun's background was.

His position as alternate Dao Child, which he had always been so proud of, seemed laughable compared to Su Yun—as different as heaven and earth.

Li Yi's desire for the Dao Child position of the Kunlun Daoist Sect grew even stronger.

If he weren't just an alternate Dao Child but the true Dao Child, surely Su Yun wouldn't dare treat him so wantonly. The sect would also value him more and spare no effort to rescue him.

He could speak with Su Yun as an equal.

But the silent atmosphere and dim light around him put enormous pressure on Li Yi, making his heart heavy.

The most pressing matter was to save his life first.

Though Su Yun had promised his master not to harm him for three days, Li Yi had already developed a deep fear of Su Yun's domineering and brutal nature.

"Young Master Su Yun, I know I was wrong. Rest assured, Master will soon come around and agree to your conditions."

Li Yi said ingratiatingly, "After all, with your status, background, and supreme talent, you will certainly become the future Su family patriarch, the strongest Divine Spirit, and a Council Member of the Federation's Supreme Council. Accompanying you for three days wouldn't diminish her status at all—in fact, it would be her honor."

Having said this, Li Yi turned to look at Su Yayue. His bloodied, twisted face formed a smile. "Yayue, I apologize for my earlier offense. I was just too eager and did something wrong.

"But once you become my master's disciple, I'll be your senior brother. I hope you can forget what just happened.

"In the sect, your senior brother has some influence. If you need anything, just ask."

"Li Yi, I'm only now realizing how truly disgusting you are." Su Yayue's face was full of revulsion.

How had she failed to see this person's shamelessness before, actually thinking he was worth befriending?

"Li Yi, you cultivate the Yin-Yang Dao Scripture. You probably wanted to cultivate alongside Yayue and get... intimately acquainted."

At this moment, Su Yun suddenly spoke. His face wore a brilliant smile, but his eyes were extremely cold, making Li Yi feel a chill throughout his body. He immediately realized he had gotten too excited and said the wrong thing.

Su Yayue was Su Yun's personal maidservant and a close guard of the personal guard battalion.

And members of the personal guard battalion were essentially never allowed to marry outsiders.

Li Yi's heart thumped. He forced a smile. "Young Master, you misunderstand. How would I dare..."

But before he could finish, Su Yun waved his hand coldly. "Dark Lady, give it to him."

The next moment, Dark Lady's voluptuous figure appeared in the hall. She walked up to Li Yi, her black-veiled face showing no emotion, and said coldly, "Eat it."

"What is this?" Li Yi stared blankly at the black pill in Dark Lady's pale palm.

"Heart Demon Pill."

Dark Lady's voice was icy, carrying a hint of cruelty. "After you take it, swear a lifelong oath of loyalty to the Young Master. The Heart Demon Pill will merge with your primordial spirit. Even if you ignite your divine fire, you won't be able to dissolve it.

"From now on, if you dare harbor even a single disrespectful thought toward the Young Master, your primordial spirit will suffer the torment of ten thousand insects devouring your heart, experiencing boundless pain until your body collapses and your primordial spirit is annihilated.

"But rest assured—even the strongest Divine Spirit won't be able to detect that you've taken the Heart Demon Pill. It won't affect your chances of becoming the Kunlun Daoist Sect's Dao Child."

Li Yi shuddered violently, his pupils contracting deeply.

He had naturally heard of the Heart Demon Pill's infamous reputation.

Once taken and the oath sworn willingly, it was said to be unsolvable even by the strongest Divine Spirits.

"No, I won't take it. I can't take it."

Li Yi was terrified beyond measure, retreating repeatedly. If he took this Heart Demon Pill, he would never be able to escape Su Yun's control for the rest of his life.

He had endured for so many years precisely to reach the pinnacle. How could he allow himself to be controlled by someone else?

"Young Master Su Yun, you promised my master you wouldn't harm me for three days. How can you go back on your word?"

Li Yi looked toward Su Yun, pleading desperately. "I swear to you, I will never pursue Yayue again. And my master cares deeply for me—she will definitely agree to your conditions within three days.

"After that, I promise I'll be the Young Master's man too. I'll speak well of you to my master."
