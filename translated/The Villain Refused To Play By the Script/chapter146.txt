Chapter 146: The Celestial Maiden Sect

Countless great Chinese clans and powerhouses received this news, only to fall into silence. Was there really still hope?

Su Yun was so forceful and domineering, with Ouyang Feng and Xuanyuan Jian following his lead.

And the secluded sects had always been suppressed by the four great families. Could they truly influence Su Yun?

Just then, a piece of news emerged from the Su family headquarters, once again shaking all of China—even the secluded sects trembled.

"The Celestial Maiden Sect has been colluding with Demon Race Divine Spirits, plotting to hand over the Chinese world to the Demon Lord. Evidence is irrefutable. The Su family, Xuanyuan family, and Ouyang family will jointly dispatch armies to campaign against the Celestial Maiden Sect and sever all connections with the Demon Lord."

"Any secluded sect that dares collude with the Celestial Maiden Sect shall be treated as equally guilty."

At this moment, all of China fell utterly silent. Countless powerhouses' pupils contracted sharply, terrified beyond measure.

Everyone understood this order must have come from the Su family heir, Su Yun—only he could do something on such a grand scale, or rather, such an insane scale.

At such a moment, with the Federation Supreme Council meeting imminent, Su Yun actually wanted to move against the secluded sects. This was madness taken to the extreme.

"He's gone mad! Completely mad!"

"Is there no one who can stop Su Yun?"

"He's going to drag peaceful China into flames of war."

"The Celestial Maiden Sect, Lingxiao Daoist Sect, and Kunlun Daoist Sect are the three great branches of the Daoist tradition—ancient powers that have produced several Strongest Divine Spirits over their thousand-year histories, with immeasurably deep heritage."

"Moreover, the Celestial Maiden Sect possesses the ancient divine weapon, the Qiankun Cauldron."

"Though the three Daoist sects have always fought among themselves, they're ultimately united. If they move against the Celestial Maiden Sect and the Lingxiao Daoist Sect and Kunlun Daoist Sect come to their aid, it'll be a prolonged war."

"Su Yun has truly gone mad!"

Countless powerhouses were dumbstruck, terrified beyond measure.

A war between forces of this level could sink hundreds of thousands of miles of territory.

Yet just as public opinion reached a fever pitch, a voice suddenly emerged from the Kunlun Daoist Sect: "The Celestial Maiden Sect has been colluding with the Demon Race—this is absolute sacrilege. The Kunlun Daoist Sect will spare no effort to help the Su family eliminate the Celestial Maiden Sect."

Just one day later, the Holy Son of the Lingxiao Daoist Sect also made a public statement: the Celestial Maiden Sect's sacrilege was beneath the Lingxiao Daoist Sect's dignity to associate with, and they would not interfere in the three great families' campaign against them.

The Buddhist sects, Confucian schools, and other secluded sects all fell unexpectedly silent, not a single one speaking up.

At this moment, all of China fell utterly silent.

Just one day later, the three great families each mobilized 300,000 troops from various parts of China—nearly a million soldiers combined—marching toward the western mountain ranges of China in a vast, awe-inspiring display. Winds reversed, dust churned, and killing intent spread throughout the Chinese world.

The western reaches of China were said to contain ten thousand mountain ranges, interconnected like ten thousand great dragons coiled upon the earth.

Each mountain range was home to various secluded sects and religions, a chaotic mixture where powerhouses abounded.

Criminals who had committed heinous crimes also fled to these mountains to escape punishment, establishing their own sects and accepting disciples from all of China.

Though the secluded sects called themselves "secluded," in reality, the only ones truly detached from worldly affairs were the great sects like the Daoist tradition, Buddhist schools, and Confucian schools.

Deep in the endless mountains stood a peak a hundred thousand zhang high, piercing into the firmament. Clouds and mist swirled around it, palaces stood in orderly rows, spirit cranes danced—like a paradise on earth.

Through the drifting clouds, three magnificent characters occasionally came into view.

Celestial Maiden Sect!

From afar, a transcendent Dao rhyme would wash over you from a hundred miles away, making one feel as if their very soul had been cleansed.

It was said these characters were personally inscribed by the Celestial Maiden Sect's founding sect master, the Celestial Maiden, after she used the most powerful Divine Spirit of China to sever her mortal attachments and transcend beyond the Strongest Divine Spirit realm. They contained her insights at the moment of transcendence.

Of course, this was merely legend.

The current Celestial Maiden Sect, let alone transcending beyond Strongest Divine Spirit, didn't even have a Strongest Divine Spirit. Though Sect Master An Ruoyi was extraordinarily talented, reaching half-step Strongest Divine Spirit in just forty years, she still wasn't quite there.

"What a pity. If Sect Master An Ruoyi had broken through to Strongest Divine Spirit, Su Yun might not have dared campaign against the Celestial Maiden Sect so brazenly, relying on the sect-guarding divine weapon Qiankun Cauldron." An ancient Divine Spirit gazed toward the sky's edge, sighing softly, then waved his hand and led his sect away from the Celestial Maiden Sect's vicinity.

All around, countless other powerhouses were also hurrying their sect disciples away.

The three great families' million-strong army was already near the Celestial Maiden Sect.

Even though the Celestial Maiden Sect's surroundings were rich in vital energy—once a hotly contested location for countless sects—no one dared remain now.

Within three days, this place would fall.

...

Celestial Maiden Peak, Main Hall.

An Ruoyi sat expressionlessly in the seat of the sect master, an aura of terrible power emanating as her black hair gently swayed.

Below her stood the Celestial Maiden Sect's many elders and peak masters, all deathly pale, not a trace of fighting spirit in their eyes.

"Reporting to Sect Master, the Buddhist Patriarch's response: Buddhism does not take lives, and they cannot lend aid."

"The Confucian Patriarch's response: the Confucian way is to govern the nation and bring peace to the world, and they cannot participate in this great war."

"These people are all sanctimonious hypocrites!"

"In normal times, one by one they fawned over our Celestial Maiden Sect disciples, hoping our sect's powerhouses would sever their mortal attachments with them, their mouths full of honeyed words."

"But at the critical moment, not a single one is useful."

The elders were filled with righteous indignation, growling one after another.

Just then, a woman standing beside An Ruoyi—her face veiled in white gauze, her skin fair—stepped forward and spoke: "Master, what should we do? Whatever you say, the entire sect will follow—whether to fight or to make peace."

She was the current Holy Maiden of the Celestial Maiden Sect, known by the Dao name Mingyu. She held tremendous renown throughout all of western China.

Not yet thirty years old, she had already achieved Profound Palace Realm—equal in fame to Kunlun Daoist Sect's Dao Child, Dao Yuan, and known as one of the two great prodigies of the Daoist tradition.

Of course, since Su Yayue and her Innate Dao Body had joined the Kunlun Daoist Sect, Mingyu's fame had declined considerably.

"Sect Master, are all men such fickle creatures?" An Ruoyi suddenly asked.

Mingyu froze slightly, not understanding what her master meant by this question. But she answered respectfully: "Master, the world is complex and varied, but surely there are still good people."

As she spoke, an indescribable light flashed through Mingyu's beautiful eyes. A tall, dark silhouette emerged unbidden in her mind.

Even among humans, there were good people—and even among the cruel Demon Race.

Hearing these words, a flash of surprise passed through An Ruoyi's eyes. She looked deeply at her disciple and said: "It seems you've already found someone to sever your mortal attachments with."

She caressed her own red lips and murmured: "But the man your master wanted to sever her mortal attachments with wants to kill me, to throw dirty water on my head, to destroy my Celestial Maiden Sect."

"My Celestial Maiden Sect has always been detached from worldly affairs. How could we possibly be colluding with the Demon Race?"

Hearing An Ruoyi's words, a complicated look flashed through the eyes of the elders and peak masters below. They naturally understood what An Ruoyi meant—after all, they had personally witnessed what happened in the Su family's great hall.

Ever since the sect master returned to the Celestial Maiden Sect, she had often seemed distracted. Clearly, she had fallen for that domineering, ruthless man.

They had thought it wouldn't be long before An Ruoyi could sever her mortal attachments and achieve Strongest Divine Spirit.

But who could have predicted that the Su family would suddenly become enemies with the Celestial Maiden Sect?

With a great war imminent, the sect master needed to achieve Strongest Divine Spirit but had to rely on her enemy to do so. What irony.
