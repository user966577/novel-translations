Chapter 46: Execute on the Spot

"This servant of Chaos Heavenly King's Manor, Old Fu, pays respects to the Young Master."

The old man's expression was blank. After giving Su Yun a slight bow, he said: "His Majesty the King has sent this old servant to bring the young miss back. He also wishes to express his apologies to the Young Master for failing to discipline the young miss properly, allowing her to offend you. He will certainly manage her better in the future."

With that, a purple-gold token appeared in his hand, engraved with the two characters for "Chaos."

"Hummm!"

In that instant, a terrifying, vast pressure erupted from the token. It seemed capable of suppressing the land for hundreds of miles, freezing the very flow of space.

It was as if a supreme king's indifferent gaze was watching this place.

The Heavenly King Token—as if the Heavenly King himself were present.

Every Heavenly King was a supreme ruler who had experienced countless battles and commanded millions of troops. Each was at least at the Saint level, having rendered great service to humanity.

Chaos Heavenly King was one of the Su family's Heavenly Kings. The previous generation's Su family patriarch, representing the Federation's Supreme Council, had personally bestowed this Heavenly King Token upon him.

Though Chaos Heavenly King had retired, he still held enormous influence in the Federation military. He held high rank and great authority as Vice Chairman of the Military Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Not only was his strength boundless—having long since reached the Saint level—but in the current Su family compound, aside from Su Heng himself, those whose power and status exceeded Chaos Heavenly King could be counted on one hand.

Chaos Heavenly King was truly one of the Su family's great figures, far above those so-called Imperial Capital luminaries.

Because of Chaos Heavenly King's strength and status, Su Ying—though not particularly powerful among the Su family's younger generation—held a very high position.

This was why she had dared to challenge Su Yun.

Su Yun was merely the Su family's heir, part of the younger generation.

But Chaos Heavenly King was a genuine Federation magnate, a Su family powerhouse.

"Chaos Heavenly King has actually brought out the Heavenly King Token. Does Su Yun dare continue?"

"Seeing the token is like seeing the man himself. This is essentially Chaos Heavenly King appearing in person."

The many Su family powerhouses held their breath, their gazes solemn.

It seemed Chaos Heavenly King truly wanted to test Su Yun's mettle as the Su family's heir—perhaps even suppress him.

Terrifying majesty permeated the air.

"Su Lie." Qin Junhua's expression suddenly darkened. A token appeared in her hand—the Matriarch Token, symbolizing her status as the family patriarch's wife.

She feared Su Yun couldn't withstand such tremendous pressure.

This was no longer a contest between the younger generation.

"Ying'er, take my token. I want to see what Su Lie thinks he's doing—does he truly have a death wish?"

"As you command, my lady."

Qin Ying immediately took the token, and her figure vanished instantly.

At that moment, terrifying majesty permeated the heavens, vast and boundless, seemingly trying to force Su Yun to his knees.

"Impudent servant! Before the Heavenly King Token, as if the Heavenly King himself were here, you dare not kneel in respect!" Steward Fu looked at Yun Ran and shouted, his aura overwhelming.

The Heavenly King Token erupted with divine light, directly pressing down toward Yun Ran at Su Yun's side.

This was a Heavenly King's might, containing the terrifying power of a Saint. A single wisp could collapse the land for miles.

"Impudent slave! Before this young master, you dare not kneel?"

"Forget the Heavenly King Token—even if Chaos Heavenly King came in person, don't think you could take Su Ying away."

But at that moment, a golden token appeared in Su Yun's hand. Terrifying divine light suddenly erupted, piercing through the heavens, directly annihilating the Heavenly King's power.

"It's the Young Master Token."

The many Su family powerhouses drew sharp breaths.

The Young Master Token was second only to the Su family patriarch's token as a symbol of status. It was itself a Divine Spirit treasure, impervious to all evil, containing vast power.

But that was secondary—the Young Master Token represented enormous authority.

In the Eighteen Battalions guarding the Su family compound around the Imperial Capital, the Young Master Token could mobilize five of them.

And each battalion contained ten thousand soldiers, led by a Ten-Thousand God Guard who was at least a Saint-level powerhouse.

Furthermore, according to Su family rules, if anything happened to the current patriarch, the heir could use the Young Master Token to mobilize all Eighteen Battalions, protect himself, ascend to the patriarch's position, and command all forces under the Su family's control.

"Su Yun has actually brought out the Young Master Token. Has he gone mad?"

"Could he really intend to confront Chaos Heavenly King head-on?"

"Su Yun seems truly angered by Chaos Heavenly King. Otherwise, given his previous temperament, he would never be so unyielding."

The many Su family powerhouses drew breath after breath. If this continued, things would escalate dramatically.

"Yun Ran, take my token and seize this dog of a slave. If he dares resist, execute him on the spot." Su Yun spoke coldly, his eyes devoid of emotion, his voice laden with terrifying killing intent.

This time, he would make the entire Su family understand.

He was Su Yun—not the original host, that waste who had power but didn't dare use it, only daring to show off outside.

What Chaos Heavenly King? If he dared show himself, Su Yun would dare to kill him.

Even if it turned the Su family upside down, even if it threw everything into chaos—so what?

He wanted to see who was more unyielding.

"As you command, Young Master." Yun Ran bowed and took the Young Master Token. Her gaze turned cold instantly, her devastatingly beautiful face becoming impassive. She looked at Steward Fu and said icily: "Impudent slave! Before the Young Master Token, you still refuse to kneel and surrender?"

"You servant girl, how audacious! You dare order me to kneel?" Steward Fu flew into rage, holding the Heavenly King Token, his spine ramrod straight.

At this moment, he represented Chaos Heavenly King.

How could Chaos Heavenly King kneel to some young brat? That would be a complete loss of face.

At that moment, inside Chaos Heavenly King's Manor, Su Lie's expression had darkened to the extreme. A terrifying cold light flickered in his eyes as his horrifying Saint's might spread outward, causing the entire massive steel manor to shake, cracks appearing throughout.

One could imagine how terrifying his fury had become.

"Hummm!"

Yun Ran wasted no words. Her figure flickered, instantly appearing before Steward Fu. Holding the Young Master Token, she struck down directly. Space itself collapsed. Under the Divine Spirit's power, all rules were suppressed.

The Young Master Token was itself a Divine Spirit treasure personally forged by the Su family's founding ancestor, containing supreme divine power.

"Servant girl, you dare attack me?"

Steward Fu roared in fury, his pupils contracting sharply. He tried to resist, but his entire body's strength was suppressed by the supreme divine power. He couldn't muster even a fraction of it.

Divine power could warp rules, make the sun and moon change places in the sky. How could a mere Heaven Spirit Realm cultivator resist?

Even the Heavenly King Token in his hand seemed to cower before the Young Master Token, voluntarily withdrawing its power.

"Slap!"

The token struck Steward Fu's skull. With a "splat," his head exploded directly, dispersing into a mist of blood. Only his body from the neck down remained, swaying in place for a moment before crashing to the ground, raising clouds of dust.

"Steward Fu!" Su Ying's shriek pierced heaven and earth, filled with bone-deep anguish.

Steward Fu had followed Chaos Heavenly King for decades and had watched her grow up, always caring for her deeply.

"Reporting to Young Master: Old Fu dared to resist. This servant has executed him." Yun Ran picked up the Heavenly King Token from his hand and returned, kneeling on the ground, presenting both the Young Master Token and the Heavenly King Token with both hands.

"Mm."

Su Yun's gaze was cold. He took back both tokens and said: "Relay my command. The five battalions of the Imperial Capital—Metal Divine Battalion, Wood Divine Battalion, Fire Divine Battalion, Water Divine Battalion, and Earth Divine Battalion—are to immediately mobilize to the Imperial Capital. Prepare for battle. Be ready to suppress any rebellion."

This scene left everyone stunned.

The Eighteen Battalions of the Imperial Capital were a crucial force guarding the Su family compound—the Su family's private army, elite among elites, impossibly powerful. They could not be mobilized casually except in life-or-death emergencies.

Su Yun had actually called the five battalions into the Imperial Capital. What was he trying to do? Had he lost his mind?

And suppress rebellion—whose rebellion? Chaos Heavenly King's?

This was preparation for Chaos Heavenly King to personally enter the fray.

"He's lost it. He's truly lost it."

"Chaos Heavenly King has played this too big. How will he salvage the situation?"

"Who could have imagined Su Yun would act so completely out of character, becoming this unyielding? Not only did he suppress Su Ying, he killed Steward Fu on the spot."

"Chaos Heavenly King must be going insane."

"No, we absolutely cannot let Chaos Heavenly King appear in person. We must stop him. Otherwise, if Su Yun refuses to back down, the entire Su family will fall into chaos."

...

The many Su family powerhouses were dumbstruck. They hurried out of their residences, flying toward Chaos Heavenly King's Manor.

"Yun'er, this is my Yun'er." Qin Junhua was stunned for a moment, then smiled with satisfaction. Her black hair danced in the breeze, her beautiful face—stunning even with minimal makeup—becoming even more alluring.

Her Yun'er had finally grown up.

He could stand on his own now.

As the Su family's heir, he should possess this kind of unstoppable dominance. Otherwise, how could he keep all those old foxes in line?

At that moment, inside Chaos Heavenly King's Manor, a deep roar of fury rang out, shattering the sky and collapsing space.

"Boom!"

Chaos Heavenly King erupted with terrifying killing intent. His eyes blazed with rolling fury as he stepped out of the manor.
