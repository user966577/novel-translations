Chapter 37: Don't You Think That's Going Too Far?

"Ye Ling, don't you think you're being too much?"

Before Liu Ting could even speak, her face pale, Xuanyuan Jian was already furious. She shouted and slammed her palm on the table, rising to her feet. Sword qi surged between her brows as she spoke: "Have you forgotten that the origin stones in your hands were earned with Sister Ting's help?

"You kept saying that you came here to help Sister Ting bid on the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine and bring it back to the Liu family—to save her clan.

"And now you're saying you want to use part of it first to bid on the beast hide scroll for me? Where does that leave Sister Ting?"

Xuanyuan Jian's expression was ice-cold, as if covered in a layer of frost, her heart erupting like a volcano.

Everything that had happened in this short time had truly driven her impression of Ye Ling to rock bottom, and she had accumulated tremendous anger toward him.

Bidding on the beast hide scroll for her while brazenly trampling over Liu Ting's interests—she had no desire for that kind of favor.

And with these words, Liu Ting's face grew even paler, drained of all color.

Even at the academy gates earlier, she had already understood how selfish Ye Ling was. But she never imagined he could be so heartless.

"Jian'er, don't say anymore. Let him do as he pleases. I don't need help from such a selfish person." Liu Ting's voice was bitter, yet she managed a smile.

The more excessive Ye Ling's behavior, the more at ease she felt about manipulating him.

This kind of person didn't deserve to be Xuanyuan Jian's friend.

She could rely on her own efforts to get Su Yun to save the Liu family. Why should she grovel before Ye Ling?

And Liu Ting's bitter smile appeared so pitiful in Xuanyuan Jian's eyes that it made her heart ache. She couldn't help but reach out to stroke Liu Ting's head, saying, "Sister Ting, don't worry. Jian'er is here for you. I'll protect you."

Her disgust toward Ye Ling only intensified.

But at that moment, Ye Ling just smiled and said, "Jian'er, relax. I know what I'm doing. Even after helping you bid on the beast hide scroll, I'm confident I'll still be able to secure the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine for Ting'er."

Ye Ling spoke with complete confidence.

Since coming to the Imperial Capital, he had encountered countless opportunities and met one benefactor after another. His assets were quite substantial.

Besides, in his view, women were all stubborn in the same way. Though Xuanyuan Jian was strong-willed, she was still a woman—no exception. She might say she didn't want it, but in her heart, she wanted it desperately.

By putting down Liu Ting and elevating Xuanyuan Jian's status...

She was probably angry on the surface but secretly delighted beyond measure.

"Since Ting'er agrees, I'll put up a portion of the origin stones—five million pounds should be enough to secure this beast hide scroll for you, Jian'er."

"Let the people below bid first. I'll deliver the final blow."

Ye Ling waved his hand dismissively. Since Liu Ting wasn't objecting, he took it as consent.

Xuanyuan Jian's expression turned frigid. If this weren't the auction house where fighting was forbidden, she would have drawn her sword to teach this ungrateful, self-righteous man a proper lesson.

He seemed to think he held an important place in her heart.

"Jian'er, I'm feeling a bit dizzy. Let me lean on you for a moment." Liu Ting smiled pitifully and rested her head on Xuanyuan Jian's shoulder, adding more fuel to Xuanyuan Jian's already burning anger.

"Alright. If you're tired, Sister Ting, rest a while. I'll wake you when they auction the divine iron mine."

Xuanyuan Jian felt deeply pained, thinking Liu Ting didn't deserve this treatment.

If not for helping Ye Ling, how would Liu Ting have angered Su Yun, leading to the broken engagement and her current predicament?

Yet Ye Ling was so utterly selfish. Not only did he show no consideration for Liu Ting, he targeted her at every turn.

As if Liu Ting had simply lost all value to him.

Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the auction hall was boiling over.

"Ten thousand pounds of origin stones."

Though the starting price was only one pound, a prodigy immediately spoke up, multiplying the price ten thousand times in one go.

After all, this was the hide of a Saint-level ancient ferocious beast, and it likely had been passed down from ancient times. Its value was extremely precious. Even though it was somewhat damaged, it was still incredibly rare—a window into the long-lost mythical era of antiquity.

"Twenty thousand pounds of origin stones."

"Thirty thousand pounds of origin stones."

"Fifty thousand pounds of origin stones."

"One hundred thousand pounds of origin stones."

"Two hundred thousand pounds of origin stones."

The atmosphere was scorching hot. Prices climbed steadily higher as if origin stones were nothing at all, mere numbers to be called out.

No one had expected that the very first item at the Azure Blue Auction would fetch such a high price.

"Two million pounds of origin stones."

At that moment, an imposing young man spoke casually, instantly suppressing all other bids.

In an instant, all voices in the hall fell silent.

"Hiss, two million pounds of origin stones. That's not liquid assets—you have to produce actual origin stones."

"Which great family's prodigy is he? Though this beast hide scroll is precious, it's incomplete and extremely difficult to comprehend. Why spend so many origin stones on it?"

"That's Wang Yi, a prodigy of the Wang family from the Imperial Capital. His clan has a Saint-level ancestor presiding over it, with family assets in the hundreds of millions."

"Two million origin stones might not be a small sum, but for the Wang family, it's really nothing special."

The hall instantly fell quiet. Clearly, everyone felt the beast hide scroll was worth two million origin stones at most.

Then a voice tinged with faint amusement rang out: "I bid two million five hundred thousand pounds of origin stones."

"Hissss!"

Instantly, everyone drew sharp breaths, turning to look toward the upper floor where the voice originated. There stood a plainly dressed young man.

"Ye Ling."

Wang Yi's expression darkened the moment he saw it was Ye Ling. He immediately called out, "Three million pounds of origin stones."

Though he was the young master of the Wang family, these origin stones were already his limit.

After all, though the Wang family had substantial resources, they also had many members.

"Wang Yi, aren't you the Wang family's young master? Is that all you've got?"

Ye Ling looked down at Wang Yi with a cold smile. What had happened at the academy gates still made his heart ache whenever he recalled it.

"I bid three million two hundred thousand."

This was already an astronomical price that made everyone gasp.

"Ye Ling."

Wang Yi's face turned iron-green, but ultimately he sat back down, giving up the competition. The amount had grown too massive.

"You think you're worthy of competing with me? Trash."

Ye Ling sneered, mocking him mercilessly, venting his fury toward Su Yun upon Wang Yi without restraint.

Then Ye Ling turned to look at Xuanyuan Jian in the private room and smiled. "Jian'er, I've secured the beast hide scroll for you."

At that moment, in the Heaven-class private room, Su Yun's lips curved slightly as he nodded calmly. "Have Meng Wudao make a bid."

"As you command. I'll notify him immediately." Yun Ran replied respectfully and vanished from the room.
