Chapter 45: I, Su Yun, Am the Su Family

The moment Su Yun lifted Su Ying with one hand, the pupils of the many powerhouses observing from within the Su family compound contracted sharply. They could hardly believe Su Yun would suddenly strike.

Primarily because this was completely inconsistent with the character Su Yun had displayed before.

All along, though Su Yun had shown a domineering personality, as the family heir, he had been extremely gentle toward those within the clan. He had no interest whatsoever in power struggles.

When it came to family matters that he, as heir, should have been managing—he avoided them whenever possible.

Externally, though he had killed some students at Qingbei Academy, those were merely crimes of passion over women, and they were all insignificant nobodies who didn't even register on the Su family's radar.

Actions like getting a Qingbei Academy elder expelled over Liu Ting might have caused a huge stir in the Imperial Capital, but to the Su family, they were beneath notice.

And most damning of all—as the Su family's heir, Su Yun had actually groveled and debased himself over a mere woman from the minor Liu family.

As Su Yun was the family heir, the Su family's powerhouses naturally monitored his every move.

To put it bluntly, if Su Yun weren't Su Heng's only son, with the formidable Qin Junhua backing him up, his position as heir would have been revoked countless times over.

After all, this was an utterly brutal world—survival of the fittest, where the strong reigned supreme. Though the Su family stood at the pinnacle of humanity, that didn't mean they could rest easy forever.

If Su Yun were an ordinary Su family disciple, his background would let him do whatever he pleased.

But as the heir who would one day lead the massive Su family? With his personality, the Su family would probably decline under his leadership sooner or later.

So it wasn't just Su Ying's branch—even Su Heng's own loyal faction was deeply dissatisfied with Su Yun.

Otherwise, what did Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie think he was? Without sensing these undercurrents, would he have dared send Su Ying out to challenge Su Yun's authority? He would have to be tired of living.

And the many Su family powerhouses wanted to use this incident to see how Su Yun would handle things—whether he still deserved to be the Su family's heir.

If his response was too soft, if he continued with his previous pattern of yielding whenever possible, they were determined to pressure Su Heng into picking someone else from among the family's many prodigies to replace Su Yun—even if that meant choosing Su Meng.

"Yun'er."

At that moment, in a pocket dimension deep within the Su family compound, Qin Junhua stood amid a garden of flowers, her gaze sharp. Qin Ying stood behind her, her expression equally cold.

They had weathered countless power struggles. It was their efforts that had pushed Su Yun to the position of family heir. And they had contributed enormously to Su Heng's ascension to patriarch as well.

They could see right through the thoughts of the Su family's many powerhouses.

They even knew exactly what schemes these people were plotting.

The reason they hadn't intervened yet was to see how Su Yun would respond—how much he had grown after the Liu Ting incident.

"My lady, the master has been at the Federation meeting for a year now. Some people within the Su family are getting restless." Qin Ying's voice was cold.

Qin Junhua waved her hand dismissively and sneered: "Ying'er, don't rush. They're just fleas. Let them hop around for now. Let Yun'er handle this himself."

"Yun'er's personality really is too soft. He needs some tempering."

"I may have been in seclusion for over a decade, but if these old fools dare to bully the young, or if they dare do anything that threatens my Yun'er's position..."

At this point, Qin Junhua's eyes turned sharp, flashing with killing intent. A terrifying murderous aura spread outward, causing the precious spirit flowers and fruits around her to wither and fall.

...

Deep within the Su family compound stood a massive mansion forged from purple-gold divine iron. The plaque above bore four large characters: "Chaos Heavenly King's Manor." It radiated an overwhelming sense of majesty.

From a distance, the mansion looked more like a colossal steel fortress—like an ancient behemoth crouching there, its breath drawing in the essence of sun and moon.

Inside the great hall, a middle-aged man with disheveled hair sat. His towering frame flickered with divine radiance, his eyes cold. "Steward Fu, take my command token and bring Ying'er back. I want to see if this brat dares to offend me."

"As you command, Heavenly King."

An old man in black robes standing to the side of the hall bowed slightly. Space rippled, and his figure vanished from the manor.

...

At that moment, the many powerhouses watched the scene unfold with cold eyes. The dilapidated, moss-covered courtyard had attracted the attention of half the major figures in the Su family's main compound.

"Cough, cough."

Su Ying's face was covered in blood. Su Yun had crushed her teeth, leaving her features twisted. Yet her eyes were full of cold mockery:

"Su Yun, I don't know what you're talking about. How did I challenge you? I was just speaking the truth."

"As for whether my father put me up to this—that's even more laughable. Over these past ten-plus years, everyone in the Su family has seen what you've done. The people who resent you are too many to count. I just couldn't stand watching anymore and was the first to step forward."

"All I did was hope you'd apologize to Su Meng and restore his proper treatment. I spoke a word of fairness. How is that challenging you?"

"Su Yun, you may be the Su family's heir, but I'm also a direct descendant. Just because I said a few words, you treat me so brutally. Aren't you afraid of making the entire Su family lose faith in you?"

With that, Su Ying's eyes suddenly hardened. A terrifying purple glow flashed as heaven and earth's origin energy churned violently. Twelve purple-gold divine dragons materialized, roaring toward the sky, their cries shaking the heavens and shifting the clouds.

Su Ying's strength was formidable indeed. Though she was an obscure woman, at merely thirty years of age she possessed the power of twelve dragons. Throughout the entire Imperial Capital, such talent was exceptionally rare—enough to make her an heir of many great families.

"Sharp-tongued to the end. Even at death's door, you still dare try to pin labels on me. Get down."

Su Yun's eyes contained the rotating Fuxi Bagua Formation. The origin energy of heaven and earth seemed to respond to his call. Nine chaotic divine dragons roared to the heavens—noble beyond measure—and with a sweep of their tails, they shattered the twelve purple-gold dragons, dispersing them into a sky full of purple energy.

"How can your power be this strong?!" Su Ying's pupils contracted violently, filled with disbelief.

But she had no more time to deploy any techniques.

At that moment, the many Su family powerhouses were also shaken. Su Yun's displayed strength far exceeded everyone's expectations.

"Boom!"

Su Yun's hand suddenly tightened. He lifted Su Ying into the air and then viciously slammed her head-first into the ground, flipping her body and creating a crater nearly three feet deep. Cracks spread wildly as dust filled the air. The ground trembled for hundreds of feet in every direction.

"Drip, drip, drip..."

This was the sound of blood dripping from Su Ying's head onto the earth. Soft and melodious, yet the sight made everyone's blood run cold.

Su Ying was the daughter of a Heavenly King, a direct descendant of the Su family—and she was closely related to Su Yun by blood.

"I am the Su family's heir. I command five of the Su family's eighteen battalions. I represent the Su family throughout the Imperial Capital. Never mind just punishing Su Meng—even if I killed him outright, it would be perfectly justified. What the hell are you, daring to lecture me?"

Su Yun's gaze was cold. He had no concept of being gentle with women as he stomped hard into the crater, his foot pressing down on Su Ying's head. Blood and flesh smeared across her face as bones crackled and burst.

"As for making the Su family lose faith?"

"I, Su Yun, am the Su family. You, Su Ying, don't have the standing. Forget killing you—even if I killed your father, Chaos Heavenly King, what of it?"

"Challenging me is challenging the Su family. Challenging the Su family's rules. It's treason—a crime worthy of death."

"Speak. Who else is behind you? Do you have accomplices?"

"Tell me, and considering you're my cousin, I can make your death quick."

The cold, domineering voice, laden with terrifying killing intent, exploded across the heavens without restraint, reaching the ears of all the watching powerhouses. It sent chills down their spines as they stared at Su Yun as if looking at a monster.

Could these really be words that Su Yun was capable of saying?

Dimly, they seemed to see that supreme Divine Spirit—Su Heng. Only he possessed this kind of overwhelming, world-sweeping dominance.

In that instant, they realized they could no longer tell which was the real Su Yun.

Was it the simp-like Su Yun?

Or this Su Yun—domineering beyond measure, treating family bonds like dirt?

"Yun'er, this is my Yun'er. My son should stand above all creation, looking down upon the world." Qin Junhua murmured, her eyes filled with indescribable emotion.

"My lady, the young master has grown up. He can stand on his own now." A joyful smile finally appeared on Qin Ying's cold face.

"If that bastard Su Heng knew about this, he'd definitely be happier than me. He'd probably drop everything and rush back from the Federation immediately."

Qin Junhua smiled with satisfaction.

Only a Yun'er like this had the qualifications to inherit the Su family—to lead the Su family in continuing to dominate the world.

As for little Su Ying? Kill her, so what? She was just another direct descendant. The Su family's main compound had no shortage of direct descendants. Kill one batch, and there'd be another.

Just a bunch of good-for-nothings.

A flash of disdain crossed Qin Junhua's eyes.

"This servant will send someone to notify the master immediately." Qin Ying smiled.

"No need. Someone will notify him." Qin Junhua chuckled softly. "Ying'er, you don't really think that just because he's at the Federation, he knows nothing about what's happening in the Su family compound, do you?"

"This servant understands." Qin Ying nodded, comprehending.

At that moment, the many Su family powerhouses—

But just then, a vast ripple of power flashed. Space twisted, and an elderly man suddenly appeared at Su Yun's side.

Spatial distortion. Instant teleportation.

This was the mark of a Heaven Spirit Realm powerhouse.
