Chapter 97: I'll Call You 'Yu'er'

Hatred!

Intense hatred nearly overwhelmed True Feather Divine Spirit in an instant, shaking even her dao heart.

"Not only did you discuss this behind my back and order me to come warm his bed, but now you're making decisions for me, having me become Su Yun's concubine."

True Feather Divine Spirit's eyes were red, her voice becoming somewhat hoarse.

Intense hatred filled her heart.

Once word of this spread, how could she ever face anyone again?

Why should she alone be sacrificed to secure benefits for the entire Kunlun Daoist Sect, while these people stood by and watched, treating her as a gift to hand over to someone else?

"True Feather, you..." The Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression darkened. He never expected True Feather Divine Spirit to say such things, putting him on the spot in front of everyone.

The various Kunlun Daoist Sect elders and peak masters also gazed coldly at True Feather, their expressions unpleasant.

This was sacrifice for the sect.

As the peak master of True Feather Peak, didn't True Feather Divine Spirit understand that this matter concerned the very survival of the Kunlun Daoist Sect?

The Kunlun Mirror and the Innate Dao Body were the Kunlun Daoist Sect's greatest hope for revival.

"Things are finally getting interesting." Watching the standoff, Su Yun's lips curved. His gaze was cold as he said indifferently:

"Whatever decision your Kunlun Daoist Sect makes, my patience is limited. I'll give you three minutes to discuss and give me an answer."

With that, Su Yun turned to look at An Ruoyi, his gaze wicked. "Ruoyi Divine Spirit, if you're willing to become my concubine, I'll give you the Kunlun Mirror directly."

In an instant, An Ruoyi's expression froze. A forced smile appeared on her enchanting face. "Young Master Su Yun, you jest. As the Celestial Maiden Sect Master, I cannot marry outside the sect... let alone—"

An Ruoyi didn't finish her sentence, but everyone knew what came next.

Even though she cultivated the Red Dust Dao, it emphasized transcending the world through entering it. She was the dignified Celestial Maiden Sect Master—marriage outside the sect was already impossible. How could she possibly become a secular man's concubine?

That would be practically handing the Celestial Maiden Sect over to the Su family.

The Celestial Maiden Sect's founding ancestor would probably rise from her grave in fury.

The expressions of the elders and peak masters behind An Ruoyi were equally unpleasant.

Su Yun's words were outrageously bold, an affront to the Celestial Maiden Sect.

The Celestial Maiden Sect cultivated the Red Dust Dao, but they never married outside the sect. Their emphasis on entering the world was to sever the seven emotions and six desires—even stricter than the Kunlun Daoist Sect and Lingxiao Sect. Disciples were absolutely forbidden from marrying out.

Let alone becoming someone's concubine.

But as they looked at the Kunlun Daoist Sect, their expressions were equally poor. They never imagined the Kunlun Daoist Sect could make such a mad decision.

This was practically throwing the Daoist sects' dignity on the ground for the Su family to trample.

"However, Ruoyi's previous conditions still stand. I hope the Young Master will carefully consider Ruoyi and the Celestial Maiden Sect." An Ruoyi, unwilling to give up, added another line.

After all, the Innate Dao Body and Kunlun Mirror were simply too important.

She also had great confidence in her own charm. In terms of allure, how could True Feather Divine Spirit possibly compare to her?

If Su Yun wasn't interested in the influence over the Kunlun Daoist Sect that came with True Feather becoming his concubine, but was focused purely on beauty and wanted to taste a Daoist Divine Spirit's sweetness, then True Feather couldn't possibly match her.

Su Yun smiled indifferently, his lips curving noncommittally. He turned to look at the Kunlun Divine Spirit and True Feather Divine Spirit. "Three minutes are up. What have you decided?"

At that moment, the Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression darkened. He suddenly stepped forward and looked at True Feather Divine Spirit. "True Feather, don't forget—before Master died, he left me in charge of the Kunlun Daoist Sect. I am the Sect Master.

"I have the authority to order you to marry into the Su family.

"Moreover, Master's lifelong wish was to revive the sect. This is the best opportunity.

"Are you going to betray the sect? Disregard the collective interests of the sect for your own selfish reasons?"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's words were low and heavy, like muffled thunder exploding beside True Feather Divine Spirit's ears, instantly draining all color from her face. Her pupils contracted sharply.

She and the Kunlun Divine Spirit had both been adopted and raised by the previous Kunlun Daoist Sect Master since childhood.

They had always shared their master's wish, vowing to revive the Kunlun Daoist Sect and recover the Kunlun Mirror.

She had looked upon the Kunlun Divine Spirit as an elder brother.

She never imagined that this man who had once been like both father and brother to her would say such things, even using their master to threaten her.

At that moment, the Kunlun Divine Spirit spoke again, his face cold. "This is the collective decision of myself and all the elders and peak masters. True Feather, if you disobey, you'll be betraying the sect's cultivation of you. I will have no choice but to expel you from the sect in Master's name."

"Senior Brother, you..."

True Feather Divine Spirit's face was deathly pale. She couldn't even complete a sentence.

Heartache!

All sorts of negative emotions churned within her.

But in the end, she still couldn't say anything.

The Kunlun Daoist Sect was where she had grown up. It was her home—she had fought for it for decades. How could she accept being expelled from the sect, branded as a traitor?

"I agree. I agree to become the Su family's concubine. But I hope you won't forget your own promises."

True Feather Divine Spirit's face was pale, but her gaze gradually became resolute. Deep in her eyes lurked intense hatred.

The moment these words left her mouth, she knew that from now on, she would forever be a laughingstock among the Daoist sects.

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's face showed a smile. He turned to Su Yun. "Young Master Su Yun, we have made our decision. Junior Sister True Feather is willing to use herself as the price. As the Vice Sect Master of the Kunlun Daoist Sect, she will become your concubine, never to betray you for the rest of her life. In exchange, you will release alternate Dao Child Li Yi, have the Innate Dao Body join our sect, and lend us the Kunlun Mirror for seven days."

At these words, everyone from both sects focused their gazes on Su Yun, their expressions grave.

Now, they just had to wait for Su Yun's choice.

At that moment, Su Yun laughed. A wicked smile hung on his face as he slowly rose and walked forward step by step, finally stopping beside True Feather Divine Spirit. He lifted her chin with one finger, gazing at her ashen face. "Compared to Sect Master An Ruoyi accompanying me for three days, I would naturally prefer to have the otherworldly Divine Maiden of the Daoist sects as a concubine.

"Having a Daoist Divine Maiden as a concubine—even I never dared imagine such a thing before."

"From today forward, I shall call you 'Yu'er.'"
