Chapter 138: Utterly Ridiculous

"How dare you! How dare you disrespect the Young Master!"

Yun Ran and Ling Yan shouted simultaneously in fury, about to make their move.

But at that moment, a beam of chaotic radiance suddenly shot out—from Su Yun.

*Hum!*

Su Yun extended his hand and caught the strand of hair in his palm. Chaotic power surged forth, instantly annihilating all of Athena's divine power upon it. Then with a squeeze of his hand, he ground the hair to dust.

"Insolent! You dare desecrate the War Goddess's sacred hair! This is blasphemy against the divine!" The Golden Feather Knight bellowed in fury.

"Kneel!"

Su Yun's gaze was cold. His form flickered, appearing directly before the knight as his hand pressed down toward his skull.

In Su Yun's eyes, above the Golden Feather Knight's head, fortune gathered in ten thousand strands—vast as rivers. Clearly, this was another Child of Destiny.

He hadn't encountered a Child of Destiny in quite some time. Naturally, he was delighted at the prospect.

"Su Yun, you're too bold! I am a Divine Son of the War Goddess's lineage! You dare make me kneel?! Are you not afraid of provoking the wrath of the gods, of having the Su family drowned by their fury?!" The Golden Feather Knight roared in rage: "I have merely come on the Goddess's command to invite you to meet outside the city! Yet you show no gentleman's grace whatsoever! I shall take my leave first!"

*Hum... Hum... Hum...*

Above his head, rolling golden radiance erupted. Clouds and mist swirled as a War Divine Court palace manifested, unleashing vast divine might in a display rarely seen in this world. It surged toward Su Yun's descending hand.

That palace was shockingly immense—fully two hundred thousand zhang in size. Its power was vast and boundless.

"You think you can leave? Did I give you permission?"

"Kneel!"

Su Yun's gaze was cold. Above his head, the Mountains and Rivers pocket dimension manifested—vast and boundless, extending into endless void. Its size was beyond measure, yet beneath its mountains, rivers, sun, and moon, grass already grew everywhere, emanating spiritual radiance.

With a *hum*, that spiritual radiance spread onto Su Yun's hand. It directly shattered the War Divine Court, grinding the statue of the War Goddess within the palace into powder.

*Pfft!*

The Golden Feather Knight's pupils contracted sharply. His body shook violently as he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood: "Su Yun, you dare?!"

He hadn't expected Su Yun to be this domineering, showing Mount Olympus no face whatsoever.

He had merely provoked him slightly—tossing the Goddess's token hair strand at Su Yun—yet it had triggered such a transformation.

"In this world, there's nothing I don't dare do."

Su Yun's gaze was cold. Lightning-fast, he kicked out twice, directly shattering the Golden Feather Knight's kneecaps. The knight crumpled and knelt before him. Then Su Yun stepped on his back, pressing him firmly to the ground.

"When dealing with people I dislike, I prefer to have them speak to me while lying on the ground."

Su Yun's detached voice reached the Golden Feather Knight's ears: "Birdman, now you can speak. What does Athena want with me? Where is she now? I want to rip off her bird wings and roast them too."

"Su Yun! Do you have any idea what crime you've committed?! You've violated the War Goddess's dignity! The wrath of the gods will drown the Su family, drown the land of China! The crusades shall come again!"

The Golden Feather Knight lay prone on the ground, struggling to raise his head as he roared: "Kneel at once! Beg forgiveness from this noble Divine Son! Only then can you find salvation!"

"Is that so?"

"The crusades?"

"I'm actually quite curious to see whether this so-called alliance of gods is truly so powerful!"

Su Yun smiled coldly. In an instant, he lashed out with his foot. Chaotic power condensed at his toe into a blade, slicing off both of the Golden Feather Knight's wings.

"Ran'er, have the kitchen roast these wings for me."

"Yes, Young Master!" Yun Ran immediately stepped forward and respectfully carried the pair of wings away.

"Su Yun! Ahhhhh..."

The Golden Feather Knight completely broke down. His eyes bulged nearly to the point of tearing, filled with madness.

What kind of person was this?! He had none of the bearing of a gentleman or knight! Even those devils who followed Satan weren't this domineering and unreasonable!

He had only come on behalf of the Goddess to invite Su Yun to meet outside the city!

"The Chinese world has a saying: 'When two armies clash, you don't kill the messenger.' The War Goddess's lineage and the Su family haven't gone to war. Why did you cut off my wings?" The Golden Feather Knight's voice was filled with endless agony.

Wings were a symbol of noble status in the Western world. They represented transcendence beyond the human race—one step closer to the God Race.

"Ha, you know quite a lot. You even know about 'when two armies clash, you don't kill the messenger.'"

Su Yun laughed: "But I'm in a bad mood. Athena has offended me, and I was just about to go to the Federation to find her. Then you delivered yourself to my door, so I could only vent some of my fury on you first.

Now speak—where is Athena waiting for me? How many people did she bring? I want to rip off her bird wings and roast them too."

"Madman! An unreasonable madman!"

The Golden Feather Knight was truly going insane. From birth to now, having grown up in the West his entire life, he had never encountered such an unreasonably domineering person—without the slightest shred of grace.

"I don't know. Just go outside the city and the Goddess will naturally appear before you. The Goddess has important matters to discuss with you."

"Hurry and release me! None of this has anything to do with me!"

The Golden Feather Knight looked at this great hall as though looking at hell itself.

And Su Yun was an existence more evil than Satan.

No wonder the gods always said that the people of the East were all barbarians—more barbaric than the Ancient Myriad Races. The West must enlighten the Eastern world and spread the light of the Lord across the East.

"Completely useless, yet you want me to let you go?"

Su Yun smiled coldly. A flash of cold light passed through his eyes as he spoke to Dark Lady: "Hang him on the Imperial Capital's city wall. Burn him with hellfire. Let the citizens of our Imperial Capital, the people of China, see just how noble this so-called supreme Western Divine Son is. Let's see whether this Athena shows herself.

Coming to China and putting on airs of the gods before me, wanting me to go outside the city to see her? Utterly ridiculous."
