Chapter 113: Not a Single One Escapes

"Rumble, rumble..."

Divine might rolled as the massive hand covered the sky, encompassing the entire heaven and earth.

This was no longer power that ordinary beings could possess—this was Divine Spirit power that had transcended Azure Star. A single strike could shatter small celestial bodies.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

The Kunlun Mirror shook violently, distorting space and time. The ancient divine weapon's power was terrifyingly extreme, constantly eroding the Barbarian god's palm strike. The sky itself cracked open, as if it would cast the Barbarian god into the endless void of space-time and destroy him utterly.

But ultimately, the gap between Su Yun's strength and a half-step strongest Divine Spirit was simply too vast—several major realms apart. A single ancient divine weapon still couldn't withstand a half-step strongest Divine Spirit's killing blow.

The Kunlun Mirror spun and trembled, showing signs of being knocked aside at any moment.

"If one isn't enough, then here's another."

Su Yun's eyes were indifferent. With a casual wave, a purple-black jade pendant appeared in his hand. With a flick, he channeled fifty thousand zhang of mountains and rivers directly into the God-Devil Pendant.

With a hum, in an instant, fierce winds swept as terrifying shadows rose up in the infinite void, towering figures ten thousand zhang tall, as if from an ancient era. Their terrifying roars echoed from ancient times.

"Another ancient divine weapon!"

Ling Man's pupils contracted sharply, shocked nearly to death, her entire body trembling with horror.

The entire Barbarian Tribe had only two ancient divine weapons, and that was enough to rank them in the top fifty among the ancient myriad races.

Yet Su Yun—a mere Profound Palace Realm cultivator—carried two ancient divine weapons on his person. What kind of concept was this?

And no one would forget that within the Su family, there was yet another extremely terrifying ancient divine weapon: the Chaos Bell.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

Space-time shuddered. The aura released by the God-Devil Pendant was extremely terrifying. The ancient divine-demon roars seemed to summon that supremely brilliant and powerful era.

This space created by the supreme Barbarian weapon finally could not withstand the might of two terrifying ancient divine weapons. It shattered completely.

Su Yun, Ling Man, and the four half-step supreme Divine Spirits appeared directly within the Imperial Capital, exposed before the eyes of the entire city.

"Rumble..."

Terrifying power, two ancient divine weapons, the fearsome presences of four half-step strongest Divine Spirits—the entire Imperial Capital shook and trembled as winds and clouds churned.

At this moment, deep voices rang out from all corners of the Imperial Capital.

"A mere four half-step strongest Divine Spirits dare intrude into the heart of human China? Do you truly think we have no powerhouses?"

"All of you stay!"

"Die!"

One supreme divine presence after another spread across the sky.

In the span of moments, dozens of terrifying divine presences erupted.

And at this moment, from within the Su family compound, wave after wave of extremely terrifying divine might was released—Divine Spirits from the Su family's heritage awakening.

"Protect the Young Master!"

"The Barbarians' target is to capture the Young Master!"

"Ling Man, stay. On behalf of the Su family, I welcome you as our guests."

Su Yun's gaze was indifferent. He quickly waved his hand, putting away the Kunlun Mirror and the God-Devil Pendant. The Patriarch Token and Young Master Token appeared in his hands. Without the supreme Barbarian weapon's barrier, in an instant, supreme divine might spread, connecting directly to the Chaos Bell deep within the Su family compound.

"Clang, clang, clang..."

A magnificent bell shadow tore through the void, appearing in the sky. Mountains and rivers, sun and moon, endless living beings—all were depicted upon it with lifelike detail, releasing boundless might.

This was an ancient divine weapon in the process of continuously awakening. Its power was terrifying to the extreme. Even a true strongest Divine Spirit would have to retreat before it, let alone merely four half-step strongest Divine Spirits.

"Hum!"

The vast bell wave condensed into a ten-thousand-zhang divine peak, crushing the sky, blotting out sun and heaven, and thundered down in suppression.

"Princess, run! We'll hold them off!"

"Drink, drink, drink..."

The four half-step supreme Barbarian gods roared, their eyes filled with blood. Their bodies expanded to nearly sixteen feet tall, like four small mountains standing in place. They charged upward, directly bearing the ten-thousand-zhang divine peak, withstanding the power of the Chaos Bell.

"Crash!"

Space within a thousand miles shuddered and instantly shattered.

"Pfft, pfft..."

The four half-step supreme Barbarian gods' bodies cracked. Terrifying fissures appeared on their robust, powerful frames as Barbarian blood flowed down to the earth like streams.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

And at that moment, from within the Imperial Capital, wave after wave of terrifying Divine Spirit attacks struck toward them, shaking the heavens and drowning out all sight.

"Shadowless."

At that moment, an indifferent voice rang out from within the Su family compound.

A sword shadow flashed across the sky, leaving behind a dense sword mark. Then, one of the half-step supreme Barbarian gods was cut clean through at the waist. Blood flew as his lower body fell directly to the earth.

"Uncle!"

Ling Man roared, her eyes nearly splitting.

"Princess, run! The Spirit Barbarian lineage cannot be without you!" That half-step supreme Barbarian god howled. Even with his lower body severed, he still hadn't died. His blood and qi surged—his vitality was terrifyingly powerful.

With just his upper body standing in the sky, he unleashed the supreme Barbarian weapon, shattering the Divine Spirit attacks that filled the heavens.

The other three Barbarian gods were now coughing blood continuously. Facing the fully awakened Chaos Bell, anyone below the strongest Divine Spirit simply couldn't resist. They couldn't hold on much longer.

And at this moment, more and more terrifying Divine Spirit presences continued to awaken throughout the Imperial Capital.

If not for the invasion of the four half-step supreme Barbarian gods, who would have imagined that the Imperial Capital—where Saints were once considered major figures—contained so many Divine Spirits?

Even more terrifying, from within the Su family compound, an extremely fearsome strongest Divine Spirit presence awakened, transforming into a massive hand that covered sun and moon, directly crushing that half-bodied Barbarian god to death.

"The Imperial Capital is my Su family's territory. Even a Barbarian War God wouldn't dare come here. What makes you think you're worthy?" An indifferent, aged voice echoed through heaven and earth.

"Today, not a single one escapes. Even the Barbarian Princess stays."

"Hum, hum, hum..."

The terrifying presence of the strongest Divine Spirit ran rampant through every corner of the Imperial Capital.

From within the Su family's pocket dimension, more extremely terrifying figures rose, standing in the infinite void. They extended their hands to cover sun and sky—all of them at least Divine Spirit level.

There were even several half-step strongest Divine Spirits among them.

At this moment, every powerhouse and major family in the Imperial Capital was terrified nearly to death. In this fearsome clash, they felt themselves as insignificant as ants.

It was also at this moment that they deeply felt the vast gulf between their so-called major families of the Imperial Capital and a Divine Spirit family like the Su family, passed down for over a thousand years.

Even if they were extraordinarily lucky and produced one supreme prodigy who cultivated to the strongest Divine Spirit level, that would probably only be enough to earn a single approving glance from the Su family.
