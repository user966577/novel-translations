Chapter 159: The Eight-Winged Angel

"She's actually become a true member of the God Race!"

Su Yun's brow furrowed slightly.

So this was what "transforming the acquired into the innate" meant—completely fusing the God Race's bloodline divine mark into Athena's body, freeing her from the God Race's control and brainwashing.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

But just then, the firmament suddenly trembled slightly. Snow-white petals drifted down, accompanied by sacred music, as if celebrating something.

The white petals covered Athena's body.

The next moment, eight snow-white angel wings appeared on Athena's back, flowing with divine light, translucent as crystal. They slowly curled around, enveloping her form.

"An Eight-Winged Angel! Heavens!"

"How is this possible? The God Race's supreme God King is only Six-Winged."

An Ruoyi and True Feather Divine Spirit exclaimed simultaneously, their voices filled with shock.

The God Race used wings to determine bloodline and potential, as well as a system of hierarchy.

Six-Winged Angels were already the strongest of the current God Race—a status only the God Emperor and supreme God King could possess, a symbol of power and nobility.

Eight-Winged Angels existed only in legend.

This meant that Athena, after being refined by the Qiankun Cauldron, had not only become a true member of the God Race but had also surpassed the God King from moments ago, becoming an Eight-Winged Angel that transcended his rank.

"But the God Race bloodline divine mark only contained Six-Winged Angel bloodline. How could it possibly cause Athena to transform into an Eight-Winged Angel?" An Ruoyi murmured to herself, then couldn't help but turn her gaze toward Su Yun.

True Feather Divine Spirit also directed her gaze at Su Yun, her eyes filled with wonder.

Neither of them had forgotten that Su Yun had just spat blood into the Qiankun Cauldron.

"Could it be because I cultivate the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art?" Su Yun's brow furrowed slightly as he murmured internally, already forming a vague hypothesis.

He had cultivated the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art to the point where his body had undergone multiple transformations, his bloodline having long surpassed the Su family's bloodline.

And the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art had been created by the Ancient God of Chaos, Pangu.

In other words, his bloodline was transforming toward Pangu's bloodline. Pangu was the most powerful divine being in Chinese mythology—his bloodline was countless times stronger than the so-called God Race's.

Even at his current level, his blood contained endless wondrous uses, having long surpassed the so-called Six-Winged Angel countless times over.

"I only acted on a whim, never expecting to discover something so remarkable."

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved. He suddenly turned to True Feather Divine Spirit and said: "Yu'er, go into the Qiankun Cauldron and try."

True Feather Divine Spirit was momentarily stunned, not understanding what Su Yun meant. There was no bloodline in her body that needed refining. But she still obeyed Su Yun's command and obediently walked into the Qiankun Cauldron.

She didn't believe An Ruoyi would dare take the opportunity to kill her.

"I want to see if my hypothesis is correct."

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved slightly. He then bit his fingertip and dripped a drop of blood onto True Feather Divine Spirit's brow.

"Ruoyi, refine my blood into Yu'er's body." Su Yun spoke indifferently.

"As you wish, Young Master."

An Ruoyi smiled charmingly. Delighted to see True Feather Divine Spirit become Su Yun's test subject, she even felt a secret satisfaction. She immediately struck the Qiankun Cauldron with her palm.

"True Feather, don't resist. I'll be gentle with you."

"Demoness."

True Feather Divine Spirit naturally understood what An Ruoyi was thinking and gritted her teeth in anger. But because this was Su Yun's order, she naturally didn't dare resist. Besides, a single drop of blood couldn't possibly pose a fatal threat to someone at her level of Strongest Divine Spirit.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

Gradually, the crimson blood was refined by the Qiankun Cauldron and fused into True Feather Divine Spirit's body, becoming one with her blood.

Suddenly, a vast roar erupted from within the Qiankun Cauldron.

*Boom, boom, boom...*

It was as if thousands of horses were galloping and roaring. A faint chaotic essence emanated from True Feather Divine Spirit's body, making her skin even more crystalline and translucent, flawless and perfect. Each inch of her skin seemed to flow with divine light.

And a terrifying Dao essence suddenly emanated from her body.

"She actually broke through!"

An Ruoyi's pupils contracted violently, shocked to the extreme.

At this moment, looking at True Feather Divine Spirit, she actually had the feeling of looking at the Innate Dao Body, Su Yayue.

It was a sense of natural unity with the Dao of heaven and earth, of closeness to the heavens, of comprehending the Dao with double the results from half the effort.

"Her bloodline actually mutated, becoming closer to heaven and earth."

Even Su Yun's indifferent gaze couldn't help but flash with a hint of pleasant surprise. He immediately activated his Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes and discovered that True Feather Divine Spirit's already formidable destiny, having absorbed his blood, was now barely inferior to Ye Ling's at the beginning.

In other words, his blood had caused True Feather Divine Spirit's bloodline to undergo a transformation, dramatically increasing her potential and changing her fate, which naturally elevated her destiny as well.

"It shouldn't just be the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art—it's also the God-Devil Scripture. The God-Devil Scripture is a cultivation method created by Hongjun, which is why it caused such a dramatic transformation in True Feather." Su Yun murmured to himself.

"Yu'er thanks her husband for this great blessing."

At this moment, True Feather Divine Spirit opened her eyes, which were filled with intense joy. Only she, as a Strongest Divine Spirit, truly understood just how enormous a benefit she had received.

Currently on Blue Star, after reaching the Divine Spirit level, one had essentially reached the limit. The rules of heaven and earth became obscure and difficult to understand, and every bit of power gained was extremely arduous.

This was why the gaps between Divine Spirits were as vast as heaven and earth.

Yet now, because the Qiankun Cauldron had refined Su Yun's bloodline into her body, she found that the rules of heaven and earth had become easy to understand. In that short time, she had already made some small breakthroughs.

But even such small breakthroughs were incomparably huge for a Strongest Divine Spirit—something that would normally require decades or even a century to achieve.

"Yu'er, how much of a gap do you feel between yourself and the Buddha Ancestor now?" Su Yun asked indifferently. He could clearly sense that after absorbing his blood, that last trace of resistance True Feather Divine Spirit had harbored toward him in her heart had completely vanished.

"At minimum, I can fight him to a draw. And Yu'er feels she will surpass him very soon."

"Yu'er even feels that perhaps without entering the starry void, she might be able to attempt touching the next realm."

True Feather Divine Spirit's eyes were filled with confidence.

Instantly, An Ruoyi and Su Jian beside them trembled violently, both turning simultaneously to look at Su Yun.

In this moment, even Su Jian's gaze toward Su Yun was filled with burning desire.

"Young Master, Husband—I want some too!" An Ruoyi wrapped herself around Su Yun's shoulder, her gaze seductive, her voice wheedling.
