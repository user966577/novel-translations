Chapter 74: Do You Really Think I Don't Dare Do Anything to You?

Su Jian's gaze was cold as he offered this warning.

With the Patriarch Token in hand, Su Yun was the Su family's supreme authority.

Unless all the Su family's senior figures gathered and reached consensus, or Su Heng returned, anyone who made a move against Su Yun would be committing treason.

"Su Jian, you—a mere branch family member—dare to raise your hand against me!"

Su Hong's eyes had turned red. Then he suddenly glared at Su Yun and growled, "Su Yun, what exactly do you want? Do you really have to tear the Su family apart before you're satisfied?"

"I'm begging you, alright? Please stop!"

The eyes of all the direct-line members had turned red. Their bodies were trembling slightly, as if they had been pushed to the edge of madness.

Even Su Yihui had been stripped of his power.

Even Su Hong's residence had been raided, their fate uncertain.

What about them? Would Su Yun not dare to move against them?

Thinking about this, their eyes turned red. They clenched their fists involuntarily. If it came to it, they would all attack together and fight Su Yun to the death.

As long even one of them escaped the Imperial Capital and spread word of what had happened at Su family headquarters, the Su family forces and vassals below would certainly fall into chaos.

With so many direct-line members, their influence within the Su family was not insignificant.

"All this talk about doing what's best for the Su family?" Su Yun sneered coldly.

At that moment, Dark Lady walked into the hall and knelt on one knee before Su Yun, saying respectfully:

"Young Master, the interrogation is complete."

"Su Hong's son didn't hold out. Before we even used torture, he confessed everything. Here are all the records of their dealings with Xuanyuan Ze over the years."

Dark Lady pointed toward the outside of the hall, where piles of documents had been stacked into small mountains.

These were all records of Su Hong's family's dealings with the Xuanyuan family over the years.

"Grand-Uncle Su Hong, shall we look through these documents together and see whether your family truly has the Su family's best interests at heart, as you claim?" Su Yun said coldly.

Su Hong stared blankly toward the back.

He never imagined his son would be so useless, confessing everything so quickly.

The Chaotic Sky King's daughter, Su Ying, had only been at the Divine Profound realm—a mere woman—yet she had been tortured to death without uttering a single word that could harm Su Lie.

His son hadn't even been tortured before spilling everything.

"Su Yun, why must you push so hard? The Su family has been passed down for over a thousand years. There are many direct-line members at headquarters. When the water is too clear, there are no fish. With such a large family business, how could there possibly be no irregularities?"

"But I, Su Hong, can say with a clear conscience that over all these years, I've served the Su family well. Even if I have no great merit, I've worked hard. My contributions outweigh my faults."

Su Hong's voice was hoarse. Finally, he lowered his proud head. "This time, all of us old folks have fallen into your hands. You've made an example of us. Tell us your true purpose.

"After all, we direct-line members still have some influence throughout the world. If we really fight back..."

"Slap!"

Su Yun laughed loudly, slapped the table, and stood up. His gaze swept over the direct-line members, making their bodies tremble and involuntarily lower their heads. They knew their own records weren't clean either.

"Grand-Uncle Su Hong, now you're being straightforward. Since that's the case, I won't hide it any longer."

"You're all my elders. Blood is thicker than water. I, Su Yun, am not a cold-blooded, heartless person who must exterminate all of you."

"As long as you hand over the power you control, I, Su Yun, promise to provide for you all and let you enjoy your retirement."

"The past is the past—a clean slate!"

"What do you say?"

At these words, all the Su family direct-line members' pupils contracted sharply. Though Su Yun's every word and action had already hinted at this, when Su Yun actually spoke it aloud, their hearts still clenched tightly, nearly suffocating.

"Su Yun, you're asking for the impossible!"

"Right now, while we still have some power, you treat us like this."

"Once we hand everything over, wouldn't you just tear us apart limb from limb and exterminate us all?"

The direct-line elders were going mad, roaring and bellowing.

"No! Absolutely not!"

"You say you're not a cold-blooded, heartless person? That's a joke!"

"Our lineage fought on all fronts for the Su family. Several Divine Spirits died for the cause. Everything we have now was earned with blood!"

"You think you can take it all away so easily? Dream on!"

"Without us direct-line members working diligently, fighting and bleeding, you think your branch can just sit securely in the Patriarch's seat without a care? It's not that simple!"

"If you have the guts, kill us all! Let's see if you can manage the vast Su family!"

"As long even one of us gets out, our subordinates aren't pushovers either!"

The direct-line elders hurled accusations one after another, their eyes bloodshot. How could they be willing to hand over everything they controlled?

This was asking for their lives.

"Is that so?"

Su Yun's eyes flashed with cold light. His robes billowed without wind, killing intent sharp and biting.

He had been pondering why Su Heng had suddenly handed him the Patriarch Token, granting him such enormous power.

But now, he was beginning to understand.

His father's words kept echoing in his mind: as long as the Su family remained united internally, a monolithic bloc, his position in the Federation would be more secure, and his voice would carry more weight.

Su Heng had even said he was going to campaign against the Barbarian Tribe.

The original novel hadn't described Su Heng's campaign against the Barbarian Tribe, since it was written from Ye Ling's perspective as the protagonist and wouldn't cover such matters.

But Su Yun knew a great deal about the Barbarian Tribe.

The Ancient Myriad Tribes were powerful forces that had once nearly driven humanity to extinction.

Among them, the Barbarian Tribe ranked in the top fifty of all powerful races. With supreme Divine Spirits guarding them, they controlled what had once been the most fertile lands of the American continent—rich in resources, dense with spiritual energy.

Even the current Su family was still slightly inferior compared to the Barbarian Tribe.

If they could defeat the Barbarian Tribe, force them to cede territory and pay reparations, or even directly exterminate them, then Su Heng—as the commander-in-chief of this campaign—would directly claim these fertile lands.

The Su family's power would explode.

Clearly, the campaign against the Barbarian Tribe was something Su Heng had pushed through in the Supreme Council. Though Su Yun didn't know the specific details, it must have been extremely difficult.

Su Heng's words were obviously telling him to consolidate the Su family and fully support his campaign against the Barbarian Tribe.

But looking at these Su family direct-line members before him, none of them seemed like they would spare no expense to support Su Heng's campaign against the Barbarian Tribe.

In their eyes, there was only their own self-interest. As for expanding the Su family—that was the Patriarch's branch's business.

The same type of person as Xuanyuan Chong of the Xuanyuan family.

Su Yun was happy to see such people appear in other families.

But he wanted to build an empire. He absolutely could not allow such people to continue wielding power within the Su family headquarters, dragging him down.

To support Su Heng's conquests abroad, the Su family internally must first be unified under a single command.

"Do you really think I don't dare do anything to you?"

Su Yun's eyes flashed with cold light, killing intent surging to the heavens.
