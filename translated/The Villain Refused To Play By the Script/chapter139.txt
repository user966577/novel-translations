Chapter 139: Hung on the Imperial Capital's Walls

"Yes, Young Master."

Dark Lady spoke respectfully, not daring to hesitate for even a moment. She immediately bound the Golden Feather Knight and flew toward the main gate's city wall.

At this moment, even she—the leader of the Shadow Soul Guards—was trembling inside.

Precisely because she worked in intelligence, she knew how powerful the West was. Among the Human Race, the West was a level stronger than the Eastern world. Every crusade in history had ended in China's defeat.

That was why the Golden Feather Knight had dared to be so arrogant inside the Su family.

Yet she hadn't expected Su Yun to treat the Golden Feather Divine Son like this—striking without hesitation.

This was a Divine Son of the War Goddess's lineage!

And the War Goddess ranked among the top ten most powerful goddesses in the Western world. Moreover, Athena had always advocated for another crusade to conquer China.

"Su Yun, I beg you! No! I was wrong! I meant no harm to the Su family!"

The Golden Feather Divine Son's pleading voice echoed continuously from the sky, filled with endless terror.

Being a Divine Son of the War Goddess's lineage, yet hung on China's walls? He might as well just be killed outright.

What face would he have left to return to the Western world?

"Ran'er, go notify Xuanyuan Jian. Have her accompany me to the Azure Federation."

Su Yun spoke indifferently, then strode toward the city gates.

He wanted to see exactly how formidable this so-called War Goddess Athena truly was.

In the original novel, Athena had been supremely arrogant, with an iron will and deep reverence for the God Race. Her strength was also extremely powerful, yet she had suffered defeat after defeat at the protagonist's hands.

It wasn't until Ye Ling had defeated a Supreme Divine Spirit of the God Race that she had finally submitted to him completely, becoming his woman.

But apparently, it was also because of Athena's beauty, combined with the Goddess of Love's influence, that Ye Ling ultimately hadn't chosen to consolidate China's strength and campaign against the West, to lead China in truly unifying the Human Race.

Right up until the end, the Azure Federation had remained intact as an alliance.

"Such a vast Human Race, clearly possessing top-ten strength among the Myriad Races, yet they can't even defeat some minor Pixiu Clan or Barbarian Tribes. The Western divine spirits must bear at least ninety percent of the responsibility. I don't have time to waste arguing with you in the Supreme Council."

Su Yun's gaze was cold, his lips curved in a sneer.

"Ahhhhh..."

As soon as he neared the city gate, he heard an extremely shrill, hoarse scream rising and falling.

Countless citizens of the Imperial Capital—commoners and young people alike—stood at the city gate, gaping upward at the wall in stunned disbelief.

A handsome Western knight was bound in iron chains, hanging from the city wall.

Five black-robed Sky Spirit Realm powerhouses continuously unleashed divine arts, covering him in hellfire and burning him alive.

"Su Yun! I am the Divine Son of the Western War Goddess's lineage! If you dare treat me this way, aren't you afraid the West will launch another crusade against China—rivers of blood, mountains of corpses?!"

The Golden Feather Knight howled in anguish, already completely deranged.

Being watched by countless Chinese ants—the psychological damage far exceeded the physical pain.

The crowd below, hearing these words, was even more horrified and dumbstruck.

"This Westerner is actually a Divine Son of the War Goddess's lineage."

"I've heard the West has Mount Olympus. The War Goddess ranks among the top few most powerful divine spirits there."

"What's more, Mount Olympus has deep connections with the God Race among the Ancient Myriad Races. Apparently, they've always intermarried with the God Race, producing quite a few humans with God Race bloodlines who are born with wings—the celestial bloodline. They're extremely powerful."

"Look—there are two wounds on his back, as if bones were broken off. There are still bits of wing on them."

"Hss! Could he really be one of those legendary celestial-blooded Westerners?!"

"The Su family is too bold. This might really trigger a crusade."

...

"A crusade? I'm actually rather curious!"

Su Yun flew up onto the city wall. His cold gaze looked down at the Divine Son as he smiled faintly: "It seems this Divine Son of the War Goddess's lineage is actually a fraud. Even now, the War Goddess Athena hasn't appeared. You dared use Mount Olympus's name to come to my Su family and try to swindle us? Who gave you the courage?"

"Have his skin flayed. I want to see what color this so-called celestial bloodline is."

Su Yun smiled coldly. His gaze swept across the firmament. His Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes pierced through the void, searching for any trace of Athena.

He had to admit—this War Goddess had an iron will. Even at this point, she could still hold back.

It seemed she knew his methods and didn't dare enter the Imperial Capital to seek him out.

"Su Yun! You're a demon! A spawn of Satan!"

The Golden Feather Knight roared. His eyes suddenly contracted sharply because he saw the five black-robed figures draw knives, seemingly actually intending to flay his skin.

"I've been a Shadow Soul Guard for decades. I've interrogated countless people. But this is my first time flaying the skin of a legendary celestial-blooded being. Don't worry—I'll be very gentle."

The lead black-robed figure laughed, his voice chillingly cold.
