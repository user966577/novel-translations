Chapter 82: My Disciple Is Young and Doesn't Know Better?

At that moment, the sky suddenly dimmed slightly as time and space froze.

True Feather Divine Spirit suddenly sensed a terrifying gaze fixed upon her. If she dared make the slightest move against Su Yun, she would face a thunderous strike.

Within the Su family compound, a figure with a calm expression was watching her.

"Su Jian!"

"You've actually ignited your divine fire."

True Feather Divine Spirit's pupils contracted slightly, her heart shaken.

Su Jian was known as the strongest person beneath Divine Spirits in all of China. Now that he had ignited his divine fire, his strength was at least not much inferior to hers.

Not to mention the Su family headquarters' Eighteen Battalions surrounding them.

At this moment, the Imperial Capital was a dragon's lair and tiger's den.

Never mind her—even if a true strongest Divine Spirit arrived, they would still bleed.

"We're leaving."

Su Yun's gaze was icy as he smiled coldly, having two soldiers restrain the barely breathing Li Yi. Then, holding Su Yayue, he walked toward the Su family gates.

"Master, save me! Save me!"

Watching the Su family gates draw ever closer, Li Yi—barely breathing, his body nearly unrecognizable as human—trembled all over, as if seeing the gates of hell.

Even his master didn't dare forcibly rescue him, making him finally understand just how powerful the Su family truly was.

Su Yun, this Su family Young Master, had absolutely no reverence for the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

His beautiful master, whom he had always relied upon, was nothing compared to Su Yun's background.

Once he was taken into the Su family, his life and death would truly be out of his hands.

He didn't want to die.

He still had a limitless, bright future.

He was so talented, with endless fortunate encounters—how could he die here?

"Master, you raised me with your own hands!"

Li Yi's voice was hoarse, trembling, filled with pleading. "Please save me."

Save him? How?

True Feather Divine Spirit clenched her teeth, her face pale, facing enormous pressure.

She also understood that if her disciple was taken into the Su family like this, he would truly have one foot in the grave.

Her reputation couldn't intimidate this Su family Young Master in the slightest.

But Su Yun was simply too domineering and lawless. The conditions he proposed were completely unacceptable to her, and he gave her not the slightest room for negotiation.

"Young Master Su Yun, wait." True Feather Divine Spirit called out to Su Yun, her voice hoarse.

"Made up your mind?"

Su Yun turned, his devilishly handsome face revealing a wicked smile.

For some reason, looking at Su Yun's nearly perfect face—despite how lawless he was—True Feather Divine Spirit found that she couldn't muster the slightest bit of disgust toward him.

She even found herself involuntarily making excuses for Su Yun's behavior.

The reason he was acting this way was because her disciple Li Yi had offended first. It was understandable.

She knew exactly how beautiful she was. Countless people had designs on her, including powerful Divine Spirits.

Su Yun was so young, with such a powerful background, and youthful vigor. It was completely normal for him to have such thoughts about her.

What was she thinking?

True Feather Divine Spirit's pale face flushed slightly red. She found it somewhat unbelievable that she was making excuses for Su Yun.

Could she actually have taken a liking to this young man?

Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

She didn't know that this was the effect of Su Yun's powerful charm value. Even mountains and rivers would pale before him.

The powerful display of strength from the Su family had affected her psyche, and Su Yun's all-pervasive charm naturally created ripples in her mental state.

"Young Master Su Yun, is there really no room for negotiation?" True Feather Divine Spirit took a deep breath to calm herself. "This condition, I truly cannot..."

"True Feather Divine Spirit, don't be so quick to refuse."

Su Yun's face revealed a wicked smile. "Think carefully about what enormous benefits you'd gain by accompanying me for three days."

"Not only can your beloved disciple safely return, but your Kunlun Daoist Sect can gain a disciple with an Innate Dao Body. Moreover, you can take back the Kunlun Mirror and give those old coots in your sect's reserves a breath of life, letting them live a few hundred years longer.

"What tremendous merit that would be.

"And I guarantee that after just three days, I will never bother you again.

"You should also know my status. As the Su family Young Master, countless women would love to share my bed but never get the chance.

"Three days, and I'll be tired of it. Unless you want to keep following me of your own accord, I won't seek you out again.

"Besides, Daoist sects speak of abandoning the physical body and achieving an indestructible primordial spirit. At your level, do you still care about the flesh?"

At this point, Su Yun paused, his lips curving slightly before continuing, "As for other conditions—do you think with my status, there's anything I can't obtain? What else do you have that could interest me?"

At this moment, Li Yi also spoke up, his voice hoarse and weak, pleading bitterly. "Master, haven't you always taught me to forget the seven emotions and six desires of the mortal world, to transcend worldliness and achieve the supreme Dao?

"If so, why must you be so stubborn?"

There was a hint of resentment in Li Yi's words.

These were the very words his master always used to reject his expressions of love.

Since you've already forgotten the seven emotions and six desires, what's the big deal about accompanying Su Yun for three days to save him, bring back Su Yayue, and borrow the Kunlun Mirror?

Indeed, Li Yi's heart was moved again.

If True Feather Divine Spirit used her body as the price to take Su Yayue as a disciple, then he would become Su Yayue's senior brother.

When the time came, near the water, he'd get the moon first.

At that point, why worry that Su Yayue wouldn't submit to him obediently?

Not to mention, if his master retrieved the Kunlun Mirror, the Kunlun Daoist Sect would definitely receive a huge boost. This would be an enormous achievement.

When that time came, his position as alternate Dao Child might be elevated through his master's influence. The position of the next Kunlun Daoist Sect Master seemed to be beckoning to him.

This was truly a case of finding hope when all seemed lost.

As for his master, whom he had always somewhat admired—he could only reluctantly give her up. Let his master suffer this indignity for now. Once he rose to the peak, he would never abandon his master, and would slay Su Yun for defiling her purity.

Thinking this, Li Yi's eyes were filled with excitement deep down.

And all of this was clearly visible to Su Yun, who was standing right nearby.

Su Yun smiled.

Indeed, this was human nature. Even at death's door, Li Yi was still scheming to get Su Yayue.

If True Feather Divine Spirit's vast destiny weren't so useful to him, and Li Yi weren't a useful chess piece, he would have already slapped Li Yi to death.

"Little Yi, you..."

At this moment, True Feather Divine Spirit's body trembled. She stared in disbelief at her beloved disciple.

She never would have imagined that her most cherished disciple would say such things to survive. It was simply morally bankrupt—even more disgusting to her than Su Yun's behavior.

She couldn't help but recall Li Yi's repeated advances toward her.

And here she had thought her disciple was young and didn't know better.
