Chapter 39: The God-Devil Pendant

At that moment, Yun Ran didn't return to the Heaven-class private room. Instead, she made her way to the "Wasteland"-class room where Ye Ling was staying.

"Miss Liu Ting, my young master learned that your friend cultivates the sword dao and seemed interested in this beast hide scroll. He specifically instructed me to bid on it and bring it over."

After speaking, Yun Ran turned to look at Xuanyuan Jian, gave her a graceful smile, placed the beast hide scroll on the table, and left the room.

At that moment, looking at the beast hide scroll on the table, Xuanyuan Jian fell into silence.

After a long while, she seemed to come to terms with it. She reached out and took the beast hide scroll, accepting Su Yun's kindness.

That's right—she was very interested in the sword technique on this beast hide.

But though she was the second young miss of the Xuanyuan family, she wasn't particularly wealthy. The origin stones she had were all given to Ye Ling to help Liu Ting bid on the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine.

"Jian'er, congratulations. You got what you wanted." Liu Ting smiled and rose to embrace Xuanyuan Jian's arm, appearing happy for her.

But no one could detect the hint of sorrow hidden deep in her eyes.

Even though she had anticipated this and had been the one to inform Su Yun, when it actually happened, her heart still ached.

All of this should have been her privilege.

"Sister Ting, you're not upset that I accepted the scroll?" Xuanyuan Jian's voice held a note of surprise, as if she hadn't expected this reaction.

"Not upset."

Liu Ting shook her head and smiled. "It's over between Su Yun and me. And I brought it on myself. Why would I be upset? If you and Su Yun end up together, Jian'er, I'll wish you both happiness."

"I told you—if you're willing, I could help bring you two together."

"And it seems Su Yun has taken a liking to you."

As she said this, Liu Ting reached out to pinch Xuanyuan Jian's cheek, pouting as she added, "Sometimes, when I look at your perfect face, Jian'er, even I can't help but be moved. I want to take you home and marry you myself. It's only natural Su Yun would be attracted to..."

"Shut up! Enough!"

Ye Ling roared, his expression savage, veins bulging on his face and neck.

He had been utterly devastated.

Not only had he been mocked and dominated in the bidding war—but the beast hide scroll he couldn't obtain for Xuanyuan Jian had been delivered by Su Yun. What did that mean?

A second humiliation, crushing him tenfold?

Liu Ting frowned. "Ye Ling, don't go too far. Su Yun didn't compete with you at all. You lost to Meng Wudao on your own. He only stepped in afterward."

"If not for Su Yun, this beast hide scroll would already be in Meng Wudao's hands."

Xuanyuan Jian's expression was blank. She cast a sidelong glance at Ye Ling, clearly displeased with his attitude. Far too petty.

"Su Yun."

Ye Ling's expression froze, his fury intensifying, but he had nowhere to vent it. His hatred for Su Yun had reached its peak.

After the beast hide scroll, one precious treasure after another appeared—scriptures, techniques, divine abilities—pushing the atmosphere to a fever pitch.

There was even a young cub from the Fox Demon clan, a three-tailed fox demon, put up for auction. Though still young, its seductive aura drove many distinguished figures nearly mad.

After the spiritual qi resurgence, the Fox Demon clan had become one of the great races among the myriad species, renowned across Earth for their enchanting beauty.

Adult fox demons were each devastatingly beautiful, and once properly trained, they made the perfect companions, capable of providing the most exquisite pleasures.

Moreover, fox demons served as excellent cultivation cauldrons, able to assist their partners in cultivation.

The three-tailed fox demon fetched an astronomical price—a full thirty million pounds of origin stones. The entire hall was stunned, and the atmosphere was pushed to its peak.

After bidding on the beast hide scroll, Su Yun made no further moves. These items, though precious, weren't enough to catch his eye.

But Ye Ling watched with burning envy. Many of these treasures and secret arts were exactly what he needed—things that could greatly enhance his combat power. Yet he couldn't act because he had to help Liu Ting bid on the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine.

This filled him with resentment.

Why couldn't these treasures be his?

At that moment, the old man on the auction stage produced half of a black, ancient jade pendant. With a smile, he began his introduction: "Distinguished guests, as we near the end of this auction, this is the second-to-last item.

"Our auction house has invited numerous experts and artifact refiners to examine it, but none could determine what material it's made from.

"Though it possesses no power itself, it's remarkably peculiar—impervious to fire and water. Even our president personally tried to destroy it but couldn't damage it in the slightest.

"We invite everyone to take a look. If anyone's interested, feel free to make a bid."

At that moment, Ye Ling's expression shifted dramatically. A surge of overwhelming excitement flashed through his eyes as he instinctively looked down at the half-jade pendant hanging at his waist.

Indeed, the jade pendant at his waist was identical to the one in the old man's hand—same shape, same color, same design, without the slightest difference.

The only distinction was that Ye Ling's pendant was the left half, while the auctioneer held the right half.

"The other half of the God-Devil Pendant is actually here at the Azure Blue Auction House."

Ye Ling roared inwardly, his eyes turning red. He had to obtain it, no matter what the cost.

No one knew that the reason he had risen from an unremarkable small town was precisely because of this God-Devil Pendant at his waist.

The God-Devil Scripture he cultivated had come from this very pendant.

And ever since obtaining it, his fate seemed to have changed. It was as if he had received heaven's blessing—encountering countless opportunities, escaping every danger and turning disaster into fortune, gaining tremendous benefits each time.

Now, he had actually found the other half of the God-Devil Pendant.

He had to get it.

Ye Ling had always believed the God-Devil Pendant was his greatest fortune, surely a supreme treasure of immense significance—not merely containing the God-Devil Scripture.

After all, the God-Devil Scripture alone was a peerless technique that could carry him all the way to the Divine Spirit realm.

"Su Yun, just you wait. Once I have the complete God-Devil Pendant, no one will be able to stop my rise."

Ye Ling cast a venomous glare toward the Heaven-class private room.

Then he took a deep breath. He knew his origin stones were limited. If he truly engaged in open competition, he couldn't outbid many of the distinguished figures present.

Meng Wudao was the perfect example.

He had to stay calm, keep a low profile, and avoid arousing anyone's suspicion.
