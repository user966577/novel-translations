Chapter 76: The Hundredth Chaos Dragon

Terrifying divine sword shadows swirled through the void. Su Jian's gaze was calm as his figure flickered constantly, using fingers as swords, continuously slashing. Three more Saint heads fell to the ground, the vitality in their bodies completely annihilated by his terrifying sword intent.

In the Imperial Capital, Saint-level powerhouses who could serve as any great family's foundation were like vegetables being chopped in his hands.

In mere moments, seven Saints had fallen.

Among them were Federation Heavenly Kings and powerhouses holding high positions.

Yet Su Yun didn't even blink, showing no emotional fluctuation whatsoever.

"Everything you have was given by the Su family."

"Now I represent the Su family and am taking it all back."

"Five Elemental Divine Battalions, hear my orders! Anyone from their families who dares resist shall be eliminated. Those who willingly cooperate and hand over their power may keep their lives."

Su Yun's cold voice echoed across the entire Su family headquarters.

"We obey!"

The Five Elemental Generals' gazes showed no fluctuation. They were all battle-hardened warriors who had seen mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

These great figures were merely people with slightly higher status in their eyes.

But dead, they were just corpses.

The Five Elemental Battalions, fifty thousand soldiers, poured into the residences of the seven Saints, killing intent surging to the heavens, directly eliminating anyone who dared resist.

In moments, blood painted the sky crimson, and the thick stench of blood pervaded heaven and earth.

Battle cries, screams—rising and falling endlessly, killing intent soaring skyward.

"And what about the rest of you? My patience is limited."

Su Yun's cold gaze swept over the remaining dozen or so Su family direct-line members.

Every single one of them could be called his uncle, aunt, or elder—positions of extreme nobility, figures who once could make the Imperial Capital shake with a single stamp of their feet.

But now, in the next moment, their heads might roll.

The Chaos Bell tolled continuously, as if announcing death.

Ninety-nine Chaos Dragons roared, shaking the sky. Chaos mist rolled and brilliant divine light shone upon Su Yun, making him appear so noble and cold.

"I... am also willing to hand over my power."

"The rear waves of the Yangtze push the front waves forward. Su Yun, I hope you won't push the Su family onto a path of no return."

"I'm old. It's time I retired and enjoyed my twilight years."

"Su Yun, from today on, my entire family will never set foot outside the Su manor. You can send people to monitor us." A female direct-line member smiled bitterly at Su Yun, expressing that she would have no thoughts of resistance.

This was preparation for the future, preventing Su Yun from settling accounts after he truly consolidated power.

If she never took a single step outside the Su manor, surely Su Yun wouldn't still pursue her to the death.

In moments, the remaining dozen or so Su family direct-line members had all submitted.

"Hahaha! I, Su Yun, guarantee that none of you will regret today's decision."

"In the near future, you will feel supreme glory for having Su family blood in your veins."

Su Yun's gaze was cold as he took Xuanyuan Jian's arm and strode out of the great hall, laughing loudly, his black hair dancing wildly.

Meanwhile, the terrifying slaughter continued throughout the Su family headquarters.

In the small dimensional world, Qin Junhua was also continuously issuing orders, having her people take over the affairs that had belonged to the various Su family direct-line members.

With the general direction set, Su Yun left his mother Qin Junhua to handle the details.

He trusted that with Qin Junhua's ruthless methods, she would handle everything cleanly and thoroughly—no need to worry about that.

From this moment on, the entire Su family headquarters had completely fallen under Su Yun's control.

...

In the blink of an eye, it was deep into the night.

In the small dimensional world deep within the Su family, Liu Ting, Xuanyuan Jian, Yun Ran, and Ling Yan's faces were flushed, the rosy glow not yet faded, their bodies clad in thin silk.

The lingering pleasure had not yet dissipated.

Thick incense filled the palace.

At this moment, Su Yun—with his tall figure, well-proportioned muscles, and devilishly handsome face—sat cross-legged on the bed. Chaos light flowed between the lines of his muscles.

Terrifying blood-qi thundered within his body like mountain floods and tsunamis, making all the women look on in shock.

It was hard to imagine that such power could come from someone at the Divine Profound realm.

Su Yun's body glowed, gathering the rolling heaven and earth energy. Ninety-nine Chaos Dragons roared above his head, making the entire massive palace tremble.

"Break!"

Suddenly, Su Yun opened his eyes. Cold divine light flashed in them, and his voice carried terrifying power that directly collapsed the entire great hall.

In that moment, boundless heaven and earth energy converged, actually condensing into another Chaos Dragon above Su Yun's head.

A full hundred Chaos Dragons roared dragon cries above Su Yun's head, shaking the sky, converging into a mysteriously divine energy.

Suddenly, the sky above the Su family headquarters trembled. Rolling dark clouds gathered, thunder crashing. In the next moment, a lightning bolt as thick as a mountain struck down toward Su Yun.

"This is heavenly tribulation!"

Yun Ran's pupils contracted sharply, her voice filled with terror. "Doesn't heavenly tribulation only descend when breaking through to the Saint realm, when transcending the mortal to become extraordinary, and heaven and earth become displeased?"

"The Young Master condensed a hundred Chaos Dragons at the Divine Profound realm. Heaven cannot tolerate this and has sent divine punishment." Liu Ting's voice trembled.

A hundred dragons—something that didn't exist even in ancient myths.

"Perhaps only the true ancient gods could break taboos at the Divine Profound realm and draw heaven and earth's jealousy."

Xuanyuan Jian took a deep breath and let out a cry. The Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul appeared above her head, connecting to the boundless sky, summoning the divine weapon's true form.

Heavenly tribulation was terrifying to the extreme.

This was something only Saint-level powerhouses could withstand. Even the rarest of prodigies only triggered heavenly tribulation at the Heaven Spirit realm. No one had imagined Su Yun would be so heaven-defying as to trigger heaven's jealousy at the mere Divine Profound realm.

The mountain-like heavenly thunder struck down, destroying heaven and earth, shattering the sky. Its aura was terrifying to the extreme.
