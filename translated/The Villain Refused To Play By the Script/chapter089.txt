Chapter 89: My Servant, Kneel

"This is impossible!"

"How can you possibly be this strong?"

Dao Yuan's eyes widened in fury. He re-condensed his ninety-eight dragons, which roared across the sky. Dao essence surged as he unleashed even more terrifying Daoist divine abilities.

"I told you, you're not worthy of fighting me."

"You're too weak!"

Su Yun's gaze was merciless. Terrifying pressure suppressed the sky. The ninety-eight dragons were pressed beneath his feet, unable to move. The Daoist divine abilities were directly dispersed. He backhanded another slap across Dao Yuan's other cheek.

Dao Yuan coughed up blood, frantically retreating to put distance between himself and Su Yun. Identical red handprints appeared on both cheeks, not a hair's breadth different from each other. Even the blood seeping out was exactly the same, demonstrating Su Yun's control over his own power down to the finest detail.

This meant that if Su Yun had wanted to, these two slaps could have directly exploded Dao Yuan's head. He simply didn't consider Dao Yuan worth his attention.

Dao Yuan's eyes bulged, filled with disbelief. Terrifying energy flickered around his body, as if he were on the verge of losing his mind.

This blow was too devastating.

For a moment, he simply couldn't process it.

He understood that he had lost. Indisputably lost.

Continuing to fight would only bring more humiliation.

Su Yun's aura was also at the Divine Profound realm, yet the two of them weren't on the same level at all.

"How is this possible?"

"This can't be! How can this be?"

"Even a prodigy at the Divine Profound extreme with ninety-nine dragon power couldn't possibly have such terrifying strength."

"I once traveled among the myriad races and fought a monster from the God race who had reached the Divine Profound extreme. But his strength was far inferior to yours."

Dao Yuan kept muttering to himself, his eyes bloodshot, simply unwilling to believe—or rather, not knowing how to believe—that he had been defeated so miserably.

He had ninety-eight dragon power, just one step away from the extreme. With his supreme talent and Daoist divine abilities, he could fight anyone at the Divine Profound extreme. He absolutely shouldn't have been crushed like this.

This was also why he had been so arrogant before, even readily wagering his entire life.

Unless the Su family's older generation stepped in, he could at least remain undefeated.

"What just happened?"

At this moment, everyone present—whether Su family powerhouses, Xuanyuan family members, or the various powerhouses who had come from the Imperial Capital's great clans—was completely dazed.

Everything had happened too fast.

The terrifying aura of the Heaven Thunder Tribulation still lingered.

But the sound of those two slaps echoed even more in their ears.

"The Young Master is absurdly strong."

Su Hong swallowed hard. Even this powerhouse who had ignited his divine fire was shocked by this scene.

When he had been at the Divine Profound realm, he had been far inferior to Dao Yuan. Ninety-eight dragon power was practically legendary.

And he knew that Su Yun had reached the Divine Profound extreme—after all, Su Yun had erupted three days ago, and his powerful talent had conquered quite a few of the Su family headquarters' direct-line members, making them willingly submit.

But even at the Divine Profound extreme, crushing Dao Yuan like this was simply monstrous.

At this moment, the numerous direct-line members of the Su family headquarters were all dazed, let alone the various regional governors who had gathered from around the world. They were completely stupefied on the spot.

They had traveled the world and seen countless prodigies, including many from the myriad races.

Yet even among them, Dao Yuan was still one of the most supreme, most powerful.

But even so, he had been given two slaps by the Young Master.

As for the Xuanyuan family and the powerhouses from the Imperial Capital's great clans, their expressions were even more horrified.

This Su family heir seemed to have just turned eighteen not long ago.

Hadn't the rumors said he had only just broken through to the Divine Profound realm recently?

What kind of monster was this?

No wonder he could conquer the entire Su family headquarters' direct line at such a young age, wielding such great power.

This talent, these methods.

Defying heaven!

"No, no, no, I don't believe it! This is absolutely impossible!"

Suddenly, Dao Yuan roared, his eyes completely red. His proud heart made him fundamentally unwilling to believe that he had been so thoroughly crushed, slapped twice in such a dominating manner.

Dao Yuan suddenly looked at Su Yun, growling like a wild beast. "Su Yun, the Divine Profound realm can't possibly have such strong power. Have you broken through to the Profound Palace realm and opened a pocket dimension?

"Or have you borrowed power that doesn't belong to the Divine Profound realm, such as the divine power of the Kunlun Mirror?

"Otherwise, you couldn't possibly have such overwhelming power against me.

"Yes, that's right, it must be like that.

"Su Yun, you cheated. I didn't lose."

Dao Yuan roared continuously, seeking excuses for his nearly shattered dao heart, refusing to admit that anyone could be so much stronger than him at the same realm.

The numerous powerhouses below fell into silence.

They deeply understood that for monsters of this caliber, their hearts were extremely proud and unyielding.

This degree of defeat was far more devastating to him than if a higher-level powerhouse had simply killed him outright.

Because they firmly believed that they were simply born later—given time, they would eventually reach the pinnacle of the world.

"Impossible?"

Su Yun laughed. Cold light suddenly flashed in his eyes. Chaotic power suddenly erupted. Surging vital energy gathered, condensing into a massive vortex in the sky.

One Chaos Dragon after another was condensed into existence, lifelike, dragon might rolling.

As everyone expected, ninety-nine Chaos Dragons were condensed, roaring across the sky. Dragon cries shook the heavens. The terrifying dragon might made people nearly unable to breathe.

The terrifying pressure of the Divine Profound extreme weighed heavily on everyone's hearts.

The numerous Xuanyuan family important figures nearly suffocated. The Su family producing a monster of this caliber was the last thing those loyal to the Xuanyuan family wanted to see.

But just then, surging heaven-and-earth vital energy gathered. Another Chaos Dragon was condensed—its body fully twice the size of the previous Chaos Dragons.

The hundredth Chaos Dragon!

In that instant, the scene fell completely silent.

Deathly silent!

Everyone was utterly shocked, frozen like statues.

Su Yun in the sky seemed to have become the sole existence between heaven and earth, gathering all divine radiance. Noble. Supreme.

The last Chaos Dragon to appear became the center of heaven and earth. Its massive dragon eyes were ice-cold, every scale lifelike, flowing with divine light, giving off a powerful sense of force as it hovered behind Su Yun.

The other ninety-nine Chaos Dragons roared ceaselessly, circling around Su Yun, gathering endless heaven-and-earth vital energy, dragon might rolling.

"One hundred dragon power."

"He's broken through the Divine Profound realm's limit?"

"No wonder he's so powerful."

"I've lost!"

With a spray of blood, Dao Yuan received a devastating blow. His dao heart shattered as he spat out a great mouthful of blood.

But this wasn't over yet!

"Didn't you bet yourself as the stake, saying if you lost you'd serve me as a slave for life?"

"My servant—kneel."

Su Yun's cold voice rang out. Chaotic power rolled. Dragon cries shook the heavens. Terrifying might pressed down on Dao Yuan like a flood, directly draining his face of color and forcing him to his knees before Su Yun.
