Chapter 148: Not Interested in You Right Now

The firmament was shrouded in darkness. Clouds rolled, gales howled, and killing intent pierced the heavens.

Ancient war chariots filled the sky, arranged in mysterious patterns that formed a net stretching across heaven and earth, concentrating a vast and mighty power.

"Such terrifying power. Even a Strongest Divine Spirit caught within would risk falling if careless."

An Ruoyi's complexion was slightly pale. She suddenly doubted whether coming here in person had been the right choice.

Even if she used Su Yun to sever her mortal attachments and achieve Strongest Divine Spirit, once she and Su Yun turned on each other, could she truly escape this net cast by hundreds of thousands of soldiers?

Along the way, she had already sensed no fewer than a dozen terrifying Divine Spirit auras—and there were even two half-step Strongest Divine Spirits among them.

And this was merely the tip of the iceberg she could sense.

The four great Divine Spirit families had controlled China for over a thousand years, commanding endless resources. Their heritage was so vast it filled her heart with shock.

But it was too late to leave now.

Soon, An Ruoyi caught sight of a massive golden palace drawn by nine flood dragons, standing in the firmament. Terrifying majesty rolled forth in waves.

Nine Divine Spirits surrounded and guarded the palace. Over a thousand Heaven Spirit Realm warriors stood watch in every direction. And the aura of the Chaos Bell seeped from cracks in the great hall above.

If Su Yun wished, he could probably kill her instantly.

"Sect Master Ruoyi, please enter. The Young Master awaits you." Yun Ran wore battle armor, her expression impassive as she approached and gestured for An Ruoyi to enter the palace.

"Little Sister Yun Ran, it's been a while. Both your bearing and your strength have grown considerably."

An Ruoyi's face was wreathed in smiles, warm as a spring breeze, yet her heart was shaken.

She had noticed that Yun Ran had already broken through to Saint realm.

The last time they'd met at the Su family, she had seen with her own eyes that Yun Ran was still some distance from Saint realm—years away from any possible breakthrough.

One should know that Yun Ran was only in her twenties, definitely not yet thirty.

A Saint in one's twenties—even in the Celestial Maiden Sect's history, such a thing had never occurred. An Ruoyi herself had been over thirty when she broke through to Saint realm.

And Yun Ran was Su Yun's personal attendant and close confidante, never leaving his side. In other words, Su Yun had helped her break through to Saint realm.

"To actually help someone break through to Saint realm—how did he do it? Saints are regional overlords throughout China, impossible to simply create."

An Ruoyi was inwardly shaken. Su Yun became shrouded in yet another layer of mystery in her eyes. She followed Yun Ran into the palace.

The moment she entered, Yun Ran respectfully withdrew, even closing the palace doors behind her—as if completely unafraid that An Ruoyi might suddenly attack Su Yun in such close quarters.

Just then, an indifferent voice came from ahead:

"Ruoyi, it's been a while. I've truly missed you!"

An Ruoyi looked up and saw a tall figure approaching. The next moment, she was embraced tightly.

Then her lips were covered.

A domineering, fiery, familiar sensation washed over her, instantly causing An Ruoyi to lose herself within it.

The Celestial Maiden Sect's cultivation method was unique. It taught entering the world before leaving it. Once one had severed their mortal attachments through a particular man, one would have almost no ability to resist that person.

Thus, every Celestial Maiden Sect disciple was extremely cautious about choosing whom to sever their attachments with.

After a long while, the fiery sensation on her lips gradually faded. An Ruoyi opened her eyes, her face flushed. A pair of cold, star-like eyes was watching her, lips curved slightly, as if in a smile.

"Young Master Su Yun, did you really summon a million soldiers to surround my Celestial Maiden Sect just to see me?"

An Ruoyi's face was charming, her cheeks flushed, her words coy yet resistant. "If that's truly the case, you can order the army to withdraw now. I'll stay by your side and never leave."

A natural, effortless charm radiated from An Ruoyi, stirring a fierce heat in any man's heart.

This was precisely An Ruoyi's goal in coming.

Though Su Yun was only at Profound Palace Realm—and the stronger the man with whom one severed attachments, the greater the benefit gained during the process of mutual harmony—An Ruoyi didn't want to wait any longer.

She had to break through to Strongest Divine Spirit now, to strengthen her bargaining position with Su Yun.

But just then, Su Yun's gaze remained completely unmoved. A flash of cold light passed through his eyes. He stepped back three paces, sat down in his chair, and watched An Ruoyi's coy, resistant pose with detached coldness. His voice was ice:

"Sect Master Ruoyi, I didn't come here just to taste your sweetness."

"Of course I find you desirable, but the matter at hand isn't resolved yet. You want to use me to sever your mortal attachments and break through to Strongest Divine Spirit? I'm not so blinded by lust that I'd create a powerful enemy for myself."

"Besides, I have a particular temperament: women I've touched must remain under my control. It's always been me who casts women aside—I don't allow anyone to do that to me."

One should know that he cultivated the God-Devil Scripture, created by the Daoist ancestor Hongjun. The Celestial Maiden Scripture was merely an offshoot branch of the Daoist tradition that had taken an unconventional path—naturally, An Ruoyi's seductive charm couldn't affect him much.

"Su Yun, you..."

Hearing Su Yun's words, the flush faded from An Ruoyi's face. A flash of anger passed through her eyes. No man had ever spoken to her like this before, especially when she had come to him of her own accord.

But soon, An Ruoyi's complexion turned slightly pale. The Celestial Maiden method had no effect on Su Yun, and she was a half-step Strongest Divine Spirit—several major realms above Su Yun.

She couldn't fathom what kind of cold, ruthless man Su Yun truly was.

"Then what exactly do you want? Must you destroy my Celestial Maiden Sect? Then why did you summon me here? My Celestial Maiden Sect isn't something you can destroy on a whim."

An Ruoyi's expression turned cold, all charm vanishing as she looked at Su Yun with shame and anger in her eyes.

If Su Yun refused, could she force him?

Setting aside the impossibility of such a thing—even if she could, severing mortal attachments required mutual willingness, harmony between two hearts.

Force would have no effect whatsoever.
