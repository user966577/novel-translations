Chapter 103: Domineering to the End

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's pupils contracted sharply.

The next moment, numerous Kunlun Daoist Sect elders suddenly appeared in the sky.

At the very front, a goddess-like figure with a snow-white veil covering her face stood before them. She wore a white dress, her bearing transcendent, her gaze cold.

It was none other than True Feather Divine Spirit.

"True Feather, have you gone mad?" Seeing this scene, the Kunlun Divine Spirit nearly lost his mind. He thought True Feather had given the order for the elders to reveal themselves.

After all, True Feather Divine Spirit had been promoted to Vice Sect Master, and all of China knew it. With her appearing at the scene, all of China would believe the Kunlun Daoist Sect was helping the Su family deal with the Xuanyuan family.

But at that moment, a calm voice echoed across the sky.

"Disciple Li Yi pays respects to Master."

Li Yi's figure appeared before True Feather Divine Spirit, bowing deeply to her.

"Yi'er, you are now the Dao Child. In terms of status, you're no less than me as Vice Sect Master. There's no need to bow to me." True Feather Divine Spirit smiled slightly, her voice cold.

But deep in her eyes lay extreme coldness.

She already knew that Li Yi had taken the Heart Demon Pill and sworn complete loyalty to Su Yun.

The moment she learned of this, her heart had been filled with cold dread.

After all, the Dao Child's position was second only to the Sect Master's. His authority was substantial—he represented the Kunlun Daoist Sect when abroad.

If the Sect Master fell, he would become the next Sect Master.

Yet Su Yun had gained control of the Kunlun Daoist Sect's Dao Child and taken the Vice Sect Master as his concubine. One could say that if Su Yun wished, nearly half of the Kunlun Daoist Sect was under his control.

In that moment, True Feather felt deep fear toward Su Yun. It also strengthened her determination to rely on Su Yun to claim the position of Kunlun Daoist Sect's Sect Master. She had sacrificed so much for the sect—this was what she deserved.

At this moment, Li Yi straightened and gazed down at the Xuanyuan family with indifferent eyes. "Our Kunlun Daoist Sect is an ally of the Su family. If the Xuanyuan family opposes the Su family, they oppose the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

"The Kunlun Daoist Sect will spare no effort to assist."

In that instant, the entire Imperial Capital fell into suffocating silence, steeped in thick terror.

The Su family had suddenly moved its Eighteen Battalions into the Imperial Capital and surrounded the Xuanyuan family's main compound, as if preparing to strike.

Now even the Kunlun Daoist Sect—a Divine Spirit sect, a reclusive sect—had issued a warning to the Xuanyuan family.

Yet even now, no one knew what had happened.

Why had Su Yun suddenly ordered the Eighteen Battalions to surround the Xuanyuan family's main compound?

Had he gone mad?

No one had forgotten that while the Xuanyuan family had declined, they were still a Divine Spirit family with enormous influence. If it truly came down to a fight to the death, the Su family wouldn't come out unscathed either.

Moreover, the Azure Federation wouldn't easily allow the Su family and Xuanyuan family to go to war.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

At that moment, winds and clouds shifted, divine might surged, and a towering figure emerged from the Xuanyuan family. His gaze was dark as he glanced at True Feather Divine Spirit, then suddenly roared, "Su Yun, you brat! Get out here and explain yourself! Why have you surrounded my Xuanyuan family?

"If you don't explain, even if it means fighting to mutual destruction with your Su family and the Kunlun Daoist Sect, my Xuanyuan family will not back down!"

Then, the next moment, the Xuanyuan family's Patriarch Token appeared in Xuanyuan Ze's hands—a Divine Spirit weapon left behind by the Xuanyuan family's founding ancestor, capable of commanding the Xuanyuan family's nearby armies.

"Xuanyuan family Elite Guard Battalion, enter the city!"

Xuanyuan Ze roared, his voice echoing across the sky. The Patriarch Token erupted with endless golden light.

The next instant, roars thundered from beyond the Imperial Capital as winds and clouds churned.

Everyone understood that the Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard Battalion was about to enter the city.

This was the army the Xuanyuan family stationed around the Imperial Capital to protect their main compound. They were the elite of the elite, the strongest of the strong.

"Is it really going to come to blows?"

"Has Su Yun truly gone mad?"

"Wanting to swallow the Xuanyuan family so easily—how could it be that simple?"

...

Countless powerhouses stood dumbfounded.

The Kunlun Divine Spirit felt cold all over, with only one thought in his mind.

It's over. Completely over.

There was no way to wash this clean now, even if he jumped into the Yellow River.

Even Xuanyuan Ze believed the Kunlun Daoist Sect was joining forces with the Su family against him. No amount of explanation would clear their name.

"Xuanyuan Ze, do you know why?"

At that moment, a cold and emotionless voice echoed across the sky.

The next instant, Su Yun emerged from the void, flanked by Su Jian and Su Hong—two Divine Spirit powerhouses.

He wore a flood dragon robe, vivid and lifelike, as an aura of a ruthless lord naturally emanated from him.

Soon, the Patriarch Token and Young Master Token appeared in Su Yun's hands. His cold voice spread throughout the Imperial Capital: "Eighteen Battalions, hear my command. If the Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard Battalion dares take even one step into the Imperial Capital, kill them on the spot. Leave no one alive."

His voice brimmed with overwhelming dominance, cold to the extreme.

Faintly, it seemed as if the entire Imperial Capital could see a vision of mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

Countless powerhouses felt their hair stand on end, their bodies frozen stiff. They looked at Su Yun with eyes filled with terror.

Madness. This Su family heir had gone completely mad.

He actually intended to go to war with the Xuanyuan family, refusing to yield even an inch.

Once the two great families went to war, the Imperial Capital would be directly devastated. More than half of the millions in the Imperial Capital would likely perish in the crossfire.

"Su Yun's madness is one thing, but what about the direct-line elders and Divine Spirits of the Su family? Why isn't anyone stopping him?"

"Stop him? Who's going to stop him?"

"The two beside Su Yun—one is the Swordless Heavenly King, Councilman Su Heng's strongest subordinate and trusted confidant. The other is Su Hong, the highest-ranking direct-line member of the Su family. Their presence means the entire Su family fully supports Su Yun's decision, even if it means going to war with the Xuanyuan family."

"I've lived over three hundred years, and I've never seen such a crazy young man—actually wanting to go to war with a Divine Spirit family."

...

Countless powerhouses across the Imperial Capital were going mad. Their only regret was that there had been no warning signs before this happened, or they could have evacuated their families from the Imperial Capital beforehand.

"Su Yun, you madman! A complete and utter madman!"

Xuanyuan Ze was also going insane. His eyes were bloodshot as he roared, never imagining that even at this point, Su Yun still refused to yield an inch.

His original intention had been to force Su Yun back, thinking that Su Yun was being too hasty because of his youth.

As long as he pushed back hard, Su Yun would surely not dare to truly fight him to the death.

If he could force Su Yun to retreat, his prestige within the Xuanyuan family would rise, rallying a group of people back to his side.

But Su Yun was even more domineering than him.

Yet Xuanyuan Ze was also keenly aware of one thing: the Xuanyuan family had truly declined—and not by just a little.

The Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard Battalion stationed around the Imperial Capital had already been cut in half over the years. While more than enough to intimidate lesser forces, if they truly clashed with the Su family's Eighteen Battalions, defeat was certain.

Xuanyuan Ze's eyes were bloodshot. He refused to believe Su Yun would actually dare to strike. He growled:

"War it is then! If you don't give me a reason today, even if the Xuanyuan family's main compound is wiped out, the Xuanyuan family's forces across the world will make sure your Su family suffers.

"I'll report this to the Federation's Supreme Council and let the Federation give my Xuanyuan family justice!"
