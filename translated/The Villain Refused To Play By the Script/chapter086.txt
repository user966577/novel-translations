Chapter 86: Silent Bloodshed

In the vast sky, Xuanyuan Chong led the Xuanyuan family's numerous Heavenly Kings and direct-line powerhouses as they emerged from the rift.

The next moment, they bowed in perfect unison, as if they had rehearsed it many times. Under Xuanyuan Chong's lead, they spoke in one voice: "Respectfully welcoming the Young Master."

In that instant, it was as if a thunderbolt had exploded beside the ears of all the important figures and ancient powerhouses of the Imperial Capital, leaving them dizzy and terrified beyond belief.

Xuanyuan Chong—the Vice Patriarch, the Alternate Council Member—was leading almost all of the Xuanyuan family headquarters' direct-line powerhouses to bow in welcome of the Su family's Young Master?

This no longer looked like an engagement ceremony!

It seemed more like the Su family, or rather Su Yun the heir, was using this engagement ceremony to announce something monumental to the world.

An earth-shaking event.

It seemed to be telling everyone that the Xuanyuan family had already submitted to the Su family.

Or rather, that the Su family had already begun absorbing the Xuanyuan family.

"What exactly happened in these three days?" The numerous important figures of the Imperial Capital's great clans were terrified, finally realizing that all their previous speculations were true.

The Imperial Capital, the center of China, was truly about to change.

Once the Su family truly absorbed the Xuanyuan family, the impact on China would be an unprecedented earthquake.

Compared to the terror of the Imperial Capital's various important figures, the Xuanyuan family members had nearly gone mad, their faces iron-green, wishing they could grab weapons and kill these direct-line powerhouses from headquarters.

What the hell were they all doing? Had their brains turned to mush?

Marrying off the alternate heir to the Su family was one thing—they could still endure that.

But doing this in front of everyone, "respectfully welcoming" the Su family's Young Master? Did the Xuanyuan family not want any face anymore? To grovel to this extent?

"Xuanyuan Chong, you might as well just kneel and lick the Su family's boots." One Saint-level powerhouse of the Xuanyuan family couldn't hold back and roared in fury.

In the next instant, a bell tolled, shaking heaven and earth. Terrifying power descended, and that Saint was directly reduced to ashes.

"Courting death—daring to disturb my Xuanyuan family's union ceremony with the Su family." Xuanyuan Chong's voice was cold.

This statement made his position clear.

The Xuanyuan family headquarters would not stand up for this Saint's death.

At this moment, the numerous Xuanyuan family powerhouses all felt their hearts grow cold.

In that instant, they vaguely understood something.

It wasn't just the Su family headquarters that had changed.

The Xuanyuan family headquarters had changed too. Internally, it was the opposite of the Su family—more fractured now, and the faction favoring submission to the Su family, represented by Xuanyuan Chong, had gained the upper hand.

"Two days ago when I was a guest at the Western Gods' Mountain, I heard a rumor that the patriarch's Alternate Council Member position had been stripped. At the time, I didn't believe it." One powerhouse's face was pale as he muttered to himself.

The other Xuanyuan family powerhouses' faces also grew pale.

Xuanyuan Chong had originally been just a Federation Heavenly King, but now he called himself Vice Patriarch and Alternate Council Member. What this meant was self-evident.

What engagement ceremony?

This was clearly the Su family heir laying groundwork for absorbing the Xuanyuan family!

Vaguely, they could sense a pair of cold eyes watching them, observing their every move.

Su Yun wanted to use this engagement ceremony to tell them, these regional governors of the Xuanyuan family: submit and prosper, resist and perish.

The authority in the Xuanyuan family headquarters had already fallen into the hands of Xuanyuan Chong, this Vice Patriarch.

If nothing unexpected happened, the order summoning them to the Imperial Capital this time had also been issued by Xuanyuan Chong.

The reason he had unhesitatingly killed that Xuanyuan family powerhouse just now was to tell them a fact: don't resist.

Resist, and you die.

"What kind of monster has appeared in this generation of the Su family?"

"Where did current Patriarch Xuanyuan Ze and the heir go? Are they dead? Where's the Patriarch Token? Are they just going to watch these traitors sell out the Xuanyuan family?"

"We're just subordinates. The ones who can truly make decisions are at headquarters."

"Whatever headquarters decides, we just follow along." This was the thought of most Xuanyuan family important figures present.

After all, getting involved in struggles between the higher-ups could easily result in complete annihilation.

Self-preservation was the way of wisdom.

The Xuanyuan family's decline seemed irreversible now. Before that happened, clinging tightly to the Su family's leg and building relationships with Su family powerhouses seemed like a good choice.

Even those direct-line members at Xuanyuan family headquarters didn't want to resist—why should they, the workers and vassals below, worry themselves?

And just as the Xuanyuan family's various powerhouses held different thoughts, a laugh echoed across the sky.

"Thank you all for coming to Su Yun's engagement ceremony."

"I'm a bit late. Please forgive me."

The next moment, a young man with devilishly handsome features emerged from the sky.

He wore a black formal suit that perfectly accentuated his tall figure. His handsome face with slightly upswept eyebrows gave off an aura of being at the peak of his power.

In that instant, everyone's eyes lit up. They couldn't help but marvel in their hearts—what a prodigy of this generation. Worthy of being the Su family heir; this bearing had already surpassed all his peers.

Beside Su Yun was Xuanyuan Jian, wearing the Starlight Flowing Radiance Dress. Her perfect face and golden-ratio figure seemed to gather all the essence of heaven and earth.

"Xuanyuan family heir Xuanyuan Jian greets all the elders of the family." Xuanyuan Jian smiled gracefully, making heaven and earth seem brighter.

But at this moment, the numerous Xuanyuan family important figures had no mood to appreciate this worldly beauty.

Because Xuanyuan Jian had called herself the Xuanyuan family "heir," deliberately omitting the word "alternate."

This was clearly at Su Yun's instruction—a final test, forcing them to take a stance.

Immediately, a quick-thinking Xuanyuan family important figure smiled. "Congratulations to the heir on her joyous union with the Su family's Young Master."

Following that, most of the Xuanyuan family important figures voiced their agreement.

The remaining small portion stood in place with iron-green faces, eyes filled with fury, wanting to speak out in rebuke. But the gruesome death from moments ago was still vivid in their minds.

The Chaos Bell still hung overhead.

But asking them to bow was absolutely impossible.

"Haha, everyone who's come—eat well, drink well, enjoy yourselves."

Su Yun laughed, but cold light flashed in his eyes. He turned and glanced at Xuanyuan Chong.

Xuanyuan Chong understood and nodded slightly.

Those who hadn't responded to Xuanyuan Jian would be the targets of his focused attention going forward. First he'd remove them from their important positions one by one, then properly punish them.

It was foreseeable that these people's fates would be very miserable.

Staying loyal to Xuanyuan Ze and not acknowledging Xuanyuan Jian's heir status was opposing him.
