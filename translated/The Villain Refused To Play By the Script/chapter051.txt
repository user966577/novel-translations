Chapter 51: I'll Agree to Any Conditions

"As you command, Young Master."

Joy flickered in Ling Yan's eyes. As a member of a vassal clan attached to the Su family, she had naturally heard about Su Yun's recent actions within the Su family compound—his prestige had surged dramatically.

She immediately understood this was Su Yun rewarding her.

After all, the Ling family had already sided with Su Yun, but as the Su family's heir, he commanded countless factions. The Ling family was merely one insignificant piece among them.

She certainly didn't think that having attended to Su Yun for a few nights alongside Yun Ran gave her any special status.

If Su Yun wished it, women willing to warm his bed could form a line stretching from the Su family's gates all the way beyond the Imperial Capital.

But being able to openly walk through the Su family's gates at Su Yun's side—that was an entirely different matter, one that would bring enormous benefits to the Ling family.

Ling Yan didn't hesitate. With a swift stroke of her blade, she severed Su Meng's head, placed it in a box, and followed Su Yun back to the Su family compound.

...

Before long, Su Yun had originally planned to visit his mother in the small world deep within the Su family compound. But after receiving a message from Yun Ran, he returned to his residence first.

"Su Yun."

Seeing Su Yun return, a woman wearing a bamboo hat and draped entirely in black gauze hurried over. She casually tossed aside the black fabric, revealing a face that, though deathly pale, remained devastatingly beautiful enough to topple nations.

It was none other than Xuanyuan Jian, who had vanished without a trace after her battle with Xuanyuan Li.

"You've come."

Su Yun's voice was flat, his gaze indifferent. He walked past the approaching Xuanyuan Jian and sat in the main seat, legs spread wide, and slowly closed his eyes. Yun Ran immediately stepped forward to massage his shoulders.

Though Su Yun's expression remained calm, he was secretly marveling at Xuanyuan Jian's beauty. Perhaps because of her pallor, she—who usually wore no makeup—had applied light cosmetics this time. Far from looking garish, it gave her a delicate, alluring fragility that made hearts flutter.

In truth, ever since meeting Xuanyuan Jian at the auction, he had anticipated her arrival. What he hadn't expected was how quickly she would come, still bearing severe injuries. She had clearly rushed to the Su family compound the moment she escaped, without stopping to rest.

As expected, after a brief dimming of her eyes, Xuanyuan Jian spoke immediately. "Su Yun, is the proposal you made at the auction still valid?"

"You mean forming an engagement with me?" Su Yun asked, feigning ignorance, not even bothering to open his eyes.

Bitterness flashed in Xuanyuan Jian's eyes. She knew Su Yun would act this way—after all, news of her assassination attempt on Xuanyuan Li had surely reached the Su family.

But when the moment actually arrived and she saw Su Yun's completely changed attitude from before, a hidden pain still throbbed in her heart.

Yet now, Su Yun was the last lifeline she could grasp.

Given Xuanyuan Li's nature, he would certainly seize this opportunity to make a grand spectacle of it, purging her mother and everyone who supported her in a complete bloodbath.

She had no time left.

Xuanyuan Jian took a deep breath, composed herself, and spoke quickly: "Yes, I want to form an engagement with you. I'll agree to all the conditions you proposed before. Playing along is fine too."

After she finished speaking, Su Yun seemed not to hear her at all. He sat there indifferently, eyes closed, enjoying Yun Ran's ministrations, not saying a word.

Xuanyuan Jian's face grew even paler, her gaze tinged with despair. She was beginning to understand Su Yun's attitude.

But for her mother's sake, for the sake of her loved ones, she dared not leave—unless she was willing to watch her family be uprooted and killed one by one by Xuanyuan Li.

If something happened now, her so-called father would certainly not protect her mother.

"Those were the conditions from before."

After a long silence, Su Yun's indifferent voice suddenly rang out. He slowly opened his eyes, his gaze cold and emotionless.

"Xuanyuan Jian, you seem to have forgotten something. I wanted to form an engagement with you because of your extraordinary talent and your high status in the Xuanyuan family."

"But I never imagined you would collude with traitors from my Su family to assassinate Xuanyuan Li."

"The Su family and the Xuanyuan family are both divine families with generations of intermarriage and deep ties. This incident has shaken the entire Su family."

"If I form an engagement with you now, there would be no benefit whatsoever. Do you understand?"

"Surely you don't think you're more important to me than the relationship between the Su family and the Xuanyuan family?"

Su Yun's cold, indifferent words struck Xuanyuan Jian's heart like arrows, piercing it full of holes. Her face grew paler still, bloodless.

"I understand." Bitterness filled Xuanyuan Jian's eyes. Suddenly, she unfastened her robes and let them fall, walking step by step toward Su Yun.

"But Su Yun, right now I truly can't find anyone else to help me. Only you can."

"Please."

"As long as you can help me save my family, I'll agree to any conditions."

Su Yun's gaze remained indifferent, though cold light flickered in the depths of his eyes. He smiled slightly. "Do you truly mean that?"

"I mean it. I can swear a heart-devil oath. As long as you help me, I'm yours right now."

"Ran'er, leave us."

Su Yun waved his hand. Yun Ran understood immediately, leaving the room and carefully closing the door behind her.

"Congratulations, Host. A Daughter of Destiny has submitted to you. Devouring her vast fortune, reward: 2,000 Charm Points." The System's voice echoed in Su Yun's ears, bringing a hint of smile to his indifferent eyes. He beckoned Xuanyuan Jian to come closer.

Everything was proceeding according to his calculations.

After all, Xuanyuan Jian possessed the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul—an ancient divine weapon. She was the only prodigy in the Xuanyuan family capable of connecting with their clan-guarding divine artifact, the Xuanyuan Sword. In the future, she would become one of humanity's most powerful Divine Spirits.

From the moment of his rebirth, Xuanyuan Jian had been one of his primary targets.

Every step of his scheming had been connected to her. Otherwise, he would have killed Ye Ling and Su Meng long ago instead of waiting until now.

And from the moment she entered his residence, his every action had been precisely calculated based on Xuanyuan Jian's mental state.

"Su Yun, please... be gentle with me."

Xuanyuan Jian murmured softly before falling into Su Yun's embrace.

...

Deep within the Su family compound, in the small world, inside the Su family's main hall.

"Brother Ze, though Su Meng's actions have nothing to do with the Su family's main branch, this incident did ultimately originate within my Su family."

Qin Junhua sat in the seat of honor, smiling as she turned to look at a tall middle-aged man seated nearby.

"Rest assured. The Su family and the Xuanyuan family have been intermarried for nearly a thousand years—our blood and bond run deep. I've already ordered our intelligence division to search for Su Meng's whereabouts with full force. We will definitely deliver him into your hands personally, so Li'er can deal with him as he sees fit."

The man had a square-jawed face and wore golden robes. His bearing was noble, and with every breath, two streams of golden energy flowed from his nostrils, rising into the sky and transforming into storms within the small world—a terrifying sight.

This was Xuanyuan Ze, Patriarch of the Xuanyuan family.

The current era's strongest member of the Xuanyuan family. Though he couldn't match the Su family's historical Divine Spirits or rank among China's six supreme Divine Spirits, he had still ignited his divine fire—an extremely terrifying existence.
