Chapter 90: The Kunlun Divine Spirit

Dao Yuan didn't resist much. After all, this had been his own wager.

But as a disciple of the Kunlun Daoist Sect, to kneel before a secular person and become a slave—this blow to his dao heart was even more fatal.

The face of the Kunlun Daoist Sect had been completely lost in his generation.

"Ahhh..."

"I've lost. Lost completely and utterly. Pledging loyalty to a prodigy who broke through the Divine Profound extreme doesn't dishonor me."

Dao Yuan howled at the sky, blood tears streaming down his face.

These words also signified that he was accepting his loss and was willing to pledge loyalty to Su Yun.

This also drew a perfect ending to his pride as a prodigy.

After all, a slave wasn't worthy of the world's respect, nor would he be considered a prodigy. With his dao heart shattered and his pride gone, he was destined never to reach the pinnacle.

At this moment, the system's notification sounded in Su Yun's ears.

"Congratulations, host. For conquering a Child of Destiny, reward: 5,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, host. For conquering the Su family's various important figures and altering the Su family's destiny, reward: 3,000 charm points."

Delight flashed through Su Yun's eyes. This was simply an unexpected windfall. In his mind, he said, "Open system panel."

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit Bloodline

Realm: Divine Profound Realm [100 Dragon Power]

Cultivation Methods: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art, God-Devil Scripture

Weapons: God-Devil Pendant [God-Devil Supreme Treasure], Kunlun Mirror [Ancient Supreme Divine Weapon]

Divine Ability: Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes

Charm Value: 33,000 [Mountains and Rivers Pale] [Cultivation speed increased 31x]

"Hahahaha..."

Seeing that his cultivation speed had directly increased by three times, Su Yun couldn't help but laugh heartily.

This engagement ceremony had originally been intended merely to suppress the Xuanyuan family, laying groundwork for absorbing them, while announcing to the world and demonstrating the Su family's strength and his authority within it.

He never expected to receive such an enormous unexpected windfall.

A dignified Dao Child of one of the three great Daoist sects, a Child of Destiny with heaven-defying destiny, had actually delivered himself to his door and become his servant, bringing him powerful charm points.

If things had developed normally, if Dao Yuan hadn't come to his door, dealing with someone of his Dao Child status would have required considerable effort.

After all, the Kunlun Daoist Sect was a Divine Spirit-level power with deep reserves.

"Dao Yuan, what are you doing? Get up quickly."

Suddenly, a furious roar echoed across the sky.

The next moment, a massive face appeared in the sky above the pocket dimension. Eyes like stars, Dao essence surging, filled with fury, it made all the powerhouses present feel as if they were suffocating.

The terrifying, furious voice was like thunder, nearly bursting their eardrums.

"This is the Kunlun Daoist Sect's Sect Master, the current Kunlun Divine Spirit—a supreme powerhouse with one foot in the strongest Divine Spirit realm."

"He's actually come to the Imperial Capital as well."

The various important figures gasped, their eyes filled with reverence.

This was a supreme powerhouse with one foot in the strongest Divine Spirit realm, second only to China's six strongest Divine Spirits. With a single hand, he could wipe out a great clan. A being who could pluck stars and seize the moon with a wave of his hand.

"Master, your disciple has shamed you, shamed the Kunlun Daoist Sect."

Dao Yuan's voice was hoarse. He lowered his head, not daring to meet the Kunlun Divine Spirit's eyes. "Your disciple took the initiative to challenge the Su family's Young Master, wagering my freedom against him. I lost. From now until the end of my days, I am his servant.

"Your disciple is a sinner, a disgrace. I'm not worthy of being a Kunlun Daoist Sect disciple. Please, Master, find someone else among the sect's many prodigies to cultivate."

His low, hoarse voice, stripped of its former pride and calm, made all the powerhouses present feel a pang of sorrow.

This was a once-in-a-generation prodigy. Given more time, he might very well have broken through to the Divine Profound extreme. Even becoming a strongest Divine Spirit was highly probable. He would have led the Kunlun Daoist Sect back to its peak.

But the world had no "ifs," no medicine for regret.

He had encountered Su Yun—a prodigy countless times more monstrous than himself—and that had sealed his tragic fate.

Or rather, any prodigy born in the same generation as Su Yun was a tragedy, destined to be overshadowed by his brilliant, dazzling radiance, fading into insignificance.

"One hundred dragon power, breaking through the Divine Profound extreme—in all of human history, no predecessor has ever achieved this."

"Perhaps only the legendary ancient divine beings in their youth could have reached this level."

Looking up, one could see those ninety-nine Chaos Dragons circling around a single divine dragon, their roars deafening. The expressions of the various powerhouses were complicated.

The Su family was already powerful, and now they had produced such a monster.

Su Heng was at the peak of his prime. Sheltering Su Yun and giving him enough time to grow was no problem at all. He was practically guaranteed to reach the pinnacle.

This was probably one of the reasons Su Heng had given Su Yun such great power—to give him enough authority to protect himself.

"Dao Yuan, you... you..."

"Why did you have to do this?"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's voice rumbled, filled with heartache, yet he didn't know how to persuade him.

Dao Yuan had been personally cultivated and taken as a disciple by him. He knew all too well just how proud his disciple's heart was.

In truth, he had noticed when Dao Yuan quietly came to the Su family. But he had chosen to overlook it, wanting to let Dao Yuan test Su Yun.

After all, he couldn't bear to let True Feather Divine Spirit go sleep with Su Yun. That was simply too humiliating.

But who could have predicted that Su Yun would be this powerful, beating Dao Yuan until his dao heart was nearly shattered?

The Kunlun Divine Spirit had naturally noticed the hundred Chaos Dragons above Su Yun's head.

This kind of terrifying monster had never appeared in human history.

The Kunlun Divine Spirit looked at Su Yun, his gaze complicated. After a long moment of hesitation, he finally spoke. "Young Master Su Yun, could you please spare my disciple? I would be eternally grateful and will certainly repay you generously in the future.

"He only wanted to save his junior brother. He meant no offense to the Su family."

Dao Yuan had been cultivated by his own hand, with countless resources invested. He had intended for Dao Yuan to revitalize the Kunlun Daoist Sect. How could he be willing to just give him up?

Facing Su Yun, the Kunlun Divine Spirit also lowered his posture considerably, placing Su Yun on equal footing with himself.

After all, this was the Su family. With so many Su family powerhouses present, all following Su Yun's lead and standing behind him, countless powerful auras had locked onto him in the shadows. The moment he dared make any move, he would face a thunderous barrage of attacks.
