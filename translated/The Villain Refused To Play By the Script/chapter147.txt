Chapter 147: An Ruoyi's Plan

"Sect Master, to fight or to make peace—please give the word. Our Celestial Maiden Sect is not incapable of fighting." A Divine Spirit-level elder spoke, her voice filled with killing intent.

"That's right! At worst, we die!"

"Besides, with the Federation Supreme Council meeting about to convene, as long as our Celestial Maiden Sect holds out for this month, there will surely be a turning point."

"Our Celestial Maiden Sect suffers this undeserved calamity. We absolutely cannot submit like this."

"Throughout our Celestial Maiden Sect's history, there has never been an instance of severing mortal attachments with someone from the Demon Race. This is slander!"

The elders spoke up one after another.

They were utterly convinced by An Ruoyi.

And now, hearing the word "Demon Race," a flash of panic passed through Holy Maiden Mingyu's eyes. She immediately lowered her head and said: "Master, our Celestial Maiden Sect has a thousand years of heritage and deep foundations. By relying on the sect's grand formation, blocking the Su family's million-strong army shouldn't be a problem."

"To fight or to make peace."

A hint of bitterness flashed through An Ruoyi's beautiful eyes, a trace of helplessness crossing her detached face.

Was it her decision to make?

What was there to fight with?

A million soldiers could flatten the Celestial Maiden Sect ten times over with ease.

The Celestial Maiden Sect's individual strength was indeed formidable, but a million soldiers arrayed in formation could fell even Divine Spirits.

She wanted to make peace, but up until now, An Ruoyi still couldn't understand why Su Yun wanted to wage war against the Celestial Maiden Sect. What could she offer to make peace?

*Rumble! Rumble!*

Just then, the terrifying sound of war drums suddenly came from the horizon. Black clouds blotted out the sky, countless ancient war chariots filling the firmament, killing intent rolling forth.

Clearly, this was the Su family's army.

*Hum! Hum! Hum!*

From the flanks and rear came more terrifying war drums. Dark clouds obscured the sun, fierce beasts roared continuously, shaking heaven and earth.

At a glance, hundreds of thousands of soldiers stretched out like an ocean, endless and boundless.

Their combined killing intent was enough to chill even Divine Spirits to the bone.

"Kill! Kill! Kill!"

A million soldiers roared in unison, their voices shaking heaven and earth. The hundred-thousand-zhang Celestial Maiden Peak trembled.

"At least fifty Divine Spirit-level powerhouses among them." A Celestial Maiden Sect Divine Spirit elder spoke, her voice trembling.

At this moment, the elders in the great hall were ashen-faced, without a trace of fighting spirit.

A million soldiers, fifty Divine Spirits—how could they possibly fight?

There was no way to fight.

"Reporting to Sect Master, a large number of disciples are fleeing from the main peak, kneeling in surrender." A core disciple entered the hall, her face deathly pale.

"The sect disciples have completely lost their will to fight. In this short time, a third of our ten thousand disciples have already fled."

"Sect Master, we can't let this continue. If we don't act, the Su family won't even need to lift a finger—our Celestial Maiden Sect will have completely lost our ability to fight."

Just then, Holy Maiden Mingyu also spoke, her face pale, her lips trembling: "Master, activate the sect-guarding formation! Summon the Qiankun Cauldron! Let the heritage powerhouses emerge!"

"Otherwise it will be too late!"

"Wait a little longer!"

An Ruoyi's complexion was also somewhat pale, but she forced herself to speak firmly.

She was waiting.

She believed that domineering man must have a purpose for doing this.

If she activated the sect-guarding formation and killed a batch of Su family soldiers, everything would be beyond redemption.

Just then, a cold voice echoed from within the formation: "Is Sect Master An Ruoyi present? The Su family's young master, Su Yun, invites you for a meeting. There are matters to discuss."

The moment this voice rang out, An Ruoyi's eyes immediately brightened. She rose to her feet at once.

"Master, you cannot go!"

But at that moment, Holy Maiden Mingyu's pupils suddenly contracted sharply. She stepped forward to block An Ruoyi and said: "Master, you are the pillar of our sect. If Su Yun tears off his mask and detains you there, the sect won't be able to resist Su Yun's army."

Just then, the elders and peak masters below also spoke up to dissuade her: "Sect Master, Su Yun is ruthless. You absolutely cannot go in person."

"A million soldiers surrounding our sect, and only now does he invite you to meet? Clearly, he has ill intentions."

"Why not let Holy Maiden Mingyu go in your place? She holds the Holy Maiden Token and can represent the Celestial Maiden Sect abroad."

When this suggestion was made, Holy Maiden Mingyu's expression instantly changed dramatically. She understood in her heart that Su Yun's campaign against the Celestial Maiden Sect was because she had severed her mortal attachments with someone from the Demon Race. Now they wanted her to go find Su Yun—wasn't that sending her to her death?

"Su Yun has ill intentions. You want me to go—isn't that sending me to die?"

"Master cannot go, and neither can I. No one can go."

"As long as our Celestial Maiden Sect stands united against the enemy, we can definitely hold off the million-strong army."

Holy Maiden Mingyu spoke rapidly.

At this point, An Ruoyi frowned, fixing her gaze on Mingyu. Something felt wrong—her disciple wasn't normally like this.

"Perhaps it's because the million-strong army has arrived and Mingyu is too nervous."

An Ruoyi thought to herself, then smiled faintly: "No more discussion. I must go personally. If I don't return, Mingyu will take my place as Sect Master. She will activate the Celestial Maiden Sect's heritage and resist the Su family's army."

"This time, I will use Su Yun to completely sever my mortal attachments and achieve Strongest Divine Spirit. Only then will I have the capital to resist the Su family's formation and negotiate with Su Yun."

An Ruoyi smiled brilliantly, her charm displayed in full. After leaving the Sect Master Token behind, she immediately flew toward the Su family's army encampment.

She understood in her heart—without a Strongest Divine Spirit, resisting a million-strong army was simply impossible.
