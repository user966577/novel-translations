Chapter 65: I Wouldn't Mind Helping the Xuanyuan Family Change Patriarchs

The majestic voice contained incomparable dominance and divine energy, causing the faces of all the Xuanyuan family powerhouses present to turn deathly pale. Terror filled their eyes.

After all, though Xuanyuan Ze wasn't among China's strongest Divine Spirits, he was still a powerhouse who had ignited his divine fire—the strongest member of this generation's Xuanyuan family.

And everyone knew that Su Heng was currently far away in the Federation attending a meeting. This face was merely a projection of his supreme divine abilities.

Yet even so, Xuanyuan Ze appeared as fragile as an infant before Su Heng—completely unable to withstand a single blow.

If Su Heng arrived in person, he could probably kill Xuanyuan Ze with a single strike.

The gulf between heaven and earth—the difference left everyone in the Xuanyuan family feeling almost suffocated.

You think you're worthy?

It seemed Xuanyuan Ze truly wasn't worthy.

How could he possibly forcibly detain the son of the current era's strongest Divine Spirit, Su Heng?

In this moment, they truly felt just how vast the gap between the Su family and the Xuanyuan family had become.

Even though both were ancient divine families with long lineages, the difference between having a supreme Divine Spirit and not having one was practically heaven and earth—an insurmountable chasm.

Moreover, the Xuanyuan family had already lost the clan-guarding divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword, while the Su family's Chaos Bell remained intact. Just yesterday, it had displayed its supreme divine might, shaking the entire Imperial Capital.

Su Heng alone was probably worth half the Xuanyuan family.

If they had truly touched a hair on Su Yun's head just now, the Xuanyuan family would really have been doomed by Xuanyuan Ze's hand.

"Councilman Su Heng."

Those Xuanyuan family powerhouses who had sided with Xuanyuan Ze now had deathly pale faces. They felt a terrifying supreme killing intent enveloping them. The slightest movement and they would instantly turn to ash.

"Pff, pff, pff, pff..."

Those ten Xuanyuan family powerhouses who had spoken out against Su Yun suddenly recoiled as if struck by lightning. Terror filled their pupils as they spat blood and collapsed, suffering severe injuries.

This was an extremely terrifying scene.

After all, these were ten Saint-level powerhouses—the Xuanyuan family's reserves.

Even in the Imperial Capital, where powerhouses gathered, a single Saint was among the most elite existences. One Saint could support a great family's prosperity for centuries.

They were existences that could be called reserves.

Yet before Su Heng, Saints were like ants.

Su Yun too felt a slight shock in his heart. Though he had long known that supreme Divine Spirits were the strongest beings currently on Earth, capable of plucking stars and capturing moons with a wave of their hand—

When he actually witnessed this scene, he could still feel that intense, shocking visual impact.

Separated by hundreds of thousands of miles, divine energy manifested. A single word had injured Xuanyuan Ze.

This was no longer something humans could accomplish.

"Su Heng, I am also the Xuanyuan family's patriarch. How dare you humiliate me again and again like this!"

Xuanyuan Ze roared. Being injured by a single word, his expression grew even more savage, murderous aura flooding the sky. "My alternate member seat must have been taken through your machinations—yours and your son Su Yun's!"

"Yes. So what?"

Su Heng's indifferent eyes looked down at him, his voice majestic:

"For the sake of the generations of intermarriage between the Su family and the Xuanyuan family, I'll spare your life this time."

"Competition among peers—I can overlook that. But if you try any more petty tricks, even if you're the Xuanyuan family's patriarch, it will be your time to die."

"I wouldn't mind helping the Xuanyuan family change patriarchs."

Completely unrestrained, utterly unscrupulous—helping the Xuanyuan family change patriarchs. On all of Azure Star, there weren't many people who dared say such words.

This was grinding the Xuanyuan family's face into the dirt.

The Xuanyuan family was an ancient clan that had produced several supreme Divine Spirits, with formidable reserves.

The expressions of many Xuanyuan family powerhouses were ugly beyond measure.

Yet they couldn't deny that Su Heng had the qualifications to say this. Under his leadership, the Su family had reached an unprecedented peak of prosperity.

He could even strip Xuanyuan Ze of his alternate member seat with a single word in the Supreme Council and elevate Xuanyuan Chong—a mere peak Saint—to an alternate member position. One could imagine how mighty Su Heng's power was, blazing like the noonday sun.

At this moment, Su Heng's indifferent gaze passed over Xuanyuan Shen.

The eyes of many Xuanyuan family powerhouses brightened slightly. They thought perhaps, given Xuanyuan Shen's status as Divine Son, Su Heng might show him some regard and restore some face for the Xuanyuan family.

But then Su Heng's gaze simply swept past Xuanyuan Shen, as if he didn't consider this Xuanyuan family founding ancestor's Divine Son worth his attention at all. Instead, he turned his gaze to Su Yun.

One could clearly sense a flash of satisfaction in Su Heng's eyes.

"Swordless Heavenly King Su Jian, Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie pay respects to the Patriarch!" Su Jian and Su Lie didn't dare delay. They had already landed on the ground, kneeling on both knees to show their reverence for Su Heng.

This scene shocked the Xuanyuan family powerhouses even more.

After all, within the Xuanyuan family headquarters, direct-line powerhouses with the Heavenly King title already had the privilege of not bowing to the patriarch.

A powerhouse who had ignited divine fire could even stand as the patriarch's equal, with the right to refuse the patriarch's orders.

Moreover, Su Jian's strength was far above ordinary Divine Spirits who had ignited their divine fire.

Yet even so, Su Jian and Su Lie still bowed to Su Heng. One could hardly imagine how terrifying Su Heng's strength and authority must be.

"Yun'er greets Father." Su Yun bowed slightly.

In the original host's memories, there were very few memories of Su Heng. Because Su Heng's status was too lofty—Su family patriarch, Federation councilman. In an entire year, he wouldn't spend even two days at the Su family headquarters.

Yet even so, Su Heng still maintained his grip on the Su family's control and authority, intimidating all the direct-line powerhouses of the Su family headquarters. One could imagine how formidable his methods were.

In the original story, if not for Qin Junhua's counterproductive actions, Ye Ling could never have helped Su Meng kill Su Heng so easily.

"Yun'er, I'm already aware of everything that's happened in the Imperial Capital. You've done well."

Su Heng's majestic voice carried a hint of coldness: "Those people in the direct line really should be taught a lesson. But I'm about to personally lead troops to campaign against the Barbarian Tribes and cannot return."

"Therefore, I authorize you to act on my behalf, with full authority to handle all Su family affairs. You will command the eighteen battalions of the Su family headquarters. All matters may be handled at your discretion—no need to report."

"Yun'er, remember this: the more stable the Su family internally and the more prosperous its strength, the more solid and secure your father's position and prestige in the Federation will be."

Having spoken, Su Heng swept an indifferent gaze across everyone in the Xuanyuan family. Then the enormous face suddenly vanished from the heavens. Only the lingering vast divine might told everyone that a supreme powerhouse had once visited this place.

A crimson-gold token slowly descended from the sky, landing in Su Yun's hand. Upon it were carved two ancient characters: Su Family.

This was the Patriarch Token representing the supreme authority of the mighty Su family—the most powerful divine artifact left behind by the Su family's founding Divine Spirit. It could command the entire clan.
