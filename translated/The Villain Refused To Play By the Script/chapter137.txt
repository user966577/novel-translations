Chapter 137: Ouyang Feng

Imperial Capital.

Su Family Headquarters.

Deep within the pocket dimension, in the main hall, guards stood in strict formation outside while Su Yun, wearing a warm smile, welcomed a middle-aged man—or perhaps it would be more accurate to say an elderly man approaching old age, yet still standing tall and straight.

Yun Ran, Ling Yan, Liu Ting, and the other women stood at the entrance to greet them.

Seeing Su Yun and the man approach, radiant smiles blossomed across their beautiful faces: "Greetings to the Young Master. Greetings to Patriarch Ouyang."

The man's weathered gaze swept across the women. He smiled faintly and turned to Su Yun: "Su Yun, you're quite lucky with the ladies."

Then he strode into the main hall.

"Uncle Ouyang, please take the seat of honor!" Su Yun smiled, gesturing for Ouyang Feng to take the main seat.

"No need."

Ouyang Feng shook his head and sat directly in a secondary seat.

"Uncle Ouyang, I hear you enjoy tea. Please try this—it's..." Su Yun's face still carried a smile, not minding at all as he took the main seat himself.

But at that moment, Ouyang Feng suddenly interrupted: "Su Yun, there's no need for pleasantries or scheming with me. Though I dislike conflict and have always claimed to be in seclusion, I'm not completely ignorant of what happens in the outside world. I know a thing or two about you, about what you've done, and about recent events. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come seeking you out."

"Then may I ask what brings Uncle Ouyang here?" Su Yun's smile remained calm, but deep in his eyes, a profound light flickered.

In truth, he didn't know much about this Ouyang family—one of China's four great Divine Spirit clans—even though he had read the original novel.

Because the Ouyang family was far too low-key. Ouyang Feng was far too low-key.

Though they were also a founding clan of the Azure Federation with a hereditary council seat, the Ouyang family patriarchs, all Strongest Divine Spirits, rarely attended Supreme Council meetings and seldom participated in any struggles over the distribution of interests.

This time, Ouyang Feng had suddenly emerged from seclusion to speak out on behalf of the Su family. Honestly, it had caught him off guard.

He had come today partly to sound out Ouyang Feng's intentions.

Yet he hadn't expected Ouyang Feng to be so direct, cutting straight to the point.

Still, even with Ouyang Feng laying everything bare, Su Yun's gaze remained calm.

"Su Yun, do you believe that being a Divine Spirit clan necessarily means being driven by self-interest?"

Ouyang Feng's voice was calm. Without waiting for Su Yun's answer, he continued: "If you truly think that, then you're gravely mistaken.

My Ouyang family, from our founding ancestor onward, has always fought for the Human Race.

To this day, my generation continues to do so.

Our ancestor left behind a commandment forbidding us from participating in the Federation's internal struggles. We are to prioritize the interests of the entire Human Race.

That's why my Ouyang family has rarely attended Federation Headquarters meetings throughout history. We won't participate in your conflicts unless the West launches another crusade against China."

As he spoke, Ouyang Feng's weathered gaze shifted, his tone suddenly solemn: "I know your Su family's campaign against the Barbarian Tribes in the Americas is primarily for expanding your own territory and power.

But I will still support your Su family.

Because your Su family is the first to dare point their weapons outward rather than turning them on your own kind.

I've come this time to tell you that I will attend this Federation meeting and support you unconditionally."

Having said his piece, Ouyang Feng rose and strode toward the hall's exit, leaving only his retreating figure for Su Yun. In an instant, he flew out of the Su family's pocket dimension.

"Tell Su Heng—he's finally done something that makes me look at him with a bit of respect. If he goes to the Americas, invite me along." Ouyang Feng's voice echoed from the void.

Long after Ouyang Feng had departed, Su Yun sat in silence, watching the direction he had gone.

"Young Master, this Ouyang family patriarch is rather strange. He's hard to read, and what he says and does is somewhat baffling." Yun Ran's beautiful eyes held confusion as she spoke: "Though the Ouyang family has some business dealings with our Su family, the connection is minimal.

We haven't promised him any benefits, yet he's volunteered to speak out for us, to support us.

He even came to our door to offer goodwill.

Could he be harboring ulterior motives?"

"Are there really people in this world who are so public-spirited?" Liu Ting murmured softly.

Ling Yan also shook her head: "Perhaps? But I've never met one."

"He and I are not the same kind of person." Su Yun spoke evenly.

"I also dislike such people. They can't be controlled."

Su Yun's gaze was cold, flickering with chill light. He hadn't let Ouyang Feng's words sway his thinking in the slightest.

His goal had always been to build a great empire, and it remained so now.

Campaigning against the Barbarian Tribes could bring enormous benefits to the Su family—that was why he spared no effort to support it.

As for how much good it did the Human Race, that wasn't within his considerations.

He never thought of himself as having some noble character.

Even having died once and been reborn, he still believed that if the world truly had heaven and hell, he was the type who belonged in the nineteenth level of hell.

Regarding Ouyang Feng, he felt neither fondness nor dislike. But this time, the man's public support was genuinely helpful to the Su family—that much was fact.

"Duanmu Lei must be pulling his hair out right about now." Su Yun murmured to himself with detached amusement.

"Reporting to the Young Master: a man claiming to have a pair of white wings is requesting an audience." At that moment, Dark Lady suddenly entered the hall to report.

"White wings." Su Yun smiled faintly, his gaze turning cold. So they'd finally come.

Throughout the Human Race, only Westerners could sprout wings.

It seemed that the Xuanyuan family's actions, combined with the Ouyang family's involvement, had made certain people on Mount Olympus unable to sit still.

"Show him in." Su Yun spoke indifferently.

"Yes, Young Master!" Dark Lady withdrew respectfully.

Before long, a man with golden curly hair, dressed in knight's attire, walked into the hall. A pair of white wings sprouted from his back. His handsome face was devoid of emotion. Upon seeing Su Yun, he raised his hand and tossed a strand of golden hair toward him: "I am the Golden Feather Knight, a Divine Son of the War Goddess's lineage. By the Goddess's command, I invite Su Yun, Young Master of the Su family, to meet outside the city."

*Hum!*

The golden strand of hair appeared no different from an ordinary woman's hair. Yet as the man casually tossed it, it suddenly erupted with vast divine radiance. Light as it was, it seemed heavier than ten-thousand-zhang mountains of divinity, crushing space into continuous collapse as it shot toward Su Yun like an arrow.
