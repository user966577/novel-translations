Chapter 114: Suppression

"This is what heritage means—this is true heritage." A heritage Saint from one of the major families smiled bitterly.

Compared to the heritage of a Divine Spirit family like the Su family, their so-called "heritage"...

They truly weren't worthy of using that word.

At that moment, Su Jian's figure appeared beside Su Yun. She dropped to one knee and said:

"Su Jian arrived late to protect the Young Master. Please punish me."

"No matter. I also didn't expect the Barbarians to move so quickly or so boldly—infiltrating the Imperial Capital of China to ambush me. Go help Grandfather and deal with the remaining three half-step supreme Barbarian gods.

"Remember, try to capture them alive if possible. I have great use for them."

Su Yun spoke indifferently, then looked toward Ling Man, who was preparing to take advantage of the chaos. She had produced a spatial Barbarian artifact and was about to flee into the void. He sneered, took a single step, and appeared directly in front of her.

"Princess Ling Man, did you really think you could use spatial power in front of me? Don't you think that's like showing off your axe at Lu Ban's door?"

Su Yun smiled lightly. The Kunlun Mirror appeared in his hand, and faint ripples spread outward. Space within a hundred miles was instantly sealed—even a Divine Spirit couldn't break through quickly.

"Su Yun, I admit I underestimated you."

Despite being in a desperate situation, Ling Man's voice remained bold. Her gaze was bright and piercing as she said: "I had everything calculated perfectly. I even mapped out the escape route. As long as I captured you, I could have escaped human territory within a day at most.

"But I truly never expected you to have two ancient divine weapons on you.

"I must admit, you're a true monster, a prodigy. Not even twenty years old, yet you already possess such bearing, strength, and heritage.

"However..."

At that moment, Ling Man suddenly growled. Her body shot forward, closing in on Su Yun. In an instant, her eyes were barely two inches from his.

It had to be said that while Barbarian women had fiery, bold temperaments completely lacking the delicate beauty of human women—wild as fierce beasts—their figures were absolutely explosive.

This was a natural gift, beyond comparison.

"However, Su Yun, you're too proud and overconfident, daring to come face me alone."

Ling Man growled, her gaze wild, black hair dancing. She pressed close to Su Yun's body, her arms wrapping toward his neck.

She was trying close-quarters combat, using her physical advantage to seize Su Yun directly and prevent him from using the ancient divine weapons.

"Is that so?"

Su Yun smiled indifferently. Within his body, the sound of divine dragon roars suddenly echoed—the tremendous sound of blood and qi circulating as the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art operated.

The Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art cultivated both internal and external.

It was the supreme scripture cultivated by Pangu, the creation god of Chinese mythology.

Legend had it that the creation god Pangu was born from primordial chaos, using the power of chaos to temper his physical body. He was called the Chaos Divine-Demon Body—his flesh immortal and indestructible. One could imagine how powerful his physical form had been.

Su Yun had cultivated the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art for some time now. After reaching the Profound Palace Realm, his body had achieved an extremely terrifying level.

"Bang!"

Accompanied by a deep thud, Ling Man grunted. She felt a wave of intense pain from the arm wrapped around Su Yun, as if the one beside her wasn't a physically weak human, but an ancient primordial dragon.

"You're only at the Profound Palace Realm, and you're human. How can your physical body be this terrifying?"

Ling Man's eyes were filled with shock. With just a slight shake, Su Yun had shattered the bones in her hand.

She was a Barbarian—a race renowned for their powerful physical bodies. Among the ancient myriad races, few could compare to her tribe in physical strength, let alone the naturally weak humans.

"There's much you can't imagine."

Su Yun smiled coldly and growled. His body seemed to emit a dragon's roar as his shoulder rammed forward, directly shattering Ling Man's shoulder bone.

Before she could be sent flying, he grabbed her by the neck and drove his knee viciously upward, slamming into her abdomen.

"Bang!"

"Pfft!"

Ling Man spat blood, her eyes wide with rage. She felt her internal organs shatter from this single blow.

"Barbarian Tattoos—Barbarian God Strike!"

Ling Man gritted her teeth and growled. Dense black patterns spread from her neck, crawling up to her face—pitch black, giving off an eerie and terrifying beauty.

"Stay here obediently!"

"Fuxi Bagua Formation!"

In Su Yun's eyes, two purple bagua formations surfaced. The shadow of Fuxi appeared behind him. He pressed down with his palm, directly suppressing all of Ling Man's techniques. The bagua formations in his eyes condensed into solid form and struck directly into Ling Man's body, sealing away all her Barbarian tattoos.

"Bang!"

In an instant, Ling Man lost all her power. Her tall frame crumpled softly to the ground. Only her eyes remained wide open, filled with disbelief.

This human man was powerful enough to terrify her.

She had only recently broken through to the Heaven Spirit Realm—a full major realm above Su Yun.

Though her initial misjudgment had led to a disadvantage in close combat, she shouldn't have been so utterly powerless against a mere Profound Palace cultivator, unable to land even a single counterattack. Even the Barbarian tattoos she had painstakingly cultivated had been directly sealed.

"You're definitely not human. What race are you? How can your innate battle power be so terrifying?" Ling Man growled.

Perhaps only prodigies from the Divine-Demon Tribe, the Dragon Tribe, or other top-ranked ancient races could be so incredibly powerful.

"Human Chinese," Su Yun said flatly.

"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!" Ling Man shook her head repeatedly, refusing to believe that she—a prodigy of the ancient races—had been suppressed across realms by a human prodigy. Her pride wouldn't let her accept it.

At that moment, Yun Ran appeared at Su Yun's side, a trace of blood at the corner of her mouth. "Young Master, are you alright?"

"I'm fine."

Su Yun's expression was indifferent. He couldn't be bothered to pay further attention to this inexplicably arrogant Barbarian princess. He said to Yun Ran: "Ran'er, personally take this Barbarian woman into custody. Remember—without my command, no one is allowed near her. She's of great use to me."

"By your command, Young Master." Yun Ran replied immediately, looking at Ling Man who was still struggling. A cold gleam flashed in her eyes.

She understood the Young Master's meaning—she was to guard the prisoner while also taming this untamable Barbarian woman.

It was also an opportunity for her to personally take revenge.

"Hum!"

At that moment, the Chaos Bell tolled continuously across the heavens. The ten-thousand-zhang divine peaks trembled as, under the attack of the strongest Divine Spirit from deep within the Su family, the three remaining half-step supreme Barbarian gods were directly suppressed.

"Reporting to the Young Master: all three Barbarian gods have been captured alive. Their powers have been sealed. What are your orders for their disposal?" Su Jian flew over and spoke respectfully.

Deep in her eyes was a flicker of shock.

Each of these three Barbarian gods was immensely powerful—not inferior to her in the slightest. She couldn't imagine how Su Yun had escaped from four Barbarian gods plus a supreme Barbarian weapon.

It seemed almost impossible.

Of course, as a subordinate, Su Jian understood that questions better left unasked should remain unasked. She could only bury her curiosity deep in her heart.
