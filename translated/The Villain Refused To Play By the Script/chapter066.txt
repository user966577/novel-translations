Chapter 66: The Divine Son's Proposal

"Su Yun obeys!" Su Yun's heart trembled slightly, awed by Su Heng's world-swallowing boldness in placing such supreme authority into his hands.

After all, the Su family's Patriarch Token could command the Su family and direct the eighteen battalions of the Su family headquarters.

This was a terrifying force capable of slaughtering Divine Spirits, comparable to an army of millions.

Su Heng had actually entrusted his own back to Su Yun's hands.

He had to admit, Su Yun felt somewhat moved. Qin Junhua and Su Heng, his parents in this life, showered their son with unconditional pampering and devotion.

"Rest assured, I will never disappoint you," Su Yun said in his heart, gripping the Patriarch Token firmly.

Su Heng's projection of supreme divine power vanished, but at this moment, Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li stood frozen in a daze.

Letting Su Yun handle all Su family affairs and control the eighteen battalions of the Su family headquarters—aside from not having a seat on the Supreme Council, how was this any different from being the Su family patriarch?

Xuanyuan Ze asked himself—if he were in Su Heng's position, he could never do this.

The army that suppressed the headquarters was his final trump card, capable of killing even powerhouses who had ignited divine fire. If he gave that to Xuanyuan Li, his son would have the capability to rebel.

Moreover, Su Heng's move clearly told them that Su Yun had full authority to handle matters with the Xuanyuan family—including going to war with them.

This was an open declaration that he would protect Xuanyuan Jian.

Xuanyuan Ze glanced at his trusted direct-line subordinates. They stood silently in place, their earlier aggressive momentum completely gone.

Clearly, Su Heng's appearance and stance had produced immediate results.

Unbidden, a sense of powerlessness suddenly welled up in Xuanyuan Ze's heart.

He understood that though he was still the Xuanyuan family's patriarch, after losing his alternate member seat, his prestige had plummeted dramatically. He simply couldn't command the entire Xuanyuan family to fight the Su family to the death anymore.

Unless the Su family truly intended to openly destroy and annex the Xuanyuan family.

"Father, you can't just let them leave like this."

Xuanyuan Li's expression was savage. Seeing through his father's thoughts, he growled: "Many reserve powerhouses of the Xuanyuan family have emerged. This is the perfect opportunity to pressure the Su family. Once we retreat, even your position will become precarious."

"Please believe me. As long as our Xuanyuan family stands united and shows we're willing to fight, the Su family definitely won't dare push further."

"No matter what, at least keep Xuanyuan Jian here. We can't let her go back to the Su family with Su Yun."

By the end, Xuanyuan Li was nearly roaring, his eyes filled with blood vessels.

Indeed, he had truly felt an enormous threat.

Su Yun truly controlling the entire Su family—the influence he could exert on the Xuanyuan family couldn't begin to compare to when he was merely the Su family heir.

If things continued developing this way, his position as heir was almost certainly doomed.

Xuanyuan Li believed in his own judgment. Su Yun definitely harbored wolfish ambitions and ill intentions toward the Xuanyuan family.

"Li'er, I..." Xuanyuan Ze's voice was stiff. He didn't know how to respond.

He believed Xuanyuan Li's judgment, because Xuanyuan Li had been enormously helpful to him over the years. It was precisely because of the ability Xuanyuan Li had demonstrated that he was so determined to let Xuanyuan Li inherit the patriarch position, believing he could lead the Xuanyuan family back to its peak.

But what good did it do to believe Xuanyuan Li's words now? In such a short time, his control over the Xuanyuan family had already weakened significantly. If he continued being stubborn, forget protecting Xuanyuan Li's position as heir—

Even his own position as patriarch would be in grave danger.

He and Su Heng were prodigies of the same era. He knew Su Heng's character very well—decisive in killing, true to his word. There was nothing he didn't dare do.

Even when his father was still alive, to secure the patriarch position, Su Heng had used his wife to collude with a Divine Spirit of the Pixiu Clan and killed his own elder brother.

He was a ruthless, heartless ambitious figure.

Moreover, since Su Yun's arrival, he had been constantly suppressing him, gradually instilling a sense of fear in his heart.

This was someone even more ruthless and heartless than Su Heng, bolder than the heavens, more vicious and decisive than his mother Qin Junhua.

If they continued pressing, and Su Yun truly went mad—having the Su family spare no cost to fully intervene in Xuanyuan family affairs, or even go to all-out war—then he would become the Xuanyuan family's eternal sinner.

Against the Su family under Qin Junhua's control, he still had a sliver of confidence.

But against Su Yun—this mere youth who had just come of age—Xuanyuan Ze suddenly found himself losing all confidence.

So Xuanyuan Ze didn't know how to respond to Xuanyuan Li. His gaze suddenly dimmed, as if he had aged countless years in an instant.

"Father, believe your son. We absolutely cannot retreat now..." Xuanyuan Li growled.

But just then, a low, aged voice suddenly rang out:

"In my capacity as Divine Son, I propose to the Xuanyuan family's supreme council that Xuanyuan Jian be established as alternate heir."

At these words, the entire hall was shocked.

Divine Son Xuanyuan Shen was actually proposing to establish Xuanyuan Jian as alternate heir.

Wouldn't that mean having two heirs? If Xuanyuan Li died, Xuanyuan Jian would become the heir.

This was unprecedented in Xuanyuan family history.

This was an obvious retreat in the face of Su Yun's dominance and constant pressure.

In this moment, Xuanyuan Chong's eyes brightened slightly. If Xuanyuan Jian could become alternate heir, then could he, as alternate council member, also become alternate patriarch?

Perhaps even go further.

With the Su family's support, it was entirely possible.

This represented enormous benefits.

"The Divine Son weighs the current situation with wisdom and keen insight. I, Xuanyuan Chong, am the first to agree."

Xuanyuan Chong laughed heartily and said: "Xuanyuan Jian possesses the ability to summon our clan-guarding divine weapon. She serves a crucial role for our Xuanyuan family. Furthermore, she is the fiancée of the Su family's heir, our family's long-standing ally. Combining these factors, establishing her as alternate heir is perfectly reasonable. No one can object."

"I also agree!"

"The Divine Son's proposal is brilliant beyond measure. Truly worthy of being the founding ancestor's own son."

"The old ancestor's decisive judgment and firm will—this junior is impressed!"

The many direct-line powerhouses standing on Xuanyuan Chong's side and favoring the Su family all laughed and spoke up.

Establishing Xuanyuan Jian as alternate heir would completely eliminate the risk of war with the Su family. It was killing multiple birds with one stone. Naturally, they all began flattering the Divine Son.

Even if he seemed somewhat incompetent, completely powerless before Su Yun and Su Heng, failing to live up to his identity as the founding ancestor's son—as long as it served their interests, it didn't prevent them from expressing support for Xuanyuan Shen.
