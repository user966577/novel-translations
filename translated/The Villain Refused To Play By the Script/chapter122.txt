Chapter 122: Suicide

But Xuanyuan Ze paid no attention to Xuanyuan Li. Instead, he swept his gaze over the Xuanyuan family direct-line members whose eyes still held cold killing intent toward him. He let out a bitter laugh, then turned to look at the Xuanyuan family's ten great generals, his voice hoarse: "Do you also want me, the patriarch, to end my own life?

"Throughout history, the Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard has unconditionally obeyed the family's orders.

"Now, do you still obey my commands?"

At these words, the ten Xuanyuan family generals remained expressionless, their gazes cold.

Over the years, Xuanyuan Ze had followed Xuanyuan Li's suggestions, continuously cutting the budget of the main branch Elite Guard, affecting their interests. They had long since grown to hate Xuanyuan Ze and his son.

"Patriarch, we only obey the commands of those who hold the Patriarch Token and the Young Master Token."

"However, for the collective interests of the Xuanyuan family, I advise you to end your own life."

"Don't force us to act personally."

"This way, you'll at least have a dignified death."

"Young Master Su Yun has already agreed not to let word of your deeds spread. In the future, you will still be remembered as an ancestor in the Xuanyuan family genealogy."

...

The ten generals spoke one after another, not a single one standing on Xuanyuan Ze's side.

At that moment, a cold gleam flashed in Su Yun's eyes. He stepped forward and said: "Xuanyuan Ze, this Young Master's patience is limited. You've committed such a heinous act that heaven and earth cannot tolerate. If you insist on resisting, this Young Master will have no choice but to report to the Federation.

"But once the Federation intervenes, this Young Master cannot predict what happens next."

At these words, a deep fear flashed through the eyes of all the Xuanyuan family powerhouses, even Xuanyuan Chong.

Reporting to the Federation meant they would all be implicated by Xuanyuan Ze and his son.

"Xuanyuan Ze, why haven't you thanked Young Master Su Yun for his great kindness?" Xuanyuan Chong roared furiously.

"End your life at once!"

"Don't force us to act personally!"

The assembled powerhouses released their killing intent, berating him repeatedly, black hair dancing wildly.

"Xuanyuan Ze, this old ancestor never imagined you would do something so deranged. You've utterly disgraced the Xuanyuan family. End your life immediately." Xuanyuan Shen's grim voice also came from within the rift.

So many Xuanyuan family powerhouses speaking out created an overwhelming pressure that bore down on Xuanyuan Ze, making his face turn deathly pale.

At this moment, he had completely lost hope.

In the entire Xuanyuan family main branch, not a single person understood his painstaking efforts. No one stood on his side.

What chance did such a Xuanyuan family have?

"You..."

"The Xuanyuan family will sooner or later be destroyed by your hands."

"It's just death—what is there to fear?"

"I'll be waiting for you down below."

Xuanyuan Ze's voice was hoarse. Flames suddenly ignited within his body, his flesh beginning to burn.

Divine Spirit fire incinerating the self, flesh dissolving.

Soon, his lower body had dissolved into nothingness.

The assembled Xuanyuan family powerhouses watched this scene with indifferent eyes.

"Father, no!" Xuanyuan Li's eyes filled with terror, but the power of Divine Spirit fire was something he couldn't even approach.

Let alone the fact that self-immolation was something even the strongest Divine Spirit was powerless to stop.

In mere moments—just a few breaths—a patriarch of a Divine Spirit family, Xuanyuan Ze, had completely vanished from the world.

"A patriarch of the dignified Xuanyuan family, a Divine Spirit, an alternate councilman—forced to end his own life." The Kunlun Divine Spirit felt ice running through his veins. Looking at Su Yun, deep fear lurked in the depths of his eyes.

At this moment, even he could foresee that in the near future—perhaps even now—the Xuanyuan family had already fallen under Su Yun's control, just not openly yet.

But would this perhaps one day be the Kunlun Daoist Sect's fate as well?

Would Xuanyuan Ze's end be a preview of his own future?

"No. Absolutely not. My Kunlun Daoist Sect is so far from the Su family. I'm not Xuanyuan Ze."

"If he thinks he can swallow my Kunlun Daoist Sect—dream on."

"The Su family and I are partners. Allies."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit continuously murmured to himself.

At this moment, he just wanted to quickly take the Innate Dao Body and the Kunlun Mirror and leave this place, to get as far away from this devil Su Yun as possible.

"Young Master Su Yun, you have no further need for my Kunlun Daoist Sect here. We shall take our leave first." The Kunlun Divine Spirit—this half-step strongest Divine Spirit—now had a faintly pale complexion.

After receiving Su Yun's agreement, he immediately led the Kunlun Daoist Sect's powerhouses and swiftly departed.

Watching the Kunlun Divine Spirit's retreating figure, Su Yun's gaze was indifferent, a cold gleam flashing in his eyes. He said:

"Su Hong, Yu'er, keep a close eye on him."

Su Hong bowed respectfully. "By your command, Young Master. This subordinate guarantees that Miss Yayue will not suffer even a scratch."

With that, he led his thousand guards and quickly followed the Kunlun Divine Spirit's steps.

Cold gleams flashed repeatedly in Su Yun's eyes as the corner of his mouth curved upward.

If the Kunlun Divine Spirit could be sensible on his own, that would be best.

If he wasn't sensible, then Su Yun would just have to help him become sensible.

"Xuanyuan Li, your father has already ended his life. What are you still hesitating for?" Xuanyuan Chong's cold voice rang out.

"End your life at once!"

"Do you need us to do it for you?"

"And all you traitors to the Xuanyuan family, all you disgraces—end your lives at once! Not a single word of today's events can leak out!"

...

The assembled Xuanyuan family powerhouses' eyes flashed with killing intent. They didn't even want to spare Xuanyuan Ze's many confidants.

Leaving them alive posed too great a threat.

They didn't care that these people were all elite powerhouses of the Xuanyuan family.

All they knew was that these people's continued existence was a massive threat.

"Patriarch!"

At this moment, the faces of the assembled powerhouses turned deathly pale, their eyes filled with confusion and despair.

What should they do now?

The patriarch had already ended his life.

"In my capacity as Vice Patriarch of the Xuanyuan family, holding the Patriarch Token, I command all of you to end your lives!" The Patriarch Token appeared in Xuanyuan Chong's hand, his expression indifferent.

"Patriarch, I'm coming to join you." The two Divine Spirit-level elders let out a growl as Divine Spirit flames ignited on their bodies.

Even the patriarch was dead. What point was there in continuing to resist?

"Splurt, splurt, splurt..."

All around, the assembled powerhouses ended their own lives one after another. Blood rained down everywhere.

The Xuanyuan family powerhouses watched this scene with indifferent expressions.

But at that moment, Xuanyuan Li's furious roar suddenly echoed across the heavens.

"Su Yun, I'll kill you!"

"Die with me!"

"Hum, hum, hum..."

Xuanyuan Li's body suddenly flashed with golden light. He instantly appeared at Su Yun's side, his eyes filled with bloodshot veins, an extremely terrifying aura emanating from his body. Every vein in his body swelled and filled with blood.

This was the prelude to self-detonation.

Father was dead. Those confidants wouldn't follow his commands anymore.

Xuanyuan Li had completely fallen into despair.

At this point, his only option was to take Su Yun down with him.

All of this came without any warning.

No one had expected that Xuanyuan Li, who had been saying he wanted to fight his way out, would suddenly choose to self-detonate. Moreover, no one knew what strange technique he had used to suddenly appear at Su Yun's side.
