Chapter 136: Athena's Killing Intent

Northern China. Endless desert stretched in all directions, with scattered oases dotting the wasteland like stars.

Terrifying desert beasts would occasionally let out roar after roar, triggering sandstorms that sent dust clouds rolling across the sky.

The desert was incredibly dangerous. Even Sky Spirit Realm powerhouses could perish there if they weren't careful.

And the headquarters of the Duanmu family—one of China's four most powerful Divine Spirit clans—stood right at the center of this desert.

Looking out, one could see an endless expanse of palace complexes, vast beyond measure.

The palaces were built from sand, seemingly reinforced by some mysterious power. They had endured over a thousand years without crumbling, with even the shortest standing over three hundred feet tall.

This was the headquarters of the Duanmu family, rulers of nine great provinces of China.

Each province was far larger and more prosperous than the Qin family's domain.

At that moment, within a massive palace five hundred meters tall at the center of the sand palace complex, Duanmu Lei sat expressionless, facing a woman whose entire body was shrouded in divine radiance. Only her flowing golden hair was visible.

"Athena, word has come from the Imperial Capital. That Su family heir Su Yun is personally going to Federation Headquarters to convene the Supreme Council."

Athena was silent for a moment. Only her cold, emotionless eyes were faintly visible. After a long while, she spoke slowly: "A child not even twenty years old—does he think he's qualified to sit at the same table as us?"

"I've already notified the divine spirits of Mount Olympus and the Eight-Headed Serpent God of the island nation across the sea. This time, none of them will support the resolution to aid Su Heng."

"Now, as long as Patriarch Duanmu supports us, and the Ouyang family of southern China doesn't voice an opinion, everything will be settled."

"After this, Mount Olympus will formally establish a cooperative relationship with Patriarch Duanmu to help you unify all of China."

"Athena, you understand what I want isn't just a confirmed partnership—I want something more substantial."

At this, Duanmu Lei's cold, domineering gaze swept over Athena's face and figure through the divine radiance, a hint of heat flickering in his eyes.

"Once Su Heng dies in the Americas, I will satisfy your request." Athena's voice was icy, like a machine without the slightest emotion.

"This time, Su Heng absolutely cannot return."

Duanmu Lei laughed heartily. Suddenly, he reached out to grab Athena: "The outcome is already decided. Why waste time?

I, Patriarch Duanmu, cultivate combat power, and you are the Goddess of War. We're naturally complementary. If we join together, perhaps we can break through Blue Star's limits and achieve Strongest Divine Spirit.

In China, we have a saying: time is gold.

Let's not waste any more."

A flash of veiled disgust passed through Athena's cold divine eyes. She was about to speak when an anxious voice suddenly reached the great hall: "Reporting to the Patriarch! Something major has happened!"

A flash of fury passed through Duanmu Lei's eyes. He growled: "What is it?"

"The Xuanyuan family's branches and forces across the world have simultaneously cut off all contact with our Duanmu family. They seem to be preparing for war against us—frantically mobilizing troops and generals."

"Several Divine Spirits have already clashed with our clan's Divine Spirits in India, with casualties on both sides."

"The branches worldwide have fallen into chaos."

"The current Xuanyuan family heir—Xuanyuan Jian, Su Yun's fiancée—has recalled the Xuanyuan family's Ancient Divine Weapon. She's gained the support of many Divine Spirits in their heritage and is about to ascend to the position of Xuanyuan family patriarch."

"Please make a decision quickly on how to respond, Patriarch."

In an instant, Duanmu Lei and Athena shot to their feet simultaneously, their pupils contracting as they exchanged glances.

This was bad!

"At such a critical moment, the Xuanyuan family's divine weapon has returned."

Duanmu Lei snarled, clenching his fists: "It must be the Su family's doing. Have they gone mad? The Xuanyuan family is also one of the Federation's founding clans. With their Ancient Divine Weapon returned, they'll automatically inherit a council seat.

The Su family has shared the Imperial Capital with the Xuanyuan family for over a thousand years. After the Xuanyuan family's Ancient Divine Weapon was lost, the Su family spent centuries bullying them. Aren't they afraid the Xuanyuan family will turn against them?

And the Xuanyuan family has gone mad too! Their Ancient Divine Weapon has returned, but instead of going after the Su family, they're picking a fight with my Duanmu family!

Do they really think my Duanmu family is afraid of them?"

Duanmu Lei's face twisted unpleasantly, with blood veins faintly spreading in his eyes.

The Xuanyuan family was still a great Divine Spirit clan with incredibly deep foundations. Before, it was only because they lacked a Strongest Divine Spirit and an Ancient Divine Weapon that they were the weakest among the four great clans.

But if they truly went to war, the Duanmu family would suffer massive losses too.

If this had happened before, it wouldn't have mattered. But right now, the Duanmu family had already openly fallen out with the Su family. In the Supreme Council, they'd been constantly obstructing support for the Su family.

Just then, that anxious voice rang out again:

"Reporting to the Patriarch! Word has come from the Ouyang family. They will support the Su family's campaign in the Americas, calling it the glory of China, the glory of the Human Race. Whoever dares obstruct them is a traitor to humanity."

"The Ouyang family patriarch, Ouyang Feng, has also declared that he will attend this Supreme Council session."

*Boom!*

Duanmu Lei's expression froze. Then he erupted in fury: "That old bastard Ouyang Feng! He's been in seclusion for so many years—what business does he have stirring up trouble now!"

"Is he deliberately opposing my Duanmu family?!"

Duanmu Lei's expression was ugly to the extreme.

At that moment, the anxious voice from outside sounded once more: "Reporting to the Patriarch! Inside information has come from the Xuanyuan family in the Imperial Capital. Xuanyuan Jian declared at the family's supreme council that the Duanmu family has bullied the Xuanyuan family for years. Now that their Ancient Divine Weapon has returned, they must make a statement—they must fight the Duanmu family.

The Su family's Young Master has returned to the Imperial Capital and publicly visited the Xuanyuan family headquarters, declaring that Xuanyuan Jian is his fiancée. Whatever reckless decision she makes, the Su family will unconditionally support her.

The situation is urgent. Please make a decision quickly, Patriarch. The clan's direct descendants are going crazy and are outside the great hall requesting an audience."

"These lunatics! What the hell!"

Duanmu Lei exploded with profanity, no longer having any mood for intimacy with Athena. He shot to his feet and paced back and forth.

He couldn't wrap his head around how the situation had taken such a complete one-eighty.

The Xuanyuan family was willing to pay any price to fight him to the death, wanting to use him to make a statement.

If it had been the Su family doing this, fine.

"Have the brains of everyone inside the Xuanyuan family been eaten by dogs?" Duanmu Lei snarled.

"This is the perfect chance to deal with the Su family, yet they choose to come after my Duanmu family instead!"

"And that old immortal Ouyang Feng is pig-headed too—going against me for the sake of so-called 'glory of China.' Does he not realize that once the Su family conquers the Americas, they'll become China's most powerful clan, standing above the Ouyang family? Can't he figure out something that simple?!"

Duanmu Lei cursed continuously. After half a moment, he forced himself to calm down. He turned to Athena with a strained smile: "Goddess Athena, circumstances have changed. I must immediately convene the family's supreme council. Please wait here for a moment."

With that, he immediately turned and flew out of the great hall, vanishing from Athena's sight.

"Another fool."

Athena murmured to herself. Suddenly, her eyes blazed with brilliant golden light. She raised her head to gaze toward the Imperial Capital, killing intent flashing through her eyes: "The God Race has decreed that the Americas are God Race territory. How can we allow some minor Chinese clan to invade?"

"Su Yun, you truly have a death wish!"

With that, Athena's form flickered as she stepped into space, heading directly toward the Imperial Capital.
