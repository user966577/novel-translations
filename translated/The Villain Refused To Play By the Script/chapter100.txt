Chapter 100: Ten-Thousand-Zhang Mountains and Rivers

In an instant, Su Yun saw the World Tree Fruit erupt with intense divine light, directly pulling his consciousness into the fruit. He appeared in a chaotic space, surrounded by endless darkness.

"Is this asking me to personally open my Profound Palace within the World Tree Fruit?"

Su Yun muttered to himself, then his gaze turned cold. Surging vital energy condensed into physical form in his hands, transforming into a giant axe.

His Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes activated, divine light piercing through the dark chaotic world like two stars hanging in the void.

His Fuxi Martial Soul manifested, appearing behind him—a thousand zhang tall, its gaze emotionless. The Eight Trigrams formation diagram rotated behind it, purple light spreading, a giant axe also appearing in its hands.

"Ha!"

Su Yun roared. A hundred Chaos Dragons materialized, their roars echoing as they dispersed the chaotic mist. Then he raised the giant axe and cleaved downward.

The Fuxi Martial Soul likewise raised its axe and struck.

A terrifying storm swept forth. The chaotic world shattered. Endless vital energy flooded in from outside, filling the void he had carved out.

The next moment, a strange set of laws appeared and swirled, filling the blank space.

Su Yun bellowed, continuously swinging the giant axe, cleaving apart the chaotic space. His consciousness became completely immersed within the World Tree Fruit.

He could feel that with each sliver of the World Tree Fruit's interior that he split open, his strength surged immeasurably.

Meanwhile, in the outside world, a hundred Chaos Dragons roared continuously. Dense green light enveloped Su Yun's body as endless heaven and earth vital energy gathered from throughout the pocket dimension, flooding Su Yun's villa completely.

The powerful formation runes inscribed on the villa were directly worn away by the surging liquid vital energy.

In an instant, Su Yun's villa seemed to have become a lake formed from vital energy—a sight that made one's hair stand on end, terrifying beyond measure.

This scene immediately attracted the attention of all the Su family powerhouses within the pocket dimension.

When they saw Su Yun's form within the vital energy lake, they were dumbstruck. With their level of strength, how could they not recognize that Su Yun was opening his Profound Palace?

"He's opening his Profound Palace already?"

"How long has it been since Su Yun broke through to Divine Profound? Not even a month."

"Though the Qi-Blood Realm takes the most time, and true prodigies will break through quickly after Divine Profound, reaching Divine Profound extreme and breaking through to Profound Palace in a single month—this can't even be described as monstrous anymore."

"This isn't just Divine Profound extreme—this is a hundred dragons. He's broken through the limit."

"In the Profound Palace Realm, opening a Profound Palace—the smallest palace is one zhang, and the largest palace was created by the Buddhist Ancestor, a Divine Spirit who reached a full nine hundred seven thousand six hundred zhang."

"Legend has it that when the Buddhist Ancestor first stepped into the Profound Palace Realm, he opened a ten-thousand-zhang Buddhist palace. Buddha light illuminated thirty thousand miles of sky, shaking the entire world."

"I wonder if the Young Master can break that record when he breaks through."

...

All the Su family important figures were shocked beyond measure. In all their years, they had never seen such a monster.

"Qin Junhua and Qin Ying have returned to the Qin family. The patriarch isn't here either. We should go protect him."

"With the Young Master's talent, why would our Su family worry about not prospering?"

Soon, wave after wave of terrifying divine might descended, sealing off the area around Su Yun's villa. Divine Spirit wills gathered upon Su Yun, blessing him.

They were also preventing any accidents.

A hundred Chaos Dragons opening a Profound Palace—this had never happened since the resurgence of spiritual energy.

Terrifying rumbling sounds emerged from within Su Yun's body. Waves crashed against the heavens, constantly shattering the sky.

"The Young Master's talent is terrifying!"

Yun Ran's eyes were filled with admiration. Without hesitation, she immediately sat down cross-legged.

The Young Master's strength was increasing too quickly. She had to rapidly improve her own power.

With vital energy this dense, plus the heavenly laws that would be drawn in during the opening of a Profound Palace—given the Young Master's talent, the effect would definitely be tremendous. This was her best chance to break through to the Saint realm.

Xuanyuan Jian, Liu Ting, and Ling Yan didn't hesitate either. They immediately focused their minds and sat down to cultivate.

This was an enormous opportunity.

Only True Feather Divine Spirit stood dazed in place, vital energy swirling around her, her red dress billowing. Her heart was filled with nothing but shock.

These three days had given her a profound appreciation of Su Yun's powerful body.

She was a half-step strongest Divine Spirit powerhouse. Her yin energy was enormous—enough to make even a Heaven Spirit Realm cultivator explode.

Yet Su Yun had absorbed all the yin energy from her body in just three days.

"Su Yun."

True Feather Divine Spirit's heart was filled only with shock.

Of course, the dense vital energy was useless to someone of her level. What she needed was a moment of enlightenment brought by the heavenly laws.

A single moment of enlightenment was worth a hundred years of bitter cultivation.

At this moment, for some reason, she found Su Yun's face—already brimming with powerful charm—even more attractive.

Hatred for the Kunlun Daoist Sect still lingered in her heart.

But toward Su Yun, she found she couldn't muster even the slightest resentment. In these three days, Su Yun had already left an indelible impression in her heart.

"So be it. Since I'm here, I might as well make peace with it. From today forward, I am Yu'er—Su Yun's concubine."

True Feather Divine Spirit said to herself.

At this moment, she completely accepted her identity as Su Yun's concubine.

After all, given Su Yun's status, background, and this formidable talent, reaching the strongest Divine Spirit level was merely a matter of time.

Becoming Su Yun's concubine didn't dishonor her.

At this moment, True Feather Divine Spirit felt the frustration in her heart quietly dissipate. Her mindset became clear.

Soon, True Feather Divine Spirit sat down cross-legged, adding her powerful Divine Spirit will to bless Su Yun, helping him open his Profound Palace while also protecting him.

Time continued to pass.

In the blink of an eye, two days went by.

Throughout the Su family's pocket dimension, all the powerhouses wore grave expressions, not daring to be the slightest bit careless.

Suddenly, the heavens trembled. The various Divine Spirits' gazes sharpened as they held their breath, all looking toward the sky above Su Yun.

The next moment, a massive projection of mountains and rivers spanning ten thousand zhang across the heavens appeared before their eyes.

In that instant, from the infinite depths of the heavens, divine thunder rumbled. It seemed as if even heaven and earth felt fear, wary of Su Yun's talent.

"As expected—a ten-thousand-zhang Profound Palace, no less impressive than the legendary Buddhist Ancestor."

"No, wait—this is ten thousand zhang of mountains and rivers."

"What is this? I feel this world is filled with vitality, as if it's nurturing powerful life forms."

"Before long, plants might even sprout within it."

...

In an instant, the various Su family powerhouses gasped, their dao hearts nearly destabilizing, almost falling from the sky.

A Profound Palace nurturing vitality, giving birth to "spirit," evolving toward a true pocket dimension—this was something that should only happen after breaking through to the Heaven Spirit Realm.

"Is the Young Master breaking through to Profound Palace Realm, or Heaven Spirit Realm?"

"Defying heaven. This is absolutely defying heaven."

"So this is a Profound Palace opened with a hundred dragon power? It can nurture 'spirit' from the moment of its birth."

"Then when the Young Master breaks through to Heaven Spirit Realm, won't he be able to directly nurture powerful fierce beasts and divine beasts?"

The various Su family powerhouses felt they were going mad.

And at that moment, the ten-thousand-zhang mountains and rivers actually began to rumble and shake, devouring endless heavenly laws as its boundaries expanded wildly once more.

"Heavens!"

In that instant, the various Su family powerhouses were completely stunned. One Divine Spirit's dao heart even destabilized, causing him to fall from the sky.

Ten thousand zhang of mountains and rivers—and it still wasn't Su Yun's limit.
