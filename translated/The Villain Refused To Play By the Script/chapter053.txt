Chapter 53: The Imperial Capital Shakes

"Don't call me Father. I don't have a daughter who tried to assassinate her own brother." Xuanyuan Ze snorted coldly, his gaze frigid, killing intent flickering in his eyes.

If not for the Starlight Flowing Radiance Dress Xuanyuan Jian wore, he would have already struck down this so-called daughter.

She was merely the child of a servant girl.

As patriarch of the divine Xuanyuan family, a powerhouse who had ignited his divine fire, he had at least dozens of such children. Yet there was only one legitimate son born of his principal wife—Xuanyuan Li.

According to family rules, only legitimate children had the right to inherit the patriarch's position.

Among so many children, only this youngest daughter was the most unruly. That alone would have been manageable—killing her would have sufficed. But she just had to possess extraordinary talent, bearing the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul, earning the admiration and support of many powerful figures within the Xuanyuan family.

She had even come to possess qualifications that could potentially allow her to inherit the Xuanyuan family's leadership.

"My own brother?"

Xuanyuan Jian laughed coldly. "Then might I ask Father—would a real brother seek out ancient forbidden arts to try to strip away his own sister's martial soul?"

"Would a real brother force his sister's mother to try to kill her when she was just a child?"

"Would a real brother slip aphrodisiacs to his own sister, and when it was discovered, have their father cover it up and forbid his daughter from ever speaking of it?"

"Would a real brother..."

...

Xuanyuan Jian's expression was cold, her eyes devoid of emotion. For the first time, she laid out her history—incident by incident, matter by matter—right there in the open, before Su Yun and Qin Junhua, without showing the slightest concern for her birth father's or brother's dignity.

"Enough!" Xuanyuan Li's face had turned ashen with rage. "No matter what you say, the iron fact remains that I am the Xuanyuan family's heir and you tried to assassinate me!"

"You got lucky and escaped last time. Let's see where you run this time. Die!"

Xuanyuan Li roared, extending his hand. Golden light blazed brilliant and dazzling as thirty golden dragons materialized above his head, roaring and shaking heaven and earth.

This was the supreme divine power of a divine family's strongest heir—seeming to fill the entire firmament, boundless in might.

At that moment, divine light flashed. Su Yun's figure appeared. A palm struck out, colliding head-on with Xuanyuan Li. It was as if two primordial beasts crashed together, producing a deafening boom, the shockwaves rolling outward.

"Bang, bang, bang..."

Xuanyuan Li's face went white as he staggered backward more than a dozen steps before barely steadying himself.

In that instant, both Xuanyuan Ze and Qin Junhua's gazes sharpened—the only difference being that Xuanyuan Ze's expression was dark while Qin Junhua's eyes overflowed with pleasant surprise.

This scene had completely exceeded everyone's expectations.

After all, Su Yun had just turned eighteen.

Xuanyuan Li was already twenty-three—a full five years older than Su Yun.

What did this mean?

Both were heirs of divine families, receiving the finest training from birth, supplied with the best resources. Neither ever needed to worry about insufficient resources.

One could say this wasn't merely a simple clash between two individuals—it was a collision of two great families' heritage, a collision of two heirs' potential.

Generally speaking, families standing at the pinnacle would never casually allow their heirs to fight, because the implications were too significant.

Yet Xuanyuan Li had struck too suddenly—they hadn't even had time to intervene.

By all logic, Su Yun had five fewer years of cultivation than Xuanyuan Li. He should have been at a disadvantage.

Yet in this single exchange, Xuanyuan Li had come out decidedly worse.

"This brat's strength is actually this much greater than Li'er's." Xuanyuan Ze's expression was grim. He could already predict that today's events would spread back to their family.

A divine family's heir had to be a top-tier prodigy—only then could the family be assured it wouldn't decline under his leadership.

Many powerful figures in the family would certainly be deeply dissatisfied with Xuanyuan Li's position as heir after this exchange.

Xuanyuan Li naturally understood this as well. His expression rapidly turned dark with rage. "Su Yun, again! That strike was only fifty percent of my power!"

He had to salvage his reputation, or the impact on him would be too great.

"Hummm!"

Xuanyuan Li formed a sword with his fingers, golden light blazing, sword intent towering to the heavens—the Xuanyuan family's transmitted Divine Spirit scripture, the Xuanyuan Sword Art.

One sword, and mountains and rivers overturned!

Sword shadows filled the sky, sword qi surged like the sea, one strike falling, space itself trembling.

Just days ago, Xuanyuan Li had used this very technique to defeat the combined forces of Ye Ling, Su Meng, and Xuanyuan Jian—devastatingly powerful.

But at that moment, Su Yun suddenly smiled slightly and unexpectedly stepped back, exposing Xuanyuan Jian behind him to bear the full brunt of this divine power.

Instantly, Qin Junhua's expression turned cold as she rose abruptly to her feet.

Regardless of the circumstances, Xuanyuan Jian was now wearing the Starlight Flowing Radiance Dress—she held the status of the Su family's future matriarch.

If she were injured within the Su family compound, where would that leave the Su family's dignity?

"Hummm!"

But at that moment, a golden divine sword martial soul suddenly manifested above Xuanyuan Jian's head. The divine dragon on its hilt seemed lifelike. It suddenly erupted with golden radiance, releasing a dragon's roar.

"Boom!"

The sky full of golden sword shadows instantly dissipated.

"How is this possible?"

Xuanyuan Ze cried out in shock, his eyes suddenly filled with terror.

"How did your martial soul awaken? Didn't I seal it?" Xuanyuan Ze said dazedly.

At that moment, the golden sword soul suddenly erupted with vast golden radiance, piercing straight through the heavens, seeming to connect to some unknown realm.

In the boundless void, a golden longsword's projection emerged, its magnificent divine might spreading across the entire Imperial Capital.

In that instant, countless powerhouses throughout the Imperial Capital trembled, their eyes filled with alarm.

"This is... the Xuanyuan family's clan-guarding divine artifact, the Xuanyuan Sword!" an ancient powerhouse exclaimed.

"But wasn't the Xuanyuan Sword lost in the infinite void during the Great War of the Century?"

"Could it be that someone in the Xuanyuan family has manifested the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul and awakened it?"

...

In that moment, countless powerhouses were dumbstruck, terrified beyond measure.

The Xuanyuan Sword—the supreme treasure held by humanity's legendary supreme Human Emperor, the Xuanyuan Clan's ancestor.

The Xuanyuan family's founding ancestor had been born with the Xuanyuan Sword Martial Soul. After igniting his divine fire, he had summoned the Xuanyuan Sword's true form from the infinite void, becoming one of the most powerful Divine Spirits in human history.

Because of the Xuanyuan Sword's existence, the Xuanyuan family had remained one of humanity's strongest families generation after generation.

But a century ago, in the Great War of the Century, the Xuanyuan family's Divine Spirit had fallen and the Xuanyuan Sword had been lost. The family had been in steady decline ever since.

The appearance of the Xuanyuan Sword's projection shook the entire Imperial Capital in that moment.

Yet those most overjoyed were the Xuanyuan family themselves.

Deep within the Xuanyuan family, a host of powerful figures from the clan's ancient reserves awakened. They stared blankly at the Xuanyuan Sword's projection in the sky, feeling the call resonating in their bloodline. Before they knew it, their eyes had reddened.
