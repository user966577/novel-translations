Chapter 145: The Qiankun Cauldron

Su Zhan smiled faintly. "So we need to use the second method. This method is both difficult and simple—for you, Yun'er, it's quite simple."

"Among the secluded sects, the Celestial Maiden Sect—one of the three branches of the Daoist tradition—possesses a sect-guarding divine weapon: the ancient artifact known as the Qiankun Cauldron. It has the supreme power to transform the acquired into the innate."

"If you can get Celestial Maiden Sect Master An Ruoyi to bring out the Qiankun Cauldron and use the divine weapon to cleanse Athena, breaking the mental barrier in her heart won't be a problem."

After speaking these words, a flash of profound light passed through Su Zhan's eyes. He vanished from where he stood, leaving only his voice echoing continuously through the void.

"Yun'er, Grandfather has already exceeded the three-hundred-year limit. Only by relying on the Divine Source and the Chaos Bell's suppression have I managed to cling to life. I still have the strength for one final battle. When you consider your strategies, you may count Grandfather among your forces—dragging three Strongest Divine Spirits down to the underworld with me shouldn't be a problem."

His weathered words brimmed with unparalleled dominance. The only thing absent was fear of death.

As a formidable leader of his generation, even in death, he would take several Strongest Divine Spirits with him.

"Your grandson understands. Please rest well, Grandfather."

A flash of cold light passed through Su Yun's eyes. He bowed respectfully to the void.

"Celestial Maiden Sect, An Ruoyi, the Qiankun Cauldron." Su Yun murmured to himself, a flash of cold light suddenly passing through his eyes.

He hadn't originally wanted to move against the Daoist sects so soon.

But it seemed the matter couldn't wait.

In the original novel, the current Holy Maiden of the Celestial Maiden Sect—An Ruoyi's disciple Mingyu—had a love-hate relationship with a Divine Spirit from the super-race known as the Demon Race. That Demon Race Divine Spirit happened to be sworn brothers with Ye Ling, having had his life saved by the protagonist.

He wondered whether the original plot would change now that he had beaten Ye Ling down to a mere remnant soul.

"The Demon Race is cruel and lawless, in mutual enmity with the Human Race. Consorting with the Demon Race is a heinous crime!" Su Yun murmured to himself, An Ruoyi's alluring figure suddenly flashing through his mind.

"Sect Master Ruoyi, it's been a while!"

Just then, the system's voice, silent for so long, suddenly rang out:

"Congratulations, Host. For killing the Son of Destiny Golden Feather Knight, reward: 4,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, Host. For defeating the Destiny Divine Spirit Athena and altering her fate, reward: 3,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, Host. For accomplishing a deed that affects the pattern of Blue Star, reward: 8,000 charm points."

"Congratulations, Host. For completely taking control of the Qin family and altering a great family's destiny, reward: 5,000 charm points."

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit bloodline

Realm: Profound Palace Realm [800,000-zhang Mountains and Rivers Profound Palace, nurturing 'spirit veins']

Cultivation Methods: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art, God-Devil Scripture

Charm Value: 86,000 [Resonance with the Stars] [Cultivation speed increased 60-fold]

"Twenty thousand charm points rewarded at once." After checking the system panel, Su Yun drew a sharp breath, his eyes filled with tremendous joy.

So many days had passed, and because events kept occurring one after another, he hadn't had time to pay attention to the system's activity. The system hadn't bothered him either.

Now that matters were finally settled, the system's notification sounds rang out continuously.

"With fifty-fold fortune value, I reached 800,000-zhang Profound Palace in just one month. With sixty-fold... at most a week, and I can reach 990,000-zhang Profound Palace—the absolute peak of the Profound Palace Realm."

"But at Divine Profound Realm, I borrowed the strength of True Feather Divine Spirit and the other women to break through the extreme boundary." Su Yun murmured, An Ruoyi and Athena's breathtaking figures flashing unbidden through his mind.

As his realm continued to grow, the masculine energy from his Fuxi Martial Soul grew ever more vast. To break through the extreme boundary of Profound Palace Realm, he would need even more powerful yin energy to balance it.

...

By now, the Chinese world had descended into utter chaos, everyone fearing for their safety.

The Su family, Ouyang family, and Xuanyuan family had jointly declared their intention to withdraw from the Federation of Azure Blue.

If they withdrew, the Crusades—even a joint campaign by world powers against China—were entirely possible.

At this moment, countless watchful eyes turned toward northern China.

The three great Divine Spirit families had gone this mad, yet only the Duanmu family remained silent. Only if the Duanmu family spoke up was there any chance of dissuading the three great families from their insane decision.

"The Duanmu family is the one among China's four great Divine Spirit families with the best relations with the Western world, even the island nation."

"For the sake of their interests, the Duanmu family definitely won't tolerate the three great families making such a crazy decision."

"But the four great families have always presented a united front externally. The Duanmu family can't possibly single-handedly resist the decision of the three great families."

"But there's still a glimmer of hope."

"As long as Duanmu Lei refuses, the three great families will have reservations."

...

Countless rumors swirled throughout the Chinese world.

Just three days later.

From the headquarters of the Duanmu family—one of the Divine Spirit families in northern China—came a terse but momentous announcement.

"The four great Divine Spirit families are united. The Duanmu family unconditionally supports the decisions made by Su Yun, Ouyang Feng, and Xuanyuan Jian."

With these words, waves upon waves of shock spread.

The entire Chinese world was utterly shaken. Countless great clans were dumbstruck, horrified to the extreme.

They'd all gone mad—completely mad.

China was only part of the Human Race's territory. If they truly withdrew from the Federation of Azure Blue, all connections to the outside world—all business—would be severed.

The losses would be incomparably massive.

One should know that not only the four great Divine Spirit families, but the numerous major clans beneath them also had enormous interests overseas.

Yet even knowing what severing ties might mean and how massive the losses could be, no one dared say another word.

The four great Divine Spirit families were the heavens in China.

A decision made jointly by all four families—no one could oppose it.

"Don't worry. Even if the four great families agreed, there's still one last hope." In a major province of southern China, an ancient Divine Spirit spoke up.

"Yes, have you forgotten about the secluded sects?"

"Though secluded sects aren't allowed to interfere in worldly affairs, their power is formidable. The Buddhist and Confucian schools each have one of China's six Strongest Divine Spirits sitting in their midst—their strength isn't much weaker than Su Heng or Ouyang Feng."

"The secluded sects stand apart from the world, but once China withdraws from the Federation and the Crusades come, they won't be able to stay out of it either."

"As long as the secluded sects step forward to negotiate with the four great families, there's still a glimmer of hope."
