Chapter 78: Yayue, I'm Doing This For Your Own Good

Su Yun's brow furrowed slightly. "Have you identified this man?"

Dark Lady immediately said, "Yes, Young Master. The man's identity has been confirmed. His name is Li Yi, an alternate Dao Child of the Kunlun Daoist Sect—one of the three great Daoist sects. He is a disciple of True Feather Divine Spirit and a Divine Profound realm prodigy.

"He accompanied True Feather Divine Spirit to the Imperial Capital this time to search for a certain heavenly treasure.

"Three days ago, when True Feather Divine Spirit entered a certain secret realm, he met Su Yayue in the Imperial Capital. Since then, he has been persistently pursuing her, wanting to take her back to the Kunlun Daoist Sect."

"Kunlun Daoist Sect!"

Su Yun's gaze turned cold as he murmured to himself.

The Kunlun Daoist Sect was one of the three great Daoist sects, on par with the Celestial Maiden Sect. With over a thousand years of heritage and deep foundations, it had produced several supreme Divine Spirits.

Though this generation's Kunlun Daoist Sect didn't have any powerhouses who ranked among China's strongest Divine Spirits, they had many who had ignited the divine fire, and their power was flourishing.

Of course, compared to the Su family, they were still slightly inferior. Moreover, in China, these reclusive sects weren't permitted to enter the Federation, so while they had some influence within the Federation, it wasn't substantial.

"People from the three great Daoist sects were drawn here so quickly." Su Yun mused.

His guess was correct—since Su Yayue began cultivating the Inquiry of the Dao Scripture, her Innate Dao Body had been continuously awakening.

This Li Yi must have noticed this, which was why he was so persistently pursuing Su Yayue.

After all, the Innate Dao Body was one of the supreme physiques of the Daoist path.

Yet a mere alternate Dao Child thought he could take Su Yayue away?

Cold light flashed in Su Yun's eyes.

At that moment, Dark Lady continued, "Young Master, I've confirmed that True Feather Divine Spirit is trapped in that secret realm and won't be able to emerge for some time. Li Yi is alone in the Imperial Capital."

"Very good. Well done. Where are Su Yayue and Li Yi now?" Su Yun said flatly.

Dark Lady's face showed a flash of delight at Su Yun's praise. She immediately said, "Su Yayue just left her home and is heading toward our Su family. Li Yi is following beside her. Shall I have him captured?"

"No need. Let's go meet this Li Yi."

Su Yun said with interest.

After all, Su Yayue possessed an Innate Dao Body—she was a Daughter of Destiny with extremely vast destiny.

Being able to meet Su Yayue was itself a tremendous opportunity.

This Li Yi himself likely had extremely vast destiny as well.

...

Su Yun had ordered the Imperial Capital sealed for three days, forbidding anyone from leaving their homes.

Today was only the second day. The normally bustling streets were empty, with only Su family Eighteen Battalion soldiers standing at street corners, expressionless atop their ancient war chariots. Even from a distance, a terrifying aura of killing intent pervaded the air.

At this moment, a man and a woman walked down the main street.

The woman was young and beautiful, with a hint of defiance at the corners of her brows. Her face was stunningly gorgeous. Even the soldiers who had experienced life-and-death trials couldn't help but occasionally glance at her before quickly looking away.

This was a female prodigy from the Young Master's personal guard battalion, already marked with the Young Master's seal. Who would dare harbor improper thoughts?

This woman was, naturally, Su Yayue.

After nearly a month of cultivating the Inquiry of the Dao Scripture, the already stunning Su Yayue now emanated an air of otherworldly transcendence, like a celestial maiden who had stepped out of the mundane world—aloof and captivating.

"Li Yi, I've told you already. Give up. I won't go back to any Kunlun Daoist Sect with you."

Hearing the man beside her drone on, Su Yayue's brow furrowed slightly, a flash of impatience in her eyes. "We're almost at the Su family estate. You can't enter. I suggest you leave quickly.

"The Young Master has ordered the Imperial Capital sealed for three days. Walking around so freely like this could bring you serious trouble."

The man beside her was Li Yi, the alternate Dao Child of the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

Li Yi was tall with an extremely handsome face, wearing a white Daoist robe. He had an extraordinary air about him that made him stand out like a crane among chickens in this mundane city, drawing the eye.

"Even when angry and impatient, she's still so beautiful. This temperament, this transcendent aura—truly worthy of the legendary Innate Dao Body."

Looking at Su Yayue's slightly impatient expression, Li Yi's gaze held a hint of intoxication.

Such a woman, serving as a mere handmaiden to some worldly young master—it was truly a waste. Only by returning to the Kunlun Daoist Sect with him, being with him, could she avoid being polluted by worldly filth, emerging from the mud unstained.

If Su Yayue returned with him, she would certainly be...

"Yayue, you probably don't understand how powerful our Kunlun Daoist Sect is."

Li Yi smiled. "Our sect is a reclusive sect, one of the three great Daoist sects. We've produced several supreme Divine Spirits, with incomparably deep foundations—not inferior to the Su family at all.

"The Su family's personal guard battalion is decent, but with your Innate Dao Body's aptitude, if you return with me, you'll certainly be named a Dao Maiden.

"With my talent, sooner or later I'll defeat the current Dao Child and become the sect's heir.

"When that time comes, you and I together—why worry about not unifying the Daoist sects and establishing a supreme sect?

"A mere personal guard battalion is truly beneath you."

Li Yi's eyes were deep. When he spoke of "together," he naturally meant cultivating together with Su Yayue. With Su Yayue's Innate Dao Body physique combined with his Yin-Yang Dao Scripture, yin and yang fused—becoming a supreme Divine Spirit would only be a matter of time.

This was one of the reasons he was so persistent with Su Yayue.

All along, he had encountered countless opportunities, but Su Yayue was absolutely the greatest he had ever met. How could he bear to let go?

He understood the principle of striking while the iron was hot.

Once Su Yayue returned to the Kunlun Daoist Sect with him, alone and isolated, she would naturally grow close to him. When the time came, becoming his woman would be a natural progression.

With Su Yayue, defeating the Dao Child would be effortless.

"Yayue, I truly can't bear to see you buried in this mundane world. Come back with me."

Saying this, seeing that the Su family gates were not far ahead, Li Yi directly reached out to grab Su Yayue's fair, delicate hand.

"Li Yi, though you've helped me somewhat, I am the personal guard of the Su family's current Young Master. Please show some respect."

Su Yayue's gaze darkened. She shifted her body, dodging Li Yi's hand, and said coldly:

"Please leave. Otherwise, once I enter the Su family, the Eighteen Battalions' soldiers won't be as polite to you as they are now."

"The Young Master has summoned me into the Su family to cultivate. I won't be coming out for some time. Perhaps we'll meet again if fate wills it."

With that, Su Yayue turned and walked toward the Su family gates.
