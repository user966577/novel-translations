Chapter 36: How About Bidding on the Beast Hide for Jian'er First?

"Young Master is so powerful!"

Yun Ran's eyes glistened with moisture. After all, she had devoted herself entirely to Su Yun. The stronger he became, the happier she was.

Five dragons roared across the heavens, circling each other like five dragons playing with a pearl.

But this still wasn't the end of Su Yun's breakthrough to Divine Profound Realm.

Suddenly, four more enormous chaotic giant dragons seemed to grow impatient waiting. They burst directly from Su Yun's body, soaring through the heavens, overturning clouds and seas, their dragon roars shaking the sky.

Nine dragons descended upon the world.

Qiao Zhiqiang felt like he was about to faint, as if he were witnessing the birth of a mythic epic.

"Fuxi Bagua Formation!"

At that moment, Su Yun suddenly opened his eyes. His irises had turned completely purple, like the eyes of a Divine Spirit—cold and emotionless, looking down upon all living things. His hands formed seals, releasing mysterious patterns one after another.

He possessed the Martial Soul of the ancient Divine Spirit Fuxi, naturally blessed with divine protection. Now that he had broken through to Divine Profound Realm, he could finally wield a trace of his Fuxi Martial Soul's power.

With a resonant hum, a purple Bagua formation condensed in the void above. Suddenly, it released a beam of purple divine light that pierced through into infinite emptiness, as if carving a tunnel through the void itself—one that refused to dissipate for a long time.

"Hissss!"

Qiao Zhiqiang drew a sharp breath. This power was no weaker than an ordinary Profound Palace Realm expert. Just breaking through to Divine Profound Realm, not only did Su Yun possess the power of nine dragons, but his combat strength was terrifyingly formidable.

Was this truly the heir to this generation's divine family, the Su clan?

Of course, the stronger Su Yun's talent, the more secure his position in the Su family—which only strengthened Qiao Zhiqiang's resolve to cling to Su Yun's coattails.

"Young Master's talent is unparalleled, surpassing all human sages of the past. This humble one is so shocked that I don't even know how to express the excitement and elation in my heart."

Qiao Zhiqiang's eyes were slightly red. After regaining his composure, his entire body seemed to tremble with excitement as he spoke hurriedly: "Young Master is mighty! This humble one's admiration for you is like the surging rivers, endless and..."

Su Yun filtered out Qiao Zhiqiang's words entirely, instead pulling up his system panel.

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit Bloodline

Realm: Divine Profound Realm [Nine Dragons' Power]

Cultivation Method: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art

Charm Value: 3500 [Flowers Bloom at Sight, Can Communicate with All Things] [Cultivation Speed Increased Eightfold]

"Communicate with All Things."

Su Yun's brow furrowed slightly as he pondered, carefully sensing the changes within himself after breaking through to Divine Profound Realm.

At that moment, Su Yun suddenly felt as if he had merged with the space around him. His vision seemed capable of communicating with the walls, seeing directly through them to the scene outside.

Then he suddenly saw what was happening in the "Wasteland"-class private room.

"ROAR!"

It was the roar of a golden giant dragon. The dragon's form was peculiar—like a massive golden sword, its sword qi razor-sharp, leaving terrifying marks upon the space around it.

Beneath the golden dragon sat Xuanyuan Jian, cross-legged in cultivation. Her lightly made-up features, already perfect as an immortal's, were now tinged with golden radiance, making her appear noble as a goddess, untouchable and inviolable.

Clearly, she had gained tremendous benefits in the "Wasteland"-class room, using the opportunity to break through to Divine Profound Realm.

In the original story, Xuanyuan Jian was exceptionally talented—her strength not the least bit inferior to Ye Ling's. It wasn't strange that she could reach the limits of Qi-Blood Realm as well.

Beside Xuanyuan Jian was Liu Ting. Judging by her delighted expression, she must have made considerable progress in her cultivation too.

Su Yun's gaze swept past Liu Ting without pause, immediately focusing on Ye Ling.

"Jian'er has actually reached the limits of Qi-Blood Realm too."

Ye Ling stared blankly at the scene before him, his eyes suddenly filling with intense resentment. That last trace of superiority he felt toward Xuanyuan Jian had vanished without a trace.

What he'd been most proud of was his own powerful talent.

But Xuanyuan Jian wasn't the least bit inferior to him.

And now, because of Su Yun's machinations behind the scenes, she had actually beaten him to the punch, breaking through to Divine Profound Realm first. His standing in Xuanyuan Jian's heart had probably dropped even lower.

"Su Yun, I'll never rest until you're dead."

Ye Ling roared in his heart, his gaze filled with venomous hatred.

The corner of Su Yun's lips curved upward, a cold glint flashing through his eyes as he withdrew his gaze.

This "Communicate with All Things" ability was far more miraculous than he had anticipated. This was a Heaven-class private room, after all, with powerful formation patterns carved into the walls. Even a Heaven Spirit Realm expert couldn't simply ignore the formations to see what lay within.

This alone made this divine ability remarkably useful.

But clearly, this ability he'd awakened upon reaching Divine Profound Realm wasn't merely for peeping. It surely had even more wondrous applications.

At that moment, the interior of the auction house suddenly fell into complete silence, all lights extinguished.

The next instant, the large screen displayed a terrifying scene of armies clashing—countless human warriors fighting alien races, battling ancient ferocious beasts.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

Suddenly, a deep drumbeat sounded, its rhythm strange—sometimes surging with passion, sometimes flowing like a mountain stream—stirring the blood of all who heard it.

This was the Federation of Azure Blue's battle hymn, composed by a Divine Spirit who excelled in the musical arts during humanity's darkest hour after the spiritual qi resurgence. It was meant to bolster the courage of human warriors and possessed miraculous effects.

"Distinguished guests, thank you all for attending Azure Blue Auction House's annual auction."

At that moment, an elderly man in black robes appeared on the elevated platform, his voice deep and solemn. "But before the auction begins, let us listen quietly to the battle hymn for one minute, in remembrance of our ancestors who sacrificed themselves for humanity."

Before long, both the battle scenes on the screen and the hymn came to an end, but the many distinguished figures and prodigies below had flushed faces, their emotions thoroughly stirred.

"I now declare that the annual Azure Blue Auction officially begins."

Seeing that everyone's emotions had been properly roused, the old man smiled slightly. This was a standard auction house tactic—stir up emotions first, get the blood pumping, and the auction items would fetch higher prices.

"This is the first item up for auction."

The old man waved his hand, and a tattered brown beast hide appeared in the air. Instantly, countless sword cries rang throughout the hall, clear and resonant.

It seemed this tattered beast hide could communicate with all swords, containing a terrifying sword technique.

"Ladies and gentlemen, this beast hide was obtained from the sacrificial altar after General Flame King led his army to exterminate the ancient Demonic Blood Lion clan. According to our artifact refiners, this hide came from at least a Saint-level Demonic Blood Lion, inscribed with a sword technique.

"However, because half of it is damaged, one would need exceptional talent to comprehend the technique within. So consider this a welcoming gift from our auction house—a lucky start."

The old man smiled mysteriously, slowly raising one finger. "Starting price: one pound of origin stones."

At that moment, the atmosphere in the auction house suddenly fell into the stillness before a frenzy, completely silent.

After all, this was the hide of a Saint-level ancient Flame Lion, containing a Saint's dao essence. Even without any inscribed technique, it would be excellent material for refining a Saint-grade artifact.

And what level of technique would require a Saint-level ferocious beast's hide to inscribe it?

In the "Wasteland"-class private room, Xuanyuan Jian suddenly opened her eyes, her gaze fixed upon the tattered beast hide.

At that moment, Ye Ling's eyes lit up. He immediately said, "Jian'er, you specialize in the sword dao. This technique is definitely suited for you. Let me bid on it for you."

He keenly sensed this was a perfect opportunity to regain Xuanyuan Jian's favor.

But upon hearing this, Xuanyuan Jian frowned, her voice cold. "Weren't you planning to use those origin stones to bid on the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine for Sister Ting?"

Ye Ling's smile froze instantly. He'd forgotten about that.

But quickly, he turned to look at Liu Ting and said in a grave tone, "Ting'er, this beast hide contains a sword technique that's very important to Jian'er. How about I use a portion of the origin stones first to bid on the beast hide for Jian'er?"

In that instant, Liu Ting was stunned.

And Xuanyuan Jian's expression turned cold as ice.
