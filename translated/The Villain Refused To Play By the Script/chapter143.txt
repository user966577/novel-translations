Chapter 143: Withdraw from the Federation

He turned to look at Su Yun and said: "I agree with you. If things are truly as you say, then the Federation of Azure Blue has no reason to exist. China withdrawing from the Federation—what of it?"

"Hahahaha!"

Su Yun laughed heartily. "Uncle Ouyang speaks well! These savage creatures think themselves noble, yet they don't realize that our China fears them not at all."

"Athena must stay today."

"If you want Athena back, provide a satisfactory explanation at the Supreme Council. Otherwise, bring on your so-called Crusade if you dare."

"My Su family wouldn't mind campaigning in the Americas while simultaneously storming Mount Olympus and roasting those angels' wings for a meal."

Just then, Dark Lady's figure appeared behind Su Yun. In her hands she held a large white platter, which she respectfully raised. "Reporting to Young Master, the Golden Feather Knight's wings are done roasting."

On the platter were two wings nearly as tall as a person, roasted to a golden brown and glistening with oil, still sizzling.

"Uncle Ouyang, shall we each have one?" Su Yun smiled.

"Haha! Excellent. I've never tasted God Race wings in my life—trying some half-breed mongrel wings first sounds good to me." Ouyang Feng laughed, grabbed a wing with one hand, and took a bite.

"Delicious!"

"Not bad at all!"

At this moment, the entire Imperial Capital, indeed all of China, was watching this scene. Countless powerhouses fell into utter shock.

"The Su family and the Ouyang family have both gone mad."

"They actually want to withdraw from the Federation of Azure Blue."

"Do the Xuanyuan family and the Duanmu family know about this insane idea?"

"You probably don't know—the Xuanyuan family has already fallen under the control of the Su family's young master, Su Yun. The current Xuanyuan heir, Xuanyuan Jian, is Su Yun's fiancée. She's completely loyal to him and will soon inherit the position of Xuanyuan family patriarch. Su Yun's will is the Xuanyuan family's will."

"With three great families in agreement, even if the Duanmu family objects, it won't matter. They might even get wiped out by the three families together."

At this moment, even the powerhouses in China's secluded sects fell into shock.

The Daoist sects, Buddhist sects, Confucian schools, Mohist schools, and so on—the Divine Spirit powerhouses among them were all utterly horrified.

If China withdrew from the Federation of Azure Blue, even these secluded sects couldn't remain detached. They would inevitably be drawn into the conflict.

...

At this moment, it wasn't just China—the entire world was shaken.

In the vast ocean, a chain of small islands stood, like scattered stars, not too far from China's mainland.

"Damn it, those Chinese lunatics."

Just then, the firmament suddenly darkened. The sky was shrouded in blackness, and faintly visible was the outline of something enormous, like a colossal dragon, winding for over a thousand miles.

It was none other than the island nation's Eight-Headed Serpent God—one of the most famous Strongest Divine Spirits among the Human Race, and currently the oldest living Divine Spirit of the Human Race.

On the island nation's main island, a pair of serpent eyes slowly opened. Within those twisted serpentine pupils was a sea of crimson, as if containing an ocean of blood.

Their island nation was too close to China.

If China, under the leadership of the Su family and Ouyang family, truly withdrew from the Federation of Azure Blue, they would be the first to suffer.

Whether the Crusades could flatten China remained unknown, but the island nation would certainly be annihilated by China first.

This much the Eight-Headed Serpent God knew clearly.

Don't be fooled by how the island nation could stand toe-to-toe with China within the Federation—that was only because China had always kept a low profile. If they truly went to war against China without Mount Olympus's support, the island nation would be obliterated in an instant.

"Damn it, how could China produce such a madman? A young man who can actually control the Su family."

"He must be killed."

The Eight-Headed Serpent God's voice was sinister, his serpent eyes piercing through the void to gaze at Su Yun.

"Immediately have the Ninja Divine Spirit issue orders. Send a group of ninjas to China to investigate everything about Su Yun. If there's an opportunity, eliminate him on the spot." The Eight-Headed Serpent God's voice was detached.

"Summon the Sun Goddess and the Sakura God. I need to meet with them. This matter is of great importance—we must discuss it."

"Given this situation, the upcoming Federation Supreme Council meeting is going to be turbulent. One misstep, and the Federation of Azure Blue will disintegrate."

...

At this moment, factions throughout the world were shaken, all beginning to discuss among themselves.

No one had expected China to be so unyielding this time—suppressing even the War Goddess Athena, showing no fear of Zeus the God King, and threatening to withdraw from the Federation of Azure Blue.

Was this still the perpetually low-key China they knew?

China withdrawing from the Federation was something no one could ignore. China was the second most powerful force after the West. If China withdrew, the Federation would essentially exist in name only.

"Su family, Ouyang family..."

Zeus's gaze was ice-cold, filled with rage. He stood atop the divine mountain, his eyes piercing through the void to stare at Su Yun and Ouyang Feng, who were enthusiastically devouring angel wings.

He wanted nothing more than to lead a Crusade right now, storming into China and wiping out these two detestable families.

But he knew he couldn't do it.

The Western world wasn't his to rule alone.

The Earth Goddess lineage, the Satan lineage, and others all wielded tremendous influence. Mount Olympus alone couldn't stand against all of China.

It was only because China had always kept such a low profile, always yielding to Mount Olympus.

Now that Su Yun and Ouyang Feng were being so forceful, it truly put Zeus in a difficult position.

"Damn it."

Zeus growled, lightning crackling and exploding in his eyes. His aura of destruction rolled forth, making even the million-zhang-high Mount Olympus tremble beneath his presence, the firmament shattering.

"Send word—I will personally attend the Federation Supreme Council meeting." Zeus's thunderous voice exploded across Mount Olympus.

Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom and War, had always represented Mount Olympus at Federation meetings.

But now Athena had been suppressed and fallen into the Su family's hands. This was Mount Olympus's disgrace.

He no longer dared project his divine consciousness into China...

...

"Uncle Ouyang, it seems Zeus doesn't dare come."

Su Yun smiled indifferently, casually tossing aside the remaining wing bone. "But the upcoming Federation Supreme Council meeting is going to be quite turbulent."

Ouyang Feng's expression had also returned to calm. His weathered gaze looked toward the firmament as he spoke evenly: "With Athena in our hands, Zeus will probably attend the meeting personally. That snake from the island nation will likely come too, along with Shiva and others."

"They don't want to support your Su family's expansion in the Americas, but they also don't want China to withdraw from the Federation. Su Yun, you'll need to be careful. They'll definitely pull some tricks behind the scenes."

"However, at Federation headquarters, there are formation runes jointly laid down by the Federation's founding Divine Spirits. Even the Strongest Divine Spirits cannot fight there."

"This time, this uncle will accompany you and meet these people."

"I've been wanting to meet the most powerful, most influential people of the Human Race." Su Yun smiled faintly, then his gaze suddenly grew deep as he looked northward. "But Uncle Ouyang, don't you think that before we go to Federation headquarters, we should first resolve some internal problems?"

"What I hate most are traitors."

Ouyang Feng fell silent for a moment, his brow furrowing slightly as he too glanced northward.

He understood Su Yun was referring to the Duanmu family.

Athena being able to sneak into China was definitely connected to the Duanmu family.

"Su Yun, let's wait a while. The Duanmu family is also one of China's Divine Spirit families. If we can avoid making a move, we shouldn't. Duanmu Lei alone doesn't represent the entire Duanmu family, and he's actually quite clever when it comes to critical moments—he should make the right choice." Ouyang Feng spoke gravely.

"Uncle Ouyang, to secure the outside, one must first stabilize the inside!" Su Yun's words were meaningful. This Ouyang Feng was indeed somewhat soft-hearted.

But he didn't press the matter further. Instead, he changed the subject with a smile: "Uncle Ouyang, what should we do with this War Goddess Athena?"

"Let your Su family suppress her." Ouyang Feng shook his head, and with a flash, vanished into the firmament.

Regarding the Duanmu family matter, he wasn't deaf to the meaning in Su Yun's words.

He needed to think carefully.

*Cough, cough, cough...*

Just then, Su Jian and the other Su family Divine Spirits came over, suppressing a pale-faced woman whose battle armor was shattered and robes completely stained with blood.

Yet her gaze remained resolute. Looking at Su Yun, there was no emotion in her eyes as she spoke coldly: "Su Yun, now that I've fallen into your hands, kill me if you will. If I, Athena, so much as furrow my brow, I'm not worthy of being the War Goddess or a divine servant of the noble God Race."

"You actually joined the God Race and became their divine servant."

Su Yun's brow furrowed slightly, then he laughed coldly. "No wonder you infiltrated China for the God Race. So you've been brainwashed by them."

"But I've said I'll sooner or later have you willingly lie on my bed. How could I bear to kill you so easily?"

"Su Jian, take the God-Devil Pendant and personally suppress her. I need to pay a visit to Grandfather."

"As you command, Young Master." Su Jian spoke respectfully. "Su Jian will personally stand guard and not leave for even a step."

Suppressing a Strongest Divine Spirit allowed for no carelessness.

...

Su Yun arrived at the deepest part of the Su family's minor world. The surroundings were shrouded in darkness, though occasionally one could see massive golden divine stones drifting past, like golden meteors that vanished from sight in an instant.

This place was where the Su family's heritage resided.

The powerhouses sealed within these golden meteors were the heritage accumulated by the Su family over a thousand years.

"Yun'er, Grandfather knows why you've come."

"The God Race's divine abilities are strange. They brainwashed Athena. But it's not impossible to undo."

Just then, an aged voice rang out, one that carried within it an undercurrent of domineering power.
