Chapter 105: Su Yun, You're Dreaming

"I invited you to the Xuanyuan family only to explain the previous situation. I never once thought about joining forces with you to split the Su family."

Xuanyuan Li roared furiously, "Splitting the Su family—that was something you brought up! I never said any such thing!"

But Su Yihui completely ignored Xuanyuan Li, continuously kowtowing and begging Su Yun for mercy, constantly explaining that he had been bewitched by Xuanyuan Li and Xuanyuan Ze and had momentarily lost his mind.

Though he was explaining, his words subtly conveyed to everyone that he really had been conspiring with Xuanyuan Li to split the Su family—he had simply been discovered by Su Yun and then captured by Xuanyuan Chong.

At this moment, seeing Su Yihui continuously kowtowing and begging for mercy, the Imperial Capital fell into dead silence. Countless powerhouses could barely breathe.

Once again, they felt just how terrifying Su Yun's authority within the Su family truly was.

After all, Su Yihui had once been such a super-influential figure that a single stomp of his foot would make the Imperial Capital tremble.

"Xuanyuan Ze and his son have truly gone mad, actually trying to split the Su family."

"Never mind being discovered by Su Yun—even if Su Yun hadn't found out, with the Xuanyuan family's current strength, the odds of successfully overthrowing the Su family are basically zero."

"Not to mention that Xuanyuan Chong and a large number of Xuanyuan family direct-line members aren't even on his side."

"When the family isn't united internally, and you still want to take on the Su family?"

"With a patriarch like this, it's no wonder the Xuanyuan family keeps declining."

The various major families and powerhouses in the Imperial Capital discussed among themselves, looking at Xuanyuan Ze and his son with peculiar gazes.

After all, Su Yun had put on such a grand display, and Su Yihui and the other direct-line members really were inside the Xuanyuan family, only to be captured and brought out by Xuanyuan Chong.

One could say they had been caught red-handed. No amount of denial would help.

"Li'er, stop explaining. Can't you see by now? We've been outmaneuvered—attacked from both inside and outside."

Xuanyuan Ze's voice was hoarse, his eyes filled with bloodshot veins, giving off a hysterical, maddened feeling.

Xuanyuan Li's words caught in his throat, his face turning deathly pale.

If they still couldn't figure it out at this point, they would truly be unworthy of being the Xuanyuan family's patriarch and heir.

It was obvious that Xuanyuan Chong and Su Yun had colluded, using Su Yihui and the other direct-line members who had once been close to them to scheme against them.

The only thing they couldn't understand was how Su Yun had managed to control even Su Yihui and these other important figures so completely that they would cooperate with him without question.

After all, among these direct-line members were Heavenly Kings and Saints—all major figures in the Su family.

"Patriarch, things have come to this point, with witnesses and evidence present. Are you still going to argue?"

Xuanyuan Chong sighed and said, "I truly never imagined you would do something so foolish. Fortunately, I happened to stumble upon it. Otherwise, once it came to light, my Xuanyuan family would have been dragged into the abyss by you."

"Xuanyuan Chong, you treacherous villain! You traitor to the Xuanyuan family!"

Xuanyuan Ze growled, "The thousand years of foundation our Xuanyuan family has built will sooner or later be destroyed by the likes of you!"

"Patriarch, you need to speak with a clear conscience. The entire Imperial Capital is watching."

Xuanyuan Chong sneered, "If I hadn't uncovered these disgraceful deeds of yours ahead of time, when the Su family's army surrounded the Xuanyuan family compound, no one would have been spared.

"The thousand years of heritage our Xuanyuan family accumulated would have been completely ruined by your hands.

"You're the patriarch of the Xuanyuan family. Instead of thanking me, you're now trying to shift blame onto me?"

"Things have come to this point. You'd better think about how to resolve this current crisis."

With that, Xuanyuan Chong bowed respectfully to Su Yun and said, "Young Master Su Yun, this matter was orchestrated by my Xuanyuan family's patriarch and heir. It was not sanctioned by us direct-line members. Please do not implicate the entire Xuanyuan family."

"Naturally."

Su Yun smiled coldly, his hands clasped behind his back, and said indifferently, "The Su family and Xuanyuan family have, after all, shared a thousand years of friendship. If it weren't for this matter being something this Young Master absolutely cannot tolerate, I would never have made such a grand spectacle.

"This time, this Young Master will only pursue the ringleaders. There will be no guilt by association.

"However, to prevent the Xuanyuan family patriarch from acting irrationally out of love for his son and further damaging the deep bond between our two families—

"I, as an outsider, feel compelled to offer a suggestion to the Xuanyuan family.

"Perhaps it's time to reconsider the question of the heir?"

The moment these words were spoken, the various important figures' pupils contracted sharply.

Su Yun's true purpose this time was actually to force the Xuanyuan family to remove Xuanyuan Li.

And his fiancée was Xuanyuan Jian.

Now everyone understood why Su Yun had put on such a grand display.

Su Yun clearly intended to remove Xuanyuan Li and elevate Xuanyuan Jian to the position of heir.

Though everyone knew that once Xuanyuan Jian was suddenly made alternate heir and married Su Yun, the Su family would likely meddle in the Xuanyuan family's affairs—

No one had expected it to happen so fast, catching everyone completely off guard.

"Like a thunderbolt from a clear sky."

"There was absolutely no warning beforehand."

"Even the Su family's main branch Eighteen Battalions being secretly moved into the Imperial Capital—such a massive operation—not a single bit of information leaked."

"This strike was brutal."

Countless powerhouses drew sharp breaths, looking at Su Yun with eyes full of horror.

After all, changing heirs in any family was no small matter.

Let alone in a Divine Spirit family like the Xuanyuan family.

And Su Yun himself was merely the heir of the Su family.

In this instant, Xuanyuan Li's expression became incomparably dark.

He understood that this bucket of dirty water—he had no choice but to accept it now. There was no way to wash it clean.

But before Xuanyuan Li could speak—

At that moment, Su Yun looked toward Xuanyuan Ze and, after a moment of consideration, continued, "Furthermore, to prevent the Xuanyuan family patriarch from acting irrationally out of love for his son and further damaging the deep bond between our two families—

"I, as an outsider, feel compelled to make another suggestion to the Xuanyuan family.

"Perhaps the Patriarch Token in Xuanyuan Ze's hands should be reclaimed and held jointly by the Xuanyuan family's Supreme Council?"

The moment these words were spoken, Xuanyuan Ze and Xuanyuan Li could no longer contain themselves. They roared in unison, "Su Yun, you're dreaming!

"Our Xuanyuan family's internal affairs are none of your business!"

"Huff, huff, huff..."

Xuanyuan Ze gasped for breath, his eyes bloodshot with veins, feeling intense humiliation.

What did it mean to hand the Patriarch Token over to the Supreme Council for joint custody?

The Supreme Council was led by Xuanyuan Chong. Nearly half of the Xuanyuan family's direct-line members were spineless cowards who retreated again and again before the Su family.

Letting them hold the Patriarch Token would mean Su Yun would have no more reservations. The Xuanyuan family would be devoured by him piece by piece.

"The Xuanyuan family has been passed down for over a thousand years. The Patriarch Token has always been held by the patriarch, and the heir has never been changed."

Xuanyuan Ze's voice was hoarse, filled with madness: "Su Yun, what you're saying is nothing but a dream.

"If you want war, then war it is. My Xuanyuan family's Elite Guard is not necessarily much weaker than your Su family's main branch Eighteen Battalions."
