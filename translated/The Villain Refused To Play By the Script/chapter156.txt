Chapter 156: A Call to Arms or a Threat?

"Please, do not harm Mingyu."

Mo Yu's eyes were filled with blood vessels. His hoarse voice, laden with deep heartache, echoed through the firmament.

How proud he was.

Once, facing his elder brother, cornered in a desperate situation, he had never shown the slightest compromise even knowing he would die.

But now, he was in despair.

For Mingyu, he was willing to give up everything, because Mingyu was the woman who had treated him best in his entire life, aside from his mother.

"Three years is too long. I can't wait that long."

Su Yun's gaze was indifferent. After casually accepting the necklace, he looked at it deeply before speaking coldly: "Two years. I'll give you two years at most. In two years, I want to see your father's head and the Demon God weapon."

"As you command, Master. As long as you don't harm Mingyu, I will definitely accomplish it within two years."

Mo Yu knelt on one knee, bowing deeply to Su Yun. He then rose and looked at Mingyu, forcing gentleness into his voice: "Yu'er, believe me. At most two years, and I'll definitely return."

"Mo Yu, you must save me. I don't want to die, and I definitely don't want to enter the Courtesan Battalion." Mingyu's voice was wretched as she gazed at Mo Yu, her heart filled with endless regret.

She simply couldn't imagine how she would survive these two years—or rather, how Su Yun would make her survive them.

Why had she made such a foolish choice back then, gambling everything for an ephemeral position as Demon Empress?

"Believe me, Yu'er."

Mo Yu nodded heavily, his eyes filled with blood vessels.

Two years.

He understood that only by becoming the Demon Emperor and increasing his importance in Su Yun's heart would he have any chance of keeping Mingyu safe.

The stronger he became, the safer Mingyu would be.

"Take this seal. Someone will guide you to safely leave the Human Race territory." Su Yun produced Qin Junhua's black seal and spoke indifferently.

Just as with his father Su Heng, colluding with the Demon Race was a heaven-defying crime in the Human Race.

As the Su family's Young Master, he naturally couldn't be tainted by such associations.

"Thank you, Master."

Mo Yu accepted the seal, gave Mingyu one deep, lingering look, then resolutely turned and flew swiftly away from the Celestial Maiden Sect, vanishing into the horizon.

"The Black-Winged Demon Emperor, heh."

Su Yun murmured to himself, a cold smile flashing in his eyes.

As an emperor, emotional attachment was the greatest weakness, the ultimate vulnerability.

Such people rarely became emotionally attached. But once they did, it was unwavering until death. So as long as he kept firm control of Mingyu, he had no fear of Mo Yu turning against him.

"Dark Lady, I'm entrusting Mingyu to you. Do you understand what I mean?" Su Yun turned to look at Dark Lady, who had appeared behind him at some point, giving her a meaningful look.

"Your subordinate understands." Dark Lady immediately bowed her head respectfully.

She naturally understood that what Su Yun needed was an absolutely loyal death warrior—a Mingyu who could have Mo Yu wrapped around her finger.

With Mingyu's current Profound Palace Realm cultivation, two years was more than enough time.

"I announce that Celestial Maiden Sect's Holy Maiden Mingyu, having colluded with a Demon Race prince, has been personally slain by Sect Master An Ruoyi and True Feather Divine Spirit to purge the sect of traitors." Su Yun's indifferent voice echoed through the firmament.

In this moment, the many Celestial Maiden Sect elders and peak masters fell silent.

This was already the best possible outcome.

With the Holy Maiden colluding with the Demon Race, Su Yun would have been justified in destroying the entire Celestial Maiden Sect—no one could have said a word against it.

"Ruoyi, on behalf of the entire Celestial Maiden Sect, thanks Young Master Su Yun for his mercy."

"In gratitude for the Su family purging our sect of this great threat, I announce that I will marry into the Su family to become Su Yun's second concubine."

"Furthermore, I as Sect Master will personally lead the sect's powerhouses and five thousand disciples to the American continent to support Council Member Su Heng in the campaign against the Barbarian Tribe, demonstrating China's might."

An Ruoyi's majestic voice rang through the mountain ranges: "Hereby, in my capacity as Celestial Maiden Sect's Sect Master, I call upon all worldly-transcendent sects to enthusiastically participate in the war, helping Council Member Su Heng in the campaign against the Barbarian Tribe."

In this moment, the mountain ranges fell utterly silent.

Countless powerhouses listened to this voice in stunned disbelief, their minds churning with turbulent emotions.

The Celestial Maiden Sect's Sect Master, An Ruoyi, a Strongest Divine Spirit, was marrying Su Yun... as a concubine?

They felt as if they were dreaming.

One should know that True Feather Divine Spirit had only achieved Strongest Divine Spirit after marrying into the Su family, and she was merely a peak master who couldn't represent the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

"This is utterly insane."

"The Celestial Maiden Sect emphasizes entering the mortal world before transcending it. In a thousand years of heritage, barely any disciples have ever married out—and now the Sect Master is marrying out, and as a concubine at that."

"The powerhouses and sects of the Daoist tradition must be going crazy!"

"If the Daoist tradition's founder were still alive, would he be so furious he'd come back to life just to die again?"

"Honor and disgrace aside, have you considered that An Ruoyi becoming Su Yun's concubine symbolizes the Celestial Maiden Sect's submission to the Su family?"

"This is the first time a worldly-transcendent sect has ever submitted to a secular family. The rules of the worldly-transcendent sects standing above worldly affairs have been publicly broken by Su Yun."

"Does this represent the Su family's—or the four great families'—attitude toward worldly-transcendent sects?"

...

In this moment, throughout the mountain ranges, countless sects were shaking in fear.

Rules had been broken. If even the Celestial Maiden Sect couldn't withstand the Su family's million-strong army, and the Buddhist Sect and other great sects didn't dare speak up, what could they possibly use to resist?

And just then, True Feather Divine Spirit's cold voice also rang through the firmament: "In my capacity as the Kunlun Daoist Sect's Vice Sect Master, wielding the Sect Master Token, I call upon all sects throughout the mountain ranges to enthusiastically participate in the war and proceed to the American continent to campaign against the Barbarian Tribe."

"Those willing to participate may register at the Kunlun Daoist Sect."

At this point, Su Yun gave Yun Ran a meaningful look. Yun Ran immediately understood and stepped forward, saying: "Our Young Master Su Yun, representing the Su family, guarantees to all worldly-transcendent sects: any sect that participates in the campaign against the Barbarian Tribe will be considered a good friend of the Su family—a worldly-transcendent sect loyal and devoted to China. After the campaign concludes, the Su family will issue rewards on behalf of the Federation Supreme Council."

*Hiss!*

In this moment, countless powerhouses felt a chill run down their spines.

If An Ruoyi and True Feather Divine Spirit's words were still a call to arms, Su Yun's statement was nothing short of an open threat.

Participating in the campaign against foreign races made you a good friend of the Su family, a sect loyal and devoted to China.

So if you didn't participate, did that make you an enemy of the Su family? A traitor to China?

"At this moment, Su Yun commands the armies of three great Divine Spirit families—Su, Xuanyuan, and Ouyang. He truly does have the standing to represent China."

"In the thousand years since spiritual qi resurged, never has a secular family's young master openly threatened all worldly-transcendent sects."

"Too arrogant."

"Campaigning against the Barbarian Tribe—how dangerous would that be?"

"Where are the Buddha Ancestor and Confucian Patriarch? Why haven't they spoken up? Are they going to just watch this secular person wreak such havoc upon our worldly-transcendent sects?"

Countless worldly-transcendent powerhouses were shaking in their boots, yet none dared voice any opposition. With a million-strong army present, who dared express dissatisfaction? Did they want to die?

Let alone the Celestial Maiden Sect and Kunlun Daoist Sect.

They all turned their gazes toward the Buddhist Sect, Confucian School, and other powerful worldly-transcendent sects, hoping these two Strongest Divine Spirits of equal standing to Su Heng would speak up.

And just then, a golden Buddha-light slowly spread from the horizon, illuminating the mountain ranges.
