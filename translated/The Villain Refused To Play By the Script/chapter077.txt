Chapter 77: Unexpected Harvest

Thunder roared. This was no longer ordinary lightning, but mountains and seas of divine thunder, crashing down in waves like an ocean, engulfing Su Yun within.

The terrifying aura spread so intensely that even a Profound Palace realm powerhouse—stronger than the Divine Profound realm—would be shaken to death if they approached.

Yet who could imagine that Su Yun, enduring the tribulation within, was merely at the Divine Profound realm?

A hundred dragons roared, their cries shaking the heavens. The sound waves formed by the dragon roars actually shattered the divine thunder into nothingness, unable to even approach Su Yun's body.

The terrifying heavenly thunder spread, and the palace where Su Yun resided was directly reduced to powder.

Beneath the tribulation, chaos light flowed across Su Yun's body, dazzling and brilliant like a god. The rolling divine thunder couldn't even get close to him before being annihilated.

He stood amid the tribulation as though immune to all calamities.

"Even a Heaven Spirit realm powerhouse would have a nine-out-of-ten chance of death in there." Ling Yan and Yun Ran, the strongest of the four women, were so shocked they nearly stopped breathing.

They were both peak Heaven Spirit realm powerhouses, with the Profound Palace realm still between them and the Divine Profound realm.

In terms of cultivation, they were a full two major realms above Su Yun.

Yet they could clearly sense that even if they were in that tribulation, they absolutely wouldn't be as relaxed as Su Yun.

"A hundred dragons—an unprecedented realm."

"The Young Master's physical body and yuan energy have reached an unimaginable level, comparable to the true ancient gods in their youth."

The two women gasped repeatedly.

"Slay!"

At that moment, Xuanyuan Jian let out a cry, her eyes flashing with divine light. Above her, a golden sword projection appeared—a golden dragon roaring on its hilt—and slashed toward the tribulation clouds.

At the same time, Su Yun slowly opened his eyes within the tribulation clouds. Divine light flashed in them as the Kunlun Mirror appeared above his head, divine radiance hazy, and he struck out with a heaven-shaking blow.

The two ancient divine weapons combined forces, piercing through the sky. The tribulation clouds were directly cleared away, and the divine thunder filling the sky vanished.

"I'm only at the Divine Profound realm, yet I've already faced heavenly tribulation."

Su Yun's gaze was cold, his lips curling slightly.

He remembered that in the original novel, Ye Ling had only faced heavenly tribulation at the Profound Palace realm, shocking all of China and being hailed as a prodigy that appeared only once in five hundred years.

Facing tribulation at the Profound Palace realm made one a once-in-an-era prodigy.

Then what did it mean that he faced tribulation at the Divine Profound realm?

"The only pity is that one wisp of Ye Ling's remnant soul escaped."

Thinking of this, Su Yun shook his head.

The Five Elemental Divine Battalions had pursued Ye Ling, killing their way into the endless void. Under the encirclement of five Divine Generals and fifty thousand soldiers, the chance of escape should have been essentially zero.

But because of the Su family's internal direct-line conspirators, he had no choice but to recall the Five Divine Battalions early, inadvertently letting one wisp of Ye Ling's soul escape.

"But so what?"

Cold light flashed in Su Yun's eyes as he slowly stood up. Divine light flowed across his bare upper body, radiating powerful strength.

In the original novel, at the peak of his destiny, Ye Ling had only reached the hundred-million extreme at the Qi-Blood realm and ninety-nine dragon power at the Divine Profound realm.

But he had broken through the limit at the Qi-Blood realm.

At the Divine Profound realm, he had broken through the limit again.

What could Ye Ling possibly use to compare to him?

Moreover, after he had repeatedly twisted fate and devoured destiny, Ye Ling's original divine artifacts and women had all been taken by him. Even if Ye Ling had escaped by luck, his destiny could no longer be called unrivaled.

With only a wisp of remnant soul remaining, his foundation was severely damaged. Even if he relied on his powerful destiny to luckily reconstruct his body, he was no longer on the same level as Su Yun.

Su Yun's gaze swept past Yun Ran, Ling Yan, and Xuanyuan Jian, pausing slightly on Liu Ting before his lips curled with cold amusement.

In the original novel, Liu Ting had cuckolded him, joining with Ye Ling to kill him, giving her Sunflower Water Physique to Ye Ling and helping him achieve greatness.

But this time, Liu Ting had knelt and begged to become his servant. The massive yin energy contained in her Sunflower Water Physique had become a powerful aid helping him break through the extreme realm.

Compared to simply killing Liu Ting, Su Yun much more enjoyed this wonderful sensation of twisting fate and seizing everything.

"Ye Ling, the next time we meet, I will personally slay you—this so-called protagonist—seize all your destiny, and make you completely become a stepping stone on my path to the peak."

"I look forward to you gaining more fortuitous encounters. Don't disappoint me!"

Su Yun murmured to himself, then pulled up the system panel.

Host: Su Yun

Martial Soul: Fuxi Martial Soul, Divine Spirit bloodline

Realm: Divine Profound Realm [Hundred Dragon Power]

Cultivation Methods: Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art, God-Devil Scripture

Weapons: God-Devil Pendant [God-Devil Supreme Treasure], Kunlun Mirror [Ancient Supreme Divine Weapon]

Divine Ability: Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes

Charm Value: 21,000 [Mountains and Rivers Lose Color] [Cultivation speed increased 25x]

Seeing these massive improvements, even Su Yun couldn't help but feel pleased.

Annihilating Ye Ling's physical body and suppressing Xuanyuan Li—crippling all his meridians—had actually brought him nearly six thousand charm points.

The cultivation speed boost had even reached twenty-five times, a full five times higher than before.

This was also his greatest aid in breaking through the extreme of ninety-nine dragon power this time.

Now, in a single breath, his cultivation speed was twenty-five times that of other cultivators at the same realm.

"Congratulations, Host, for reshaping the Su family's internal structure. Reward: 3,000 charm points." At that moment, the system notification suddenly sounded.

Charm Value: 24,000 [Mountains and Rivers Lose Color] [Cultivation speed increased 26x]

Instantly, Su Yun's eyes lit up.

Reshaping the Su family's internal structure had brought him tremendous benefits and could also earn such massive charm point rewards—not much less than suppressing a Child of Destiny.

Then as he continued to increase the Su family's strength, even building a supreme empire, wouldn't it bring him even more massive charm points?

As his strength and realm increased, Su Yun's desire for charm points also continued to rise.

After all, as strength increased, cultivation speed would continuously slow.

But he had already tasted the thrill of rapidly soaring strength and realm.

To maintain this pace of constant improvement, he needed to acquire massive charm points to keep raising his cultivation speed.

At that moment, Dark Lady's respectful voice suddenly came from nearby: "Young Master, Dark Lady has something to report."

"Come. What is it?" Su Yun said indifferently, gesturing for the four women to come dress him.

Dark Lady didn't dare delay and immediately walked over with her head lowered, kneeling before Su Yun. "Young Master, Su Yayue has recently been frequently accompanied by a man."

Because Su Yayue's Innate Dao Body was useful to Su Yun, although he had inducted her into his personal guard battalion, he hadn't restricted her movements. He had only ordered the Shadow Soul Guards to keep her under close surveillance.
