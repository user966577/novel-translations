Chapter 112: Four Half-Step Strongest Divine Spirits

"Spirit Barbarian Goddess."

Su Yun murmured to himself, his eyes suddenly narrowing. Above the woman's head, he saw vast and overwhelming destiny qi, like a mighty river rolling endlessly—even surpassing True Feather Divine Spirit's.

Ever since he had severely wounded Ye Ling, leaving him with only a wisp of remnant soul to flee, this was the first time he had seen someone with such immense destiny qi.

He suddenly recalled that in the original story, during the middle-to-late plot, Ye Ling had already cultivated to the strongest Divine Spirit level and was nearly unstoppable on Azure Star.

But a woman from the Barbarian Tribe calling herself Spirit Barbarian Divine Spirit had emerged to battle Ye Ling, fighting all the way into the depths of space.

Could it be that this Spirit Barbarian Goddess was that same Spirit Barbarian Divine Spirit?

Seeing that his father Su Heng had captured the Heavenly Barbarian War God alive, this Barbarian Goddess couldn't sit still. She had actually infiltrated human territory, coming all the way to China to use him in exchange for the Heavenly Barbarian War God.

"Spirit Barbarian Goddess, I admire your courage—daring to infiltrate the Imperial Capital alone."

Su Yun's face was expressionless, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth.

"If you're willing to cooperate with my Su family and suppress the rebellions among your Spirit Barbarian lineage's territories, I might consider persuading my father to release your father, the Heavenly Barbarian War God."

"Courting death! At death's door and you still dare dream of splitting my Barbarian Tribe?"

A flash of violent rage passed through Ling Man's eyes.

"Young Master, leave first!"

At that moment, Yun Ran suddenly barked, striding forward as her overwhelming Saint-level presence spread. Pink mist billowed across the heavens.

"Heavenly Charm Domain."

Yun Ran's expression was blank as she pressed down with her palm. A giant hand filled the sky, directly suppressing toward Ling Man.

But at that instant, a terrifying blast of violent divine might flashed past, directly shattering Yun Ran's technique domain.

"Human ants, courting death!"

A tall, middle-aged Barbarian emerged from the pitch-black sky, his hair disheveled as if he hadn't washed it in years.

But the aura emanating from his body was extremely terrifying—divine might rolling, causing the heavens to distort.

This was clearly a half-step strongest Divine Spirit, a terrifying Barbarian god.

"Ling Man, don't waste words with them. This is the heart of human China after all—powerful beings abound. The few of us working together can only block this space temporarily. We'll be discovered by human powerhouses soon enough."

As he spoke, he slapped out with one palm, sending Yun Ran flying. She was already coughing up blood in mid-air.

Before a half-step supreme Divine Spirit, even she—with her Heavenly Charm Body as a Saint—had no power to resist. The gap was simply too vast.

"Alright, Uncle."

Ling Man strode toward Su Yun, her gaze wild as she said coldly: "Young Master Su Yun, don't think of resisting. Several half-step supreme Divine Spirits of our Spirit Barbarian lineage have already used a supreme Barbarian weapon to cut this space off from the Imperial Capital. No powerhouse can come to save you.

"Come with me obediently. We only want to exchange your life for my father's. We won't harm you."

"Is that so?"

Seeing Yun Ran sent flying, Su Yun's gaze turned cold. He smiled coldly: "But what if I say no?"

"Today, you have no choice."

Ling Man's eyes were wild. Bronze battle light radiated from her body as dense tattoo runes spread from her neck, crawling up to her forehead, giving off a primal, wild feeling.

With a hum, she struck out with her palm. Light surged vast and endless, blotting out the sun and sky, as she tried to directly seize Su Yun in her grasp.

She herself was a terrifying powerhouse at the Heaven Spirit Realm.

Moreover, several half-step supreme Barbarian gods stood watch nearby, having sealed off space. Their terrifying pressure enveloped Su Yun, making every hair on his body stand on end.

This was absolutely the greatest crisis he had faced since coming to this world.

Who could have imagined that just as the news of his father's great victory over the Barbarians had arrived, the Barbarian Goddess and several half-step supreme Barbarian gods had secretly infiltrated China, trying to capture him alive?

"Greater Thousand Worlds."

Su Yun's gaze was cold to the extreme, devoid of any emotion. He growled.

At such moments, he grew even calmer than usual.

Two lifetimes had given him a powerful soul.

"Rumble, rumble..."

In an instant, the ten-thousand-zhang mountain-and-river Profound Palace materialized above Su Yun's head, erupting with rolling radiance. Endless vital energy gathered and struck directly into the infinite void, as if connecting to some unknown place.

"How is this possible?"

At that moment, several horrified growls came from the pitch-black sky.

"What kind of technique is this? It can actually pierce through the supreme Barbarian weapon's barrier and connect to the infinite void!"

"The Divine Spirits in the Imperial Capital will sense it soon. Stop trying to conceal our space—attack together and seize him!"

"Hum, hum, hum..."

Instantly, multiple massive divine presences erupted.

Faintly, one could see four towering figures standing in the chaotic void, their hair disheveled, driving a large bone-shaped Barbarian weapon. Strange runes radiated endlessly, sealing space and seemingly shrinking the Imperial Capital into a small spherical world.

And in the infinite void, the divine might unleashed by Greater Thousand Worlds pierced through endless space, connecting to some unfathomable region.

"Who dares attack in my Imperial Capital!"

"It's Barbarian Divine Spirits!"

Soon, deep and terrifying voices rang out from within the Imperial Capital, along with terrifying collision sounds, as if multiple formidable existences were attacking together, constantly bombarding this unknown world.

"Damn it!"

Ling Man's expression changed dramatically.

"Boom!"

At that moment, a terrifying wave of power returned from the infinite void, surging into Su Yun's ten-thousand-zhang mountains and rivers, carrying the power of the Greater Thousand Worlds.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

At this moment, an ancient, simple mirror appeared in Su Yun's hand. He channeled the power of the Greater Thousand Worlds directly into it.

"Rumble, rumble..."

Instantly, the Kunlun Mirror spun with a tremendous rumble, expanding like a celestial body, growing madly until it filled the sky, directly sending Ling Man flying.

"He has an ancient divine weapon!" Ling Man cried out in shock.

"Rumble, rumble..."

At this point, the terrifying sounds of battle from within the Imperial Capital grew even more fearsome, with divine might rolling.

"Little wretch, you've brought this upon yourself. Don't blame me!"

One of the half-step supreme Barbarian gods growled, abandoning his efforts to drive the supreme Barbarian weapon. He struck directly at Su Yun with his palm.
