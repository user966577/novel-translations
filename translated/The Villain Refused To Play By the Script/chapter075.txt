Chapter 75: You're the Ones Who Forced Me to Kill

"Su Yun, wait."

At that moment, Su Hong suddenly spoke, his voice hoarse. He seemed to have seen something and stepped forward, blocking Su Yun's view of the other direct-line members.

"If I hand over my power, and my family no longer interferes in internal affairs, will all past offenses truly be written off?"

Su Hong stared intently into Su Yun's eyes, as if trying to see through him completely.

"As long as you don't violate my principles, I guarantee your family will remain part of the Su family's direct line and continue to enjoy resource allocation as before," Su Yun said coldly.

If he could get them to hand over power smoothly, he naturally didn't mind expending a bit of resources to support a bunch of useless people.

Once time passed, their influence would fade along with their withdrawal from power. It would just be a matter of course—people leaving, tea growing cold. At that point, he could deal with them however he pleased.

"Furthermore, as long as someone truly pledges loyalty to me and has real ability, I don't mind granting them even greater power."

"The Chaotic Sky King Su Lie is your example."

"Alright. I'll hand over my power. From now on, my family will never interfere in Su family internal affairs, and we'll sever all ties with Xuanyuan Ze."

Su Hong's voice was hoarse as he stared fixedly into Su Yun's eyes. "Now, can you release my sons and grandsons?"

"I'm old. I can't stand seeing bloody scenes."

"This world belongs to you young people."

Su Yun smiled. "Of course. Grand-Uncle is truly a straightforward person. You've set an excellent example."

"From now on within the Su family, Grand-Uncle will still be my elder. As long as your sons and grandsons do their jobs well, I, Su Yun, will never mistreat them."

"Yun Ran, go tell Dark Lady to have Grand-Uncle's sons and grandsons complete the handover of everything."

"Yes, Young Master!"

Yun Ran's gaze was cold as she immediately strode out of the hall.

In that moment, the direct-line elders were all stunned. Their faces flushed red, eyes bloodshot with rage as they glared at Su Hong.

"Su Hong, have you gone senile?"

"Su Yun is a wolf in sheep's clothing. If you give in now, he'll tear you apart later!"

"Don't you understand that just being alive is a threat to him?"

"Their branch just wants to seize all of the Su family's power for themselves!"

"What good does betraying us do you?"

Angry accusations rose and fell.

Su Hong was the strongest among them, with the highest seniority.

His taking the lead in submitting to Su Yun was a huge blow to their will.

"Enough!"

"If you want to die, go die on your own!"

Su Hong turned, his murky eyes exploding with divine might as he bellowed, "Have all of you forgotten that Su Yun's branch is the Patriarch's line?"

"The Patriarch's command is heaven!"

"Are you trying to prioritize your own interests over the collective interests of the Su family?"

"This old man is done here. Farewell!"

With that, Su Hong's expression darkened as he strode away.

This time, he had truly been screwed over by these greedy fools.

Handing everything over—how could he not feel the pain?

But he could see clearly that Su Yun was determined to concentrate all of the Su family's power in his own hands.

From Su Yun's series of actions, he could tell this was a madman—heartless, ruthless, willing to do anything.

Moreover, Su Heng had given him even the Patriarch Token. Though Su Heng wasn't present, this made his stance clear.

This time, getting Su Yun to compromise was simply impossible.

Resistance had only one outcome: forcing Su Yun into a massacre.

Su Jian's warning words earlier still echoed like thunder in his ears.

He was old. Having lived for several hundred years, he no longer had the ambition of his youth. He couldn't watch his entire family be slaughtered by Su Yun.

Besides, as a powerhouse who had ignited the divine fire, even without controlling power, his status within the Su family was unshakeable.

Su Hong firmly believed this.

So, under Su Yun's relentless pressure, he had retreated.

"Su Hong, come back!" A direct-line elder roared, his voice choked with blood.

Su Hong, Su Lie, Su Yihui—these figures were all among the most important people among the direct line.

Su Hong, especially, was a powerhouse who had ignited the divine fire.

Yet now, all of them had been brought down by Su Yun. How could they continue to resist?

"And what about all of you? Have you made your decision?"

Su Yun's gaze was cold, filled with killing intent. "I don't mind getting a bit more blood on my hands."

Terrifying killing intent swirled throughout the hall.

This time, the direct-line elders fell silent. Su Hong's departure had dealt them a heavy blow.

Looking at Su Yun's cold eyes and young, devilishly handsome face, they truly couldn't imagine how, in such a short time, Su Yun could have undergone such a tremendous transformation.

Before, he had never bothered with internal family affairs.

Yet in just these few days, he had acted with such decisive speed that no one could react before they had been cornered.

This simply wasn't the temperament a newly adult young man should possess.

Ruthless methods, iron will, cold indifference.

All of this would have been understandable from Su Heng, but appearing in Su Yun...

"I'll hand it over. I'll hand everything over."

"From today forward, I will no longer interfere in Su family internal affairs. I hope Su Yun will keep your promise."

"I'll return to my residence and wait. Send someone to handle the handover."

In an instant, three direct-line Saints spoke up in succession, submitting to Su Yun.

As Saint-level powerhouses, their status was noble and their lifespans long. They didn't want to die here like this.

With that, the three Saints, their gazes heavy and filled with helplessness, immediately strode away without even greeting those around them.

"You... all of you..."

"Traitors! Fools!"

"Su Yun is picking us off one by one! You've lived this long and can't even see that?"

"Being played like puppets by a mere child!"

"Damn it, all of you come back!"

Furious roars exploded continuously as several peak-level Saints bellowed in rage.

In that moment, several more Saints' gazes turned sinister. They quietly shifted their feet, moving closer to Su Yun, powerful energy building within their bodies.

He was just a mere Divine Profound realm cultivator, yet he dared treat them like this.

Su Yun was the center of all this. As long as they could kill him in one strike, there was still hope.

Handing over their power was worse than death to them.

"What I love most is your defiant spirit."

"Kill!"

Su Yun's cold voice suddenly rang out.

In his hands, both the Patriarch Token and the Young Master Token appeared simultaneously. Divine light flowed, shrouding his body.

In the deepest reaches of the Su family, within a small dimensional world, the rumbling of a great bell echoed, suppressing heaven and earth, sealing the sky.

The body of the Chaos Bell materialized in the heavens above, chaotic light spreading as mountains, rivers, and all creation released boundless might.

The entire Su family headquarters fell into a state of frozen stillness. Even the bodies of all the Saints were directly immobilized.

Within the Su family headquarters, the Chaos Bell suppressed the family's reserves, perpetually in an awakened state, possessing boundless divine power.

In an instant, four sword gleams flashed simultaneously. The entire world seemed to freeze in that moment.

Four wet, tearing sounds rang out in quick succession. Four heads with sinister expressions flew into the air as blood sprayed across the heavens.

Their bodies remained frozen in the posture of quietly edging toward Su Yun.
