Chapter 44: Who Put You Up to This?

Su Yun's gaze gradually turned cold. He didn't care about Su Ying's words.

What surprised him was that someone within the Su family still dared to stand up for Su Meng—to challenge his authority, or rather, to challenge his father's authority.

After more than ten years, it seemed some people in the Su family were getting restless again.

Or perhaps someone from the Su family's main branch was unhappy about his move against Su Meng, and had hinted for Su Ying to come suppress him.

If it were just Su Ying alone, even with ten times the courage, she wouldn't dare stick her head out like this.

After Su Yun used his "Communicate with All Things" ability to carefully sense his surroundings, he could clearly feel numerous terrifying divine senses projecting toward him, hidden in the endless void, secretly observing this scene.

"It seems my previous behavior made some people in the family look down on me."

Su Yun smiled coldly and suddenly said something seemingly unrelated.

His "previous behavior" naturally referred to the original host's simp behavior toward Liu Ting.

"So, Su Ying, you've come to confront me on Su Meng's behalf?" Su Yun suddenly said, a cold light flickering in his eyes. His form of address changed from "Sister" to her full name.

"So what if I have?"

Su Ying's expression was icy. "Su Yun, don't forget—you're only the Su family's heir, not the patriarch yet. As a direct descendant of the Su family, and as your elder sister, I have every right to help you correct your mistakes."

"Oh? And what do you want?" Su Yun asked with interest.

"Go apologize to Su Meng. And immediately restore the treatment he deserves as a direct descendant of the Su family. Help him heal his body and repair his inner demons."

Su Ying sneered: "Su Meng is a direct descendant of the Su family. This is just giving him back what he should have. Not too much to ask, is it?"

"And in terms of seniority, he's your cousin. Apologizing to him won't be beneath you."

Su Yun laughed.

A brilliant smile.

He didn't know if Su Ying was saying this intentionally or if someone had coached her, but he heard something else entirely.

Giving Su Meng back what he should have.

And what exactly should Su Meng have?

After all, Su Yong had once been the strongest candidate for the patriarch's position. So by that logic, shouldn't the current heir's seat also be something Su Meng "should have"?

And perhaps even the entire Su family?

"Very well. Setting aside right and wrong for now."

Su Yun's smile vanished abruptly. Deep in his eyes lurked a cold intent. "This young master will accompany you to see Su Meng, to see if he's really as miserable as you claim—severely injured, dao heart shattered, on the verge of death."

"Let's go then."

Su Ying smiled coldly and immediately took the lead, flying toward the front. Su Yun followed.

At some point, Yun Ran's figure had quietly disappeared from Su Yun's side.

Soon, they arrived at a dilapidated, moss-covered small courtyard.

This was where Su Meng had been living.

By the standards of the Su family's main branch—their wealth and power—even the most ordinary cleaning lady lived in quarters a hundred times better than Su Meng's.

A heavy, bloody scent wafted from the courtyard.

Clearly, this was the smell of blood Su Meng had coughed up.

"Su Yun, this is what you and your mother have done. Su Meng is a direct descendant of the Su family, yet he lives in a place like this."

Su Ying snorted coldly and strode toward the courtyard.

Su Yun smiled coldly. Right now, he truly wanted to know who was backing Su Ying, giving her the courage to even badmouth his mother, Qin Junhua.

In the courtyard, the door was tightly shut.

"Knock, knock, knock..."

Su Ying stepped forward and knocked several times on the door, saying softly: "Meng'er, your sister has brought Su Yun to apologize to you."

Su Yun's expression was cold as he stood silently, his thoughts unreadable.

Time passed. After about a minute, there was still no response from inside.

Then Su Yun suddenly stepped forward and kicked. The already decrepit door exploded into countless fragments.

"Su Yun, you bastard!" Su Ying flew into a rage, her eyebrows shooting up.

Su Meng was already severely injured with a shattered dao heart. He might already be unconscious—how could he withstand such a shock?

But at that moment, Su Yun pointed indifferently at the interior: "Su Ying, is this the Su Meng you told me about?"

Su Ying turned to look and froze.

The room was empty except for fragments dancing in the air and a musty smell. Not a soul in sight.

On the bed, there was still a pool of wet blood—clearly what Su Meng had just coughed up.

"How is this possible? Just half a day ago, I saw him myself. He told me you beat him severely and helped the Ling family humiliate him, getting him expelled from Lingyun Academy." Su Ying shook her head, somewhat at a loss.

Her branch had been monitoring this courtyard the entire time.

If Su Meng had left, wouldn't her people have reported it?

At that moment, Yun Ran appeared beside Su Yun, having entered from outside the courtyard. She transmitted to him: "Young Master, Steward Zhong has already taken Su Meng through their secret passage. They're setting up a formation to ambush Xuanyuan Li with Ye Ling right now. Xuanyuan Jian is there too."

Su Yun understood. A cold smile crossed his face as he turned to Su Ying, his eyes devoid of emotion, his voice flat: "Ran'er, seize Su Ying."

The reason he had followed Su Ying here was that he didn't want a mere Su Ying to interfere with Su Meng and disrupt his plans.

In an instant, Su Ying's expression changed drastically. She erupted in fury: "Su Yun, how dare you! I am a direct descendant of the Su family, daughter of a Heavenly King! What right do you have to order your servant to seize me!"

But at that moment, Yun Ran's figure appeared instantly at her side. With just one hand, she overwhelmed Su Ying completely, forcing her to her knees before Su Yun.

"What right?"

Su Yun smiled coldly. He crouched down, one hand gripping Su Ying's face as he spoke icily: "Because I am Su Yun. Because I am the Su family's heir. Because I am the son of Su Heng and Qin Junhua."

"Is that enough?"

"Hummm!"

In that instant, a terrifying aura erupted from Su Yun. Chaotic power surged as nine chaotic divine dragons materialized, roaring, shaking the very heavens.

Su Yun gripped Su Ying's fair face, his gaze merciless. His dragon-like hand lifted her into the air. The sound of shattering bones rang out continuously as blood dripped from her face onto the ground.

"Speak. Who put you up to challenging me? Was it your father, Chaos Heavenly King Su Lie?"

In that instant, within the Su family's main compound, wind and clouds churned. Terrifying breathing sounds echoed, causing the very weather to shift.
