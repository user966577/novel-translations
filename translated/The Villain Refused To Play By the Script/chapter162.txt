Chapter 162: The Assassin

*Hum!*

"Ten Thousand Swords Return to Origin!"

Su Jian's expression was grave. For the first time, a longsword appeared in his hand. With a single slash, the tribulation clouds were cleaved in two.

True Feather Divine Spirit then used her supreme divine technique, unleashing divine might to blast half of the tribulation clouds into the endless void, attempting to extinguish them.

But at that moment, endless destructive laws of heaven and earth gathered once more, reconstituting the tribulation clouds. Bolts of Nine Heavens Divine Thunder condensed out of thin air and crashed directly into Su Yun's small world.

"It's useless. Blue Star has only undergone one revival and hasn't yet reached the pinnacle of ancient times. It cannot accommodate a 990,000-zhang Profound Palace."

An Ruoyi's face was deathly pale as she said: "The Young Master's breakthrough to the ultimate of Profound Palace Realm has triggered Blue Star's destructive laws. Unless it strikes the Young Master down from the ultimate level, the tribulation thunder will be endless."

At this moment, True Feather Divine Spirit and Su Jian also realized this point, their expressions turning pale.

"Destructive tribulation."

Just then, Su Yun opened his eyes. Chaotic mist swirled within them. Faintly, one could see two wheels—one golden, one white—rotating within his eyes before they burst forth into his Mountains and Rivers Profound Palace world.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

The twin wheels intertwined, manifesting endless vitality and repairing the damaged Mountains and Rivers Profound Palace, restoring it instantly to its peak of 990,000 zhang.

Then the twin wheels flew into the firmament, releasing infinite divine might. They seemed to transform into a divine sun and a bright moon, rotating in alternation, illuminating the world.

In this moment, endless vitality began to nurture within the Mountains and Rivers world. Through the Sun Essence Wheel and Moon Essence Wheel, they directly pierced through Blue Star's firmament, connecting to the starry void, drawing down rolling stellar power. This severed the connection between the Profound Palace and Blue Star, forming its own self-contained cycle.

Instantly, the endless Purple Heaven Divine Thunder that had been crashing into the world seemed to have entered another realm entirely. It was directly ground away by the world's own laws, transforming into rolling vitality that began nourishing the Mountains and Rivers Profound Palace.

*Boom, boom, boom...*

At this moment, the will of Blue Star seemed to fly into a rage. The tribulation clouds grew even denser. Endless Purple Heaven Divine Thunder condensed, blotting out the sky and sun, like an ocean of divine thunder crashing directly into the Mountains and Rivers Profound Palace.

Without exception, every bolt was ground away by the world, transformed into nutrients for the Mountains and Rivers world.

*Hum!*

And at that moment, the Mountains and Rivers world, drawing upon the endless destructive power of the Purple Heaven Divine Thunder, advanced one step further, breaking through 990,000 zhang to reach one million zhang.

Then, as if some limit had been shattered, it began expanding frantically once more.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

Endless stellar power and divine thunder power were absorbed by the small world, transformed into fuel for its expansion.

One million zhang.

1.1 million zhang.

1.2 million zhang.

...

At this moment, An Ruoyi, True Feather Divine Spirit, and Su Jian stood frozen in place, their entire bodies numb.

They could no longer describe what they were witnessing.

What two Strongest Divine Spirits and one powerhouse rivaling the Strongest Divine Spirits couldn't accomplish by protecting him—Su Yun had resolved. Moreover, from within that crisis, he had seized the opportunity, shattering the limits of the Profound Palace Realm.

A 1.2-million-zhang Profound Palace—who had ever seen such a thing?

Certainly not them.

Even though they had now achieved Strongest Divine Spirit and their small worlds had already nurtured life—little ants, fleas, fish, and other ordinary creatures—their small worlds remained at Profound Palace Realm size.

Trying to improve them was virtually impossible.

And now, in this short time, with endless Purple Heaven Divine Thunder crashing down along with stellar power, the Mountains and Rivers Profound Palace had actually reached 1.9 million zhang. Even more terrifying, it was still expanding, seemingly without limit.

"Could the Young Master be trying to create a perfect great world comparable to Blue Star?" Su Jian's voice trembled.

"A man who creates the impossible." True Feather Divine Spirit's voice was hoarse.

An Ruoyi's face was flushed with excitement: "He is my husband, An Ruoyi's husband."

In this moment, all three had reached the peak of excitement and exhilaration.

"Look!"

Just then, Su Jian's gaze shook violently. He suddenly pointed into the Mountains and Rivers world, where small fish the size of fingernails were beginning to appear in a stream.

"The Young Master has broken through to Heaven Spirit Realm." True Feather Divine Spirit and An Ruoyi's eyes filled with joy.

Soon, schools of small fish were born within the world.

Little ants, insects, and more.

Before long, even large beasts and flying birds began to be born.

"This..."

The three of them found themselves completely numb.

Even they, with their current Profound Palace worlds, had only nurtured small creatures. Wanting to nurture a large beast was incomparably difficult, unless they actively created one themselves.

At the Heaven Spirit Realm, the stronger the creatures within one's Profound Palace world, the more power it could contain, representing stronger laws.

The vitality and laws that were being nurtured indicated how powerful someone was at the Heaven Spirit Realm.

In other words, the moment Su Yun broke through to Heaven Spirit Realm, he was already invincible within that realm. And this enhancement, with the stellar power continuously pouring in, would continue to grow.

Meanwhile, Blue Star's will seemed to have realized it couldn't destroy Su Yun. Moreover, his small world had already become self-contained, transcending Blue Star. The tribulation clouds across the sky gradually dissipated.

"Tell me—could the Young Master now battle a Saint-level powerhouse?" An Ruoyi asked excitedly.

True Feather Divine Spirit and Su Jian shook their heads, their pupils contracting slightly. They too harbored vague suspicions, but dared not voice them.

What was a 'Saint'?

The Saint realm—transcendent and extraordinary, having surpassed ordinary beings. With a wave of the hand, one could destroy mountains and rivers for hundreds of miles, twist the laws of heaven and earth, establish a sect, and command a territory of a hundred thousand miles.

In the Imperial Capital, Saints were the ancestral figures of great families.

Yet Su Yun was only twenty years old at this moment.

Twenty years old, rivaling a Saint—far too shocking for the world.

"But shattering the Profound Palace limits, transcending Blue Star—is that not another form of transcendence?"

An Ruoyi smiled: "The Saint realm transcends, but we Strongest Divine Spirits, though we can pluck stars and seize moons, are still constrained by Blue Star, unable to continue advancing. Generation after generation of Strongest Divine Spirits have had no choice but to venture into the starry void, seeking unknown territories."

"In our generation, Blue Star has finally shown signs of a second revival, but we've already waited a thousand years."

True Feather Divine Spirit and Su Jian nodded thoughtfully.

*Hum!*

But just then, a dark gleam flashed past, containing terrifying, restrained killing intent.

"Who's there!"

Instantly, An Ruoyi gave a low shout, a flash of killing intent passing through her eyes as she looked sharply toward Su Yun's direction.

"It's an assassin from the Island Nation's ninja lineage."

"Courting death!"

All three erupted in rage, striking simultaneously.
