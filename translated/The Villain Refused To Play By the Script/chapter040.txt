Chapter 40: What Does Dominance Look Like? This Is It

The atmosphere in the auction hall had cooled considerably. For a long while, no one placed a bid.

After all, even the Azure Blue Auction House couldn't determine the jade pendant's origins. And it was only half a pendant—who knew where the other half might be.

Being impervious to fire and water, and undamageable even by a Heaven Spirit Realm expert—these two points simply weren't enough to attract the distinguished figures here.

"One thousand pounds of origin stones."

After several breaths, an ordinary prodigy finally called out a casual bid, treating it as a gamble, hoping to get lucky.

"Fifteen hundred pounds of origin stones."

"Sixteen hundred pounds of origin stones."

People continued bidding, but the price rose at a glacial pace. Everyone seemed thoroughly disinterested.

Seeing this, Ye Ling grew even more excited, struggling to suppress his agitation.

He had to stay calm. He must stay calm. No need to rush. He couldn't arouse anyone's suspicion.

But just then, an indifferent voice echoed through the hall:

"One million pounds of origin stones."

Instantly, the entire hall went silent. Even the old auctioneer's body trembled with surprise.

This was a scene he had anticipated. He hadn't expected this broken jade pendant to fetch any real price—it was just meant to cool things down before the true finale.

All eyes immediately turned toward the Heaven-class private room. The indifferent voice had come from there.

In other words, it was the Su family's young master, Su Yun.

He had taken an interest in this jade pendant of unknown origin.

Of course, this was merely speculation.

After all, one million pounds of origin stones was nothing to the Su family—not even a drop in the bucket, just pocket change. Perhaps Su Yun simply wanted to buy a toy.

The truly powerful, the supreme figures, often had peculiar hobbies. Occasionally throwing around money was perfectly normal.

In an instant, silence blanketed the hall. No one else bid.

Spending one million origin stones on a broken jade pendant, competing against the Su family's young master—unless they were insane.

The moment Su Yun bid, everyone assumed the matter was settled. The old auctioneer thought the same and was about to announce that the pendant belonged to Su Yun.

"One million one hundred thousand pounds of origin stones."

Then Ye Ling's trembling voice rang out, stunning everyone present.

Had this fellow lost his mind?

Spending over a million origin stones on a broken jade pendant?

Or had he discovered something special about it?

Su Yun bidding was one thing—but Ye Ling bidding this high struck everyone as strange.

"Su Yun, you bastard, you're trying to oppose me again."

Inside the "Wasteland"-class private room, Ye Ling snarled under his breath, his eyes bloodshot with fury. He had suppressed himself for so long. Everything had been going fine as he waited for the right moment. And now, Su Yun had appeared out of nowhere yet again.

One million one hundred thousand pounds of origin stones—though far below the God-Devil Pendant's true value—was enough to raise suspicions.

At that moment, after a brief pause from the Heaven-class private room, Su Yun's voice rang out: "One hundred million pounds of origin stones."

Instantly, the entire hall stopped breathing, utterly stunned.

This price was too overwhelming.

From one million straight to one hundred million—not even giving Ye Ling a chance to compete. Completely and utterly shut down.

As if to say: you think you're qualified to bid against me?

An unprecedented, astronomical sum.

Even the old auctioneer was completely dumbstruck. His face flushed crimson, his entire body trembling with excitement.

Never before had the Imperial Capital's Azure Blue Auction House achieved such a sale price.

This was an enormous opportunity. Even the Federation Auction House headquarters would take notice. His career was about to change.

In that instant, Ye Ling was stupefied by the price. His body went rigid, his jaw slack, his eyes glazed, standing frozen in place, unable to speak.

Completely and utterly dominated.

All the origin stones he possessed didn't even amount to half of one hundred million.

How could he possibly compete?

Liu Ting and Xuanyuan Jian were also thoroughly stunned by this overwhelmingly domineering bid. They exchanged glances, speechless for a long moment.

"Perhaps... this is who he really is." Liu Ting's eyes filled with bitterness as she managed a strained smile.

She truly couldn't reconcile this Su Yun with the one who used to grovel before her, desperate and shameless.

They were like two completely different people.

She couldn't deny it—this Su Yun made her heart race even more. He had seeped into her very bones.

"Su Yun."

Xuanyuan Jian also fell silent, murmuring his name to herself. In this moment, that name was permanently etched into her memory.

Though she was the second young miss of the Xuanyuan family, and her clan's assets were substantial, she had never been valued or treated well—targeted at every turn. From the day she was born, she had never seen such a vast sum of origin stones.

Xuanyuan Jian couldn't help but glance at the dazed Ye Ling before immediately looking away.

This selfish, petty man, compared to Su Yun... No, there was simply no comparison. It was like placing garbage next to origin stones—a difference in fundamental quality.

A long time passed. The entire hall remained frozen in stunned silence, the sound of breathing barely audible.

One hundred million origin stones—that was nearly half the total assets of an ordinary major family in the Imperial Capital.

An astronomical price.

No one had ever been mad enough to offer such a sum for something of completely unknown value.

But the Su family's young master had that privilege.

One hundred million origin stones was merely a drop in the ocean for the Su family, whose assets spanned the entire globe.

After a prolonged silence, the old auctioneer's voice finally broke the stillness. His words came out trembling: "Congratulations to the honored guest in the Heaven-class private room for winning this jade pendant half at the astronomical price of one hundred million origin stones."

As he finished speaking, he practically jogged up to the second floor, respectfully presenting the pendant to Yun Ran, who had stepped out to receive it.

No one mocked him for his humble behavior.

If someone offered them one hundred million origin stones, they would gladly kneel and lick Su Yun's toes.

One hundred million origin stones was enough to completely change, to utterly transform a person's fate.

"Su Yun, I'll never rest until you're dead. I will kill you." Ye Ling let out a roar, no longer able to contain his aura. It surged forth like raging waves, his killing intent soaring to the heavens.

This was an enormous fortune that could have changed his destiny once more—and Su Yun had snatched it away.

His chance to rise had been cut short.

How could Ye Ling not hate him?

But what Ye Ling didn't realize was that his every movement—including his excitement upon seeing the God-Devil Pendant—had been observed by a pair of indifferent eyes.

"The God-Devil Pendant, is it?"

Su Yun looked at the half-pendant in his hand, the corner of his lips curving upward.

In the original story, this pendant was one of Ye Ling's greatest treasures—the foundation upon which he dominated the world. Su Yun never imagined it would appear here at the Azure Blue Auction House.

It seemed his presence had changed the original plot considerably. Like a butterfly gently flapping its wings in one hemisphere, only to trigger a hurricane in the other—every small change had created massive ripples in the original trajectory.

As expected of a Child of Destiny with heaven-defying luck. Because of his continuous suppression, this tremendous fortune had appeared ahead of schedule.

If he hadn't been watching Ye Ling closely, the other half might truly have fallen into his hands.

And at that very moment, the old man's solemn voice rang out once more:

"I now announce the auction of this event's final, headlining item: the Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine contract."
