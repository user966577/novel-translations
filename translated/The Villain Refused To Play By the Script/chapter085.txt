Chapter 85: Disgraced All the Way to the Pacific Ocean

The Su family gates were decorated with lanterns and festive ornaments. Maidservants carrying various precious spirit fruits arranged the Su family's great hall like flowing water.

Various rarely seen powerhouses and important figures stood in small clusters of threes and twos outside the gates.

The important figures from the Su family, gathered from all corners of the world, along with leaders of various factions, were all smiles, joy evident in their eyes.

The important figures from the Xuanyuan family, however, all wore unpleasant expressions. When greeting familiar faces from the Su family, they could only force out strained smiles.

It couldn't be helped. The Xuanyuan family headquarters' decision to establish an alternate heir and marry her into the Su family made them feel they couldn't hold their heads up.

Too disgraceful!

This was inherently humiliating behavior—equivalent to bowing to the Su family.

It was shameful enough that they had done it. It was bad enough that the Su family was publicizing it so grandly. But why were those people at Xuanyuan family headquarters joining in the spectacle?

They simply couldn't understand.

They felt like Xuanyuan Ze and those power-holders in the Xuanyuan family's supreme council had all lost their minds, issuing a strict order for them to drop whatever they were doing and rush to the Imperial Capital at full speed.

They had thought it was something important.

They never expected they were being sent to the Su family's doorstep to be trampled on, to let all of China have a good laugh at the Xuanyuan family's expense.

"Disgraced all the way to the Pacific Ocean."

"What kind of family head is Xuanyuan Ze? Is he incompetent, or is his brain full of shit?"

"It's like we're being gift-wrapped for the Su family."

"How will the other ancient clans of China look at us Xuanyuan family members now? Are we even going to do business anymore?"

"Goddammit, it's not just China! This has spread all the way to the Western Gods' Mountain. I was in the middle of negotiating with someone from Athena's faction and was planning to roll around in bed with that winged broad tonight. The moment this news came through, the way that blonde bitch looked at me completely changed."

...

"Groveling and shameless—has Xuanyuan Ze gone soft in the bones? Is he going to kneel down and wag his tail at the Su family?"

"After this, we must demand an explanation from Xuanyuan Ze."

"I can't swallow this humiliation."

The more the Xuanyuan family's important figures discussed it, the more their hearts ached, their faces turning iron-green.

As leaders of subsidiary forces, companies, and factories under a Divine Spirit family, every time they returned to the Imperial Capital in the past, they had walked with their heads held high, commanding all eyes.

But this time, they felt the gazes from the other Imperial Capital family heads and old-generation elders were full of peculiarity.

But they couldn't blame anyone else.

How could those gazes not be strange?

Throughout all the ancient families in the world, there had never been a family head who established an alternate heir, let alone married her off to another family.

Disgraced all the way to the Americas, all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

As important figures from throughout the Imperial Capital arrived one after another...

At that moment, the Su family gates slowly opened, dazzling divine light shooting out from within, brilliant and resplendent, as if a blazing sun were slowly rising from within.

The sonorous tolling of bells emerged from the pocket dimension deep within the Su family compound, shaking heaven and earth. Ancient essence was infused with an air of celebration.

The vast shadow of the Chaos Bell appeared in the sky, projecting an image of mountains and rivers stretching millions of miles. What had been a street of blue stone suddenly transformed into mountains, rivers, and streams, spiritual energy rising, spiritual cranes dancing, spirit apes calling—a scene brimming with vitality.

The numerous important figures of the Imperial Capital all gasped, shocked by the Su family's heaven-and-earth-altering methods. In an instant, without a sound, they had all been transported into this space through a manipulation of space-time.

This was the supreme power of an ancient divine weapon.

And it demonstrated the terrifying depth of the Su family's reserves.

After all, activating this ancient divine weapon required an astronomical amount of resources beyond imagination.

"Hahaha, what skill the Young Master has!"

"For our Su family Young Master's engagement ceremony, it's only fitting that it shock the entire world. Using an ancient divine weapon for an engagement is probably unprecedented since the resurgence of spiritual energy."

"After this generation brings our Su family to its peak, we truly do need a grand celebration to prove the Su family's might to the entire world."

...

The important figures from the Su family's global operations stood even taller, basking in the glow of others' astonishment.

"It's just an ancient divine weapon. Our Xuanyuan family once had one too," said one Xuanyuan family important figure, his voice tinged with bitterness.

The other Xuanyuan family important figures' expressions were equally grim.

Ever since losing the Xuanyuan Sword, the Xuanyuan family's decline had seemed unstoppable.

This time, headquarters' fools had made this idiotic move, dealing yet another massive blow to the Xuanyuan family's already fading prestige.

They deeply felt that the Su family was rubbing salt in their wounds.

At that moment, a massive vortex suddenly split open in the sky, and waves of terrifying supreme might emanated from within.

The first to emerge was an elderly man in formal attire, his expression solemn.

The moment he stepped out of the vortex, heaven and earth fell silent. The entire world seemed to submit at his feet, his presence noble beyond measure.

He was none other than a powerhouse who had ignited his divine fire—Su Hong, the most senior member of the current Su family generation.

"Su Hong, leading the Su family's direct-line powerhouses, respectfully welcomes the Young Master."

Su Hong's voice rang like a great bell, shaking heaven and earth, causing the Xuanyuan family powerhouses and Su family powerhouses below to freeze simultaneously, keenly noticing two particular words in Su Hong's declaration.

Respectfully welcomes?

Su Hong said he respectfully welcomes Su Yun, the Su family heir?

They were all important figures in both Divine Spirit families—akin to regional governors, with high status and great authority.

And since the two families had been openly competing, secretly fighting, and intermarrying for a thousand years, they naturally had considerable knowledge of Imperial Capital affairs.

Su Hong was a Divine Spirit who had ignited his divine fire.

His seniority was extremely high. Even when meeting the current Su family patriarch Su Heng, he didn't need to bow—they were equals.

Let alone facing Su Yun, the heir—shouldn't Su Yun be calling him Grand-Uncle?

They couldn't understand what had happened within the two families' Imperial Capital headquarters.

"Chaotic Sky King Su Lie, respectfully welcomes the Young Master."

The second figure to step out of the rift was Su Lie.

"Green Wood Heavenly King Su Zhi, respectfully welcomes the Young Master."

"Su Yihui, respectfully welcomes the Young Master."

...

One after another, the Su family's important direct-line figures stepped out of the rift, bowing at the waist, standing in the sky behind Su Hong, all calling out in unison: "Congratulations on the Young Master's engagement."

In an instant, wind and clouds shifted. The Chaos Bell rang out with thunderous tolls.

It was like thunder exploding in the hearts of all the Su family's important figures, leaving them dumbstruck.

At this moment, they vaguely realized that something incredible had changed within the Su family headquarters.

This display wasn't like welcoming a Young Master's engagement ceremony—it was like receiving the Su family patriarch.

And at that moment, a majestic voice rang out, shaking heaven and earth.

"Xuanyuan family Vice Patriarch, Federation Alternate Council Member Xuanyuan Chong, leading the Xuanyuan family headquarters' direct-line powerhouses, congratulates Young Master Su Yun and alternate heir Xuanyuan Jian on their engagement."

At this moment, the faces of all the Xuanyuan family's important figures instantly turned iron-green.

And when they saw what appeared next, they wished they could find a crack in the ground to crawl into.
