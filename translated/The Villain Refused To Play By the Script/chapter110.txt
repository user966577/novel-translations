Chapter 110: Paying Respects to the Young Master

"Su Heng the Divine Spirit—made a god through a single battle!"

"The Su family's prestige will reach its supreme peak through this battle."

...

Throughout the Imperial Capital, countless powerhouses were shaken, excited, exhilarated.

Many of them weren't even subordinate families or forces of the Su family.

Yet they still felt proud.

Because Su Heng represented the human race in the campaign against the ancient myriad races.

This wasn't just the Su family's glory—it was the pride of the entire human race.

"Su Heng, you really are something."

Even the Kunlun Divine Spirit was shaken beyond measure, unable to calm his Dao heart for a long time.

After all, Su Heng wasn't the first to campaign against the ancient myriad races, but he was the first to achieve victory.

Those before him had either suffered crushing defeats or died—died beyond the borders of human territory.

Very quickly, the Kunlun Divine Spirit's eyes lit up.

Because of this news, the Su family would inevitably become the pride of the human race.

Then the matter of True Feather Divine Spirit becoming Su Yun's concubine might no longer be the Kunlun Daoist Sect's shame—it might become their glory instead. No one would dare criticize them anymore.

With the Su family's prestige at its peak and the Kunlun Daoist Sect having married into the Su family, this would shake the entire world of reclusive sects.

This time, standing with the Su family and pressuring the Xuanyuan family, no reclusive sect would dare criticize the Kunlun Daoist Sect on this matter either.

Thinking of this, the Kunlun Divine Spirit smiled.

This was truly a blessing in disguise.

Making this decisive choice to have True Feather Divine Spirit become Su Yun's concubine had turned out to be nothing but beneficial.

"An Ruoyi, I'm quite curious—when you learn of this news, will you regret not fighting harder against me back at the Su family?" The Kunlun Divine Spirit's smile grew radiant.

He could already imagine An Ruoyi's expression when she learned of this news. That perfect face of hers would surely display something quite spectacular.

Everyone was excited and exhilarated.

But within the Xuanyuan family, there was only silence.

Even Xuanyuan Chong's face had lost its smile.

The same was true for the other Xuanyuan family direct-line powerhouses—each one stood rigid, dumbstruck, unable to utter a single word.

Su Yun had already made his intentions clear—he wanted to meddle in the Xuanyuan family's power by making Xuanyuan Jian the heir.

At a time like this, the only thing the Xuanyuan family could rely on was external Divine Spirit powers intervening with the Su family, or the Federation itself ordering Su Yun to stop.

But this great news, however you looked at it, was not good news for the Xuanyuan family.

At a time when Su Heng was campaigning against the Barbarian Tribe for the human race, who would dare point fingers or criticize his family back home, or his son Su Yun? That would make them an enemy of the human race—they'd be drowned in spittle alone.

The Su family swallowing the Xuanyuan family—in the face of such supreme glory, it would become somewhat insignificant.

One could easily predict that Su Yun would become even more unrestrained and lawless going forward.

The pressure facing the Xuanyuan family would likely increase geometrically.

And at that moment, an aged voice rang out once more:

"I agree with Xuanyuan Chong's proposal. Make Xuanyuan Jian the Young Master of the Xuanyuan family."

Instantly, all the Xuanyuan family powerhouses' gazes converged on Xuanyuan Shen.

Xuanyuan Shen's eyes were murky, his expression blank as he said: "Our Xuanyuan family lost our ancient divine weapon so many years ago. The powerful beings in our heritage reserves cannot hold on much longer.

"Making Xuanyuan Jian the Young Master so she can summon the power of the clan-protecting divine weapon to stabilize our heritage—that is the most urgent priority.

"Furthermore, with the Su family patriarch having achieved such glory, letting the Su family heir's fiancée temporarily become the Xuanyuan family heir as a show of respect from our Xuanyuan family to the Su family—I see nothing inappropriate about this. Therefore, I fully support Xuanyuan Chong's proposal."

The expressions of the Xuanyuan family direct-line members grew stiff.

Temporarily?

Once Xuanyuan Jian truly became the heir, trying to change that would be extremely difficult.

What he really meant was that his life was nearly at its end and he urgently needed to return to the divine source, to have the ancient divine weapon stabilize him so he could live a few more centuries, wasn't it?

But even this old ancestor—the highest in seniority and the strongest in the current Xuanyuan family—had spoken in favor. Opposition had essentially become meaningless.

"I agree."

"I also agree."

"Our Xuanyuan family and the Su family have shared a thousand years of friendship. At this time, we should continue to deepen this bond."

...

Instantly, one after another, the Xuanyuan family's direct-line powerhouses spoke up in agreement.

"Ha ha ha! All of you elders truly are far-sighted. I, Su Yun, am deeply impressed!"

Su Yun laughed heartily, cupping his fists toward Xuanyuan Shen from afar: "Senior Xuanyuan Shen, you have particularly sharp eyes. I, Su Yun, am extremely impressed. On behalf of the Su family, I welcome Senior Xuanyuan Shen to visit the Su family at any time. You will forever be an honored guest."

"Ha ha ha ha..."

Su Yun laughed loudly as he waved his hand, signaling the Eighteen Battalions' divine generals to lead their troops in withdrawal. The dense formation patterns filling the sky and the rolling killing intent dissipated completely, allowing countless powerhouses to breathe easier—though their expressions remained extremely complicated.

This heaven-shaking confrontation had ultimately ended in the Su family's complete victory.

The Xuanyuan family had also sounded the death knell of their total decline.

"Jian'er, come out!" Su Yun said softly.

The next second, Xuanyuan Jian stepped out from the void behind Su Yun, her expression blank.

She wore a Starlight Flowing Dress, Divine Spirit presence radiating from her as an aura of nobility naturally permeated the heavens.

She was the fiancée of the Su family's heir.

In the future, she would also be the Xuanyuan family's patriarch.

Xuanyuan Jian gave Su Yun a gentle smile, then turned to Xuanyuan Chong and said: "Uncle Chong, a great debt of gratitude needs no words. Please hand the Young Master Token to me."

"Ha ha, Jian'er, from now on in the Xuanyuan family, we must cooperate well and work together to revive the family." Xuanyuan Chong laughed heartily and handed the Young Master Token to Xuanyuan Jian.

His meaning was obvious. He was the alternate councilman and Vice Patriarch—currently the highest-ranking person in the Xuanyuan family.

And Xuanyuan Jian held the Young Master Token.

As long as Xuanyuan Jian didn't oppose him, he would be the one in charge of the Xuanyuan family's Supreme Council.

"Uncle Chong, Jian'er will also need your strong support going forward." Xuanyuan Jian smiled faintly, but deep in her eyes was only coldness.

She had long since completely given up on the Xuanyuan family.

If not for Su Yun's protection, she and her entire family would all be dead.

Su Yun was her everything now.

Since Su Yun wanted to swallow the Xuanyuan family, she would naturally give her full support.

Moreover, if she could control the Xuanyuan family and use it as the foundation of her dowry when marrying Su Yun, her position in the Su family would become even more secure. No one would ever be able to threaten her again.

"Ha ha ha, certainly, certainly."

Xuanyuan Chong laughed heartily, then announced to the assembled Xuanyuan family direct-line members: "I hereby declare that from this day forward, Xuanyuan Jian is the heir of our Xuanyuan family! She holds the Young Master Token and may command a portion of the Xuanyuan family's heritage as well as three battalions of the Elite Guard!"

"Greetings, Young Master."

The expressions of the Xuanyuan family direct-line members were complicated, but under Su Yun's watchful gaze, they still bowed respectfully, speaking in unison as they welcomed Xuanyuan Jian through the gates of the Xuanyuan family estate, then followed after her.

As the new heir to the Xuanyuan family, she would next need to pay respects to all the previous ancestors, taking an oath to protect the Xuanyuan family's interests with her life, to shed her last drop of blood for the family.
