Chapter 158: The God King's Phantom

*Hum, hum, hum...*

The Qiankun Cauldron suddenly manifested, filling the firmament. The power of heaven and earth emanated outward, releasing terrifying force that instantly reduced the golden armor on Athena's body to powder. It then drew her—stark naked and deathly pale—into the great cauldron.

"Boundless Qiankun—refine!" An Ruoyi gave a low shout, striking the Qiankun Cauldron heavily with her palm.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

The Qiankun Cauldron emanated dense divine light, sealing its mouth. Rolling flames manifested within the cauldron, enveloping Athena.

"Ahh..."

Suddenly, Athena screamed in terror, her voice filled with intense pain and even more with horror.

"Su Yun, what are you trying to do? Why is my noble God Race bloodline trembling?" Athena's voice was filled with fear.

Compared to death and pain, what she feared more was losing her noble God Race bloodline.

Her God Race bloodline was trembling, showing signs of being forcibly extracted from her. This utterly terrified her.

She was a Strongest Divine Spirit. The God Race bloodline within her had been implanted by the supreme God King when she was young. How could it possibly be affected?

"The mark of the God Race."

Su Yun's pupils narrowed slightly. Ignoring Athena's words, he fixed his gaze upon her body.

At this moment, a pair of golden-white wings had appeared on Athena's snow-white back, lifelike, covered with dense runes, containing powerful life force.

Most importantly, though this pair of wings was formed by condensed divine runes, it had fused completely with Athena's meridians, blood, and bones.

Trying to extract it would be tantamount to killing Athena outright.

Even a Celestial God transcending the Strongest Divine Spirit realm probably couldn't accomplish it.

"Truly worthy of a super race passed down from ancient times. Their divine techniques are this bizarre." Su Yun's gaze was cold.

*Hah, hah, hah...*

"Transform the acquired into the innate."

An Ruoyi's gaze was grave. From these golden-white angel wings, she sensed a powerful threat.

This had definitely been placed in Athena by an ancient Divine Spirit of incredible power.

At minimum, a Strongest Divine Spirit on the same level as Su Heng and the Buddha Ancestor.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

The Qiankun Cauldron shook violently. In an instant, heaven and earth inverted, space shifted. Chaotic essence began to fill the cauldron's interior.

*Ah, ah, ah...*

Athena's voice was shrill, agonized to the extreme, as if the chaotic force was being driven directly into her body, forcibly changing her soul and bloodline.

"Su Yun, wait. We can talk. I can represent the God Race in negotiations with you."

"As long as you release Princess Ling Man of the Spirit Barbarian lineage and the Heavenly Barbarian War God, all the Spirit Barbarian lineage's territory will be yours. The Barbarian Tribe will absolutely never actively harass Su Heng's army."

"How about it? Please stop—my God Race bloodline is being refined away."

Athena's voice was filled with endless fear.

She could feel her bloodline gradually changing, that sense of reverence for the God Race in her soul beginning to blur.

She didn't want to become a lowly, barbaric human.

At this moment, Su Yun's eyes narrowed slightly: "Athena, you can represent the God Race and Barbarian Tribe in negotiations with me?"

"Yes, I am the divine servant of the supreme God King. I can fully represent the God King in dealings with the Human Race."

Noticing Su Yun's response at last, Athena's voice filled with joy as she immediately answered: "As long as you release Princess Ling Man and promise not to continue attacking the Barbarian Tribe, allowing all Spirit Barbarians in the Spirit Barbarian lineage's territory to safely withdraw, I can respond on behalf of the Barbarian Tribe and God Race—the Barbarian Tribe and Council Member Su Heng will not interfere with each other."

Instantly, a cold glint flashed through Su Yun's eyes. He vaguely sensed that he had still underestimated Ling Man's importance—it wasn't simply that she was a Child of Destiny and the future Strongest Divine Spirit of the Barbarian Tribe. "What exactly is Ling Man's identity, that it would make the Barbarian Tribe willing to give up millions of miles of Spirit Barbarian lineage territory?"

"Stop first. Otherwise, my God Race bloodline will be refined away." Athena's voice had grown extremely weak, filled with endless pain.

"You have no standing to bargain with me." Su Yun sneered coldly, then stopped speaking.

Athena shouted in rage: "Su Yun, don't go too far! Even if your Qiankun Cauldron can refine away my God Race bloodline, I still won't obey you. I will still be the noble Goddess of War."

Su Yun sneered, not deigning to say more.

Time passed minute by minute. The chaotic force within the Qiankun Cauldron grew ever more dense, and Athena's voice became increasingly shrill and weak.

The pair of angel wings on her back was gradually fading, seemingly being refined bit by bit and fused into Athena's bloodline, transforming her into a true innate member of the God Race.

And at that moment, a cold glint suddenly flashed through Su Yun's eyes. He bit his tongue and spat a large mouthful of blood into the cauldron, landing precisely on Athena's angel wings, allowing the blood to merge with the wings into Athena's body and soul.

"Su Yun, the God King will not spare you."

Athena's voice was extremely weak, filled with endless hatred. She could feel the God Race bloodline within her—that distinctly perceptible sensation—continuously fading away.

"Refine!"

An Ruoyi gave a low shout. The might of a Strongest Divine Spirit exploded in full, her black hair dancing wildly as she poured endless divine power into the Qiankun Cauldron.

"Who dares refine my blood servant?"

At that moment, a voice filled with infinite majesty suddenly exploded within the underground palace, causing the entire vast space to shake violently, sending endless boulders crashing down.

The next instant, a tall figure wreathed in divine light appeared before Athena. His entire body was shrouded in radiance; only the six massive angel wings on his back were particularly striking, flowing with divine light like crystal.

The next moment, he actually turned and struck at the unconscious Athena with a palm, apparently trying to kill her on the spot—extremely ruthless.

"Kill!"

True Feather Divine Spirit's gaze turned cold. She had been watching this scene all along and immediately struck, slapping his body and directly scattering his form.

"No matter who you are, for daring to act against my divine servant, no one on all of Blue Star can save you."

The divine phantom dispersed, and along with Su Yun's blood, completely fused into Athena's body.

*Hum, hum, hum...*

The Qiankun Cauldron spewed chaotic essence, slowly expelling Athena from its opening.

Immediately, Athena's body drew the attention of Su Yun and the two women.

At this moment, divine light flowed across her body. Her skin was as translucent as crystal, so flawless and lustrous she seemed inhuman.
