Chapter 42: I'm the One Pursuing You

In that instant, Ye Ling's body went rigid. He slowly turned his head toward the Heaven-class private room, and sure enough, Yun Ran's alluring figure came into view.

Su Yun again.

Ye Ling's mind went blank.

The price of one hundred million pounds of origin stones once again dominated the entire hall.

Everyone fell silent.

How were they supposed to compete with this?

This was treating origin stones like cabbages—as if there was an endless supply.

The old auctioneer's face flushed red with excitement. But before he could speak, Yun Ran said calmly: "My young master says this Golden Spring Divine Iron Mine belongs to Liu Ting. He's returning it to its rightful owner."

"The origin stones for this auction will be transferred directly to Azure Blue Auction House's account."

With that, she turned and walked back into the private room, leaving the crowd with only a beautiful departing silhouette.

Ye Ling was completely stupefied. For some reason, he felt waves of stinging pain on his face, as if it had swollen.

"Ye Ling, remember to transfer my thirty million origin stones back to me." This was Xuanyuan Jian's flat voice.

Liu Ting's voice came at the same time: "And the ten million origin stones that belong to me. They've been with you for quite a while now."

In the past, Ye Ling clearly remembered, the two women had never quibbled with him over such things. The origin stones had always stayed with him.

This was the consequence of shattered trust and broken feelings.

Then Ye Ling witnessed a scene that made his eyes nearly split with rage. Liu Ting and Xuanyuan Jian walked together toward the Heaven-class private room, leaving him with nothing but their two beautiful retreating figures.

This time, they hadn't even bothered to say goodbye.

...

Inside the Heaven-class private room.

Liu Ting and Yun Ran had somehow already disappeared.

Su Yun wore a faint smile as he carefully studied Xuanyuan Jian's devastatingly beautiful features. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly—truly worthy of being called Azure Blue Star's number one goddess in the original story.

Too beautiful.

Hair cascading like a waterfall, eyes like stars, skin like congealed cream, bright eyes and white teeth. A light cloud-colored T-shirt perfectly outlined her figure. Though only seventeen, she already possessed assets that countless women would envy.

Curves where there should be curves, slender where it should be slender. Perfect proportions—one ounce more would be too plump, one ounce less too thin. It was as if the Creator had exhausted all his effort to craft this perfect woman.

Even though he had seen her once before, examining her closely now still left Su Yun utterly amazed.

This was no woman that the mortal world could produce. The celebrities from his previous life were nothing compared to her.

Of course, Su Yun's admiration was merely that—a normal man's appreciation of a beautiful woman.

If they ever truly became enemies, he wouldn't show the slightest mercy. The Xuanyuan family was a target he had to deal with eventually, and Xuanyuan Jian was merely a chess piece he intended to use. When the time came to scheme against her, he would scheme.

If Xuanyuan Jian ever showed signs of becoming uncontrollable, that would be her death sentence.

But for now, in Su Yun's eyes, she was just a seventeen-year-old girl with exceptional talent but a still-simple mind.

"Su Yun, you know my identity, don't you?" Xuanyuan Jian suddenly spoke.

For some reason, facing Su Yun's intense, scrutinizing gaze—even filled with a predatory edge—she couldn't muster any disgust.

In fact, she felt a hint of secret delight in her heart.

If it were any other man, she would have already drawn her sword.

Perhaps it was because Su Yun was simply too outstanding—his perfectly handsome face, his exceptional talent, his powerful background, and his extravagant generosity. Everything about him seemed to draw Xuanyuan Jian in.

Moreover, her closest friend Liu Ting had been constantly telling her about Su Yun's various virtues.

"Mm."

Su Yun smiled slightly, picked up his teacup and took a sip before responding with a smile: "The Xuanyuan family's second young miss. Because you possess the Martial Soul of the ancient divine weapon Xuanyuan Sword, you were named Xuanyuan Jian. Exceptionally talented, regarded by many family elders as having Divine Spirit potential—so much so that you've threatened the position of Xuanyuan Li, the family heir, causing him to target you repeatedly."

"As the Su family's heir, if I didn't even know this much information, Xuanyuan Li would probably be laughing."

"Compared to Young Master Su, Xuanyuan Jian is nothing. My position is probably similar to your cousin Su Meng's." Xuanyuan Jian said calmly.

"I just don't know what Young Master Su intends, showing me such favor?"

"No, no, no."

Su Yun smiled and waved his hand. "There are two errors in what you said."

"First, you are not Su Meng. In my eyes, he's nothing but an ant. You can't be compared to him."

"Second, this isn't showing favor. I'm pursuing you."

All his earlier groundwork finally erupted in this moment.

Xuanyuan Jian—the future strongest female Divine Spirit of the human race—could only be his woman. And she was the most important chess piece for helping him seize control of the Xuanyuan family.

Xuanyuan Jian was exceptionally talented, strong-willed, and domineering. In the original story, even Ye Ling as the protagonist had never truly won her over in the end. Clearly, merely showing her favor wouldn't work.

As a former underground boss, insight into psychology was a required course.

In that instant, Xuanyuan Jian was completely stunned by his words.

This man was unexpectedly domineering—far beyond anything she had anticipated. He could state so calmly that he was pursuing her, without the slightest hint of euphemism.

How was she supposed to respond?

Xuanyuan Jian was only a seventeen-year-old girl, after all. When had she ever heard such direct, unabashed words? Her face instantly flushed red as she abruptly stood, wanting to turn and leave the room.

Her heart was pounding violently.

But Su Yun didn't mind Xuanyuan Jian's reaction. He smiled faintly and said: "Miss Xuanyuan Jian, you should understand that your current situation in the Xuanyuan family is extremely dangerous. Xuanyuan Li wants you dead."

"And me? Given my status, I should naturally marry a woman from an equally prominent family as my official wife."

"Yet all these years, I've endured tremendous pressure from within the family, almost madly pursuing Liu Ting, accommodating her, trying to please her. I thought I could move her heart. But what I got in return was coldness, indifference, betrayal."

"So don't you think we're perfect for each other?"

Though it was the original host who had pursued Liu Ting, not him, Su Yun didn't mind using that tragic romance to break through Xuanyuan Jian's psychological defenses.

"I still don't understand why you're telling me all this." Xuanyuan Jian fell silent, then turned to gaze at Su Yun's handsome face. For some reason, she felt a pang of heartache.

She had witnessed Liu Ting's behavior toward Su Yun over the years.

She hadn't thought much of it at the time. But now, she suddenly felt Liu Ting had gone too far. How could she treat Su Yun like that?

For some reason, Su Yun's indifferent face seemed to take on a tinge of tragic melancholy in her eyes, making her want to comfort him.

"Because I want to get engaged to you," Su Yun suddenly said.

Instantly, the already dazed and flustered Xuanyuan Jian went completely blank.

Just moments ago it was pursuing her, and now suddenly he wanted an engagement?

"Su Yun, please let me calm down first." Xuanyuan Jian's voice trembled. Wave after wave of shock hit her, each stronger than the last, leaving her unable to process any of it.

But Su Yun had no intention of letting her calm down. He smiled and said: "Xuanyuan Jian, though this is our first meeting, you're close friends with Liu Ting, so you should know what kind of person I am. Though my methods are domineering, even somewhat brutal, I've always been open and aboveboard. I never hide my intentions. So let me be direct."

Xuanyuan Jian nodded dazedly, not denying this.

Even when Liu Ting had constantly told her about Su Yun's various flaws, she had never denied that Su Yun was straightforward and honest in his actions. He killed when he wanted to kill, did what he wanted to do, and never concealed his thoughts.

In fact, in Xuanyuan Jian's view, Su Yun could have easily used his power to obtain Liu Ting, yet he insisted on pursuing her openly and honestly. It was quite unusual for the Imperial Capital.

"Right now, I need to marry a woman from a major family to solidify my position within the clan."

Su Yun continued calmly: "And you—once we're engaged, though I won't fall in love with you, with my Su family backing you up, Xuanyuan Li wouldn't dare touch you anymore. You would even have the qualifications to compete equally with Xuanyuan Li for the position of Xuanyuan family heir."
