Chapter 111: Spirit Barbarian Goddess, Caught in Danger

On the way back to the Su family compound, Su Yun's expression was cold. He suddenly turned to Yun Ran and said: "Ran'er, besides the news of Father's great victory, is there something important you haven't finished telling me?"

How powerful was the Barbarian Tribe? They were an ancient great tribe ranked in the top fifty among the ancient myriad races, with over a hundred million Barbarians. Strongest Divine Spirits emerged in endless succession. Their heritage ran deep, and they even possessed two ancient divine weapons.

Father had crushed a million-strong Barbarian army and captured the Heavenly Barbarian War God alive. The entire Barbarian Tribe was probably shaken to its core.

Su Heng had occupied one-fifth of Barbarian territory, yet he had brought only a million troops. The pressure he faced must be incomparably immense.

On one hand, he had to face external Barbarian counterattacks.

On the other, the conquered one-fifth of the territory would likely see endless rebellions.

Though the Americas were rich in resources, until they completely conquered or drove out the Barbarians in those territories, there was no way they could bring significant benefits to the Su family in the short term.

Earlier, Yun Ran had deliberately announced the good news publicly—she must have been trying to help him suppress the last of the Xuanyuan family's resistance.

"Young Master is perceptive. Indeed, that is so."

Yun Ran immediately spoke, her expression grave: "The Patriarch has sent word asking the Young Master to gather resources as quickly as possible and send them urgently to the Americas.

"Furthermore, at least another million troops must be assembled and sent to the Americas.

"The Madam has also sent word saying that the Patriarch asked her to request support from the Qin family. But after Qin Ying obtained the alternate councilman position, he suddenly changed his attitude—stalling everywhere and refusing to meet with the Madam.

"The Madam wants this servant to inform the Young Master that you should personally visit the Qin family, and afterward go to the Federation.

"In the Federation's Supreme Council, opinions are deadlocked between continuing to support the Patriarch's campaign or ordering him to retreat.

"On the Barbarian Tribe's side, the front lines are critical. Both the Madam and the Patriarch hope the Young Master will make a decision quickly."

"The situation has deteriorated this badly?"

Su Yun drew a deep breath, a cold gleam flashing in his eyes. He sneered: "It seems that after my Su family achieved such great merit, many people can't stand to see our influence continue to grow!

"And that Qin Ying—you're really courting death. Don't think that just because you're my biological uncle, I won't kill you.

"Those who block me, die!"

Cold light flashed repeatedly in Su Yun's eyes, a violent rage hidden in their depths, like a volcano about to erupt.

Though the Qin family was also a major Chinese family that had produced a strongest Divine Spirit, they weren't counted among the strongest Divine Spirit families.

Originally, they had married Qin Junhua to Su Heng because they recognized Su Heng's potential.

Now, after using Su Heng's influence in the Supreme Council to become an alternate councilman, they actually dared to burn bridges and stall at every turn.

"Young Master, the Shadow Soul Guards have sent word. The Qin family appears to have been influenced by the War Goddess Athena faction from Mount Olympus. Their interactions have been extremely frequent recently," Yun Ran reported respectfully.

"In the Federation's Supreme Council, War Goddess Athena is also one of the councilmen strongly opposing the Patriarch's continued campaign against the Barbarian Tribe."

"Qin Ying, you're really courting death."

Su Yun sneered repeatedly, killing intent flashing in his eyes. "Let this old thing live a few more days. The urgent priority is gathering supplies and troops to send to the Americas so Father can stabilize the front lines.

"Ran'er, notify Jian'er. Have her use the Xuanyuan family's power to gather supplies and conscript troops with all her might.

"Have all the Su family direct-line members come for a meeting.

"Notify the Kunlun Divine Spirit. Tell him tomorrow morning I'll be waiting for him in the Su family main hall. The discipleship ceremony originally planned for the Xuanyuan family main hall will be postponed to tomorrow, and this Young Master will personally preside over it."

Cold light flashed repeatedly in Su Yun's eyes as he issued order after order.

No matter what, since Father had already swallowed one-fifth of the Barbarian Tribe's territory in the Americas, they absolutely could not give it up.

In the original story, the Americas were the region with the most resources and the densest vital energy.

Not only did the Barbarian Tribe live there, but even races ranked in the top ten among the ancient myriad races—the Divine-Demon Tribe and the Asura Tribe—lived on the American continent. One could imagine how important this territory was.

If the Su family wanted to continue expanding and rising, they absolutely could not limit their ambitions to the human race, or even to China alone.

And this territory would become the foundation of Su Yun's rise.

"By your command, Young Master." Yun Ran didn't dare delay, her expression grave.

"Also, notify Father that after I've handled everything here, I'll personally lead a million troops and the Eighteen Battalions to the Americas.

"Tell Father I'll guarantee all resource supplies to the front lines. Those who block me die. Tell him to rest easy." Su Yun said indifferently.

But at that moment, a bold female voice suddenly rang out: "Young Master Su Yun, why wait until you've finished handling matters? Why not come with me to the Americas right now?"

"Who's sneaking around? Come out!"

Yun Ran's eyes narrowed. She barked coldly and stepped in front of Su Yun. Terrifying Saint-level presence suddenly swept across heaven and earth.

When Su Yun had broken through to the Profound Palace Realm, she had also used the manifestation of the rules from his breakthrough to break through to the Saint realm.

If she weren't Su Yun's maidservant, anywhere else in the world, breaking through to the Saint realm at such a young age would have made her the most dazzling prodigy goddess.

Only then did Yun Ran notice that while she had been reporting to Su Yun, the sky had somehow turned pitch black without a sound. Points of light flickered like stars in the dark night sky, illuminating a world of utter darkness.

"A little maidservant doesn't deserve to speak with me. Get lost."

At that moment, a tall woman emerged from the dark sky, wearing primitive beast hides.

She was extremely tall—at least six foot three—several inches taller than Su Yun.

Black hair cascaded carelessly over her beast hides. Her eyes sparkled like stars, giving off a wild and bold impression, like an untamable cheetah, full of aggression.

"Young Master Su Yun, allow me to introduce myself. Daughter of the Barbarian Tribe's Heavenly Barbarian War God, Goddess of the Barbarian Tribe—Ling Man."

The woman's voice rang like a great bell as she walked toward Su Yun step by step. Her tall frame gave no impression of clumsiness—rather, it exuded a powerful allure.

Curves in all the right places.

Exceptionally voluptuous, far surpassing normal human women.

Her wheat-colored skin was extraordinarily smooth.

Even among the human race, she would be a peerless beauty comparable to Xuanyuan Jian.

"This time, Ling Man has come to invite Young Master Su Yun to visit the Barbarian Tribe as our guest." The woman's gaze was wild. Despite being in the heart of the Imperial Capital, she seemed as relaxed as if walking on flat ground, showing not the slightest panic or urgency—revealing the powerful confidence in her heart.
