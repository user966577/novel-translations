Chapter 140: Captured

"You dare?! You dare?! You dare...?! I am a child of the divine! If you flay my skin, the fury of the God Race will drown the lands of Humanity!"

The Golden Feather Divine Son shrieked, terror reaching its peak.

"Oh, a child of a divine from the God Race? Now I'm even more excited!"

"Hahahaha!"

"Let me do it!"

The five black-robed figures laughed coldly. As Shadow Soul Guards, this kind of work was routine for them. The only difference was that they had always operated in darkness—this was merely their first time working in broad daylight before the public.

"No! Please no! I was wrong! I was wrong! Su Yun!"

The Golden Feather Divine Son's expression went deathly pale. He completely abandoned any pretense of dignity, begging for mercy continuously: "Su Yun! I know I was wrong! I shouldn't have provoked your authority! You are the true divine child, the child of destiny! I am willing to pledge my loyalty to you, to become a knight of the Su family!

I possess celestial bloodline! My father is a Supreme Divine Spirit of the God Race—a supreme figure who looks down upon Blue Star! In the future, I will surely cultivate to Strongest Divine Spirit and become your most powerful asset!"

Yet no matter how he pleaded, no matter how many oaths he swore pledging loyalty to Su Yun and the Su family, no matter how he proclaimed his potential and usefulness, Su Yun remained expressionless, unmoved. His detached gaze watched the firmament.

"Goddess! Where are you?! Come quickly and save your faithful believer!"

The Golden Feather Knight broke down completely. He watched helplessly as the five black-robed figures approached with their sharp knives, his entire body turning cold. He raised his head to the sky and roared in fury.

What the hell kind of situation was this?

He hadn't done anything! He'd only come to deliver a strand of hair! His attitude had merely been slightly lacking—and now he was being flayed alive!

He still had an infinitely bright future ahead of him!

Just then, the firmament suddenly rippled. Then it froze completely. A beam of golden light pierced through the heavens, boring through space to transform into a golden spear. It shot toward the black-robed figures on the city wall, its killing intent terrifyingly endless.

Heaven and earth seemed to freeze. Spacetime ceased to flow. Terrifying divine might rampaged through every corner between heaven and earth.

"Goddess!"

The Golden Feather Knight's pupils contracted sharply. Endless terror surged up within him—because Athena intended to kill him along with the others.

Though he had anticipated this—his experience had made him unfit to return to the West, a disgrace to the War Goddess's lineage—when this moment actually arrived, endless despair and sorrow still welled up in his heart.

He hadn't done anything wrong, yet had been tortured half to death. Now he was being treated as a discarded pawn, to be killed outright.

"Ancient Divine Weapon—the War Spear!"

Su Yun's gaze flickered slightly.

It seemed Athena had come prepared. She had even brought the Ancient Divine Weapon, the War Spear.

This clearly wasn't as simple as asking him to meet outside the city—she had plainly intended to strike directly.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

"Current generation War Goddess—how despicable."

Su Zhan's cold voice erupted across the firmament. The Chaos Bell's true form manifested directly between heaven and earth. Its tolling pierced through the starry void, annihilating the golden spear's projection. Then it blasted into the endless void, tearing apart all of spacetime.

*Hum... Hum... Hum...*

Chaotic spatial currents flooded the firmament like surging seas. At the ocean's edge, a goddess shrouded in divine radiance stood upon spacetime itself. Golden hair flowed freely. Divine eyes were cold and merciless, gazing down toward the Imperial Capital.

"Su Zhan! Your son and grandson dare invade the Americas! Know this—the Americas are God Race territory, not something the Human Race may violate! Order your son and grandson to immediately cease their invasion of the Americas! Release Ling Man, the Barbarian princess, and the Heavenly Barbarian War God! Withdraw the army back to Human Race lands at once!"

Athena's gaze was merciless. Only when speaking of the God Race did a ripple of emotion pass through her eyes—filled with reverence.

"If you refuse to withdraw, the fury of the God Race will drown the lands of Humanity! Your Su family cannot bear this consequence!"

Countless citizens of the Imperial Capital gazed upward at this terrifying scene in the firmament—a supreme goddess standing there. Fear filled their eyes.

Every Western crusade in history had ended in China's defeat. The fear of the Western gods had long been branded into Chinese hearts as a shadow.

Some powerhouses from the Imperial Capital's great clans were even trembling on their knees, prostrating in worship toward Athena in the distant void.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

The Chaos Bell's true form suppressed the endless void. Bell waves rolled outward.

Su Zhan's voice vanished into the endless void, though one could faintly sense terrifying fluctuations lingering around the Imperial Capital.

"Athena, you're utterly ridiculous."

Su Yun laughed coldly. In a single step, he ascended into the firmament. His detached gaze swept over the Golden Feather Divine Son before fixing on her: "If the God Race were truly so formidable, why not simply campaign against my Human Race directly? Why send you, this bitch, to China to cause trouble everywhere? You stir up discord in the Supreme Council, yet now you only dare hide in the endless void. You don't even dare set foot on my Imperial Capital's soil—you can only send this human mongrel to invite me outside the city?

As for Barbarian Princess Ling Man, she is indeed in my hands.

The Heavenly Barbarian War God is in my father's hands.

If you can make the Barbarian Tribes surrender and never again invade my Su family's territory in the Americas, I'll release them both immediately."

"Insolent Su Yun! You dare blaspheme the might of the God Race!"

Athena's gaze turned cold, killing intent flickering continuously: "I admit you have some small tricks. You actually managed to unite the Su family, conquer the Xuanyuan family, and persuade the Kunlun Daoist Sect to help you campaign in the Americas.

But young man, you need to understand—no matter how excellent someone is, if they die before they can grow, they'll quickly be forgotten by the world."

Just then, a pleasant female voice suddenly reached Su Yun's ears.

"Su Yun, as long as you convince your father to withdraw from the Americas, you may name any conditions." Athena's voice echoed directly in Su Yun's ears.

Her voice carried a hint of helplessness.

She had originally planned to invite Su Yun outside the city to meet, using the War Goddess's name. But who would have thought Su Yun would be so cunning, refusing to take the bait? Her plan had completely fallen through.

She had already realized that though Su Heng was the one campaigning in the Americas, Su Yun was the core.

Kill Su Yun, and the current situation in China would resolve itself.

When that time came, she could simply flee directly to the God Race. What could the Su family do to her?

By now, she absolutely could not allow things to continue developing. After all, as supplies continued flowing to the Americas, Su Heng had gradually established a firm foothold there and was growing ever more victorious.

If she let Su Yun keep this up, and he actually accomplished something at the Federation Council—getting the Federation to fully support Su Heng's campaign—the Human Race would have completely offended the God Race.

"Any conditions?"

Su Yun immediately laughed: "The Americas have nice territory. In all the West, there aren't many places that can match such a large piece of land. How about you have Zeus give Mount Olympus to my Su family? Then you become my concubine—along with that legendary Goddess of Beauty—and I'll immediately release Ling Man and the Heavenly Barbarian War God. I'll withdraw from the Americas. What do you say?"

"You're courting death!"

Athena exploded with fury: "Su Yun, don't think that just because Su Heng defeated the Barbarian Tribes, you can act recklessly and do whatever you please!

Provoke Mount Olympus, and no one can bear the consequences!"

"Don't think I truly have no way to deal with you! I have plenty of methods to annihilate your Su family!"

"Oh? Then it seems we can't reach an agreement."

Su Yun laughed coldly: "Athena, then I'll see you at the Federation Council. Remember—sooner or later, I will make you willingly lie on my bed and serve me as my concubine."

*Hum... Hum... Hum...*

Just then, a beam of dim killing light suddenly flickered into the endless void.

A figure shrouded in divine radiance appeared abruptly at Athena's side. A palm struck out directly, aimed at Athena's forehead.

"Athena! You people are always running your mouths about crusades, about annihilating my Chinese Divine Spirit clans! Do you really think there's no one in China?!"

"It's precisely because of vermin like you that the Human Race has accomplished nothing and failed to expand our territory for so long!"

This was an extremely aged voice.

"Ouyang Feng! Have you gone mad?! You dare attack me?!"

Athena roared in fury. In her hand, the War Spear materialized instantly, unleashing rolling divine might as she struck back against Ouyang Feng's palm.

*Rumble!*

Two Strongest Divine Spirits' terrifying divine might erupted in the firmament, rampaging through the endless void. The land for ten thousand miles around the Imperial Capital directly sank and collapsed.

Faintly, one could sense an even more terrifying Ancient Divine Weapon aura pervading the endless void.

"Ouyang Feng, and the aura of the Ouyang family's Ancient Divine Weapon."

In that instant, Su Yun's pupils contracted slightly. Then a flash of cold light burst through them.

Excellent opportunity.

"I command all Su family headquarters powerhouses and Divine Spirits, all Xuanyuan family powerhouses and Divine Spirits, the Eighteen Great Battalions, and the Xuanyuan family's personal guard army—seal off the void immediately! Capture Athena!"

Su Yun's cold voice echoed through the void.
