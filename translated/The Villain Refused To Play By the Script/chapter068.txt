Chapter 68: What Right Does Su Yun Have?

"Xuanyuan Li, I warned you. If you dare provoke me again, the consequences will be severe."

Su Yun's voice was low, as if containing concentrated fury.

With those words, a "hum" sounded as rolling chaos radiance erupted. Ninety-nine Chaos Dragons filled the heavens, their vast pressure shaking heaven and earth.

In this moment, the Xuanyuan family's main hall trembled violently. Even the boundless sky beyond the hall began to show cracks.

The overwhelming might crashed down on Xuanyuan Li like a tsunami or waterfall.

"Hum!"

In an instant, the cold and authoritative Xuanyuan Li's face turned pale. He felt only a terrifying power pressing down on him as the elemental energy circulation in his body came to a complete halt.

The next moment, with a "crack," the bones in both his knees directly shattered, blood mist spraying everywhere.

"Bang!"

Xuanyuan Li's eyes bulged with fury, but he couldn't control himself as he fell directly to his knees—kneeling before Su Yun.

"Pff!"

Xuanyuan Li spat blood. Under the terrifying pressure, his blood continued to flow in reverse, his meridians thrown into chaos. He knelt prostrate at Su Yun's feet, blood seeping from every part of his body, staining the great hall red.

"Su Yun, your intentions are truly malicious!"

Xuanyuan Li struggled with all his might, his voice incomparably weak and hoarse, yet filled with concentrated venom.

Su Yun had actually crippled his meridians.

Even with the Xuanyuan family's capabilities, repairing them would be extremely difficult.

And even if they were repaired, he could hardly return to his former state. His potential and foundation would be severely damaged.

One could say the prestige he had just recovered had been directly snapped in half by Su Yun.

Su Yun's malicious intentions were obvious—he didn't want Xuanyuan Li's potential to gain recognition from the Xuanyuan family powerhouses.

In this moment, the great hall was suffocating.

The pupils of many Xuanyuan family powerhouses contracted deeply as they gazed at the ninety-nine Chaos Dragons filling the sky, their hearts shocked to the extreme.

Su Yun, at a mere eighteen years of age, had reached the ultimate level of the Divine Profound Realm.

No wonder Su Heng had been so pleased—he had clearly seen this.

What did this mean?

This was a true absolute genius.

As far as they knew, even Su Heng, this strongest Divine Spirit, hadn't reached the ultimate level in the Qi-Blood Realm back then. In the Divine Profound Realm, he had only reached ninety dragons of power.

Yet even so, he had already been humanity's indisputable peerless prodigy.

And Su Yun had far surpassed Su Heng.

In this moment, Su Yun standing in the void was dazzlingly brilliant.

"Li'er!"

Suddenly, Xuanyuan Ze roared, his voice hoarse, glaring at Su Yun with hatred.

Su Yun had struck too fast. He had focused all his attention on guarding against Su Jian and Su Lie, leaving him no time to intervene.

But who could have known that Su Yun had hidden so deeply? After all, when Su Yun and Xuanyuan Li had clashed in the Su family's great hall last time, they had seemed evenly matched.

"Xuanyuan Ze, do you not want your patriarch position anymore either?"

After Su Yun's indifferent voice came, Xuanyuan Ze immediately froze.

This was already the second time Su Yun had repeated these words.

He wasn't joking. Given the Xuanyuan family's current situation, plus Su Yun now holding the Su family's supreme authority—as long as he was willing to pay the price, he could absolutely make it happen.

Moreover, Su Heng had already warned him. Competition among peers was acceptable, but if he dared attack Su Yun, he would certainly kill him.

Xuanyuan Ze didn't dare gamble his patriarch position and his life on this.

"Xuanyuan Li, consider this a small lesson. Don't be so arrogant."

Su Yun looked down at Xuanyuan Li, withdrew his pressure, and under the protection of Su Jian and Su Lie, merged into the void and departed with great strides.

Many Xuanyuan family powerhouses remained in shock, watching Su Yun's departing figure, unable to recover their senses for a long time.

The Su family's Young Master, at such a young age, had reached ninety-nine dragons of power and even grasped the Su family's supreme authority. He was truly a dragon among men, a peerless prodigy.

A single word from him made even Xuanyuan Ze unable to meet his gaze directly.

In stark contrast, Xuanyuan Li—also a divine family heir—now knelt prostrate on the ground, covered in blood, his meridians shattered, severely wounded.

Though he possessed an ancient demon god legacy, with his meridians crippled, his future was essentially over.

Compared to Su Yun, he was even more of a waste now.

Many Xuanyuan family powerhouses could already see the future. Under Su Yun's leadership, the Su family would surely rise to even greater heights.

And the Xuanyuan family?

They pondered this and fell into silence.

If they wanted to preserve the Xuanyuan family's dignity and avoid declining too severely, it seemed the best approach was to endure patiently, not provoke Su Yun, and ideally recover the clan-guarding divine weapon, the Xuanyuan Sword.

"Young Master Su Yun has departed as well."

Xuanyuan Chong calmly sat down in the seat to Xuanyuan Ze's right—the seat that had originally belonged to Xuanyuan Li. He smiled slightly and said: "I propose that we vote by show of hands on Divine Son Xuanyuan Shen's proposal to make Xuanyuan Jian the alternate heir."

Having spoken, without even seeking Xuanyuan Ze's approval as patriarch, he was the first to raise his hand.

"I agree."

"I also agree!"

"At this point, there doesn't seem to be a better choice."

"Let Xuanyuan Jian become the young mistress. Order our subordinate forces everywhere to pull back and avoid provoking the Su family. We might even need to yield some benefits to Su Yun to appease the Su family's anger."

"I also agree. After all, our Xuanyuan family has a thousand years of accumulated reserves. Retreating one step won't hurt us fundamentally."

...

Almost everyone present raised their hands, including the many ancient figures who had emerged from the reserves.

No one objected to bowing to the Su family and yielding some resources and benefits to appease the Su family's anger.

After all, given the Xuanyuan family's current divided state—with Xuanyuan Chong having become an alternate council member yet at odds with Patriarch Xuanyuan Ze—they couldn't possibly match the Su family at the height of its power.

If war broke out, the Xuanyuan family would be finished. They, accustomed to their pampered lives, no longer dared to go head-to-head with the Su family.

In short—endure for now, continue enjoying their wealth and status.

...

"All eighteen battalions of the Su family, hear my command. Surround the Imperial Capital. Complete martial law. Without my orders, no one is permitted to leave the Imperial Capital." Su Yun's indifferent voice was transmitted through the Patriarch Token to the Su family's eighteen battalions outside the Imperial Capital.

"Five Elemental Divine Battalions, Thunder God Battalion, Lightning God Battalion, Wind God Battalion—these eight battalions are responsible for sealing the Su family headquarters. Within the entire Su family, without my orders, anyone who dares act without authorization—regardless of who they are, their position, status, or background—is to be executed on the spot. No need to request instructions."

Soon, Su Yun's orders spread throughout the entire Su family, including to the many direct-line members currently holding the Su family's internal supreme council meeting.

Among them were even Divine Spirit-level powerhouses from the Su family's elder generation who had ignited their divine fire.

The moment they heard Su Yun's orders, they were completely dumbfounded.

What was going on? Su Yun was actually ordering the mobilization of the Su family's eighteen divine battalions? Had he lost his mind?

He wanted to lock down the entire Imperial Capital?

What right did he have?
