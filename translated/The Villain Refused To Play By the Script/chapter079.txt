Chapter 79: What Nonsense Are You Spouting?

"Yayue."

Being so directly rejected by Su Yayue, a flash of darkness crossed Li Yi's eyes. His expression turned cold as he watched Su Yayue's stunning figure walk toward the Su family gates.

With such a heaven-sent opportunity before him, how could he just watch Su Yayue slip through his fingers?

This was his best chance to rise.

He knew the Su family's strength. If he let Su Yayue enter the Su family and a powerhouse inside discovered she possessed an Innate Dao Body, it would no longer be something he could interfere with.

Moreover, since arriving in the Imperial Capital, he had heard of Su Yun's domineering reputation. Su Yayue was so beautiful and talented—the reason she was inducted into the personal guard battalion was likely because Su Yun coveted her beauty.

If Su Yayue's body was taken by Su Yun, that would be an enormous loss.

He had to strike first while Su Yayue's Innate Dao Body had only just awakened.

As for the surrounding guards, Li Yi paid them no mind. Unless the Eighteen Battalions' Divine Generals personally intervened, who could possibly keep him here? He had that much confidence.

Besides, his master True Feather Divine Spirit would return soon.

Would the Su family really make an enemy of the Kunlun Daoist Sect over a mere personal guard and do something to him, an alternate Dao Child?

If it really came down to it, he would just have to forcibly take Su Yayue back to the Kunlun Daoist Sect. Would Su Yun really storm into the Kunlun Daoist Sect to snatch her back for the sake of a mere personal guard?

Even the Su family patriarch might not have that courage, let alone a mere heir.

"Yayue, wait."

Thinking this, Li Yi's figure flickered as he blocked Su Yayue's path. Hiding the darkness in his eyes, he smiled. "You're probably reluctant to leave the massive resources the Su family's personal guard battalion provides.

"What you don't know is that my master is True Feather Divine Spirit, the famous female Divine Spirit of China. Her strength isn't much weaker than China's six strongest Divine Spirits.

"If you return with me, I can recommend you to my master and have her take you as her disciple.

"A Divine Spirit approaching the level of the strongest taking you as a disciple—isn't that better than staying in this Su family? Su Heng the Divine Spirit certainly won't take you as a disciple."

"Li Yi, how many times do I have to tell you before you understand? The Young Master has shown me great kindness and changed my fate. I will never go back with you based on your mere promises." Su Yayue's gaze had grown quite cold, though when she mentioned Su Yun, a peculiar light flashed in her eyes.

Over these days of interaction, she could see that Li Yi had improper intentions toward her.

If not for Li Yi's helpful guidance in her cultivation of the Inquiry of the Dao Scripture, she would have turned hostile long ago.

"No matter what benefits you offer, I won't go back with you. Give up."

"Yayue, you... you..."

Li Yi's heart sank. He keenly caught that peculiar flash in Su Yayue's eyes when she mentioned "Young Master."

Clearly, Su Yayue had already developed feelings for Su Yun.

If Su Yun had improper intentions toward her, she absolutely wouldn't refuse.

"Yayue, the Innate Dao Body is a supreme physique of the Daoist path. How can you develop worldly feelings for a mundane person? This will affect your cultivation."

Li Yi's expression was somewhat ugly.

"What business is it of yours?"

Su Yayue said coldly. Thoroughly annoyed by Li Yi, she flew directly toward the Su family gates.

"Yayue, I'm doing this for your own good. You'll understand eventually."

"Come back with me!"

Suddenly, Li Yi let out a low growl, his voice deep. He thrust out his hand toward Su Yayue, yin and yang energy pervading. Using a Daoist divine ability and some unknown treasure, he separated himself and Su Yayue into an isolated space, preventing the surrounding Eighteen Battalions soldiers from noticing anything.

Within the yin-yang space, seventy yin-yang dragons roared, shaking the heavens. Yin and yang energy rolled, powerful beyond measure.

Li Yi was indeed worthy of being the Kunlun Daoist Sect's alternate Dao Child—his strength was extremely formidable.

"Li Yi, have you gone mad?!"

Su Yayue cried out, quickly turning around. Her body merged with the heavens, channeling the myriad Daos, and she clashed with Li Yi.

Su Yayue had only recently broken through to the Divine Profound realm. No matter how talented she was, how could she match Li Yi? Blood seeped from the corner of her mouth as she was forced back three steps.

"I'm not mad. I know that returning to the Daoist sect with me is the best choice for you, Yayue."

"If you enter the Su family, your Innate Dao Body will no longer be pure. You'll thank me for this eventually."

Li Yi's voice carried a hint of madness. With a growl, yin and yang energy surging around his body, he immediately pressed forward, his palm striking down toward Su Yayue.

He knew they weren't far from the Su family gates, where powerhouses gathered. Even with the treasure's isolation, he had to end this quickly.

"What nonsense are you spouting? Li Yi, I really misjudged you!" Su Yayue was furious, though despair flashed in her eyes. The gap in strength between her and Li Yi was too great. Was she really going to be forcibly taken to the Daoist sect by this man?

"Yayue, he really is spouting nonsense."

At that moment, a cold voice suddenly penetrated the yin-yang isolation space.

"Young Master!" Hearing this voice, Su Yayue cried out in delighted surprise.

"So what if Su Yun has come?!" Li Yi's pupils contracted sharply. Gritting his teeth, he reached for Su Yayue regardless of anything else.

This heaven-sent opportunity was worth the gamble.

Even if he lost the bet, the Su family wouldn't dare do anything to him, an alternate Dao Child.

With a hum, a beam of divine light pierced through the treasure space. An ancient mirror entered the yin-yang space.

In an instant, the terrifying might of an ancient divine weapon pervaded the yin-yang space, directly shattering it.

Li Yi coughed up blood. The destruction of the treasure space caused him severe backlash.

But what he found even harder to believe was that this treasure mirror gave him a strong sense of familiarity, as if he had seen it somewhere before.

"That's the Kunlun Mirror! The treasure that guards my Kunlun Daoist Sect! Wasn't it stolen by a divine thief five hundred years ago?"

Li Yi roared, his eyes filled with terror.

He had seen this mirror in the portrait of the Ancestral Master hanging in the Sect Master's hall when he first joined the sect. The appearance was identical.

And this powerful ancient divine might couldn't be faked.

At that moment, a tall figure suddenly appeared beside Su Yayue. His face was so handsome it bordered on demonic, his gaze cold. One arm wrapped around Su Yayue while his other hand formed a fist, clashing with Li Yi's incoming attack.

A terrifying dragon roar seemed to echo through the void. Li Yi's seventy yin-yang dragons were directly shattered into scattered yin and yang energy.

"So strong!"

Deep terror flashed in Li Yi's pupils. His body shuddered violently. The bones in his striking hand directly shattered, and the terrifying force surged into his body like a flood, seeming to grind his internal organs to powder.
