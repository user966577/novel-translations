Chapter 95: How Can You Break the Agreement?

From deep within the Su family compound, within the pocket dimension, terrifying auras stirred and churned, causing the heavens to tremble.

At least ten beings who had ignited their divine fire.

Terrifying divine might converged, all focused on Su Yun's villa, freezing endless space-time.

Faintly, through the infinite void, one could see one terrifying Divine Spirit after another in some mysterious space—their bodies towering, divine fire burning, their eyes filled with the cold, emotionless intent of divine beings.

In an instant, terrifying killing intent descended upon True Feather Divine Spirit, An Ruoyi, and all the Celestial Maiden Sect powerhouses, instantly draining the color from their faces.

This was merely a glimpse of the Su family's reserves, yet it was so powerful it nearly suffocated them.

Worthy of being the Su family—one of the most powerful families in the entire world.

Such depth was simply terrifying beyond comprehension.

"Young Master Su Yun, I have overstepped."

An Ruoyi's face had gone slightly pale. She immediately addressed Su Yun.

It was mainly True Feather Divine Spirit's remark about "seductresses" that had angered her. Now that she had regained her composure, she immediately realized this was the Su family. With an ancient divine weapon suppressing it and deep reserves, this was not a place where she could act recklessly.

"Ruoyi Divine Spirit, True Feather Divine Spirit, may I ask what brings you here today? Otherwise, I won't see you out."

Su Yun's gaze was cold and heartless. With a wave of his hand, he was directly showing them the door, without a shred of consideration for these devastatingly beautiful, otherworldly women—as if they were nothing more than painted skeletons.

Terrifying killing intent swirled in the sky. The ancient divine weapon had awakened. With a single thought from him, he could keep all of them in the Su family.

At that moment, True Feather Divine Spirit's face remained pale. She glanced at An Ruoyi and her entourage, then turned to Su Yun. "Young Master Su Yun, there are too many eyes and ears here. Could we find a private place to speak alone?"

"No need!"

Su Yun's expression was cold and indifferent. With a wave of his hand, he said, "The three days are up. I never mince words. I want to know your answer."

Cold. Domineering. Not leaving True Feather Divine Spirit the slightest bit of face. Playing the part of a hedonistic young master to perfection.

True Feather Divine Spirit's exquisite face grew even paler. She bit her lip and glanced at An Ruoyi.

She and An Ruoyi had been at odds since their youth, always looking down on each other, constantly competing.

With An Ruoyi present, how could she possibly say such things?

At that moment, An Ruoyi smiled enchantingly and said to True Feather Divine Spirit, "Dear sister, if you can't do it, just hurry back home."

With that, An Ruoyi turned to Su Yun and stepped closer, speaking seductively, "Young Master Su Yun, you said that if True Feather Divine Spirit accompanies you for three days, she can take the Innate Dao Body as a disciple and borrow the Kunlun Mirror for three days.

"Since you're not interested in any of my Celestial Maiden Sect elders—

"Then how about Ruoyi? Can I obtain these things with the same conditions as True Feather?"

An Ruoyi's face was enchanting, her cheeks flushed like two red clouds, extremely captivating, making one's heart flutter.

"Is that so?"

Su Yun's lips curved. He suddenly stood up and walked to An Ruoyi. He actually reached out with one finger to lift her chin. Towering over her by more than half a head, he gazed down at her mist-covered eyes, then suddenly lowered his head.

And kissed her!

In that instant, the entire scene froze. Everyone stood dumbfounded, staring blankly at the sight.

It had to be said—Su Yun was handsome to the point of being almost demonic, while An Ruoyi was enchanting and alluring. Together, they looked like a golden couple, a perfect match, appearing so well-suited to each other.

Yet the various Celestial Maiden Sect elders were nearly suffocating.

They understood An Ruoyi all too well. Beneath her smooth social grace and enchanting exterior lay an incomparably proud heart and an iron will.

According to the Celestial Maiden Sect's Red Dust Scripture, one should enter the world to entrust the seven emotions and six desires, then sever them to walk the path of the strongest Divine Spirit.

Yet An Ruoyi was too proud. To this day, she still hadn't found any man worthy of her attention. Through her own formidable talent alone, she had forcibly stepped into the half-step strongest Divine Spirit realm.

But at this moment, she was being forcibly kissed by a man decades younger than her, with strength far inferior to hers, right in front of all these people.

An Ruoyi was also stunned. Her beautiful eyes were covered with mist as she stared blankly at the man so close to her, whose eyes were filled with dominance.

She never could have imagined Su Yun would be bold enough to do this.

At such close range, with her strength, she could kill Su Yun in an instant with just a hand movement. Not even the ancient divine weapon could save him.

Yet she found that there wasn't the slightest anger in her heart.

And her heartbeat had suddenly accelerated.

She could hear the sound of her own heart pounding wildly.

Those domineering eyes. That handsome, nearly perfect face. That heedless personality.

An Ruoyi was becoming intoxicated.

"An Ruoyi, you seductress."

At that moment, True Feather Divine Spirit's extremely gloomy voice, low as muffled thunder, exploded and jolted An Ruoyi awake. She hastily pushed Su Yun away and retreated several steps, like a flustered young maiden. Her face was covered in a red flush, and she didn't dare meet Su Yun's eyes.

"Not bad. I approve. Your conditions can replace True Feather Divine Spirit's."

Su Yun's lips curved into a wicked arc. He stroked his own lips, seeming to linger on the sensation from just now.

His goal had been achieved.

An Ruoyi's destiny was also extremely powerful. In the original novel, she had been Su Yayue's master. In the end, her strength had reached a terrifying level.

And because she had shared a night with Ye Ling, using Ye Ling to sever the seven emotions and six desires, she had helped Ye Ling several times at crucial moments. She was a very important supporting female character.

Moreover, given her status as Celestial Maiden Sect Master, if Su Yun wanted to conquer the Daoist sects, he couldn't possibly let her go.

But Su Yun also understood An Ruoyi's temperament and the peculiarities of the Celestial Maiden Sect's Red Dust Scripture. So he had been laying groundwork until now. The reason he had let the information leak was precisely because he knew that given the hostile relationship between the Celestial Maiden Sect and Kunlun Daoist Sect, they would spare no cost to disrupt Kunlun's plans.

When it came to playing mind games, Su Yun was a professional.

This kiss would surely leave a deep imprint in the heart of this powerful Divine Spirit.

"This can't be right."

True Feather Divine Spirit was dumbstruck, her body rigid, not knowing how to react.

The next moment, intense fury filled her heart.

Su Yun was actually willing to substitute An Ruoyi for her—what about her then?

What about her disciple Li Yi?

The Innate Dao Body could only go to one person. There was only one Kunlun Mirror. What about the Kunlun Daoist Sect?

And she had gone through a massive psychological struggle before finally making up her mind. The sect was waiting for her to bring back good news.

But if she failed—

If the Innate Dao Body and Kunlun Mirror fell into the Celestial Maiden Sect's hands—

True Feather Divine Spirit didn't dare imagine those consequences.

"Young Master Su Yun, how can you break the agreement?"

True Feather Divine Spirit's voice came out hoarse.
