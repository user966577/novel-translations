Chapter 108: What's the Difference From a Vassal Family?

"Xuanyuan Ze, this Young Master has said that if the Su family wants to fight, we do not fear it. It's only out of consideration for the bond between our two families that this Young Master has merely demanded the removal of the Xuanyuan family heir while still preserving your position as patriarch. I'm only asking you to surrender your Patriarch Token to the family council."

Su Yun's expression was cold, but deep in his eyes lurked a cold smile. "As long as you can sincerely repent, the family council may not necessarily refuse to restore your powers."

He understood that from this moment forward, the Xuanyuan family had officially fallen apart.

A family without someone truly in charge, with factions fighting among themselves, would inevitably splinter into pieces.

From now on, the Su family could devour the Xuanyuan family's power piece by piece.

Looking at Xuanyuan Ze, killing intent surged in the depths of Su Yun's eyes. Next, this so-called patriarch had to die. And Xuanyuan Li had to die too.

"Su Yun, your wolfish ambitions toward my Xuanyuan family are known to the entire world. It's simply pitiable that my former mercy toward these people allowed you to exploit our weaknesses, leading to today's fractured state."

Xuanyuan Ze growled, his eyes filled with deep pain.

He understood that he could no longer command these people.

If he continued to force the issue, they might not hesitate to move against him and forcibly take the Patriarch Token.

If it truly came to that, there would be no rules left within the Xuanyuan family.

Xuanyuan Ze truly couldn't understand how the Xuanyuan family had come to this fractured state, step by step.

Did these people truly not understand? Once they knelt to Su Yun today and removed the heir, what would they use to satisfy his appetite next time?

At that moment, Xuanyuan Ze suddenly looked toward the Su family compound and roared: "Xuanyuan Jian, don't forget—you still bear the Xuanyuan surname! Your body flows with my blood! If you betray the Xuanyuan family, you won't come to a good end either!"

With that, he slowly drew out the Patriarch Token and tossed it to Xuanyuan Chong.

"Father, how can you back down!"

Xuanyuan Li growled, his eyes filled with disbelief. Father had actually retreated again.

The Patriarch Token controlled the Xuanyuan family's heritage. Even if the Elite Guard betrayed them, they still had other family resources they could use.

"Li'er, it's useless."

"Hand the Young Master Token over to them."

Xuanyuan Ze sighed heavily, firmly patting Xuanyuan Li's shoulder. A cold gleam of killing intent flashed in his eyes as he rasped: "Li'er, Father is still the patriarch. We still have a chance.

"They cannot remove Father from that position.

"Let's go!"

Xuanyuan Li's eyes were filled with pain. How could he not understand his father's meaning—he was referring to the ancient relic left behind by the Divine Farmer Shennong.

If they could break through the relic and obtain its legacy and ancient divine weapon, there would still be a chance to turn the tables.

But by then, both the Patriarch Token and Young Master Token would have been surrendered. Trying to reunify the Xuanyuan family again would be extremely difficult.

But at this point, Xuanyuan Li was powerless to change anything.

"Hum!"

Xuanyuan Li casually tossed the Young Master Token to Xuanyuan Chong and growled: "Xuanyuan Chong, you traitor! I, Xuanyuan Li, swear that one day I will personally purge the family of you—I'll bury you beneath the main gate so that generation after generation of Xuanyuan descendants can trample over you!"

With that, Xuanyuan Li followed Xuanyuan Ze, striding into the Xuanyuan family estate.

"Just you?"

Xuanyuan Chong sneered coldly, gripping the Patriarch Token and Young Master Token in each hand, the depths of his eyes filled with excitement.

These two tokens representing the Xuanyuan family's supreme power had finally fallen into his hands.

"In the name of the Supreme Council, I take possession of the Patriarch Token and command the Elite Guard to withdraw from the Imperial Capital and return to their original positions.

"I announce that the Supreme Council has reached consensus: Xuanyuan Li is hereby removed from his position as heir."

Xuanyuan Chong didn't dare delay. He immediately made the announcement before the eyes of the entire Imperial Capital.

At this moment, as the overwhelming presence beyond the Imperial Capital gradually receded, countless powerhouses nearly suffocated.

A Divine Spirit family that had been passed down for over a thousand years had actually been forced to remove their heir and strip the patriarch of his powers.

This was a disgrace.

Something that hadn't happened in countless years.

They didn't know whether the Su family would truly have dared to fight to the end if the Xuanyuan family had shown iron resolve and refused to back down.

But they understood that Su Yun had accomplished something that all previous Su family patriarchs—even strongest Divine Spirits—had never achieved.

Under his machinations, the Xuanyuan family's prestige had utterly collapsed, and so had their strength.

"Pfft!"

And at that moment, Xuanyuan Ze, who had just stepped through the gate, spat out a large mouthful of blood. With Xuanyuan Li's support, he barely managed to walk away, step by step, disappearing from everyone's sight.

He had become a disgrace to the Xuanyuan family for the ages.

Throughout all of history, no patriarch of a major family had ever been forced to surrender the Patriarch Token in front of countless people while watching his own son be stripped of his position.

"Congratulations to the Xuanyuan family for making the wise decision. The friendship between the Su family and Xuanyuan family shall endure for all time." Su Yun smiled, giving a slight wave. The terrifying presences within the Su family compound gradually subsided.

But at that moment, Xuanyuan Chong noticed a cold gleam flash in Su Yun's eyes. He still hadn't ordered the Su family's Eighteen Battalions to withdraw, as if waiting for something.

Xuanyuan Chong's heart clenched. He immediately understood Su Yun's meaning.

This entire affair had been orchestrated by Su Yun.

He understood that if he wanted to hold power in the Supreme Council going forward, he couldn't do without Su Yun's support.

"The Xuanyuan family is a Divine Spirit family—we cannot go a single day without an heir."

Xuanyuan Chong's voice was low as he slowly said: "Since Xuanyuan Li has been removed, I propose that the alternate heir Xuanyuan Jian be promoted to official family heir to take possession of the Young Master Token. This will demonstrate to the Su family that our Xuanyuan family has no intention of severing relations with them.

"Our two great families shall continue our friendship—forever.

"Does anyone have objections?"

At these words, all the direct-line members were stunned.

Xuanyuan Jian had been living in the Su family compound all along. She was Su Yun's fiancée. Before long, there would be a wedding ceremony.

Was it really appropriate to give the Young Master Token, which represented a portion of the Xuanyuan family's power, to Xuanyuan Jian?

They fell silent.

Reason told them they shouldn't agree.

But with the Su family's power so overwhelming, with the Eighteen Battalions still present and Su Yun watching them like a tiger eyeing its prey, they didn't dare object.

At that moment, Su Yun suddenly smiled: "As the Su family's heir, this Young Master understands very well how important an heir is to a family.

"If the Xuanyuan family makes Jian'er the heir, this Young Master has decided to let Jian'er return to the family. This demonstrates that the Su family has absolutely no intention of meddling in the Xuanyuan family's internal affairs."

With that, Su Yun's eyes flashed with cold light as his gaze swept across the assembled Xuanyuan family heirs. Not a single one dared meet his eyes.

Xuanyuan Jian was already his woman, and she had sworn a Heart Demon oath. She had been thoroughly conquered by him. So he wasn't the least bit worried that Xuanyuan Jian would betray him once she held power.

With Xuanyuan Jian returning to the Xuanyuan family and holding the Young Master Token, with no one in the Xuanyuan family holding the Patriarch Token, she would be the highest authority. She could better coordinate with him to purge the Xuanyuan family and devour it piece by piece.

Throughout the Imperial Capital, a suffocating silence fell.

Countless major families and powerhouses felt ice run through their veins, utterly horrified.

Su Yun's words made his intentions clear.

But letting a married-out woman hold the Xuanyuan family's supreme power—how was that any different from being a vassal family to the Su family?
