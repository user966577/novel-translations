Chapter 155: The Necklace

"As you command, Yu'er." True Feather Divine Spirit smiled lightly, then turned to look at An Ruoyi and said:

"Demoness, do you have anything to say?"

"Your disciple colluded with the Demon Race, causing considerable casualties among the Su family's army. According to the rules, the Young Master would be justified in exterminating her entire clan—and that includes your Celestial Maiden Sect!"

With those words, True Feather Divine Spirit walked toward Holy Maiden Mingyu, deliberately slowing her steps.

An Ruoyi's expression turned cold. She naturally understood True Feather Divine Spirit's intentions and wouldn't be provoked by her. With a cold laugh, she said: "Mingyu is a traitor to my Celestial Maiden Sect. She secretly colluded with the Demon Race, a crime deserving death. All punishments from the Young Master are exactly what she deserves."

"In my capacity as Celestial Maiden Sect's Sect Master, I announce: Mingyu is stripped of her Holy Maiden position and expelled from the Celestial Maiden Sect. Everything about her from now on has nothing to do with my sect."

At this moment, the many Celestial Maiden Sect elders and peak masters who had just arrived looked at Mingyu with eyes full of disgust, speaking out one after another:

"We support the Sect Master's decision."

"Colluding with the Demon Race is unconscionable. She brought catastrophic losses upon the sect—being sent to the Su family's Courtesan Battalion is already letting her off easy."

"She should be executed by a thousand cuts, torn to pieces, so the entire Human Race can see what happens to those who collude with the Demon Race."

"I never imagined the sect would raise her, only for her to betray us for a demon, nearly pushing the sect into an endless abyss."

...

One angry condemnation after another rang out.

In this moment, Mingyu was completely desperate, her face pale to the extreme.

Even her master and sect had abandoned her. Who could save her now?

She was supposed to become the Demon Empress. For that, she had sacrificed everything.

"Mo Yu, save me! I don't want to go to the Courtesan Battalion, to be violated by countless people." Mingyu's voice was shrill, piercing through the heavens.

She swore that if given another chance, she would never gamble everything again.

She would rather have handed over Mo Yu, waited obediently for her master to pass away, inherited the Sect Master position, and lived out her life in peace.

"Yu'er." Mo Yu's voice was hoarse, filled with endless struggle and pain. After a moment, he suddenly rasped: "Su Yun, as long as you don't harm Yu'er, I swear in the name of the Demon God to agree to any condition you propose."

"Oh?"

Instantly, a cold glint flashed through Su Yun's eyes. He waved at True Feather Divine Spirit.

True Feather Divine Spirit understood immediately. With a thought, the rolling dark clouds vanished, and Mo Yu, who had been engulfed by the sea of thunder, crashed down from the sky, his body blackened by divine thunder.

"Truly worthy of possessing the bloodline of an Ancient Demon God, a direct line of the Demon Race's Demon Emperor."

Seeing this, even Su Yun couldn't help but marvel internally at Mo Yu's powerful vitality and physique.

First severely wounded by An Ruoyi using the Qiankun Cauldron, then bombarded by True Feather Divine Spirit's divine technique for so long—yet he still maintained such powerful life force.

In the original novel, Mo Yu was the son of the Demon Emperor, albeit a bastard born to the Demon Emperor and an ordinary demon woman. Yet his talent was extraordinarily heaven-defying. Targeted and hunted by the Demon Emperor's eldest son, he had been cast into the endless void, drifting to the Human Race, where he was saved by Mingyu and Ye Ling.

A textbook protagonist template.

Later, he became the Demon Race's Emperor, becoming one of the most powerful existences on Blue Star, and through iron-blooded methods, completely took control of the entire Demon Race.

Though the protagonist Ye Ling was alone, with Mo Yu as the Demon Emperor supporting him from behind, he had gained powerful influence among the Human Race.

However, even at his peak, Ye Ling hadn't helped the Human Race reclaim the Demon Race's territory.

"In this life, there shall be only one voice on Blue Star—the voice of the Human Race. And more specifically, my voice."

Cold light flashed repeatedly in Su Yun's eyes. He raised his hand to have True Feather Divine Spirit restrain Mingyu, then looked at Mo Yu with a smile: "What if I want you to submit to me?"

Mo Yu struggled to his feet. One of the horns on his head had already broken off. His blood-red eyes looked at Su Yun, then turned to look at Mingyu before falling into silence.

He was the strongest genius of the Demon Race, possessing the bloodline of a Demon God. How proud his heart was.

Moreover, he had promised his mother that he would definitely become the Demon Emperor, slay that beast with his own hands, and avenge her.

"Mo Yu, I beg you, save me, save me. I saved your life once. I have nothing left now—you're all I have." Mingyu pleaded desperately, her voice filled with misery, beautiful eyes brimming with tears.

Hearing Mingyu's voice.

Seeing Mingyu's wretched state, Mo Yu's heart ached until he could barely breathe.

Yes, this woman had saved his life.

And for him, Mingyu had given up everything.

He had sworn to protect this woman for the rest of his life—she was his everything.

What was he still hesitating for?

"Mingyu, believe me. I said I would protect you for a lifetime."

Mo Yu's voice was hoarse and low. He then turned to look at Su Yun and said: "I, Mo Yu, of Demon God bloodline, bastard son of the Demon Emperor, swear in the name of the Supreme Demon God to serve Su Yun faithfully for all eternity. Should I ever betray this oath, may my demon soul fall into the Demonic Abyss and suffer the torment of a hundred million Demon Gods gnawing at my heart."

"Su Yun, I've sworn. Please release Mingyu." Mo Yu's voice was hoarse.

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved slightly, his gaze cold: "The Demon Race is known for being ruthless and merciless. How could I believe you've truly submitted to me just because you swore an oath?"

"If you want me to release Mingyu, it's simple—go back and bring me your father's head and the Demon God weapon in exchange."

"But before that, there's another item on you that you need to hand over."

"What item?"

Mo Yu's blood-red eyes were filled with pain. He raised his head and saw Su Yun's gaze fixed on the necklace around his neck.

This was the only memento his mother had left him, containing a portion of her bloodline she had preserved for him.

It was the only thing he had to remember her by.

"Mo Yu, save me, save me..." Mingyu's miserable voice continued to ring out.

"I'll give it to you."

Mo Yu gritted his teeth, yanked off the necklace and handed it to Su Yun, saying: "Su Yun, what I, Mo Yu, have said will never change. From now on, you are my only master.

Within three years, I will definitely become the Demon Emperor and deliver my father's head and the Demon God weapon to you."

"Please, do not harm Mingyu."
