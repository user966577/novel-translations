Chapter 116: Are You Threatening Me?

"Su Jian, bring it here," Su Yun said flatly.

With that, Su Jian respectfully carried over a jade tablet, its surface densely carved with names. At the very end, one could faintly make out the names Su Heng, Su Yun, and Su Jian, flickering in and out of visibility.

This was none other than the Su family's genealogy.

Only direct-line members of the Su family could have their names inscribed upon it.

Su Jian herself had once been elevated to direct-line status under Su Heng's support, inscribing her name upon it.

At this moment, the faces of the Kunlun Divine Spirit and all the peak masters and elders turned extremely ugly.

After all, Su Yayue was someone they intended to cultivate as the next Sect Master of the Kunlun Daoist Sect. They had placed great hopes in her—otherwise they wouldn't have gone to such lengths and paid such a heavy price just to bring her into the sect.

But what if Su Yayue became a direct-line member of the Su family, Su Heng's adopted daughter?

Would the Kunlun Daoist Sect have to change its surname to 'Su' in the future?

"This Su Yun fellow is trying to completely drag my Kunlun Daoist Sect onto his ship." The Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression had become ugly to the extreme.

He desperately wanted to refuse, but he had absolutely no way to do so.

Fine!

He would first bring Su Yayue back to the sect. Over time, through gradual teaching, the Su family's position in her heart might not necessarily be higher than the Kunlun Daoist Sect's.

"Drip a drop of blood and make your oath. From today forward, Yayue, you will be a direct-line member of my Su family," Su Yun said with a smile.

"Yes!"

Su Yayue didn't hesitate. She immediately bit her fingertip and dripped a drop of blood onto the tablet.

"I, Su Yayue, voluntarily join the Su family. I will strive my entire life for the Su family's great endeavors, holding family interests as my highest honor, sparing not even myself. Should I ever violate this oath, may I suffer eternal damnation, to be executed by the entire clan." Su Yayue's solemn voice echoed through the great hall.

This oath didn't have the powerful control of the Heart Demon Pill, like the one used on Kunlun Daoist Sect's current Dao Child Li Yi.

But the path of cultivation valued courage and determination.

If one violated their oath without possessing powerful willpower, an indelible mark would be left on the spirit. Their cultivation path would essentially reach its end.

This was how various families controlled newly joined members.

Of course, it only worked on new members. For children born to existing direct-line members, there wasn't much binding power—which was why families like the Su family and Xuanyuan family, passed down for over a thousand years, had produced so many people who placed their personal interests above the family's.

"Young Master Su Yun, can Yayue now take me as her master and return with me to the sect?"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit forced a smile. "The sect has many pressing matters. We've been away for quite some time now..."

Before he could finish, Su Yun smiled faintly and said: "Naturally you may. However, before that, I have one small request that I hope the Kunlun Daoist Sect can agree to."

"What condition?"

The Kunlun Divine Spirit was already growing numb.

What happened to being a man of his word?

"As the Sect Master surely knows, my father is campaigning against the Barbarian Tribe on the American continent. He defeated the Spirit Barbarian lineage of the Barbarians and occupied one-fifth of their territory," Su Yun said with a smile.

"But these Barbarians truly live up to their name—utterly savage and uncivilized. The millions of Barbarians remaining in those territories constantly burn, kill, and plunder, occasionally ambushing the camps where Father's army is stationed. It's giving Father quite the headache.

"So I'd like the Sect Master to do me a small favor—personally make a trip to the front lines. Preferably bring a group of elders and peak masters to civilize these Barbarians, let them experience the profound culture of China's Daoist sects, teach them shame and gratitude.

"Let them know that we humans are there to save them."

The moment Su Yun finished speaking, the Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression became incomparably ugly.

The other elders and peak masters' faces had already turned iron-green.

What "profound Daoist culture of China"? He just wanted them to help Su Heng suppress Barbarian resistance. Better yet, use Daoist techniques to brainwash them so they'd stop resisting and accept Su family rule there.

But this was millions of Barbarians, with countless powerful beings among them.

Heaven only knew how many Kunlun Daoist Sect powerhouses would die there.

To put it bluntly, he was asking the sect to be free muscle for Su Heng.

"The Young Master jests."

The Kunlun Divine Spirit's face twitched a few times as he forced a smile. "Millions of Barbarians—how could my Kunlun Daoist Sect possibly civilize them? Besides, brainwashing and such is the specialty of those Buddhist baldies. My Kunlun Daoist Sect isn't skilled in such things."

Moreover, this was a Federation foreign campaign. Heaven only knew how much controversy existed in the Supreme Council. The waters were too deep—the Kunlun Divine Spirit had no desire to involve his sect.

"If that's the case, then I'm in quite a difficult position!"

Su Yun sighed. "Yu'er told me that Daoist techniques are no less effective than Buddhist ones. She even volunteered to lead a group of Kunlun Daoist Sect powerhouses to the American continent.

"I didn't want to trouble her so.

"But since the Sect Master is unwilling, I can only have Yu'er and Yayue take the Kunlun Mirror and lead a contingent of troops to support Father.

"Under such circumstances, though it pains me to say it, I'll have to postpone Yayue's discipleship to the Kunlun Daoist Sect a bit longer."

In an instant, the Kunlun Divine Spirit was dumbstruck, as were all the peak masters and elders.

What happened to being a man of his word?

"Oh, right."

At that moment, Su Yun suddenly seemed to remember something and said: "Last night, your sect's Dao Child Li Yi visited me. He said he was willing to help Yu'er lead troops and a group of Daoist disciples to the American continent. He's already taken Yu'er's Vice Sect Master token and returned to the sect ahead of us.

"Dao Child Li Yi was so gracious that I couldn't refuse. I had no choice but to reluctantly let Dao Yuan accompany Li Yi back as well."

"Su Yun, what did you say!"

Instantly, the Kunlun Divine Spirit growled, his expression becoming extremely ugly as he shot to his feet.

The Dao Child plus the Vice Sect Master, plus Dao Yuan—who had once held tremendous prestige in the sect—combined together, they already wielded enormous influence, perhaps not inferior to his own as Sect Master.

If Su Yayue and the Kunlun Mirror were added to that, the Kunlun Divine Spirit simply couldn't imagine the consequences.

Su Yun was openly threatening him now.

If he didn't help, not only would Su Yayue not take him as her master anytime soon—

But True Feather Divine Spirit and the Dao Child would join forces to split the Kunlun Daoist Sect.

At this moment, the Kunlun Divine Spirit suddenly recalled how, at the gates of the Xuanyuan family, Li Yi and True Feather Divine Spirit had declared war on the Xuanyuan family without even consulting him, forcing his hand.

At the time, he had thought it was just an accident.

But now he suddenly understood.

He seemed to have made an extremely foolish decision, handing over a portion of the Kunlun Daoist Sect's power to Su Yun.

Su Yun was determined to drag the Kunlun Daoist Sect onto his ship. Now his wolfish ambitions had been completely exposed.

"Su Yun, are you threatening me?" The Kunlun Divine Spirit's expression became extremely ugly.
