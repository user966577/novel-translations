Chapter 60: Divine Son's Summons?

"Roar, roar, roar..."

Infinite heaven and earth elemental energy gathered, condensing so densely it became liquid, coalescing around Su Yun's body. One by one, massive Chaos Dragons materialized outside his form, roaring ceaselessly.

Su Yun's Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art churned wildly. With the enhancement of twenty-fold cultivation speed, his strength began rising at a frantic pace.

Beside the twenty Chaos Dragons, more dragons were continuously being conjured. Dragon roars shook the heavens, howling at the firmament.

"Twenty-one."

"Twenty-three!"

"Thirty!"

"Thirty-five!"

...

One Chaos Dragon after another, lifelike with whiskers flowing, their massive bodies seeming to fill the entire sky, roaring continuously behind Su Yun.

And more Chaos Dragons kept materializing without end.

"Heavens, the Young Master is so monstrous." Liu Ting was shocked to the core. In all her years, she had never witnessed such a speed of power advancement.

If word got out, it would probably frighten a great many people to death.

Liu Ting already felt her heart couldn't take it.

After all, not long ago, Su Yun's strength had been greater than hers, but only by a limited margin—they were both at the Qi-Blood Realm.

But now, not only had Su Yun reached the Divine Profound Realm, he had already reached the ordinary Divine Profound Realm's limit—one dragon of power.

To advance another dragon of power from there was equivalent to breaking through one's limits again—incomparably difficult.

Yet for Su Yun, it seemed as simple as eating and drinking.

"If word of the Young Master's rate of power advancement and limit-breaking got out, it would probably frighten a great many so-called geniuses to death." Liu Ting thought to herself.

Since the spiritual energy revival, there had never been such a speed of power advancement—not even in recorded history.

"Ting'er, don't waste time. This is a great fortune—a perfect opportunity for you to break through to Divine Profound Realm."

At some point, Xuanyuan Jian had already sat down cross-legged, borrowing the dense elemental energy that Su Yun had gathered to cultivate.

And her form of address had unconsciously shifted from "Sister Ting" to "Ting'er."

Liu Ting didn't hesitate either, immediately sitting cross-legged to cultivate.

"Purple Heaven Palace."

"The God-Devil Scripture!"

In the sky, Su Yun cultivated while simultaneously reviewing the God-Devil Scripture that had appeared in his mind.

This was a supreme scripture created by Hongjun Daozu.

If the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art was a technique of the Great God Pangu, cultivating both body and soul together, then the God-Devil Scripture was somewhat more extreme. It walked the path of transcending the primordial spirit beyond space and time, separating it from the physical body, merging with the Dao—attempting to achieve immortality and indestructibility through the primordial spirit.

Su Yun was delighted to discover that the God-Devil Scripture and the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art didn't conflict with each other. One cultivated body and soul together, while the other focused specifically on tempering the primordial spirit.

"Then I'll cultivate both together."

Su Yun didn't hesitate, immediately beginning to cultivate the God-Devil Scripture.

As he cultivated both supreme scriptures simultaneously, his strength began rising at an even more frantic pace.

"Forty dragons of power."

"Forty-five... fifty, fifty-five..."

All at once, he could advance by five dragons of power.

Dense, massive divine dragons filled the heavens, their dragon might vast and overwhelming.

Fortunately, Su Yun was currently in the wilderness. Otherwise, if anyone witnessed this scene, it would probably frighten a great many people to death.

Such a terrifying speed of power advancement was unprecedented.

As time slowly passed, when the number of Chaos Dragons reached ninety-nine—the ultimate limit of the Divine Profound Realm—it suddenly stopped.

"Divine Profound Realm ultimate power."

Su Yun's lips curved. He slowly opened his eyes as a bolt of lightning flashed within them, directly splitting apart this dim sky.

Feeling the seemingly inexhaustible, overwhelming power within his body, Su Yun felt that if Xuanyuan Li stood before him and they clashed palms again, he could crush him into meat paste with a single slap.

"Purple Heaven Palace!"

Su Yun gazed at the God-Devil Pendant lying quietly in his palm, cold light flashing in his eyes. Purple Heaven Palace—he would have to visit sooner or later.

This was one of the largest ancient ruins on Azure Star, containing infinite resources and fortuitous encounters.

However, Purple Heaven Palace was located in the territory of the myriad races. Now was not the time to go.

After the vast elemental energy dissipated, Xuanyuan Jian and Liu Ting below also opened their beautiful eyes, joy flashing within them simultaneously.

"One dragon of power. I've actually reached the Divine Profound Realm's limit." Liu Ting was overjoyed. At Qingbei Academy, even among the scions of great families, those who could break through to Divine Profound Realm at this age were few and far between—let alone reaching one dragon of power.

"Twenty dragons of power."

Xuanyuan Jian's expression was cold, cold light flashing in her eyes. "If I face Xuanyuan Li again, within ten moves he will certainly be defeated. Within twenty moves, I will certainly cut him down."

"Young Master, Ran'er has urgent matters to report."

At that moment, Yun Ran's graceful, alluring figure suddenly emerged from space, bowing respectfully to Su Yun.

She too was stunned by the speed of the Young Master's power advancement.

"Speak." Su Yun said calmly, standing up and hanging the God-Devil Pendant at his waist. An aura of domineering nobility naturally emanated from him.

"Various direct-line members of the family have arbitrarily convened the highest council, wanting to remove the Young Master from the position of heir. They've also issued an external order demanding that the Young Master surrender the Young Master Token." Yun Ran's expression was icy, filled with killing intent. She continued:

"They originally intended to move with lightning speed to place the Madam under house arrest. But at the critical moment, Chaos Heavenly King suddenly switched sides, declaring his submission to the Young Master. He reported the entire situation to the Madam. The Madam has already led Swordless Heavenly King and a group of the Patriarch's direct loyalists to suppress them and confine them to their residences."

"These direct-line members all have deep connections to the Xuanyuan family's side."

"Meanwhile, within the Xuanyuan family, many great figures from ancient times have emerged from the reserves. The Divine Son of the Xuanyuan family's founding Divine Spirit has awakened. He has requested that you and Miss Xuanyuan Jian go to meet with him."

"Half an hour ago, the Patriarch sent word from the Federation that he grants the Young Master full authority to handle matters as you see fit."

"The Madam doesn't know how to proceed and sent this servant to seek the Young Master's instructions."

Liu Ting and Xuanyuan Jian felt chills run down their spines, their hair standing on end as they listened.

They had never imagined that in less than a day since leaving the Imperial Capital, so many earth-shaking events had occurred.

The Divine Son of the Xuanyuan family's founding Divine Spirit—what an ancient figure that must be, what level of powerhouse.

Unimaginable!

"Is that all?"

Yet Su Yun's expression remained unchanged, his eyes showing no emotional fluctuation whatsoever. Only when he heard that Su Heng had authorized him with full powers did a flash of surprise cross his eyes.

It seemed this father's boldness far exceeded his imagination.

"Return to the Imperial Capital. We go to the Xuanyuan family first. Jian'er, you come with me—let's meet this Divine Son ancestor of yours."

Su Yun's lips curved, his gaze indifferent as he flew toward the Imperial Capital.

"He's actually going to the Xuanyuan family first!"

Horror flashed in Yun Ran's eyes, but she didn't dare hesitate and immediately followed.
