Chapter 161: Massive System Reward

Endless heaven and earth energy was drawn from outside the underground palace, gathering into an incomparably massive vortex, forming a funnel of elemental energy spanning hundreds of thousands of zhang across the firmament.

"This is insane!" True Feather Divine Spirit was horrified.

The commotion she had caused when breaking through to Strongest Divine Spirit had been nothing more than this.

And at this moment, the system voice that Su Yun had been ignoring began ringing incessantly:

"Congratulations, Host. For reversing the destiny of the Demon Race's Child of Destiny, you are rewarded with 5,000 Charm Points."

"Congratulations, Host. For causing a change in the Demon Race's destiny, you are rewarded with 8,000 Charm Points."

"Congratulations, Host. For severing the fate of Daughter of Destiny Mingyu, you are rewarded with 2,000 Charm Points."

"Congratulations, Host. For conquering Divine Goddess An Ruoyi, you are rewarded with 9,000 Charm Points."

"Congratulations, Host. For unlocking the mysteries of the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art, you are rewarded with 10,000 Charm Points."

The continuous stream of system notifications rang in Su Yun's ears like an alarm clock, causing his heart to tremble violently.

This Charm Point reward far exceeded his imagination.

It seemed that obtaining An Ruoyi had triggered an enormous chain reaction. Combined with the tremendous use of the Ancient Divine Weapon, the Qiankun Cauldron, he had been rewarded with a full 9,000 Charm Points.

Especially the Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art discovery, which had rewarded 10,000 points.

This was the first time since obtaining the system that a single reward had exceeded 10,000 points. One could only imagine how profound an impact this Nine-Turn Profound Origin Art discovery would have on destiny.

And at that moment, the system voice sounded once more: "Congratulations, Host. For achieving a single Charm Point reward exceeding 10,000, you are rewarded with the Ancient Primordial Divine Weapons: Sun Essence Wheel and Moon Essence Wheel."

*Hiss!*

Even Su Yun drew in a sharp breath at this—two Ancient Divine Weapons rewarded at once.

One should know that even the protagonist Ye Ling had only possessed two Ancient Divine Weapons, and of course, they had all become his now.

Allowing his qi and blood to circulate automatically, Su Yun silently commanded: "Open the system panel."

Charm Points: 120,000 [Resonance with the Stars] [Cultivation speed increased 80-fold]

*Hiss! A 20-fold increase in cultivation speed in one go.*

Su Yun drew in a cold breath. The benefits from this campaign against the Celestial Maiden Sect had exceeded imagination.

After all, he had always believed that improving his own strength was the foundation of everything.

He then carefully read the system's description of the two Ancient Divine Weapons. This was the first time he had seen the system use such a lengthy description specifically for an item on the system panel.

"Great benefits for breaking through to Heaven Spirit Realm?"

"It seems these were specially created by the system for me after I achieved a Charm Point reward exceeding 10,000."

Su Yun murmured to himself.

At this moment, accompanied by a heaven-shaking rumble, a terrifying supreme might flashed through the underground palace.

*Boom!*

The massive vortex spanning hundreds of thousands of zhang was swallowed whole by Su Yun's Mountains and Rivers Profound Palace.

"990,000 zhang!"

"Heavens!"

Su Jian let out a low roar, his face flushed, his entire body trembling with excitement—the first time he had ever lost his composure before Su Yun.

It was impossible to imagine the violent shock this scene brought him.

"The Young Master has achieved a miracle unprecedented in all of Blue Star's history." True Feather Divine Spirit's beautiful eyes widened, filled with horror, her small mouth falling open without her realizing.

At this moment, An Ruoyi also emerged from the Qiankun Cauldron. The excitement on her face hadn't yet faded when she witnessed this earth-shattering scene. Her entire body instantly froze, her expression dazed, and she actually jumped straight down from the cauldron to the ground.

Unlike Su Jian and True Feather Divine Spirit, who had witnessed Su Yun's Profound Palace breakthrough before and had some tiny psychological preparation—

She had only just submitted to Su Yun.

The impact of this scene on her was beyond compare.

Back when she had been at the Profound Palace Realm, she too had reached 900,000 zhang, earning the title of the Celestial Maiden Sect's greatest genius in a thousand years.

This had also made her understand just how difficult it was to advance past 900,000 zhang.

One could say it wasn't that advancement was impossible—it was that the limitations of heaven and earth, Blue Star's capacity to bear the Profound Palace Realm, had reached its limit. It was like reaching Strongest Divine Spirit and being unable to advance further; generation after generation of Strongest Divine Spirits had no choice but to venture into the starry void, seeking unknown territories.

The ultimate of Profound Palace Realm was something impossible to achieve on Blue Star.

"Su Yun, how many more shocks can you give me?" An Ruoyi's eyes were wide, her face flushed, the redness extending down her neck.

The shock this scene brought her was beyond description.

Originally, her submission to Su Yun had been a choice made under duress, a submission before the Su family's million-strong army. Her heart remained incomparably proud—a 900,000-zhang Profound Palace was enough to rival the God Race's God Emperor.

But in this moment, because of this scene, she was completely and utterly convinced.

The ultimate of Profound Palace Realm.

A myth of Blue Star.

*Boom, boom, boom...*

And just as Su Yun's Profound Palace reached 990,000 zhang, a vast purple thunder pierced through endless void and crashed heavily into Su Yun's Profound Palace.

*Bang!*

The world within the palace shattered. Space ruptured. Endless spirit herbs and ancient trees were destroyed. The aura of destruction pervaded Su Yun's Profound Palace.

"Nine Heavens Divine Thunder."

An Ruoyi and True Feather Divine Spirit exclaimed simultaneously, their eyes filled with horror.

Nine Heavens Divine Thunder was famous throughout the Daoist tradition—a legendary divine thunder belonging exclusively to the Heavenly Dao. Only those who suffered heavenly punishment, those whom heaven and earth could not tolerate, would face such tribulation.

Their gazes pierced through space to look outside the underground palace. Throughout the mountain ranges, within a radius of hundreds of thousands of miles, dense dark clouds blocked out the sky. Thunder crashed incessantly. Heaven and earth were shrouded in gloom; only lightning flashed, blindingly bright, filled with the aura of destruction.

*Boom, boom, boom...*

Tribulation thunder rolled. The falling aftermath alone destroyed thousands of mountains. Even a Divine Spirit caught within would face mortal danger.

In this moment, countless powerhouses throughout the mountain ranges were going mad, trembling with fear, completely unable to understand what was happening.

"This is terrible. Blue Star cannot currently accommodate the Young Master's existence and has called down destructive tribulation thunder. Even a Strongest Divine Spirit faces the risk of perishing within."

True Feather Divine Spirit, An Ruoyi, and Su Jian's expressions all changed dramatically. They exchanged glances, then attacked simultaneously.

An Ruoyi waved her hand, and the Qiankun Cauldron descended directly above Su Yun's head to block the Nine Heavens Divine Thunder for him.

True Feather Divine Spirit and Su Jian simultaneously unleashed divine techniques, blasting toward the tribulation clouds.
