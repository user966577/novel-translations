Chapter 57: The Kunlun Mirror

Five-colored divine radiance illuminated the heavens, transforming into an inescapable net that covered the mountain—not even a mosquito could slip through.

Five Saint-level Divine Generals suppressed the five directions of heaven and earth.

The terrifying pressure bore down on Ye Ling like a vast sea, forcing blood to continuously overflow from the corner of his mouth. Each step was arduous, yet he still walked forward one step at a time, his eyes bloodshot.

"Liu Ting, I cannot understand—why did you betray me? Why did you treat me this way?"

"And you, Xuanyuan Jian—you've actually sided with Su Yun!"

Ye Ling roared hoarsely, then suddenly fixed his gaze on Xuanyuan Jian. Even separated by the five-elemental formation, his keen spiritual sense could perceive the changes in Xuanyuan Jian. Compared to her former forthright and pure demeanor, there was now an added touch of allure.

Clearly, something unspeakable had transpired between Xuanyuan Jian and Su Yun.

"Just a few days ago, I gave everything I had to help you ambush Xuanyuan Li. I lost everything and paid the price of severe injuries."

"It's barely been any time at all, yet you've already become Su Yun's woman and even brought him here to ambush me."

"You're a wretched woman too. Wretched..."

"They're all wretched women. Not a single good thing among women. I, Ye Ling, was blind to have ever known you."

Ye Ling roared again and again, his voice filled with blood and hysteria.

"Ye Ling, we were all just using each other."

Being cursed as a "wretched woman" repeatedly, Xuanyuan Jian's expression turned cold as well. In terms of losses, hers were no smaller than Ye Ling's.

Of course, she had also gained fortune from misfortune afterward, obtaining even more from Su Yun.

If not for Su Yun's help, she dared not imagine the consequences.

After all, though it was also an exchange of interests, the fact that Su Yun had extended his hand when she was at her most desperate was an enormous kindness.

"You helped me assassinate Xuanyuan Li only because you saw value in my potential to inherit the Xuanyuan family, didn't you?"

"Now that we've failed, our relationship naturally ends here."

"And speaking of your character, Ye Ling—" At this, Xuanyuan Jian laughed coldly. "Compared to you, I feel like an absolute saint."

After what happened at the auction house, her favorable impression of Ye Ling had long since plummeted into the negatives.

If not for their cooperative relationship, she would have severed all ties with Ye Ling long ago. She felt not the slightest ripple in her heart about Su Yun's plan to kill Ye Ling.

Liu Ting looked at this man she had once felt affection for and suddenly spoke in a hoarse voice: "Ye Ling, back at the gates of Qingbei Academy, I already told you—we have no relationship whatsoever. How did you treat me then?"

"All of this is your own doing."

"Sister Ting, don't waste words on this selfish bastard. From now on, stay with me—I'll protect you." Xuanyuan Jian said, looking at Liu Ting's state with heartache.

Only she understood how much Liu Ting had endured, how much she had lost during this time.

Once, she had been the woman Su Yun loved most, dazzling and spirited—the brightest pearl of the Imperial Capital.

But because she had been bewitched by Ye Ling, she had lost everything.

And Ye Ling? He had been so selfish that even she, as a bystander, couldn't bear to watch.

Though she could see that Liu Ting might have had ulterior motives in pushing her toward Su Yun—using her to save the Liu family—she didn't blame Liu Ting. After all, if Liu Ting hadn't helped her meet Su Yun, she would have been finished too.

These words meant she agreed to let Liu Ting become her handmaiden, following her as part of her dowry into the Su family, to serve both her and Su Yun.

"Jian'er, thank you."

Liu Ting's eyes reddened as she expressed her sincere gratitude from the bottom of her heart.

After all, she had helped Su Yun scheme against Xuanyuan Jian, yet Xuanyuan Jian not only didn't hold it against her but was even willing to extend a helping hand.

The position of personal handmaiden to the Su family heir and his fiancée was enviable beyond measure. With this status, the Liu family could truly weather this storm.

Moreover, as Su Yun's status and power rose—eventually becoming the Su family's patriarch—the Liu family's standing would surely leap to new heights as well.

One need only look at Qin Ying, Qin Junhua's personal handmaiden, and her position within the Su family to understand—even the patriarchs of great Imperial Capital families had to treat her with utmost respect.

Su Yun's gaze was cold. He had no objections to Xuanyuan Jian taking Liu Ting as her handmaiden.

After all, this woman had originally been chosen by his mother Qin Junhua for her Sunflower Water Physique, which had similar benefits to Yun Ran's Heavenly Seduction Body and would greatly aid his cultivation.

Of course, this was predicated on Liu Ting still being a maiden.

He had used Liu Ting to eliminate Ye Ling and Su Meng, conquered Xuanyuan Jian, and now was taking Liu Ting as a handmaiden as well—completely reversing the original ending.

"Now, only this Son of Destiny remains."

Through Su Yun's Delusion-Breaking Divine Eyes, Ye Ling's fortune remained vast and boundless despite everything that had happened—far surpassing Su Meng's, even rivaling Xuanyuan Li at his peak.

This was despite Su Yun's repeated schemes altering Ye Ling's fate and devouring his fortune. One could only imagine how immense this Son of Destiny's fortune truly was—absolutely among the very top tier on Azure Star.

"However, with the Five Elemental Divine Battalions' formation deployed, five Divine Generals suppressing the heavens, heaven and earth sealed, and everything within a hundred miles locked down, let's see where this Son of Destiny can run to."

At that moment, Ye Ling felt supremely humiliated. He roared:

"Are you two wretched women done yet? Are you deliberately putting on a show for me?"

"Do you really think that by colluding with Su Yun, coordinating from inside and out, you can kill me?"

"You're dreaming!"

"Xuanyuan Li couldn't do it. Su Yun definitely can't do it either."

Then Ye Ling suddenly turned to Su Yun and spoke coldly: "Su Yun, you despicable schemer. I admit I lost to you this time. But this—this is merely our first clash in the Imperial Capital.

"Azure Star is vast beyond measure—far beyond what your Su family can control.

"The next time we meet, I will personally slay you and these two wretched women with my own hands—revenge for today's grudge."

With a "hum," vast divine radiance erupted from Ye Ling's body, the light blinding and dazzling, instantly reducing the entire mountain to ash.

"Hum, hum, hum..."

An ancient, russet mirror flew from Ye Ling's forehead, releasing surging divine radiance that struck toward the infinite void, actually piercing through the five-elemental formation.
