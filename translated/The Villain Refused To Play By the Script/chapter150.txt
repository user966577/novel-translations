Chapter 150: Mingyu's Decision

"No wonder the Kunlun Daoist Sect issued a statement supporting the Su family's campaign against my Celestial Maiden Sect. You were behind it all, weren't you?"

This time, Su Yun had issued a declaration to campaign against the Celestial Maiden Sect. The Kunlun Daoist Sect had been the first—and only—sect to voice support.

One should know that even the Lingxiao Daoist Sect, which had been rivals with the Celestial Maiden Sect for a thousand years, hadn't spoken up in support.

If not for the Kunlun Daoist Sect's statement of support, the other secluded sects wouldn't have remained so silent. Even if they didn't send powerhouses to help, they would have at least spoken up, so the Celestial Maiden Sect wouldn't be so completely isolated.

"More than just speaking up in support."

True Feather Divine Spirit's voice was calm, but a flash of cold light passed through her eyes.

The moment her words fell, a beam of radiance suddenly burst from the ancient mirror outside the palace, tearing through spacetime and connecting to another mountaintop in the western mountain ranges of China.

The next moment, numerous Kunlun Daoist Sect elders, peak masters, and Divine Spirits emerged from it, their vast pressure filling the firmament.

One could faintly see through the spatial rift that within the Kunlun Daoist Sect, terrifying auras were awakening and reviving.

Clearly, the Kunlun Daoist Sect's heritage powerhouses were stirring.

"True Feather Divine Spirit, you mad woman! You traitor to the Daoist tradition! You're actually helping secular people move against my Celestial Maiden Sect like this!"

An Ruoyi cursed, her body emanating terrifying killing intent.

True Feather Divine Spirit's gaze was cold. "Demoness, more than half of your three minutes have already passed. I advise you not to act rashly. The Young Master always means what he says."

Looking at An Ruoyi, a cold smile flashed through True Feather Divine Spirit's eyes.

In an instant, An Ruoyi understood.

True Feather Divine Spirit harbored tremendous resentment in her heart.

So she wanted to drag both An Ruoyi and the Celestial Maiden Sect under the Su family's control—the better to improve her own standing with Su Yun.

"True Feather, you're insane! You mad woman! You'll drag the entire Daoist tradition into eternal damnation!"

An Ruoyi spoke, her complexion somewhat pale as she glanced at Su Yun's expressionless face. She didn't doubt that Su Yun would follow through on his words—after all, she had seen for herself the situation Su Yun was currently facing.

This domineering, ruthless man truly wouldn't show the slightest mercy.

With the Kunlun Daoist Sect's full support, plus the Kunlun Mirror and True Feather Divine Spirit as a Strongest Divine Spirit, and that million-strong army—forget holding out until the Federation Supreme Council convened, the Celestial Maiden Sect might not even last half a day.

Yet An Ruoyi's heart was still in fierce turmoil.

Su Yun's demands were simply too excessive—not just her, but control over the Celestial Maiden Sect and the Qiankun Cauldron as well.

"I don't believe it. I absolutely refuse to believe Mingyu would collude with the Demon Race."

An Ruoyi's heart continued to struggle. Her face deathly pale, she suddenly shouted toward the outside: "Mingyu, leave the Sect Master Token within the sect and come out here!"

Her vast voice, piercing through the hundreds of thousands of soldiers, echoed atop Celestial Maiden Peak.

At this moment, the corner of Su Yun's mouth curved slightly.

His purpose in having An Ruoyi come out was precisely to break down her psychological defenses bit by bit.

Moreover, from what he knew of the original novel, she had been willing to sleep with Su Yayue's man, Ye Ling, in order to break through to Strongest Divine Spirit. Clearly, she wasn't the kind of woman who could hold firm to her principles.

She might be proud.

But that was only because she hadn't encountered greater temptation or powerful despair.

After all, his goal was to subdue the Celestial Maiden Sect and gain the Qiankun Cauldron—a shattered Celestial Maiden Sect was not what he wanted.

Of course, if An Ruoyi proved too obstinate, he wouldn't hesitate to strike with lethal force.

"Demoness."

True Feather Divine Spirit's lips curved slightly. She glanced at Su Yun, drawing a deep breath.

Having been with Su Yun for this long, she understood all too well how deep his calculations ran—as if he knew everything. An Ruoyi couldn't escape from his grasp.

Yet the moment An Ruoyi's voice rang out, the previously calm Celestial Maiden Sect suddenly erupted with a vast fluctuation. Layer upon layer of mysterious formation runes began spreading across the firmament, dense and countless, enshrouding the entire massive Celestial Maiden Peak.

"All disciples of the Celestial Maiden Sect, hear my command! The Su family has acted tyrannically, detaining our Sect Master! The Celestial Maiden Sect will never bow to the Su family's brutality!"

Holy Maiden Mingyu's voice—charming yet laced with cold, stern killing intent—echoed throughout the Celestial Maiden Sect.

Furthermore, as the Qiankun Cauldron emerged, a unique aura belonging to the Sect Master Token spread forth. Ancient, terrifying auras began awakening atop Celestial Maiden Peak.

Holy Maiden Mingyu had instantly activated the heritage and was summoning the Celestial Maiden Sect's ancient powerhouses, assuming a stance of fighting to the death against the million-strong army and the Kunlun Daoist Sect—forceful to the extreme.

But what no one knew was that at this moment, atop the main hall of Celestial Maiden Peak, Holy Maiden Mingyu's expression was pale, her eyes filled with terror.

Only she understood—she absolutely could not leave the Celestial Maiden Sect.

Because she really had been harboring a demon, hidden right in her master's residence, using her master's aura to mask his demonic presence. And she had severed her mortal attachments with him.

If she left the Celestial Maiden Sect, she felt certain she couldn't withstand the Su family's interrogation.

When that time came, the Celestial Maiden Sect would be finished. She would become the sect's sinner, and she would die too. The secluded sects forbade interference in worldly affairs, and colluding with the Demon Race was an even graver crime.

At this moment, the many peak masters and elders stared in stunned disbelief at Holy Maiden Mingyu, who held the Sect Master Token.

Almost the instant An Ruoyi had spoken, Holy Maiden Mingyu had activated the sect-guarding formation like a conditioned reflex, summoning the Qiankun Cauldron.

It caught them completely off guard.

"Mingyu, have you lost your mind? By making a show of fighting to the last, you're pushing the Sect Master into a dead end!"

A Divine Spirit-level elder reacted and scolded her angrily.

"She's your master! Are you trying to get her killed?"

"Open the sect formation at once! Let the Sect Master back in!"

...

The elders and peak masters raged one after another.

It had to be said—An Ruoyi commanded tremendous respect and was deeply revered by them all.

"Fellow Elders and Peak Masters—if I go out, the sect will be completely without a pillar."

"Su Yun never intended to let our Celestial Maiden Sect go. If I leave, I'll be walking to my death."

Holy Maiden Mingyu spoke coldly: "Master left me in charge of the Sect Master Token. Say no more. Go prepare for battle. Only if we hold out will Master have any chance of survival."
