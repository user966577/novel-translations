"The West has always harbored ambitions to conquer China, and the Su family is one of China's strongest Divine Spirit clans—a hardline faction that has always opposed the West."

Su Yun murmured to himself, his eyes cold and detached.

He remembered that in the original novel, the West had once launched a crusade against China.

At that time, the protagonist Ye Ling had already matured. In that battle, he made a grand display of his abilities, uniting the four great Divine Spirit families through his connections. He pushed back the Western armies and even slew a Supreme Divine Spirit from the West.

But even by the end of the story, Ye Ling had never conquered the West. Instead, he had won over Athena and another Western goddess through his charm. In the end, his relationship with the West turned out surprisingly well.

"In this lifetime, with me here, China won't let the West touch even a single inch of its soil."

Su Yun's gaze was cold, killing intent flickering in his eyes.

Just then, an ecstatic voice erupted with manic laughter.

"Hahaha! Heaven is helping me! Heaven is helping me! The Qin family is destined to rise! An Ancient Divine Weapon has delivered itself to my doorstep!"

"Leaving so soon, my dear nephew? Since you've come to the Qin family and brought such a generous gift, why not stay a while? Let your uncle properly entertain you."

Qin Ying laughed wildly, his eyes bloodshot as he stared at the God-Devil Pendant. His entire body trembled with excitement.

If the Ancient Divine Weapon had been in Su Heng's hands—even if Su Heng had come alone—he would have dropped to his knees and begged for mercy without hesitation.

But right now, the Ancient Divine Weapon was in Su Yun's hands, powered by merely three Divine Spirits. Though its might was still terrifyingly formidable, enough to rival a Strongest Divine Spirit...

This was the Qin family headquarters, the battle fortress that generations of Qin ancestors had spent over a thousand years constructing—a place even the Strongest Divine Spirits wouldn't dare approach lightly.

"Come, my dear nephew, let uncle have a look at that Ancient Divine Weapon." Qin Ying's voice quivered with excitement at its peak.

An Ancient Divine Weapon! This had been the dream of countless generations of Qin family ancestors—a dream they could never achieve.

Today, it was finally going to be realized by his hand.

Once he obtained a seat on the Council, the Qin family would be able to replace the Su family's position and become China's strongest Divine Spirit clan.

Whooom, whooom, whooom...

Even as he spoke, a black token carved with dragon patterns appeared in Qin Ying's hand—the Qin family's Patriarch Token.

Endless black radiance erupted from the token, piercing through the heavens. Every formation rune throughout the Qin family headquarters fully awakened.

Rumble, rumble...

The entire battle fortress began to shake violently. Black light churned as thunderous rumbling filled the sky. A terrifying battle might swept across heaven and earth, as if some ancient primordial beast that had slumbered since time immemorial had finally awakened.

Countless formation runes covered the skies above Qin City. Deep within the heavens, endless killing techniques and divine abilities were gathering, ready to strike.

A thousand years of Qin family heritage—Qin Ying had awakened it all.

"What's happening?!"

Throughout Qin City, the countless members of the Qin family stared dumbfounded as the battle fortress they had lived in for countless generations erupted with supreme divine power. They were terrified beyond words.

The battle fortress was the Qin family's greatest heritage. Unless they faced an existential crisis, it could never be activated lightly.

And only the family patriarch could use it.

"Something big has happened at headquarters!"

"Hurry back!"

"The patriarch has activated the battle fortress! He's even awakened the countless divine runes in the headquarters! The ancestors in our heritage who were being stabilized by the fortress's power will all wake up now!"

"Has Qin Ying gone insane?!"

In that moment, the Qin family's direct descendants—those whom Qin Ying had dispatched away on various errands—were losing their minds. They all rushed frantically back toward headquarters.

Activating the battle fortress without the approval of most direct descendants—even with the Patriarch Token in hand—was an unauthorized use of the family's heritage.

"Qin Ying, you've truly gone mad!" Qin Junhua was shocked and furious. She instantly appeared at Su Yun's side, joining Su Jian in channeling power into the God-Devil Pendant.

Rumble...

With a half-step Strongest Divine Spirit now adding her strength, the God-Devil Pendant's might was unleashed even more completely.

Roar, roar, roar...

Countless god-demons howled as the heavens shattered and space itself trembled. It seemed as though some terrifying primordial world was about to tear free from the void.

Roiling chaos qi erupted from the God-Devil Pendant, threatening to return this entire region to primordial chaos.

Whooom, whooom, whooom...

Far in the distant sky, the phantom of an enormous purple palace materialized, emanating waves of divine power.

It was the palace built by the Ancient Divine Spirit Hongjun—the Purple Heaven Palace.

"Qin Ying, the Qin family doesn't have an Ancient Divine Weapon! By recklessly activating the battle fortress like this, you'll shatter the Divine Sources of the ancestors in our heritage. They'll die within days!"

"A thousand years of accumulated Qin family heritage—all destroyed by your hand!"

Qin Junhua screamed in fury, nearly driven to madness. She had never imagined Qin Ying would be this deranged. To capture Su Yun, he had directly activated the battle fortress.

"Who says I don't have an Ancient Divine Weapon? My dear nephew just delivered one to me!"

Staring at the God-Devil Pendant, Qin Ying's eyes blazed with greed. His whole body trembled with delirious excitement: "Once I get that pendant, not only can I reseal those ancestors, but the Qin family will gain even more powerhouses in the future."

"Dear nephew, give me the God-Devil Pendant! Give it to me! Don't force your uncle to kill you."

Su Yun had been watching this scene with cold, detached eyes. Now, suddenly, he smiled: "I really should thank you, my dear uncle. To support the Su family's campaign in the Americas, you've activated the Qin family's entire heritage."

"Don't worry—in the future, I won't treat the Qin family poorly."

Su Yun's smile was radiant, but his eyes were cold to the extreme as he fixed his gaze on Qin Ying: "However, before that, you won't be serving as the Qin family's patriarch any longer. You won't be living any longer either."

"This time next year will be your death anniversary."

In the next instant, Su Yun willed it, and the God-Devil Pendant—now powered by Qin Junhua, Su Jian, and two other Divine Spirits—suddenly unleashed a vast beam of god-demon killing light. It pierced through the heavens, shattered countless formation runes, and shot directly toward Qin Ying.

"Hahaha! My dear nephew, your ambitions are quite grand! Uncle likes it!"

"But if you want to kill your uncle, you're still too young—far too naive!"

Qin Ying laughed wildly. With a wave of his hand, the Dragon-Patterned Battle Standard appeared before him. The entire Qin family headquarters and battle fortress unleashed endless divine abilities, grinding away at the god-demon killing light inch by inch.

The beam couldn't even get close to Qin Ying before it was swallowed by the endless formation runes.

A thousand years of accumulated Qin family heritage, reinforced by generations of Divine Spirits—its terror had reached an extreme. It wasn't something three or four Divine Spirits with a single Ancient Divine Weapon could shake.

Just then, one ancient figure after another emerged from beneath the battle fortress. Their auras were primordial, their eyes clouded with age.

These were the ancient powerhouses the Qin family had accumulated over a thousand years—one of the family's greatest assets.

However, without an Ancient Divine Weapon, the battle fortress could only suppress them temporarily. Once they emerged from their Divine Sources, they wouldn't live much longer before dying.

Meanwhile, the various direct descendants Qin Ying had sent away were returning to headquarters.

Seeing the scene before them—Qin Ying confronting Qin Junhua and Su Yun—they were all dumbstruck.

They couldn't understand what had happened.
