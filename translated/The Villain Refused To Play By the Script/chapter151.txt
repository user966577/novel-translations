Chapter 151: Submission

"You..."

The elders and peak masters froze, staring dumbly at Holy Maiden Mingyu. This was clearly just an excuse.

Once fighting broke out, how could Su Yun possibly spare An Ruoyi? He would surely use her to rally his troops.

Most of them had met Su Yun before. They didn't doubt for a moment that Su Yun was capable of such a thing.

They had never expected Holy Maiden Mingyu to be so cold and ruthless, so forcefully determined. It caught them completely off guard.

"Mingyu!"

At this moment, inside the palace, An Ruoyi stood frozen, staring blankly at the scene unfolding before her.

She had never imagined that one sentence from her would cause Mingyu not only to refuse to come out, but to trigger such a chain reaction.

That peak master had accompanied her to the Su family before.

Didn't she understand that this was pushing her onto a dead end?

"Demoness, it seems even your own disciple and sect have abandoned you."

True Feather Divine Spirit spoke lightly, though the schadenfreude in her voice was impossible to conceal.

"Silence, you traitor!"

An Ruoyi shouted angrily, glaring at True Feather Divine Spirit. She wanted to say something, but found she couldn't utter a word.

Heartache.

A wrenching pain surged from her heart, nearly suffocating her.

She truly had been abandoned by her sect.

Betrayed and abandoned by the disciple she trusted and loved most.

She understood Mingyu. Her disciple's behavior had been far too abnormal.

In other words, Mingyu really had used her trust to hide a demon in her residence.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

An Ruoyi kept muttering, killing intent nearly impossible to suppress surging from deep within her heart. Her black hair danced wildly.

"Your three minutes are up."

Just then, Su Yun opened his eyes, his voice ice-cold: "But looking at the current situation, Ruoyi, you've been abandoned by your sect. You've even handed over the Sect Master Token. Forget leading the sect to submit to me—the Qiankun Cauldron has fallen into your disciple's hands."

"So be it."

"It seems the Celestial Maiden Sect has no reason to exist."

Su Yun slowly rose, killing intent thick in his eyes.

True Feather Divine Spirit also stepped forward, her long dress fluttering. "Who would have thought the Celestial Maiden Sect would end like this? But a disgrace to the Daoist tradition—better gone."

"Su Yun, wait. I agree to all your previous conditions."

Just then, An Ruoyi's hoarse voice suddenly rang out.

The corner of Su Yun's mouth curved. He looked at An Ruoyi with detached indifference: "Oh? Your disciple has already betrayed you. What qualifications do you still have to negotiate with me?"

At this moment, though An Ruoyi's expression was deathly pale, she suddenly smiled brilliantly. Her charm emerged more intensely than before, stirring a fierce heat in any man's heart.

She gently brushed her hair, tucking the black strands behind her ear. She walked lightly to Su Yun's side and breathed softly: "My dear man, don't forget—I am the Celestial Maiden Sect's Sect Master. I've held the Sect Master Token for decades. Who could possibly understand it better than I?"

"Though the Qiankun Cauldron and Sect Master Token are now in that traitor's hands, once I break through to Strongest Divine Spirit, even across the sect's grand formation, the Qiankun Cauldron and Sect Master Token will still be under my control."

"Oh? You mean..."

Su Yun's lips curved in a smile, but before he could finish, An Ruoyi suddenly pressed a jade finger to his lips. Her voice was charming: "Don't speak. Let this servant finish."

"This servant is willing to lead the Celestial Maiden Sect in obeying the Su family's commands. I'm even willing to swear a heart demon oath and take a Heart Demon Pill—guaranteed never to betray you for all eternity."

"But this servant also has two conditions. I hope the Young Master will agree."

Su Yun smiled faintly, his gaze bewitching: "What conditions?"

"First, this servant wishes to stand as equals with True Feather Divine Spirit—to become a concubine of the Su family. And the Young Master must guarantee that only this servant may control the Celestial Maiden Sect."

"Second, the Innate Dao Body Su Yayue must take me as her master. This servant is willing to share the Innate Dao Body with the Kunlun Daoist Sect."

An Ruoyi spoke charmingly, her seductive manner on full display, radiating powerful allure.

But at this moment, her eyes flickered with cold light, filled with powerful desire for authority.

Things had come to this point. She seemed to have no other choice. If she refused, the Celestial Maiden Sect would certainly be destroyed.

And yes—she didn't want to die either.

Once the Celestial Maiden Sect fought back madly, Su Yun, this ruthless man, might very well use her to rally his troops.

Then the Celestial Maiden Sect would be destroyed at her hands, and she would die too.

She especially didn't want to die because of a traitor's betrayal.

So she would have her revenge—and she would rise above True Feather Divine Spirit.

This was already the best solution she could devise.

"Hahaha! I thought it was something difficult, but I agree to all of it."

Su Yun laughed heartily, his voice shaking the firmament.

Indeed, An Ruoyi was exactly as he had guessed. Faced with powerful pressure and setbacks, she would submit.

Holy Maiden Mingyu, because of that demon man, wouldn't come out to save her master either.

Moreover, True Feather Divine Spirit had broken through to Strongest Divine Spirit. He also needed a woman by his side who could counterbalance her, lest True Feather Divine Spirit develop any wayward thoughts.

Even if An Ruoyi hadn't proposed this condition, he would have done so himself.

As for Su Yayue—she was always meant to be his tool for unifying the Daoist tradition. Having her take An Ruoyi as a master would only make her representation of Daoist orthodoxy even more legitimate.

"True Feather, join me."

Su Yun laughed heartily, sending Yun Ran a mental command to guard the palace doors.

"Yes, Young Master."

A blush crossed True Feather Divine Spirit's face.

She had long been mentally prepared for the Young Master's decision and naturally felt no great resistance.

This time, she had also rendered great service to the Young Master. She trusted Su Yun wouldn't treat her poorly.

"Su Yun, I cultivate the Celestial Maiden Scripture. If I don't sever my mortal attachments, from now on I'll be completely devoted to you."

An Ruoyi's soft, charming voice echoed within the palace.

What followed was a symphony of delicate sounds.

"By the Young Master's command—the Celestial Maiden Sect has colluded with the Demon Race and harbors evil intentions. Kill!"

Yun Ran's voice rang out, cold as ice.

In an instant, a million soldiers roared in unison. Winds reversed, killing intent rolled, the firmament erupted.

Endless formation runes coalesced as the million-strong army launched their assault on the Celestial Maiden Sect.

Meanwhile, inside the Celestial Maiden Sect, Holy Maiden Mingyu—still holding the Qiankun Cauldron—arrived at a certain residence, her face pale: "Mo Yu, you must leave this place quickly."
