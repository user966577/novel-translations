A soon-to-depart flight, first class cabin—Qin Feng and his two companions sat in a row.

Zhang Fan was engrossed in studying various surgical cases on his phone, looking quite pleased.

Though the three days had been brief, they'd witnessed dozens of cases and surgeries from hospitals across the country.

Cardiothoracic and neurosurgery accounted for nearly a third—after all, these were the two main pillars of major surgery.

For Zhang Fan, this was a rare learning opportunity. He'd benefited greatly!

"Qin Feng, take a look at this. Such severe myocarditis and the patient still survived—it's a miracle!

Even more severe than the fulminant myocarditis case you handled. They were essentially gambling with the patient's life."

Zhang Fan handed his phone to Qin Feng, pointing at the surgical video with amazement.

"Indeed. The lead surgeon was very skilled—using extracorporeal circulation so decisively was remarkable, given the extreme risk."

Qin Feng glanced at it, recalling the conference when Beijing Union Medical College had presented this case. The audience had been astonished.

Learning that the patient had recovered well and was nearly ready for discharge had stunned every cardiothoracic specialist present!

Given the patient's cardiac condition, survival chances were less than ten percent!

Any other doctor encountering this would probably have closed the chest immediately.

Operate and die. Don't operate and die.

Yet Beijing Union's vice president had personally led the surgery, with four specialists assisting. They'd dragged this life back from the brink.

Truly remarkable!

Even with all the world-class surgical experience Qin Feng had inherited, watching it had made his heart pound.

Because during the surgery, even half a millimeter's deviation would have meant death.

When he saw the successful outcome, he let out a long breath, cold sweat beading on his forehead as if he'd been there himself.

Still, it was gratifying. Cases with such research value contributed significantly to medical science.

Medicine never lacked miracles!

Except for this guy Qin Feng.

During breaks these past few days, while Zhang Fan studied cases in the hotel, Qin Feng had taken Liu Yan'er out exploring, eating, shopping.

Henglü Law Firm's Mercedes was his dedicated vehicle, driving everywhere for shopping sprees.

Then special couriers transported everything to Jiang City, to be sorted after they returned.

Even with Liu Yan'er trying to restrain him, he'd still spent two or three million!

Not that it mattered—his account held over a billion in dividends that he couldn't possibly spend.

"Qin Feng, I'm going back to the capital in a few days. My advisor wants me to continue with graduate school. What should I do?"

Liu Yan'er leaned against his shoulder, asking with some hesitation.

"Then do it. Your grades are excellent—why wouldn't you pursue a master's?"

Qin Feng nodded without hesitation.

"But if I go, I'll have to stay in the capital for two more years. Doesn't that worry you?"

Liu Yan'er's face broke into a sweet smile.

"Where would you run off to? Besides, Chen Dong and his wife are planning to move to the capital to set up a new headquarters."

Qin Feng gently flicked her nose, teasing.

"Don't forget—your parents are on my side. I don't believe there's anyone better than me."

"Hmph! So arrogant."

Liu Yan'er wrinkled her nose, looking adorably annoyed.

Then she settled back to sleep. Last night's exertions had left her exhausted—she'd barely slept.

Seeing this, Qin Feng smiled and pulled out his tablet, his expression turning calm.

He'd be back in Jiang City soon. He needed to prepare for Director Zhang Tong's surgery.

Pancreatic cancer had another name—the King of Cancers!

Early-stage pancreatic cancer was a relatively colloquial term, meaning the cancer cells hadn't visibly spread.

Through aggressive surgery, the tumor could be excised along with surrounding organs and regional lymph nodes for complete removal.

But even after such thorough surgery, high recurrence and metastasis rates remained.

This was pancreatic cancer's greatest challenge!

It was an extremely malignant digestive system tumor. Because the pancreas was anatomically deep, pancreatic cancer had insidious onset and was difficult to diagnose early.

Over 80 percent of pancreatic cancer patients had already lost their best surgical window by the time of initial diagnosis—their only option was to prolong survival, with almost no possibility of cure.

Currently, the worldwide five-year survival rate was under 10 percent!

Some patients survived three or even five years post-surgery, while others died within a year due to early recurrence and metastasis.

A rare few achieved ten years or longer after surgical treatment.

This depended on the patient and subsequent treatment.

A true headache!

Pancreatic cancer was one of the conditions internal medicine least wanted to encounter, because its appearance meant the patient's lifespan became uncertain.

Fortunately, Zhang Tong's jaundice had been caught the moment it appeared!

Had it continued progressing, even a miracle worker would have been powerless!

For mid-to-late stage pancreatic cancer patients, surgery often wasn't even possible. They could only endure painful chemotherapy, radiation, and biological treatments, with death likely within three to six months.

Qin Feng opened the reports and X-rays, carefully studying Director Zhang Tong's lesion location and surgical approach.

Word had slowly spread within the hospital.

But over these three days, only department heads, some attending physicians, and head nurses knew—strictly confidential. Most others remained unaware of Zhang Tong's condition.

News that the director had pancreatic cancer, if it spread too widely, would be bad for both the hospital and everyone up and down the chain.

After all, under Zhang Tong's leadership, Municipal First Hospital was making bold yet steady strides toward becoming a first-tier provincial Level 3A institution.

Jealous critics would inevitably seize on such news.

Making Municipal First Hospital a nationally premier Level 3A hospital—

This was Zhang Tong's greatest wish!

Since his wife's unexpected death and daughter's marriage, he'd become alone.

Every day he commuted between hospital and home. Too busy for romance, he'd declined one matchmaking attempt after another.

He knew—his life was dedicated to Jiang City's medical development.

A man approaching sixty, working harder than young people, yet coming home to no warm meal.

Everyone at the hospital knew Zhang Tong ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the cafeteria.

If he worked too late and missed serving hours, he'd make do with cold leftovers.

Eventually even the cafeteria staff couldn't bear it. They always saved a portion for him, reheating it if the director came by.

Though Qin Feng had the system, Zhang Tong had genuinely given him his start.

So this time, he would give everything to heal him—this surgery had to succeed.

He needed to remove every possible cancer cell!

Qin Feng knew this would be his most challenging surgery in over a year.

Because he was facing a malignant disease that no one in the world had solved!

"I hope these eyes can hold out until I finish..."

Half an hour later, Qin Feng closed his tablet, exhaled deeply, and murmured to himself.

Municipal First Hospital, Internal Medicine—

Director Sun Sheng cleared Operating Room 1 completely, then had instrument nurses prepare all surgical equipment.

Qin Feng had messaged before boarding—arriving in Jiang City at noon, surgery at 3 PM.

"Nurse Lu, I'm leaving this to you. I need to check on the director."

Sun Sheng spoke quietly to Head Nurse Lu Yun beside him.

"Don't worry, Director."

Nurse Lu nodded, not daring to be the least bit careless.

This was the director's surgery—she had to be absolutely meticulous!

Sun Sheng knocked and entered. Zhang Tong was reviewing reports.

"Old Sun, you're here."

He looked up, smiled at Sun Sheng, and continued signing documents.

"Director, the operating room is ready. Qin Feng's flight arrives at noon. Your surgery is this afternoon."

Sun Sheng watched him working and couldn't help sighing inwardly.

"Good. I know."

Zhang Tong nodded.

"Alright, I'll wait for you in the ward. We still need final pre-op checks."

Sun Sheng quietly closed the door and left.

After landing, Qin Feng first took Liu Yan'er home, then drove with Zhang Fan to the hospital.

"Qin Feng, you should rest. You have surgery this afternoon."

After parking, Zhang Fan urged him.

"Don't worry, Director Zhang. I'll head in now."

Qin Feng smiled and nodded, then went straight to Internal Medicine.

After confirming the operating room and all procedures, he went to Sun Sheng's rest room to recover his energy.

He'd already sent the surgical plan to Sun Sheng from the airport. He would be the lead surgeon, Sun Sheng first assistant, and Deputy Director Cheng Hongwu second assistant.

At this moment, everyone's heart was in their throat, nerves taut.

Except Qin Feng—no one else could rest easy.

2:30 PM.

Zhang Tong had changed into a surgical gown and lay quietly on his bed, staring at the ceiling.

He seemed lost in thought, deep in contemplation...

In the rest room, Qin Feng opened his eyes and rose, taking his white coat from the rack and putting it on.

"System, don't let me down. Please!"

Murmuring softly, he opened the door and strode out.

"Director Qin."

"Good afternoon, Director Qin."

"Director Qin."

Along the way, doctors and nurses greeted him with friendly smiles.

Qin Feng nodded in acknowledgment, but this time without his usual smile, his steps steady and purposeful.

"Wow, Director Qin looks so cool today! So handsome!"

"Right?! So aloof! I love it!"

"Sigh... Director Qin has a girlfriend. What a shame!"

"I know! I should have made my move earlier."

"Please. His girlfriend is Deputy Director Chen's daughter—an absolute goddess!"

Several nurses watched Qin Feng's tall, handsome silhouette, swooning and sighing.

Qin Feng entered the ward.

"Qin Feng, you're here! Haha!"

Zhang Tong heard him and looked over, his face breaking into a warm smile.

"How are you feeling?"

"Not bad. I've been thinking about a lot of things from the past. Found I have no regrets."

"Haha, relax. You'll have plenty of time to reminisce later. Shall we get started?"

"Yes! My life is in your hands."

Zhang Tong nodded, speaking with vigor as he sat up.

The two walked side by side toward the operating room.

"Qin Feng, I'm trained in internal medicine and understand pancreatic cancer well. I've been mentally preparing these past few days."

Along the way, Zhang Tong maintained his gentle smile.

"My father was a doctor. He died on this hospital's operating table from liver cancer—worked himself to exhaustion. I inherited his calling and have devoted my life to medicine without regret.

In nearly forty years of practice, you're the first true genius I've encountered—and the only one.

I believe that someday you'll bring earth-shaking progress to China's medical field—and the world's!"

"I know."

Qin Feng nodded with a smile.

"Hahaha!"

Hearing this, Zhang Tong paused in surprise, then burst into hearty laughter.

He reached out and clapped Qin Feng firmly on the shoulder, stopping in his tracks.

"Qin Feng, the Transplant Center has grown rapidly under you. Its reputation and capabilities keep improving—all your achievement."

Zhang Tong's expression turned serious. He grasped Qin Feng's hand.

"I know you'll leave someday. Jiang City is too small a pond to hold a true dragon like you. So before we go into surgery, I want you to make me a promise."

"Sure, Director. What is it?"

"Regardless of this surgery's outcome, regardless of whether I survive five years, my greatest wish is for Municipal First Hospital to expand beyond Jiang Province and become a nationally first-tier comprehensive hospital.

For ten years I've searched for the right person. I never found one—until I met you.

I want you to build the hospital's first General Practice department!"

As he spoke, Qin Feng felt Zhang Tong's grip tighten. His gaze was sincere and fervent, full of hope.

"I know how complex and difficult general practice medicine is. But I hope you'll consider it.

You don't have to answer now. Think it over and we'll talk later. Alright?"

Hearing this, Qin Feng was moved.

What did this mean?

Currently, general practitioners were an extremely advanced and rare phenomenon worldwide.

Only a handful of top hospitals in China even had general practitioners, and those were still in development—nowhere near mature.

Most regions and hospitals lacked the conditions and foundation to train general practitioners.

General practitioners would take over basic diagnostic functions for all departments, freeing other specialties to research and tackle more advanced conditions, raising the level of doctors and hospitals overall.

This would benefit the entire medical field!

"Alright, Director. I'll think about it."

After a moment's consideration, Qin Feng nodded.

"This is even bigger than establishing the Transplant Center. Give me time. After the surgery, we'll discuss it properly."

Zhang Tong's face lit up with delight at his response. He nodded repeatedly.

Then they arrived at the operating room entrance.

Two rows of medical staff stood waiting for them.

"Thank you all for your hard work."

Zhang Tong smiled and nodded to everyone, then turned to Qin Feng.

"Director Qin, you're the lead surgeon. Your call."

"Everyone, let's begin!"

As soon as he spoke, everyone filed in and began scrubbing.

Qin Feng donned his sterile gown and gloves.

Zhang Tong lay on the operating table, appearing calm.

Qin Feng nodded to the anesthesiologist.

Zhang Tong went under general anesthesia, unconscious. Surgery could begin.

"Current time: August 21st, 3:01 PM. Pancreatic cancer resection surgery—now commencing!"
