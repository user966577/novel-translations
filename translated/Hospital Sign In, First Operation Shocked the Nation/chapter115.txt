"Apologize! Who do you people think you are!"

"Exactly! There's hundreds of thousands of them in Zhujiang alone. I've been disgusted by them for a long time!"

"This is long overdue! They've had it too easy!"

"Well done! Good!"

"They take our money, eat our food, sleep with our women—I've wanted to do this for ages!"

"That was satisfying! But young man, you've stirred up big trouble. You'd better get out of here."

Cheers erupted from all around, mostly men's voices.

But some worried that Qin Feng's high-profile beat-down of the foreigners might not end well for him.

Many had already pulled out their phones to record, some already uploading to the internet.

'Chinese students attacked by foreigners on subway—martial arts expert steps in!'

'1 vs 4, complete victory! Handsome guy demolishes foreigners who bullied students.'

Qin Feng looked at Nick, still struggling to breathe before him, unmoved.

Seeing the defiance still in his eyes, Qin Feng slowly tightened his grip until Nick felt like his skull was clamped in iron jaws, a terrifying sense of imminent explosion flooding his mind.

After all, with Qin Feng's current strength, two fingers could crush a walnut.

Let alone all five fingers applying force?

In an instant, Nick's face turned red, even purplish.

The two foreign women watching finally calmed down. One stepped forward and pointed at Qin Feng.

"Let him go! We're exchange students at Dongda University's Chinese International College. If you assault our people like this, I can report you to the consulate!"

Qin Feng glanced at her and scoffed.

"Are you... threatening me?"

"This isn't just assault—it's a serious diplomatic issue! You'll face punishment..."

Before she finished her angry tirade, something flashed before her eyes. She felt a tremendous force strike her face.

She spun around twice before landing hard on her backside, her left cheek burning with pain.

"Now you can go report."

She looked up in disbelief, clutching her face. Qin Feng's expression was pure cold indifference, his voice dripping with contempt.

She never imagined anyone would dare strike them like this!

"What did you come to China for? What good is learning Chinese? Who gave you the courage to act so brazenly on someone else's soil?"

Qin Feng surveyed the scene, grabbed Nick's head, and looked down at him, speaking calmly.

"Even during our weakest period a century ago, this land saw constant warfare—while your ancestors were just slaves to the West. You haven't even stood on your own two feet yet and you're already trying to bully people in their own home?

I don't care what brought you here—money or women—China isn't a place where you can run wild!

Next time, learn our rules first. And read about your ancestors in your own history books."

Another round of cheers erupted. Perhaps what Qin Feng was doing was vindicating all of them.

Many men shouted excitedly, clapping vigorously, faces full of excitement.

But Qin Feng knew clearly—they were probably treating this like some power fantasy novel.

His gaze fell on the boyfriend still on the floor, and he sighed inwardly.

Being pinned down by two foreigners and spat on—that was extremely degrading behavior that caused no physical harm.

These foreigners were clearly experienced!

After all, hurting someone carried risks, but spitting didn't.

And when the victim couldn't take it anymore and struck first, they had their excuse.

Even if they beat the other person severely, they could claim self-defense.

Because though they were far from home, they had local support and lived more comfortably than in their own countries.

To them, China was paradise!

But now, Qin Feng had knocked all of them out cold.

In their minds, beyond fear, there was also anger and resentment!

Resentment that someone dared to hit them!

"Are you hurt?"

Qin Feng looked at the boyfriend on the ground.

"N-no."

The boyfriend was clearly still in shock. The scene had been stunning. Hearing the question, he finally shook his head.

"Then why are you still sitting there? Wipe off your face and stand up!"

Qin Feng frowned, his gaze stern.

"I'm giving you a chance. Return that spit from earlier. Do you dare?"

The boyfriend froze, then fury ignited in his eyes. He wiped his T-shirt across his face, then climbed to his feet and walked up to Nick.

Without hesitation, he spat directly in the foreigner's face.

Qin Feng's lips curved slightly. Not bad.

Nick's eyes filled with rage as he struggled to force an insult from his throat.

Too bad—before he could finish, Qin Feng's hand on his forehead swung forward.

His head slammed into the floor in a heavy kowtow, then he passed out.

All four aggressive foreigners lay scattered across the subway car while the two women—one stood frozen in place, the other sat holding her face, terror in their eyes.

"Well done!"

"That's how it should be!"

"Beautiful! Satisfying!"

"I've held that in for so long—finally got it out!"

"Young man, you should run!"

"Yeah, there's definitely going to be trouble!"

After the initial thrill, many looked at Qin Feng with concern.

This kind of thing happened too often—ignoring certain people while cracking down hard on locals.

And Qin Feng had just knocked out four exchange students—probably injuring them significantly.

If he got caught, wouldn't he be looking at years in prison for intentional assault?

The subway security finally arrived, staring at the scene in shock.

Especially the four unconscious foreigners on the floor—it was like a bolt from the blue!

"Who did this?"

The guard called out urgently.

Most people quickly dispersed, but a few pointed hesitantly at Qin Feng.

The guard frowned and approached him.

"Did you do all this?"

Qin Feng didn't answer, just nodded silently.

"Alright, you can't leave now. Get off at the next stop and come with me to the security office."

The guard immediately pressed his radio.

"Fight on Line 3. Four foreigners unconscious and injured. Send an ambulance. Have people meet us at the next station. Hurry!"

Qin Feng, Liu Yan'er, Zhang Fan, and the young couple followed the guard off the train under everyone's watchful eyes.

By now, medical personnel and police had gathered outside the station.

Then Qin Feng and the others were taken to the security office.

"Tell me what happened."

The police officer had barely spoken when Qin Feng shook his head, interrupting.

"Excuse me, may I make a phone call first?"

After receiving permission, he stepped outside and dialed a number.

"Hello, Mr. Wang. I just beat up some foreigners on the Zhujiang subway in Guangchuan... Yes, they attacked first. I was acting in self-defense.

Alright, I'll wait for your people."

After hanging up, Qin Feng found another number and dialed.

"This is Qin Feng."

"Qin... Mr. Qin, why are you calling?"

On the other end, a middle-aged man's voice leaped up from the sofa, instantly nervous.

"I'm now informing you as the majority shareholder of Qidong Pharmaceutical: prepare to withdraw all investments from Dongda Medical School immediately, and initiate a complete separation from Dongda Medical School!

Deliver this message to Dongda's president. Tell him to drain the water from his brain and figure out whose side he should be on."

Qin Feng's words left the other end in stunned silence!

"Wh-what? You can't be serious!"

What was going on?

Withdraw all investment from Dongda Medical School?

That was a project worth tens of billions!

And it was one of Dongda's crown jewels—affiliated with one of the nation's top four hospitals!

If the investment was pulled, Dongda would collapse overnight. Countless people would suffer.

Qidong Pharmaceutical was so powerful that even provincial officials didn't dare offend them, always greeting them with smiles to maintain their position in the local medical community.

Had Dongda somehow offended this man?

After all, Qin Feng had acquired over 40 percent of Qidong Pharmaceutical's actual shares overnight, at prices 15 percent above market, aggregating over 30 billion in stock market capital.

In other words, though Wu Donghua was chairman, he was nothing compared to Qin Feng!

If Qin Feng told him to leave, he'd have to leave!

"Did you understand what I said?"

Qin Feng's tone suddenly turned icy.

"Yes!"

The man on the other end felt a chill run through him and answered quickly.

"Good. I've already notified Tianhong Law Firm in the capital. They're on their way to assist you with this matter. Everything follows my instructions."

Qin Feng hung up, nodded calmly at the police officer nearby, and walked back into the room.

Under police questioning, everyone recounted what had happened, but no fingerprints were taken.

Liu Yan'er and Zhang Fan watched him nervously.

"Qin Feng, is everything going to be okay?"

Zhang Fan couldn't help asking quietly.

After all, this kind of incident could be big or small. If it blew up, it might affect Qin Feng's reputation and medical standing.

"Don't worry. Just wait a bit longer."

Qin Feng nodded calmly, a faint smile on his lips.

Half an hour later—

Just as everyone was anxiously waiting, the door suddenly swung open.

All eyes turned toward it. Four people in crisp suits carrying briefcases walked in—clearly elite professionals.

The leader was a woman in her thirties who appeared intelligent and composed.

"Who are you?"

The two officers stood up, puzzled.

"Good day, officers. We're the criminal litigation team from Henglü Law Firm's Guangchuan branch. We're now taking full responsibility for Mr. Qin Feng's case. Here are our credentials."

The woman nodded at the officers, introduced herself, then turned to Qin Feng with a standard professional smile.

"Mr. Qin, please sign this letter of authorization and you may leave."

"Good. Thank you."

Qin Feng nodded, picked up a pen, and signed his name.

About three minutes later—

Once the officers verified the lawyers' identities and paperwork, they had no choice but to let them go.

Walking out of the security office, they said goodbye to the young couple. Zhang Fan and Liu Yan'er were both in shock.

The top law firm in China!

Known as 'the KFC of legal circles'—'guaranteed victory'!

And they had sent a complete team to personally handle all of Qin Feng's matters.

What was going on?

And the Tianhong Law Firm from the capital that had handled Feng Juan's case had already become hospital legend.

That Qin Feng could summon one of the top three law firms in the capital was hard enough to believe.

But now, it was the undisputed champion of China, famous worldwide—and they'd arrived at record speed!

This wasn't something money alone could achieve.

"Qin Feng, how did you get Henglü's lawyers?"

Zhang Fan couldn't help asking, disbelief in his voice.

"I have a friend who's a senior partner there. He sent them over."

Qin Feng brushed it off with a casual excuse.

"Anyway, let's drop it and head to the hotel. We have the conference tomorrow. I'll leave this to them."

When they stepped out of the subway station, a Mercedes S500L was parked across the street.

It was the car Henglü had arranged for him!

Seeing Zhang Fan's stunned expression, Qin Feng couldn't help but chuckle.

"Relax, Director Zhang. You're not the first one. The cardiothoracic team that came with me last time already spread the word about the luxury cars."

"It's different. This is different."

Zhang Fan shook his head, his eyes full of complex emotions.

"Sometimes I really wonder who you actually are. You've been wealthy from the start, your medical skills are extraordinary, and even when trouble comes, you have the nation's best legal team.

It's like no one can see through you..."

Qin Feng's lips curved mysteriously. He patted Zhang Fan's shoulder.

"Director Zhang, there's no need to see through me. What fun would life be then?"

As the Mercedes drove away, the internet and another city were being rocked by massive waves.

A gray-haired man in his fifties with silver-rimmed glasses paced back and forth, phone in hand, his face anxious.

"Director Wu, Director Wu, what's going on? Why are you withdrawing funding from the Medical School?

This is Dongda's lifeblood!

You can't do this!"

"Sigh, President Lü, this isn't my decision to make."

On the phone, Qidong Pharmaceutical Chairman Wu Donghua also sighed helplessly.

"Old Lü, I'll be straight with you. This isn't simple at all. You'd better think hard about whether you've offended that person, and deal with it fast.

There's nothing I can do! Good luck to you."
