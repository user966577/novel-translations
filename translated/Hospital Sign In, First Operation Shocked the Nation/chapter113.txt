Jaundice—a condition most people typically saw in newborns.

But newborn jaundice and adult jaundice were fundamentally different at their core!

One major distinction was that newborns had far more red blood cells than adults while in the womb.

After birth, these excess red blood cells oxidized and ruptured.

When the infant's liver couldn't metabolize all those red blood cells fast enough, bilirubin accumulated in the blood, staining the sclera, skin, mucous membranes, and other tissues yellow.

Adult jaundice, however, resulted from impaired liver function preventing normal bilirubin metabolism.

This manifested as hyperbilirubinemia—elevated blood bilirubin concentrations causing yellow discoloration of the sclera, skin, mucous membranes, and other tissues and body fluids.

Newborn jaundice healed easily, typically resolving quickly with treatment.

Of course, there were rare cases of over-treatment or severe complications affecting brain development.

But under modern medical conditions, such possibilities had been greatly reduced.

Adult jaundice, however, carried extremely serious dangers!

"Director, have you noticed any changes in yourself the past couple days?"

Qin Feng's brow furrowed as he studied Zhang Tong.

"Changes? I don't think so. Just been drinking more at night lately, and my stomach's been a bit uncomfortable."

Zhang Tong pointed to the Sanjiu Weitai stomach medicine on his desk and smiled helplessly.

"Though there's one silver lining—I've lost a few pounds these past few days, haha."

Through basic inquiry, Qin Feng's heart sank further.

Alcohol consumption, weight loss, plus jaundice and hiccups—he concluded the director must have an internal organ problem.

Most likely concentrated around the liver, pancreas, or gallbladder!

He immediately ruled out rice blast disease and other conditions that might present similar symptoms, since Zhang Tong had no exposure to such pathogens.

Now that the director was showing scleral icterus, he needed to be examined immediately.

"Director, there's something I need to tell you."

Qin Feng deliberated briefly, then decided not to hide it—he'd tell him straight.

After all, Zhang Tong had spent his entire career in medicine. As hospital director, he'd seen if not a hundred thousand cases then at least eighty thousand.

Even if he himself might be ill, he should be able to process it rationally.

"Oh? What is it? Go ahead."

Zhang Tong looked at him, nodding curiously.

"Could you spare me an hour this afternoon? I need to confirm something."

"An hour?"

Hearing this, Zhang Tong paused, confusion deepening on his face.

"The hospital's been extremely busy these past couple days. This afternoon I probably—"

"Just one hour. Before you leave for the conference, please give me one hour!"

Qin Feng shook his head, his tone resolute.

"This... Can you give me a reason?"

Seeing his determination, Zhang Tong fell silent for several seconds before responding gravely.

Qin Feng stood and walked out of the office, borrowing a small mirror from the secretary next door.

Then he returned to stand before Zhang Tong, holding up the open mirror.

Zhang Tong was even more puzzled. What did this mean?

He wanted him to look at himself?

"Director, take a good look at the whites of your eyes."

Seeing Zhang Tong watching him, Qin Feng pointed at the mirror and spoke in a low voice.

Zhang Tong instinctively looked at his own eyes, and upon careful inspection, his eyelids jumped violently.

This was... yellow discoloration?

"Scleral icterus—a symptom that only appears with jaundice. I don't think I need to explain the possible causes to you."

Qin Feng pressed his lips together, explaining somewhat helplessly.

"Though I can't confirm the cause yet, you must come with me for a comprehensive examination. We need to find the underlying cause of the jaundice first."

Zhang Tong said nothing, but the index finger resting on his documents trembled involuntarily, his face expressionless as he sank into thought.

After a moment, he set down his pen and nodded.

"I still have some urgent documents to sign. Wait for me to finish these first—it's not that urgent anyway."

"Alright, you finish up. I'll go arrange things at radiology and wait for you there."

Hearing this, Qin Feng let out a long breath, feeling slightly more relaxed.

Zhang Tong had shown him great kindness. Without the director's opportunities and full support, even with world-class medical skills, Qin Feng might not have advanced so quickly.

While his classmates were still struggling through residency, he was already a department head.

No other director could have made this happen—this was why Zhang Tong was known as one of Jiang Province's great medical reform leaders.

From an obscure Level 2A hospital, in just a few years it had leaped into the Level 3A ranks, becoming Jiang City's preeminent medical institution.

Moreover, every department head at Municipal First Hospital had achieved associate senior physician status!

The directors of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Neurosurgery were even pushing for full senior physician rank!

Once they succeeded, combined with the Transplant Center's achievements, Municipal First Hospital would officially join the ranks of provincial first-tier Level 3A hospitals.

This achievement would be Jiang City's greatest honor!

Zhang Tong had given so much over these dozen-plus years.

So much so that after his wife's unexpected death, he hadn't had time to find another companion, and now he was approaching sixty.

After leaving the director's office, Qin Feng went straight to the radiology department.

He immediately arranged for ultrasound, CT, MRI, MRCP imaging, and needle biopsy pathology.

He also notified Hematology to prepare for blood biochemistry and immunology tests!

Half an hour later—

Zhang Tong arrived. Qin Feng led him through each examination, focusing on abdominal exploration to identify the affected organ and location.

"Qin Feng, don't worry too much. I'm sure it's nothing serious."

Zhang Tong wasn't as anxious as him—if anything, he seemed more relaxed.

Meanwhile, the radiology staff, seeing that Director Qin's examination subject was the hospital director himself, immediately grew serious and attentive.

"Let's see what the reports say after you're done. Get on the scanner."

Qin Feng shook his head, his expression grave.

"You rascal, are you hoping I'm sick or something?"

Zhang Tong couldn't help but laugh.

But he still listened, removing his coat and lying down on the table.

After the ultrasound, they proceeded immediately to MRI and MRCP.

Then Qin Feng took him to Hematology for blood work to check bilirubin levels.

By the time they finished, over half an hour had passed.

Now they just had to wait for the reports. Zhang Tong and Qin Feng sat in the radiology office, having requested priority processing.

Ten minutes later—

The reports came back. Qin Feng took all the results and X-rays, examining each one carefully.

The liver appeared normal on imaging. Seeing this, Qin Feng relaxed slightly.

This meant the liver function impairment wasn't severe—the pathology wasn't originating from the liver.

This had been his greatest fear!

If severe liver dysfunction was causing the jaundice, the disease might have already progressed—possibly beyond the early stage!

Once it entered the intermediate stage, treatment difficulty increased exponentially!

But the situation didn't seem that bad.

When the next report and image appeared, both their hearts skipped a beat.

The lesion was hidden in such a concealed location—near the pelvic cavity!

"Here it is. Lymph node pathology. Pancreas."

Qin Feng pointed to a small shadow on the X-ray, roughly the size of a fingernail.

This was where the lesion was located.

Zhang Tong also saw the spot. He was silent for a long time.

His expression wasn't good, eyes filled with resignation and doubt.

But no fear.

After a while, he sighed.

"Qin Feng, I didn't misjudge you. You spotted my condition with just one look. If not for you, I probably wouldn't have noticed it myself."

"Director, let's do a pathology test. It's just early-stage pancreatic cancer—should be manageable."

Qin Feng also breathed a sigh of relief. His judgment was correct—it was indeed the pancreas.

But the situation was actually acceptable. Though it was pancreatic cancer, it was still early stage, with a cure probability over 90 percent.

They just needed to confirm whether it was benign or malignant to determine the surgical approach for excision.

"Alright, let's go."

With that, both men stood and left.

The pathology results wouldn't be ready until the next day due to processing time.

By tomorrow, Qin Feng would be leaving with Zhang Fan, so he probably wouldn't see the results in time.

But that was fine—given the current situation, there was nothing to worry about.

Early the next morning—

Qin Feng took Liu Yan'er and Zhang Fan to the airport, boarding a flight to Guangchuan Province.

Just after landing, he received a message from the director.

"Qin Feng, malignant tumor, but no spread. Nothing major."

"Director, in that case, you should have surgery as soon as possible. Removing it will give you peace of mind."

Qin Feng had barely finished when laughter came from the other end.

"Forget it. I'm busy these next few days anyway. I'll finish up and hand things over, then you can operate on me when you get back. How about it?"

"Sure! Haha, Director, don't worry. I'll be back soon."

Qin Feng couldn't help laughing either and agreed immediately.

After chatting briefly, they hung up. They had just arrived in Zhujiang, the city where the Guangchuan Province Medical Research Center was located.

This time Qin Feng didn't arrange for a private car. Instead, he took Liu Yan'er and Zhang Fan on the subway.

It was rush hour—driving would mean getting stuck in traffic!

The subway would be faster, so the three of them carried their bags and luggage into the station.

"Qin Feng, Director Zhang, wait here for me. I'll go buy the tickets."

Liu Yan'er took their ID cards and ran to queue at the ticket machine while the two men stood to the side with their belongings.

Zhang Fan watched him with a knowing smile, his expression full of deeper meaning.

"Director Zhang, that look doesn't seem right. Just say whatever's on your mind."

Qin Feng rolled his eyes and looked at him.

"Xiao Qin, Deputy Director Chen's beautiful daughter is your girlfriend now, and she treats you so well. You're a lucky man!"

Zhang Fan patted his shoulder, nodding with satisfaction.

"Of course. Who told me to be so handsome?"

Qin Feng nodded, his expression serious.

Zhang Fan's face froze. This guy really wasn't modest!

But he wasn't wrong either. Who could blame Qin Feng for being handsome?

At that moment, the crowd in the subway station surged like waves, countless heads bobbing. Even the ticket queue snaked around several bends.

Just as only one couple remained ahead of Liu Yan'er and she was about to buy tickets—

Suddenly, a tall, dark figure darted in from the side. The moment the man in front of the couple stepped away, this person cut directly in line.

Caught completely off guard, the young couple was shoved back two steps, and the girl stepped hard on Liu Yan'er's foot.

She stumbled and fell to the ground.

Two cries of pain rang out simultaneously. Liu Yan'er's face contorted in pain while the girl clutched her arm and ankle, curled up on the ground.

"Linlin, are you okay?"

The boyfriend's expression changed. He quickly knelt to support his girlfriend, asking anxiously. Then he turned to face the person ahead and began shouting angrily.

"Are you blind? Can't you see there are people here? What are you cutting in line for?! No manners at all!"

The commotion drew curious glances. Everyone noticed the person buying tickets wore a T-shirt and shorts, his whole body dark-skinned.

On the ground, a boyfriend cradled his teary, pained girlfriend.

Behind them stood Liu Yan'er. When the men saw her face, they felt their hearts stop.

What a beautiful woman!

Combined with having been stepped on hard, her slightly furrowed brow gave her a delicate, pitiable appearance that stirred protective feelings in many men. Their gazes toward the foreigner turned hostile.

"I don't know, it's you who bumped into me."

The foreigner got his ticket, turned to face the shouting boyfriend, and shrugged.

But the moment he looked up and saw Liu Yan'er, his eyes went wide.

Noticing that she seemed to have been stepped on too, he immediately walked past the couple toward her.

"You're beautiful. Beautiful lady, I'm sorry. My name is Nick, I'm from Kenya. I'm very sorry I stepped on you, please forgive me, sorry."

Liu Yan'er glanced at him, her brow furrowing slightly.

"Don't you know how to queue?! Why did you cut in line!"

"I came to China to study. I'm sorry, may I invite you for coffee? To express my apologies, please accept, please."

The foreigner was tall and muscular, at least 1.85 meters, his face full of apology and hope.

"Hey! Are you deaf? You knocked my girlfriend down, apologize now!"

The boyfriend stood up, grabbed him, and spoke aggressively.

"No, it's your fault. I won't apologize. Don't touch me."

Hearing this, the boyfriend's temper flared. He couldn't help but curse.

"Apologize now! If you don't, I'm calling the police! Let them handle this!"

"No matter, whatever you want."

Nick looked completely unconcerned, shrugged, then turned his gaze back to Liu Yan'er.

"Is anyone going to do something? Hello?!"

The boyfriend shouted loudly. A police officer standing guard nearby heard the commotion and hurried over.

Meanwhile, Qin Feng and Zhang Fan had noticed the situation. He left the luggage with Zhang Fan and walked quickly toward Liu Yan'er.

"Are you okay?"

He wrapped an arm around Liu Yan'er's shoulders and, seeing her clutching her foot with a pained expression, asked urgently.

The foreigner saw a man approach and embrace Liu Yan'er, and his expression froze, dissatisfaction flickering in his eyes.

Qin Feng looked up at the foreigner before him and spoke in a low voice.

"Did you step on my girlfriend?"
