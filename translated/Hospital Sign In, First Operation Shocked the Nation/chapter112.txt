Feng Juan's case was still ongoing, and the other side's desperate resistance was growing increasingly futile.

Because of the special circumstances of both plaintiff and defendant, the case was being tried behind closed doors to protect privacy.

The process had gone smoothly. After two hearings, the opposition had been unable to mount any defense and was on the verge of total defeat.

Though Sun Daqiang had vowed to drag things out, in Qin Feng's eyes he was nothing but a clown.

Victory was locked in!

Sun Han faced 16 charges!

Even with leniency, his minimum sentence would be no less than eight years!

As for compensation, the current offer had reached 800,000 yuan. Breaking a million seemed certain.

For Feng Juan's family, this money would at least provide significant relief.

But Qin Feng still worried about one hidden danger—whether Sun Daqiang might try something underhanded.

So over the past two days, Tianhong had begun investigating Sun Daqiang and his company for any problems. Ideally, they'd send the whole family to prison together.

Cut the grass and pull up the roots!

In the hospital director's office—

Qin Feng and Zhang Fan sat in chairs across from Director Zhang Tong.

"Zhang Fan, Qin Feng—there's a conference in Guangchuan Province. I'd like you two to attend. Any objections?"

Zhang Tong looked at them with a smile.

Qin Feng and Zhang Fan exchanged puzzled glances.

The Guangchuan Province Medical Conference was one of the largest in the country, carrying significant weight in the medical community.

Under normal circumstances, at least a vice director would need to attend to represent the hospital appropriately.

And while Municipal First Hospital was a Level 3A hospital that met the admission criteria—

Compared to the top hospitals in first-tier cities, they could still be easily outclassed.

Whether in terms of physician numbers, skills, or equipment, they were just barely qualified.

If not for the Transplant Center's rising national reputation recently, with its strong influence and excellent reviews, they might not have even received an invitation this year.

"Director, we're just department heads. Wouldn't it be inappropriate to go without a vice director leading the delegation?"

Zhang Fan spoke up.

"Hic—sigh, it's not that we don't want to go. Director Liu and I are just too swamped to get away! Hic—"

Zhang Tong hiccupped, shaking his head helplessly.

"This Guangchuan conference focuses mainly on cardiovascular specialists, with emphasis on cardiovascular and hematological disease research and case sharing.

For cardiothoracic surgery, Zhang Fan, you're our pillar. And Qin Feng's achievements in hematology speak for themselves. So after careful consideration, we don't want to miss this opportunity to exchange ideas with top hospitals. That's why we're sending you two."

Hearing this, Zhang Fan nodded slightly and fell silent, looking somewhat tempted.

Cardiovascular focus!

This was right up his alley. The chance to discuss and compare notes with specialists from first-tier cities was incredibly rare for any doctor.

After all, the cases any single city encountered were limited. Many extremely unusual or rare cases might never cross most doctors' paths in their entire careers.

This was all too common!

Limited case exposure meant limited breakthrough opportunities—an unavoidable bottleneck in medical advancement.

Modern medicine's progress was built on human sacrifice—

"I'm fine with it. Perfect chance to compare notes with them."

Qin Feng smiled and nodded. This was a good opportunity.

Though he already possessed world-class expertise across multiple fields, medicine was a realm where miracles never ceased.

If he encountered conditions that didn't exist even in his inherited memories, that would be a real windfall!

"Hic—haha! Since neither of you objects, I'll submit the registration. Hic—"

Zhang Tong looked at them with satisfaction.

"The conference runs three days, with sessions only in the mornings. The afternoons are free—you can explore, relax, consider it a perk."

"Can we bring someone?"

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

"Sure, hic—the conference is just you two anyway. Bring whoever you want during free time, but no reimbursement for that!"

Zhang Tong waved magnanimously.

Qin Feng's face broke into a grin. Perfect—he could bring Liu Yan'er to see Guangchuan. She'd never been.

Three days meant about a day and a half of free time—plenty for sightseeing and eating.

Liu Yan'er had been home working on her thesis lately, losing hair from the stress. A change of scenery would do her good.

"Hic—alright, that's settled then. You can go. Hic—"

Zhang Tong waved them off. His desk was piled high with reports and documents.

Being a hospital director wasn't easy. Though he was in his fifties, his daily workload would exhaust most young people.

One phone call and he'd have to drive to the hospital or some government office.

As the top leader of Municipal First Hospital, he had to oversee everything.

The stress lately had even taken a toll on his complexion.

"Alright, we'll head out then."

Qin Feng and Zhang Fan stood to leave. Just as he opened the door, he heard Zhang Tong hiccupping repeatedly behind them.

His brow furrowed slightly, suspicion rising.

What was going on?

Why hadn't the hiccups stopped?

"Director, there's something I wanted to discuss with you."

Qin Feng walked to the chair across from him and sat down.

"Sure, give me—hic—two minutes to finish reviewing this document."

Zhang Tong nodded, eyes on the report in his hands.

Qin Feng said nothing, but began observing him closely.

Hiccups could have many causes, and most resolved within minutes. But persistent hiccups could indicate various issues.

For instance, excessive tension, anxiety, emotional agitation, or even underlying fear could trigger involuntary air swallowing, causing hiccups.

But there was another category—organic pathology. From the mildest superficial gastritis to atrophic gastritis, even gastric tumors, all could present with hiccups.

Other organs too—lungs, pleuritis, peritonitis, pancreatitis—could irritate the phrenic nerve and cause persistent hiccups.

So hiccups, at their simplest, were just common belching. But at their worst, they could signal various diseases.

For most doctors, without thorough and detailed examination, these things were impossible to detect!

"Director, how long have you been hiccupping?"

Qin Feng couldn't help asking.

"I don't know. Been hiccupping on and off the past couple days, but I didn't think much of it. Hic—figured it would stop on its own. Today's been longer than usual."

Zhang Tong shook his head dismissively.

The past couple days?

"Have you felt unwell at all?"

Qin Feng pressed.

"Not really, just haven't had much appetite. Probably the heat. That's normal."

Zhang Tong paused, thought for a moment, and shook his head.

"Why? You think something's wrong with me? Haha, I get full checkups every year."

"Nothing, just seemed odd."

Qin Feng smiled.

That was true. As hospital director, Zhang Tong would have comprehensive annual physicals.

If there were any latent health risks, they would have been caught already.

Unless it was something rapidly deteriorating—but that was unlikely.

Because conditions that deteriorated rapidly were never minor!

They would show obvious physiological symptoms—immediately visible!

Qin Feng was about to let it go when suddenly, the moment Zhang Tong lowered his head, his entire body jolted!

Why did Director Zhang's eyes look... yellowish?

Something was very wrong!

That was...
