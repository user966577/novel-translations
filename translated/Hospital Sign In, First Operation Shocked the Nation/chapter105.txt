A Porsche flew down the highway at breakneck speed. Qin Feng had to reach Peng City Train Station before Xiaoxia and convince her to come back.

After he'd ordered the stem cell bank at the hospital to run tests, the staff had immediately begun screening—and unexpectedly discovered that his stem cells were a perfect match for Wei Xiaoxia!

No one had anticipated this!

It was like a gift from heaven, or perhaps the only lifeline that could save Xiaoxia.

Ring ring ring—

"Hello, this is the Jiang City Police Command Center. I'm Deputy Director Zheng Kui."

"Hello, I'm Qin Feng, Director of the Transplant Center at Municipal First Hospital. I'm currently on my way to Peng City Train Station."

Hearing the commanding voice on the other end, Qin Feng immediately identified himself.

"I just received instructions from above to assist you as much as possible. Are you really confident you can persuade your patient to return?"

The voice on the other end was low and serious, almost questioning.

"I should tell you that while we can cooperate with you on this matter, if the persuasion fails, Zhang Tong will still owe me an explanation."

"Don't worry. I'm certain I can convince the patient to come back."

Qin Feng's tone was resolute.

"Good. I'm authorizing you to exceed the speed limit. We'll also contact Peng City Train Station to help you find Wei Xiaoxia. Don't let us down."

Zheng Kui didn't say anything more and immediately made his position clear.

The call ended.

Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief. Looks like certain connections really do come in handy!

Actually, he had just asked Lin Xiaoxiao to contact the municipal government office on behalf of the Qin Medical Foundation, informing them that a patient from their partner hospital, Municipal First Hospital, had gone missing, and that department director Qin Feng was already en route, hoping for assistance.

The health bureau director who received this news was also startled, but years of experience helped him stay calm.

As a nationally renowned and powerful medical foundation, the Qin Medical Foundation's status was not to be underestimated.

After all, establishing a charitable foundation in China required multi-party oversight—and that "multi-party" could be understood by referencing the One Foundation.

If it weren't for the fact that private individuals couldn't establish foundations in China at the time, even the Kung Fu Emperor wouldn't have needed to change his citizenship.

But Qin Feng was different. The power behind his foundation was beyond even Jiang City's top officials to investigate.

This meant they couldn't afford to offend him!

As for Qin Feng himself, local state security had received two files on him. One showed his social information was suspiciously clean.

And the other...

So the police were quick to offer help this time. It was far better than him going it alone.

The path was paved for him. All he had to do was act.

After hanging up, Qin Feng floored the accelerator.

Dawn was breaking, the engine roaring. The two-tier rear spoiler slowly rose.

This time, he pushed the 8-cylinder engine to its absolute limit!

With extreme vision and extreme driving, he vanished like a white phantom at the end of the highway!

Xiaoxia had finished the crackers but hadn't drunk the water.

Licking her dry, cracked lips, she looked at the mineral water in front of her, then at the woman.

"Why aren't you drinking?"

The woman smiled at her and asked.

Xiaoxia didn't speak, but the woman understood. This time, however, she didn't move.

About a minute or two later—

The woman's expression changed. She looked at Xiaoxia with something like heartache and reached out to pat her head.

"You stubborn child. Fine."

She picked up the mineral water, unscrewed the cap, poured a little into a cup, and placed it back in front of Xiaoxia.

Then she lifted the cup to the lips of the little boy sleeping in her arms and slowly fed it to him.

"See? My own child drank it. Go ahead and drink. Your little lips are about to stick together."

After setting down the cup, the woman urged.

Xiaoxia hesitated but eventually picked up the bottle and gulped down two mouthfuls before setting it down.

Carefully, she screwed the cap back on and tucked it into her bag. She wanted to save it so it would last longer.

Watching this, the woman's smile deepened. Without a word, she affectionately patted Xiaoxia's head.

She looked as though Xiaoxia were her own daughter.

Half an hour later—

Xiaoxia felt her eyelids growing heavy, yawning from exhaustion.

It was past 5 AM and still dark. At this hour, almost everyone in the carriage was tired, either just waking up or still fast asleep.

Most were sleeping soundly, so her reaction was perfectly normal.

Xiaoxia didn't think much of it. Unable to hold on any longer, she slowly closed her eyes and leaned against the window, drifting off to sleep.

At that moment, the woman pulled out her iPhone, leaned close to Xiaoxia, and snapped a photo. Her smile was natural and doting, but her eyes held a different meaning entirely—

The man sitting across from them, his eyelashes trembling, had been watching the woman's every move. A glint of cunning flashed through his eyes.

The corner of his mouth couldn't help but rise, as though he were dreaming of good fortune.

An hour later, Peng City Train Station began to bustle with activity. Many early travelers were already flooding into the station.

Everyone carried large bags, looking busy.

Qin Feng's white Porsche drove straight into the parking lot. He threw open the door and rushed toward the station.

"Excuse me, where's the police office?"

Spotting a staff member inside, he quickly asked.

"Is there something I can help you with?"

"I was sent by Jiang City Police. They've already made contact."

Qin Feng explained.

"Jiang City? Alright, follow me."

Without further questions, the staff member led him to the police office.

"Are you Qin Feng?"

When he appeared before two officers, their eyes lit up as they stepped forward to ask.

"That's right. Has the train arrived?"

"It arrived five minutes ago. We've been waiting for you."

The two officers immediately led him at a brisk pace toward the entrance, explaining as they walked.

"The stop is only 15 minutes. We need to hurry."

The officers led the way while Qin Feng followed, smoothly passing through the ticket checkpoint and entering the waiting hall.

Without stopping, they pushed through the crowd, showed their credentials, and entered the platform.

"There—Car 8."

An officer pointed to a carriage in the distance where passengers were boarding. The three of them sprinted over.

However, when they reached the door of Car 8, they saw a woman walking out with her hands in front of her, head bowed.

Behind her walked a man escorting her, and then another man wearing glasses in the same posture, following closely.

Behind them came a bald, muscular man carrying a familiar small figure in his arms.

Who was that man?

Qin Feng recognized her instantly. His brow furrowed and he quickened his pace.

"Wait! Who are you people?!"

Reaching them, he stretched out his arm to block the muscular man, his voice deep.

The two men froze for a moment, their gazes immediately becoming wary and sharp.

"Who are you?"

"Put down the child!"

Qin Feng didn't answer. His fists clenched, his eyes fierce—he was ready.

"What are you doing?"

The two officers also sensed something was wrong. Instinctively, their hands moved toward the equipment at their waists as they pointed at the two men.

"This is none of your business. Move!"

The bald man was blunt with all three of them, but he deliberately pulled back the sleeve of the glasses-wearing man in front of him, revealing a corner of silver handcuffs.

Instantly, the three understood. Could these be colleagues?

"Please come with us to the police office for questioning. Thank you!"

The older officer, clearly more experienced, stepped forward with a salute and spoke in a serious tone.

The two muscular men exchanged glances, nodded silently, and followed the officers and Qin Feng off the platform with the man and woman in custody.

"Hahaha! So this little girl is the person you were looking for! We thought she was some kid who ran away from home. She stumbled right into our operation and did us a huge favor!"

The bald man let out a hearty laugh, pointing at Wei Xiaoxia still sleeping on the couch.

By now, Qin Feng understood. These two were plainclothes officers sent by the provincial bureau specifically to crack down on a human trafficking ring.

The bald man was the leader of the task force, personally leading the investigation.

They had been tailing the woman for over three months but still hadn't identified who was responsible for the transfers.

This time, the woman had stolen a child in Huizhou, traveled through the southwest in multiple legs, and finally boarded a train to Changxi Province.

They had barely received intelligence that a contact might appear along the route, so they had kept close watch.

What they hadn't expected was that the woman—whether out of greed or because someone was offering money for a girl—had noticed Xiaoxia at just that moment.

She'd gotten ideas and decided to make extra money by drugging Xiaoxia.

But with two unconscious children, how could she possibly carry them both?

So she took a risk and contacted a hidden accomplice on the train for help—and walked right into their trap!

As long as they could extract information during interrogation over the next couple of days and confirm the identity of the middleman responsible for transfers, they could take down this despicable organization in one sweep!

So Xiaoxia's appearance had actually provided a major breakthrough for their case.

You could say she'd rendered meritorious service!

Hearing this, Qin Feng stroked the sleeping Xiaoxia lying on his lap, unable to suppress a smile.

This child. Who would have thought that running away to die would end up helping rescue other trafficked children?

Whether it was fate or heaven's mercy, who could say?

"Here's what we'll do—leave us your contact information. Once the case is closed, the provincial bureau will have a reward for this little girl."

The bald man stood up and smiled at Qin Feng.

"Alright, thank you!"

After leaving his phone number, Qin Feng lifted Xiaoxia into his arms and turned to the two officers.

"Thank you for your help. I need to head back now. Her condition is serious—she needs surgery as soon as possible."

"We won't keep you then. Take care, Dr. Qin."

They shook hands, and Qin Feng turned to leave.

By now, the first rays of sunlight were breaking over the horizon. The morning glow spread across the sky like a painting, breathtaking in its beauty.

The pale face of Xiaoxia in his arms was tinted pink by the sunlight. Her dry lips pressed together slightly.

Qin Feng smiled and set off on the journey home.

Two hours later—

Municipal First Hospital Transplant Center, Jiang City.

Hospital Director Zhang Tong, Hematology Director Ji Zhonghe, and Transplant Center Deputy Director Tang Dandan—all three leaders had gathered, waiting in the lobby alongside Xiaoxia's parents.

When Qin Feng appeared carrying Xiaoxia, a gurney was already waiting.

"Xiaoxia! My daughter, you're finally back! Waaah..."

Seeing this, Xiaoxia's parents couldn't hold back their tears any longer. They rushed over like mad.

At this moment, Qin Feng looked like a hero in everyone's eyes. Even Zhang Tong and Ji Zhonghe, two grown men, couldn't help but feel their noses sting with emotion.

Racing through the night across two cities, coordinating police in both locations—Qin Feng had been like a ray of light, bringing this dying little girl back.

This was what it meant to be a great physician!

After much crying, Xiaoxia was taken back to her room.

Now there was a spark of life in her eyes, unlike before when she'd looked listless and hopeless, as though she'd already given up on life.

"Dr. Brother, was everything you said really true?"

On the hospital bed, Xiaoxia's flickering eyes looked at him as she asked weakly.

"Yes, all of it."

Qin Feng smiled and nodded, gently stroking her hair. A few strands came away in his hand. He held them up for her to see.

"Soon, these will all grow back. You'll be able to braid your hair again, just the way you like."

Xiaoxia nodded vigorously, a sweet, adorable smile spreading across her face.

"Deputy Director Tang, schedule examinations for both Xiaoxia and me. Have the operating room on standby and prepare the isolation chamber."

Qin Feng turned to Tang Dandan and the others, issuing instructions.

"Deputy Director Tang will perform the surgery. All attending physicians will observe in the OR. Residents will watch the live broadcast from the monitoring room."

When he finished, everyone answered in unison, their expressions serious and meticulous.

Their department director—their boss—was personally serving as the donor and going into surgery alongside the patient!

This was practically unheard of!

At 3 PM, the operating room and isolation chamber were fully prepared.

Qin Feng changed into surgical attire, and Xiaoxia had also changed into her surgical gown.

"Xiaoxia, are you ready?"

"Yes, I'm ready!"

"Good. Let's head into the operating room."

With that, Qin Feng personally pushed the gurney, entering the operating room together with Xiaoxia.

Inside the surgical suite, over a dozen fully equipped doctors stood to the side, their eyes filled with respect.

"No need to be so serious. You're scaring me."

Qin Feng smiled at everyone. After helping Xiaoxia onto the operating table, he climbed onto his own table and assumed the standard lateral position.

Ready for bone marrow extraction!

Tang Dandan took her place as lead surgeon. First assistant was Ji Zhonghe. Second assistant was Hospital Director Zhang Tong. Third assistant was Deputy Director Liu.

This lineup was unprecedented at Municipal First Hospital—and likely never to be seen again!

Tang Dandan took a deep breath and glanced at the clock.

"The time is now 3:15 PM. Bone marrow transplant surgery for patient Wei Xiaoxia—beginning now."
