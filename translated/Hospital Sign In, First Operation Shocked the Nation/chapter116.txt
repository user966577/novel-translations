Zhujiang Municipal First Hospital—

The foreigners lay in hospital beds, now conscious.

Nick, the ringleader, ground his teeth as he looked at his friends in the adjacent beds.

"We must pursue this to the end. Call Mr. Brado and have him intervene!

They dared to do this to us—we have to teach them a lesson!"

"Alright, I'll contact him now."

One of his friends nodded, equally furious.

They'd just been examined. Nick was diagnosed with a mild concussion, and the impact had scraped skin off his forehead, causing some bleeding.

Of the other three, one had hairline fractures in his last two left ribs, while two had minor injuries—nothing serious.

This was only because Qin Feng had held back. Especially the one who'd been kicked in the diaphragm—if Qin Feng hadn't pulled his strike, that man would be on an operating table right now.

After the call, his friend told Nick that Mr. Brado had already informed the school and relevant authorities.

They would handle this seriously, have police find the attacker, and impose severe punishment.

He told them to stay in the hospital and get every possible examination done. That way the Chinese police would have to classify it as at least minor injuries or above.

The attacker would face prison time and have to pay substantial compensation!

"I have to find out who that guy was. I want revenge! Fuck!"

Just then, a nurse pushed a cart into the room.

When Nick and his friends saw the young nurse, their eyes lit up.

Though she wore a loose-fitting uniform and cap, her delicate features were unmistakable.

She walked to Nick's bedside to change his dressing.

As she prepared the gauze and medication, the other foreigners gave Nick knowing looks, waggling their eyebrows suggestively.

Nick nodded, his eyes burning as he sized up the nurse.

"Here, time to change the dressing."

The nurse finished preparing and reached toward his forehead.

This position exposed her chest directly in front of Nick.

"Beautiful angel in white, may I know your name?"

Nick looked up at her admiringly.

"Why do you want to know?"

The nurse ignored him, carefully removing the old gauze and applying new dressing to his forehead.

Just as she was about to finish, Nick suddenly clutched his head, feigning a pained expression.

"Beautiful angel, it really hurts. What should I do? Am I going to die?"

Seeing his expression, the nurse paused, then pulled back her hands.

"Wait a moment, I'll call the doctor."

She turned to leave, but her hand was suddenly grabbed tight.

"No, don't go. When you leave, my head hurts even more. Please finish bandaging me first."

Nick held her hand, his face contorted in apparent pain.

The nurse's expression shifted slightly, but as a nurse, she'd encountered such situations before.

"Then bear with it. I'll call the doctor right after."

She reached out and quickly applied the new gauze. But before she could stand, Nick suddenly closed his eyes and fell toward her chest.

"Hey, what's wrong?"

The nurse had no time to react. When she tried to push him away with both hands, she found she couldn't support his weight.

Just like that, Nick's face pressed firmly against her chest while his arms seemingly fell loosely around her, encircling the nurse.

"What are you doing?"

The nurse finally realized something was wrong, her expression tightening, her voice rising.

With all her strength, she managed to push Nick back onto the bed.

"S-sorry, beautiful angel. I felt a bit dizzy just now. Are you okay?"

Nick opened his eyes, supporting his forehead with his hand, speaking weakly.

The nurse glared at him angrily, turned, and quickly left with her cart.

"Hahaha, Nick, you're doing it beautifully! How do you feel?"

His friends burst out laughing, then asked with lewd expressions.

Nick's eyes flashed with a lecherous gleam. He licked his lips and shook his head.

"Too small! But soft enough! Hahaha!"

Satisfied laughter filled the hospital room.

Meanwhile, the video of Qin Feng beating the foreigners was spreading and fermenting rapidly online.

The incident had inherently high appeal, and combined with provocative headlines and the decisive counterattack in the video—

It became viral content, shared everywhere. In just two hours, views had surpassed several million and were fast approaching ten million!

A hot search appeared: 'Chinese guy takes on four foreigners! Sends them flying! Still think this is the Qing Dynasty?'

It sparked countless comments.

"Holy shit! So satisfying! This guy is incredible!"

"Well done! Those who aren't our people have different hearts! They've been riding high over us for too long!"

"I've been fed up with them for ages. Still think this is the Qing Dynasty?"

"The Qing Dynasty fell!"

"What? My Qing Dynasty is gone? Then why are they bullying us!"

"Chinese men really have no manners—you can't hit exchange students even if you can fight!"

"Exactly! So what if they're in China? You people are just racist!"

"Oh look! The feminists are here! What, are they your daddy now?"

"These feminist activists worship foreigners. Do what you want with them."

"This time I support the handsome guy in the video. Are you blind? Can't you see those foreigners bullying our people?"

"Don't bother arguing with them. Feminists have no brains and no eyes—they're just lapdogs. Don't waste your time on dogs."

The entire internet exploded!

Arguments and insults from various camps pushed the video's popularity through the roof.

In just half an hour, the topic shot to number one on the trending list with over 50 million searches!

Then came carefully edited short videos, aggressively steering the narrative.

Qin Feng's identity was quickly discovered—after all, he was extremely handsome and had been in the news several times before.

His social media account was immediately flooded with messages of support and abuse.

But Qin Feng had no time to pay attention. He hadn't checked his social media in ages.

"Qin Feng, is beating those people really going to be okay?"

In the hotel room, Liu Yan'er asked with concern while organizing their things.

She knew those people's status was different—foreigners plus exchange students might be difficult to handle.

"Haha, what? Worried they'll cause trouble?"

Qin Feng stopped what he was doing, walked over and embraced her, smiling.

"Or worried my legal team can't handle them?"

"It's just—I feel you were too reckless this time. What if..."

Liu Yan'er pouted, speaking in annoyance.

"Don't worry. I'll tell you something—not only is Tianhong mine, so is Henglü from today."

Qin Feng leaned close to her ear and whispered mysteriously.

"I figured as much."

Liu Yan'er put down the clothes in her hands and looked at him helplessly, then sighed.

"You're really too mysterious. You have no parents, but everything you reveal is beyond what ordinary people could achieve.

Honestly, I'm very curious about why.

I studied finance and have some knowledge of law too. Tianhong Law Firm is one of the capital's elite, valued at least three billion.

And Henglü is the undisputed giant of the industry—they even acquired Dentons, one of the world's top ten law firms. Their global influence is enormous.

Getting shares in either isn't just about money!

And you're just a department head at a Level 3A hospital. It's terrifying!"

Hearing Liu Yan'er's analysis and seeing her furrowed brow, the nervousness and confusion in her eyes—

Like a fledgling bird facing an eagle, helpless and flustered yet unable to do anything—

Qin Feng felt his heart squeeze. He pulled her tightly into his arms.

"I'm sorry, Yan'er. I can't tell you these things yet."

Qin Feng spoke softly and tenderly near her ear.

"But please believe me. I'll love you forever. Whatever you want, I can give you—even a city, even a star!"

"I know, I know..."

Liu Yan'er was silent for a long moment. A tear slid from her eye as she murmured softly.

Qin Feng felt her body trembling slightly in his arms. He couldn't help but lift her chin and kiss her tears away.

As their lips met, passion followed.

Girlfriend problems—nothing that affection couldn't solve.

If once wasn't enough, then twice!

In the Dongda University President's Office—

President Lü watched the video on his phone, brow deeply furrowed.

Before him sat three or four people, including two middle-aged foreigners in suits.

"Professor Lü, this matter is extremely serious! I've already notified the foreign affairs department to handle this severely. I also hope the university will apply pressure to have the criminal apprehended quickly!"

"President Lü, such an incident happening to Dongda exchange students during their cultural tour—we absolutely cannot let this slide!"

"President Lü, I think we shouldn't be too hasty about this. In the video, our exchange students also threw punches. Maybe we should apprehend the suspect first, then decide whether to get involved?"

Just as an older professor spoke up, the two foreigners immediately stood, shouting in protest.

"How can you do this to us? If you won't handle it, we'll report this to higher authorities and our home countries. I'm sure we'll get a result!"

Everyone fell silent, looking toward Lü Dongxing, who was still watching the video.

Lü Dongxing was no fool. The importance of these exchange students to the university was undeniable—otherwise he wouldn't have turned a blind eye all this time.

More importantly, some of these students served specific purposes for the country.

After all, sacrificing small benefits to gain support and control over local populations, eventually managing external regions through proxies or using them as information sources—this was the most economical approach.

(This is nothing new—our ancestors refined these techniques over 5,000 years, similar to the protectorate system.)

Three of those involved in the video were from Dongda, though fortunately they were nobody special.

Now this hot potato had landed in his lap—quite the headache.

Another matter flashed through his mind!

The next second, Lü Dongxing hurried out the door.

"Professor Lü, where are you going?"

"Wait for me!"

The two foreigners immediately called out. He raised his hand to indicate they should stay seated.

He went to the next room and dialed a number.

"Old Lü, did you see the video?"

A familiar voice came through before he could speak.

"Director Wu, you..."

Lü Dongxing froze completely!

Had he guessed right?

"Old Lü, I'm advising you—if these people are useless, cut them loose. Otherwise the consequences might be more than you can bear!"

On the phone, Director Wu sighed deeply and spoke quietly.

"Let me tell you a secret. I just received word from a life sciences research center in Jinling, Jiang Province. A new drug for coronary heart disease has passed Phase 3 clinical trials. I've seen the research report.

It could overturn the entire coronary heart disease pharmaceutical market!

Additionally, the chairmen of Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Shiyao Group—two of China's top pharmaceutical companies—have already sent letters requesting the establishment of a new Daqin Medical Center, with Jinling's life sciences center taking the lead. The nominal controller would be Qiao Changping, a famous industrialist from Jiang Province!

Of course, this is all confidential. Leaking even a hint would mean disaster!

Withdrawing from Dongda Medical School would hurt us somewhat, but the benefits are staggering. And you...

Think it over carefully. I'm hanging up."

The call ended!

Lü Dongxing was stunned!

His mouth hung open, eyes filled with shock!

Who could this person be?

To wield such enormous power!

Of China's top ten pharmaceutical companies, this person controlled three!

Anyone with such terrifying influence could shake the entire Chinese medical industry at will.

Even global markets would feel the impact!

He had no choice.

The message couldn't have been clearer—either the foreigners go, or he does!

After several seconds, Lü Dongxing made his decision, a fierce glint in his eyes.

'These troublemaking animals! Had to feed me flies!'

After anxiously waiting over ten minutes, Lü Dongxing pushed open the door and strode in.

"President Lü, what should we do about this?"

"I'll handle this personally. It's not your concern anymore!"

Lü Dongxing glanced coolly at the four people before him, his tone decisive.

"These three students are expelled immediately! Forced deportation!"

"What?! You can't do this!"

The two foreigners jumped to their feet, shouting.

"What are you yelling about? I'm the president of Dongda! I make the decisions here!"

Before they could speak again, Lü Dongxing's face turned cold. He slammed his palm on the desk and pointed at them.

"The announcement has already been drafted by my secretary's office! If you have connections, go ahead and try to pressure me!"

"You'll regret this!"

The two foreigners' faces were extremely ugly. They opened their mouths but didn't know what to say. Finally, they spat out a few words and turned to leave.

The office door slammed shut. Lü Dongxing's anger erupted.

He strode to the door, threw it open, and bellowed at their retreating backs.

"Stop! Who gave you permission to slam my door?!

Come back and close it properly! Slam it again and I'll have you carried out!"

The two foreigners froze mid-step, staring at Lü Dongxing in disbelief, their faces nearly distorting.

But given Lü Dongxing's rank, though they held foreign affairs positions, they weren't even in the same league.

Usually, playing the foreigner card earned them courtesy. But now that his own position was threatened, why would he care?

They walked back, eyes blazing with anger.

One of them grabbed the door handle and, right in front of him, slowly closed it properly. Only then did the sound of hurried footsteps descending the stairs echo through the hallway.

Lü Dongxing was furious. He'd really been too generous with them all this time!

How dare they slam the door of a vice-ministerial official?

Meanwhile—

Zhujiang local police, under confirmed facts and pressure from Henglü's legal team, rejected Nick and his friends' claims, awarding only 1,800 yuan for medical expenses.

What was Henglü Law Firm?

China's number one!

The power, connections, and formidable strength behind it would make even the likes of Jack Ma tremble.

Nick's group had been planning to recover in the hospital for a few days, discussing how to spend their big payout on clubbing and women.

Then police, foreign affairs, Henglü, and university representatives all arrived.

All six people who appeared in the video—including the woman who hadn't thrown a punch—were notified of their expulsion, visa revocation, and forced deportation.

The next day, they were put on a plane and sent out of China.

When the results were announced, the internet exploded again!

'Subway foreigner beating results revealed! Forced deportation! Hardcore!'

Zhujiang Medical University—

Administrative Building, conference hall—

Over a hundred experts at deputy director level or above from Level 3A hospitals across the country sat together, discussing and sharing their case studies.

And among them was one anomaly!

Strikingly young—still in residency—yet serving as director of a transplant center. A handsome guy who stood out like a sore thumb.
