"What's going on here?"

Two police officers responsible for maintaining order walked over, frowning at the scene.

"He cut in line, knocked my girlfriend down, and stepped on someone else. Aren't you going to do something about it?!"

The boyfriend pointed at Nick indignantly.

"And he's refusing to apologize because he's a foreigner!"

"Exactly, since when are foreigners this arrogant?"

"Absolutely no manners! Apologize!"

"Well, he's a foreigner, they always get special treatment. Just watch."

"Alright, alright, stop arguing."

One male officer stepped forward and helped the girl up.

"Where are you hurt?"

"I think I twisted my ankle. It hurts."

The girl was still crying from the pain, her face contorting the moment her foot touched the ground.

"How about this—come with me to the medical room first. If it's serious, you can go to a hospital."

"What about him?"

The boyfriend pointed at Nick.

The officers exchanged glances, looking somewhat hesitant.

"It's just a small matter. Let's all be understanding. He probably didn't know better. Why don't you come too—we'll go to the mediation room."

The officers led everyone away. Qin Feng carried Liu Yan'er and followed.

After all, she'd been stepped on too. Better to check if she was injured.

In the medical room, Qin Feng removed Liu Yan'er's shoes and socks. Her foot was slightly red but uninjured. Fortunately.

The couple nearby wasn't so lucky.

The boyfriend had just started removing his girlfriend's shoe when she gasped in pain.

"Ouch! That hurts! Be gentle."

"Okay, okay, I'll go slower. Bear with it."

The boyfriend quickly pulled his hand back, then slowly loosened the laces before carefully removing the shoe.

The girl's ankle was clearly red and even starting to swell—she must have sprained it when she fell.

"Let me take a look."

The medical room doctor walked over, glanced at it, and said casually,

"It's nothing, just a sprain. Rest for a few days and it'll heal."

"Doctor, we need to report to our university. She can't walk like this—what are we supposed to do?"

The boyfriend grabbed the doctor anxiously.

"It's just a sprain. It can only heal naturally. What can I do about it?"

The doctor spread his hands helplessly.

"What do we do now?!"

The girl started crying again when she heard this.

Qin Feng watched from the side. Liu Yan'er leaned in close to his ear.

"Can you fix her ankle?"

Qin Feng looked at her and couldn't help smiling.

"I can. But you don't mind me touching another girl's foot in front of you?"

"Please! You're a doctor. When don't you examine patients' bodies?"

Liu Yan'er rolled her eyes, patting his shoulder.

"Go on. These college students have it hard enough."

"Fine. Since you're being so considerate, I'll help out."

Qin Feng thought for a moment and nodded, standing up.

Actually, Western medicine had no direct method for healing a sprain. Judging by the girl's ankle, it was soft tissue contusion with slight misalignment. With three or four days of rest and no weight-bearing, it would recover.

But that doctor's attitude had been far too dismissive. Even if he couldn't treat it, he could at least apply medication to reduce swelling—that was the bare minimum.

"Young man, let me take a look."

Qin Feng walked over to the boyfriend and smiled.

"I'm a doctor. I should be able to help."

Hearing this, the boyfriend paused in surprise, then moved aside with delight.

Qin Feng crouched down, examined the girl's ankle, and looked at her. "It's not serious. Don't worry."

Then he grasped her lower foot with one hand and held her ankle with the other, gently rotating and massaging.

"What university are you from? What year?"

"We're second-year students at Zhujiang University. We came back early because we had things to do at school."

The girl wiped her tears, no longer crying.

When she saw Qin Feng, she was stunned. The pain in her foot instantly faded from awareness as her eyes fixed on him.

He was easily a hundred times more handsome than her boyfriend!

Especially when he held her foot—it felt like he was holding her heart, making it pound uncontrollably!

Meeting Qin Feng's gaze, the girl's face flushed red, and she quickly looked away.

Meanwhile, the boyfriend couldn't help feeling a twinge of jealousy.

But what could he say? The guy was genuinely, ridiculously handsome.

If he were a girl, he probably couldn't resist either!

"Haha, I envy your college days. How long have you two been together?"

Qin Feng continued manipulating her ankle while distracting her.

"We've been..."

The girl had just started speaking when suddenly Qin Feng applied force. A soft crack came from her ankle.

The girl cried out sharply, her features contorting.

"Huihui, Huihui, are you okay? Is something wrong?!"

The boyfriend leaped to his feet, embracing his girlfriend protectively before casting a wary look at Qin Feng.

Qin Feng released her foot and smiled calmly at them.

"Done. It's fine now. Try walking on it."

Both of them froze. The girl came to her senses and wiggled her foot experimentally, then broke into a delighted smile.

"It really doesn't hurt anymore! Wow, you're amazing!"

The medical room doctor, who had inwardly mocked Qin Feng when he walked over, was stunned.

How could a sprain possibly be fixed?

That was nonsense!

But now, with just one forceful twist, it was actually healed!

Watching the girl put on her sock and shoe and carefully walk around, he was truly shocked.

How was this possible?

Soft tissue contusion and slight misalignment—even a miracle doctor couldn't restore that instantly!

"Alright, don't push it. Your ankle has soft tissue damage. I just temporarily realigned it to stop the pain."

Qin Feng smiled as he watched the girl happily walk back and forth, quickly stopping her.

"Rest well for a few days after you get back to school for full recovery. Otherwise it'll hurt again."

"Thank you, handsome!"

The girl stopped immediately and looked at Qin Feng gratefully.

Qin Feng went to the sink to wash his hands, then returned to Liu Yan'er's side.

Now that the injury was handled, next came the mediation with Nick.

When Qin Feng and the boyfriend arrived, there were five or six more people in the room, all with dark skin.

Four men and two women sat casually on chairs and the desk, laughing and chatting loudly.

But when Qin Feng and Liu Yan'er appeared, they all fell silent. The four men stared fixedly at Liu Yan'er while the two women gazed at Qin Feng, unable to look away.

What a beautiful girl!

What a handsome guy!

"Alright, everyone's here. We've reviewed the surveillance footage and understand the situation."

Two police officers entered and addressed both parties.

"These students are from Dongda University, visiting Zhujiang for tourism. They probably aren't familiar with our rules, so they accidentally bumped into you.

Since there's no real harm done, let's be magnanimous as citizens and let it go."

Then they turned to Nick, their expressions somewhat helpless.

"Can you understand Chinese?"

"My Chinese isn't very good, but I can understand."

"Good. I hope you'll follow the rules while in China. Queuing for tickets is the most basic standard of conduct, understand?

We won't penalize you this time—just a warning. Don't let it happen again."

The officers stood and waved at everyone.

"Alright, that's that. Stop making trouble. You've wasted enough time—everyone go about your business."

Qin Feng was speechless.

Such smooth fence-sitting—truly practiced.

The boyfriend grew angry again, jumping to his feet and pointing at Nick.

"They broke the rules and that's it? Why?! Not even an apology!"

"What do you want! Want to make more trouble?! Want to spend a few nights in a cell?"

The officer slammed the table, his expression stern.

"This was never a big deal. If you don't accept mediation, then file a formal complaint!"

Hearing this, the boyfriend's face flickered with fear—after all, they weren't even twenty yet.

After the officer's words, he could only back down reluctantly, though his eyes still burned with resentment.

Qin Feng said nothing. He stood and led Liu Yan'er out.

The boyfriend and girlfriend followed with their luggage.

Nick and his friends walked out of the mediation room still laughing and chatting, trailing behind them.

The young couple joined Qin Feng's group, approaching him.

"Thank you so much just now! Are you really a doctor?"

The boyfriend and girlfriend looked at Qin Feng curiously.

Qin Feng smiled and nodded.

They had just sat down when they noticed the same group boarding the same subway car, in the same compartment.

When that guy Nick kept glancing in their direction, the boyfriend shot him a hostile look but ignored him, feeling a knot of frustration in his chest.

About ten minutes later—

Nick actually got up with two of his friends and walked over.

"Hey, how about that? Told you I wouldn't apologize to you."

Nick deliberately taunted the boyfriend.

"You people are trash!"

The boyfriend spat contemptuously.

"What did you say?"

Hearing this, Nick's expression darkened. He demanded coldly,

"You insulted our skin color. You need to apologize to us!"

"Apologize? Haha, why should I apologize to you."

The boyfriend sneered and looked away, ignoring him.

Nick's eyes flashed with malice, then turned to the girl beside the boyfriend.

"Miss, does your foot still hurt? I study medicine at Dongda. I could take a look for you."

He crouched down, reaching for her foot.

"Don't touch me!"

The girl immediately recoiled, shrinking back.

"What are you doing?!"

The boyfriend finally lost it. He reached out and shoved Nick's shoulder hard, sending him to the floor.

Before he could react, the two friends behind Nick pointed at him and rushed forward, shoving him roughly.

Then a foot drove into the boyfriend's stomach, sending him crashing down.

The three foreigners swarmed him, spouting incomprehensible gibberish, raising their hands to strike.

"What are you doing?! Stop hitting him!"

The girl reached out anxiously to intervene, but one of them grabbed her wrist and yanked hard, pulling her toward him.

The chaos erupted so suddenly that even the other passengers hadn't processed what was happening.

By the time they reacted, many started moving to adjacent cars, unwilling to get involved.

These were foreigners!

Of course, a few young men looked ready to act, but seeing that no one was being seriously beaten, they remained hesitant.

Just as the girl was about to fall into the foreigner's arms, her face pale with terror while he wore a triumphant grin—

A hand suddenly appeared on her shoulder, stopping her fall.

The foreigner found his prize snatched away and immediately glared at the intruder.

Qin Feng's lips curved slightly as he spoke two words.

The foreigner apparently didn't understand and paused. Then he pointed at the boyfriend pinned on the ground by the other two and threatened,

"Mind your own business. He started it."

"Haha! You think I'm blind—who gave you the courage?"

Qin Feng laughed coldly, his eyes narrowing.

"This one still owes an apology. Looks like I'll have to beat it out of him."

"Fuck! You need a spanking!"

The foreigner stepped right up to him, arrogantly raising his hand to strike.

Qin Feng's expression sharpened. His fist clenched and shot out like lightning.

The next second, the man who was half a head taller than him rolled his eyes back and crashed heavily to the floor, unconscious.

The onlookers stared in shocked disbelief!

Meanwhile, Nick and his other friend, who had been pinning the boyfriend down and spitting on his face, suddenly noticed their companion collapsed before them. They froze.

Looking up at Qin Feng, who was watching them with a faint smile, their faces filled with rage.

They'd been here so long and had never seen a local dare to fight back!

"You're courting death!"

The two stood and charged at Qin Feng.

Liu Yan'er sat nearby, clutching her clothes nervously.

But she knew she couldn't interfere and make things worse. Qin Feng had already told her and Zhang Fan not to move!

Qin Feng wasn't afraid to act—because he had nothing to fear!

The power behind him wasn't something these losers could challenge!

As long as no one died and his reasons were justified, it didn't matter how hard he hit.

But the bystanders didn't dare act. They knew that injuring foreigners meant trouble for themselves, and getting hurt by foreigners meant accepting bad luck.

The other foreigners watching from nearby saw their people go down and rushed over.

Qin Feng's gaze turned sharp. He'd already been displeased with how things were handled earlier.

Now they were being this arrogant in front of everyone? That had pushed him over the edge!

Fine then. He'd deal with them all at once.

Just as two fists were about to reach him, he shifted his stance, taking half a step back to dodge.

Then his body flowed forward, one hand a fist, the other a palm.

His fist slammed into another foreigner's side ribs. He felt the bones bend and crack before pulling back.

His palm struck Nick's throat, each blow targeting vital points.

The next instant, the foreigner's eyes went dark and he collapsed, while Nick's eyes bulged, his whole body seizing as his face went deathly pale.

Then his knees buckled. Clutching his throat, he dropped straight to his knees, mouth gaping as he gasped for air, unable to speak.

The last attacker hadn't even reached him before Qin Feng stepped forward and kicked out with full force.

The man's feet left the ground completely as he flew through the air, landing face-down on the floor, eyes rolling back as he passed out.

The two foreign women who'd been about to join in froze in their tracks, faces full of shock and fear.

"This is my place. Not your doghouse."

Qin Feng reached out, grabbed Nick's forehead, and lifted his face toward the young couple, his voice ice-cold.

"According to traditional Chinese rules, when you apologize, you kowtow!"
