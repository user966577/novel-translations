The boy's parents' expressions went rigid. By now, the implications were clear.

"What exactly happened? Please explain. Otherwise, I won't let you take my son."

The boy's father's demeanor turned cold.

"Sun Han used a so-called 'hero saves the beauty' act to trick Feng Juan into becoming his girlfriend. Then, despite her resistance and refusal, he had sexual relations with her and secretly recorded videos."

Qin Feng looked at him and gave a brief summary of the entire incident.

"How many years do you think your son deserves?"

With that, Qin Feng sneered at the heavyset man. Feng Juan's father stood nearby, eyes brimming with tears, barely containing his rage.

Hearing this, the heavyset man was also quite shocked. He turned and glared fiercely at his son.

Sun Han immediately averted his gaze, visibly flustered.

Before anyone could react, the heavyset man delivered a solid slap across the boy's face, then followed up with a kick that sent him sprawling.

"I worked my ass off raising you all these years, and this is what you do?!"

He rolled up his sleeves, face twisted with anger.

"Today I'm going to teach you a lesson!"

He grabbed Sun Han by the collar and slapped him several more times, leaving his face red and swollen, fingerprints clearly visible.

The force wasn't light—even his mouth was bleeding.

Yet Sun Han just lifted his head defiantly, biting his lip without making a sound.

"What are you doing?! Why are you hitting him so hard? He's our son!"

The woman shoved the man aside and yelled, then hugged Sun Han, gently touching his swollen cheek. She shot her husband a reproachful look.

"So what if he made a little mistake? Can't we sit down and talk? Did you have to be so rough?!"

"I'm sorry for the spectacle. Spare the rod, spoil the child. We failed in our parenting."

The man ignored her, pushed his son back to the ground, and turned to face Qin Feng and Feng Juan's father with an apologetic expression.

"Here's what I propose. If this is confirmed to be true, I'll first apologize to the victim. I'll discipline my son strictly—he'll never do this again!

As for this matter..."

He gestured toward the phones being backed up, his face full of ingratiating smiles.

"Can we discuss this privately? Keep it out of the legal system? Whatever compensation or requirements you have, we can negotiate. As long as both sides can accept the terms, I'm sure the children won't object either, right?"

Hearing this, Qin Feng couldn't help but smirk.

As expected of a businessman—even something like this could be turned into a price negotiation on the table.

Perhaps this was how many cases got settled with money in real life!

"How much do you think my daughter's life is worth?"

Feng Juan's father spoke up, his face dark as a storm.

"Well..."

The man paused, smiled awkwardly, and gestured toward him.

"You name it. As long as I can afford it, we can discuss everything."

"Bullshit! My daughter's life—no amount of money can buy it! You want to settle privately? Dream on!"

Feng Juan's father exploded, slamming his fist on the table.

"I'll make sure this little animal rots in prison! He'll pay for what he did to my daughter!"

"Mr. Feng, that's not very reasonable. They're still children. As parents, we should think about their futures."

The man's expression shifted, displeasure creeping in.

"If my son goes to prison, what good does that do your daughter? Besides, a girl's reputation is important. If word gets out, what will her future look like?

Mr. Feng, I suggest you reconsider. We could find another place to talk. This is a hospital, after all."

He grabbed his wife and headed for the door.

"Hey, hey, what are you doing? Our son is still here!"

The woman was confused, then called out.

The man spun around and slapped her across the face.

"Shut up!"

The woman clutched her cheek, stunned.

Just like that, she was dragged out of the conference room.

"Dad! Mom!"

Sun Han panicked. Though he was arrogant, facing this situation had shattered his composure.

No one had expected the man to be so decisive—abandoning his own son just like that?

He was definitely going to find a way to work the system and protect Sun Han.

Chen Dong returned with both phones and handed them to Qin Feng.

Qin Feng nodded and stood to give the phones to the officers.

"Officers, all the evidence is here. We've already made copies. Shortly, professional notaries will visit your station to certify the evidence. So please keep these safe. If anything goes wrong, I can't guarantee what will happen."

The two officers exchanged a glance, both seeing the gravity in each other's eyes.

That simple statement from Qin Feng carried enormous implications.

Not only had he preserved the evidence, but he was also having everything compared and notarized. Once notarized, even the most powerful person couldn't challenge every single copy.

Most critically—if anything happened to these two phones as physical evidence—

They would be held responsible!

This was essentially a restraint on authority!

The law is the law—impartial and unbiased!

What mattered most was that Qin Feng's identity was somewhat special. His personal involvement was going to make this case very complicated.

"Don't worry. We'll keep the evidence secure."

The officers nodded, then grabbed Sun Han to conduct a full investigation, including formal interview records.

Feng Juan's father would also need to accompany them to provide a detailed account.

As they reached the parking lot, Sun Han's parents were waiting at the entrance.

"My child! Oh, my poor baby!"

Seeing Sun Han being led out, the woman rushed over wailing, embracing him and crying.

"Son, take care of yourself. Mommy and Daddy will find a way to get you out! Don't admit anything—we'll get lawyers to protect you... Sob sob..."

Qin Feng stood right behind Sun Han. Everyone assumed the woman was crying too hard to speak clearly.

But he saw everything—her lips moving between sobs, every word captured.

'Don't admit anything. We'll get lawyers to protect you.'

Qin Feng's gaze turned icy, a cold curve forming at the corner of his mouth.

"Alright, that's enough."

The officers pried the woman off Sun Han and loaded him into the police car. Feng Juan's father got in too.

Just as the heavyset couple were about to get into their car and leave, Qin Feng grabbed the door handle.

The man paused and looked up at him, frowning.

"What do you want?"

"Hello. I'm Qin Feng, Director of the Transplant Center at Municipal First Hospital. May I ask Mr. Sun's full name and profession?"

"Sun Daqiang. Construction. Why do you ask, Director Qin?"

Sun Daqiang was startled, then quickly put on a smile—though wariness flickered in his eyes.

He had assumed Qin Feng was just some young doctor. He hadn't expected him to be a department director.

Now he remembered—this was the young medical prodigy who'd been all over the news lately.

"Nothing much. Just happened to hear what your wife whispered in Sun Han's ear."

Qin Feng smiled faintly and pointed at the woman.

"Your son did something monstrous, and you still want to protect him? I can't just stand by. This is my case now.

Care to make a bet?"

"What bet?"

Sun Daqiang's expression turned strange, his smile fading.

Qin Feng raised one hand in front of Sun Daqiang's face and said slowly:

"I'll make sure he serves at least five years!"

"You—! Hmph!"

Sun Daqiang's expression froze, then twisted with anger.

"You think a doctor can do that? Fine, let's see how this plays out!"

He slammed the door and drove off.

Qin Feng watched them leave in their Mercedes S450, eyes narrowing.

"Qin Feng, that was reckless. Do you know who Sun Daqiang is?"

Zhou Xianren approached, frowning, speaking quietly.

"Who?"

"He's one of the top three construction magnates in Jiang City. He holds multiple major city development contracts. His net worth is at least a billion—maybe more. He's a major player around here!"

"Interesting. The fat guy's got some pull!"

Qin Feng seemed somewhat surprised but nodded.

"That's why I said you were rash. He'll definitely throw money at saving his son. Sigh..."

Zhou Xianren shook his head.

Feng Juan's mother still didn't know. When she found out, she'd probably collapse.

Her daughter treated like that—how could any mother bear it?

But eventually she would have to know. That would wait until Feng Juan's father returned.

Only the two of them could support each other through this.

"Director Zhou, head back. Don't worry about this. Put Feng Juan under my care—I'll be her primary physician."

Qin Feng thought for a moment.

"You really want to get involved in this?"

Zhou Xianren's frown deepened.

"What if—"

"Relax. I never take on anything I'm not sure about."

"Fine. Let me know if you need anything. I'll help however I can."

He patted Qin Feng's shoulder and left.

Qin Feng's expression shifted. He turned to Chen Dong and Lin Xiaoxiao.

"Contact the capital law firm. Have them send their best team for this type of case. Once they agree to take it, we must win!

This kind of juvenile scum needs to be crushed before it spreads!"

"Got it. I'll reach out now."

Chen Dong nodded solemnly.

Actually, three months ago, the system had awarded him a massive bundle of rewards.

Among them was a partnership with one of the top three law firms in the capital!

This was a firm with a terrifying track record—an unbroken winning streak nationwide.

If Tencent's legal team combined with local resources was called "Guaranteed Win," then Tianhong was the kind that could flip any case with even a sliver of evidence.

Instantly, his biggest concern—legal protection for his future medical foundation and businesses—was solved.

Yet the first time he'd deploy them was for a patient...

Perhaps that was its own kind of tragedy—

Two days later—

Feng Juan had woken long ago, but her body couldn't handle the exam. Through anguished tears, she missed the college entrance exam.

Her parents had been in torment. Qin Feng had offered help.

After tremendous mental suffering, the family of three finally withstood all of Sun Daqiang's threats and bribes.

It was Feng Juan's resolve that steeled her parents.

Even if they had to leave this city, they would fight for their daughter!

They would never let a criminal go unpunished!

In the end, they chose court, rejecting the 1.5 million yuan settlement.

"These lawyers are the nation's top specialists in juvenile and sexual assault cases. They'll handle everything from here."

Qin Feng gestured to the sharply dressed men and women beside him.

"Hello. We're from Tianhong Law Firm in the capital. Director Qin engaged us to take your case."

The lead middle-aged man addressed Feng Juan's family.

"Tian... Tianhong?"

Feng Juan's father stared in disbelief, stammering.

"You're really from Tianhong Law Firm?"

"Absolutely."
