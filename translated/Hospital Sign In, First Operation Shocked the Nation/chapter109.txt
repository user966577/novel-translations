Sleeping pills were sedative drugs that suppressed the cerebral cortex and central nervous system.

For those with sleep disorders, taking sleeping pills in appropriate doses could improve sleep quality and treat insomnia.

However, overdosing could cause memory loss as a side effect—and in severe cases, death.

Benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics were the most commonly used class of sedatives, sleep aids, and anti-anxiety medications in clinical practice.

Commercial sleeping pills generally had controlled safe dosages, so a normal person taking one or a few pills would at most experience severe drowsiness or mild poisoning.

But swallowing over 30 pills at once without timely discovery would lead to severe toxicity.

That was extremely dangerous!

Generally speaking, consuming large amounts of sleeping pills would cause multiple systemic reactions.

The respiratory and circulatory systems could fail—difficulty breathing, cyanosis, rapid blood pressure drop, accelerated heartbeat, and more.

Second, the nervous system would be attacked, leading to coma, convulsions, dilated pupils, and loss of light reflex.

Finally, toxic reactions would occur—complete muscle relaxation, loss of neural responses, erratic pupil dilation and contraction, and signs of life-threatening danger.

"Prepare for gastric lavage."

Zhou Xianren spoke urgently, then began examining the patient alongside Qin Feng.

Breathing was weak but normal.

Pupils showed clear light response, just somewhat sluggish.

No signs of muscle relaxation throughout the body, and neural reflexes were still intact.

"How long ago did the patient swallow the pills?"

Qin Feng asked urgently.

"According to her classmates, she left around 10:30. Based on our estimate, it's been nearly two hours."

"Two hours? That doesn't add up!"

Both Qin Feng and Zhou Xianren froze, exchanging puzzled looks.

Could the pills not have taken effect yet?

After two hours with such a large dose—

Under normal circumstances, a person would definitely have fallen into moderate or even severe poisoning, completely losing consciousness.

But this girl's reactions all appeared relatively normal.

No time to worry about that now. Treatment first.

For cases of sleeping pill ingestion, the approach was actually straightforward: elimination through gastric lavage.

If the sedative components had entered the bloodstream, things would be more complicated—blood dialysis would be required, drawing the blood out of the body for purification, removing the toxic components, then returning it.

Elimination also meant diuresis—IV fluids with large amounts of saline and glucose, plus diuretics to maximize the body's filtration.

As for gastric lavage, that was even simpler.

So the girl underwent blood tests, IV fluid diuresis, and simultaneous gastric lavage...

Given the situation, there was no need to wait for test results. The priority was to flush out the remaining medication in her stomach to prevent further harm.

Soon, some undigested pills were washed out of her stomach—visible as cloudy white particles.

"Hmm? Director Zhou, something's off about these pills."

Qin Feng noticed the white sediment and his expression turned curious.

"What is it?"

Zhou Xianren was still handling follow-up procedures and hadn't paid attention.

Hearing this, he looked up and immediately paused.

"Huh? Where did this sediment come from?"

"Let's wait for the test results."

Qin Feng looked at the foul-smelling, oddly colored wastewater, then at the girl on the bed, and mused aloud.

He had a pretty good idea what this was!

Where could a student possibly get dozens of sleeping pills?

Pharmacies were definitely out. Sleeping pills were prescription medications—you needed a hospital prescription and personal ID to purchase limited quantities.

Such a large amount for a student would immediately raise red flags.

So it definitely wasn't from a pharmacy.

If brick-and-mortar stores weren't an option, that left online shopping.

Combining the state of the pill sediment with the patient's currently stable vital signs—

She probably bought counterfeit pills...

Half an hour later, a nurse from the lab came running to the ER resuscitation room with the blood and urine test results.

"Director Zhou, Director Qin, the results are in. The patient has mild benzodiazepine poisoning. Her condition is relatively stable."

The moment she finished speaking, everyone was stunned.

This was from over thirty sleeping pills!

"The patient likely bought counterfeit pills. The central nervous system depressant content was far below normal sleeping pill dosage, which is why this happened."

Qin Feng took the report and explained with a slight smile.

"Mm, that's probably it."

Zhou Xianren also came to the same realization and nodded in agreement, letting out a sigh of relief.

Thank goodness for fake pills. If they'd been real, even if they saved her life after two hours, there would definitely be some irreversible neurological damage.

And tomorrow was the college entrance exam!

The girl's teacher had arrived at the hospital with the patient's phone. Her parents had also been contacted.

The girl was moved to a ward to rest. An IV drip would help flush the remaining sedatives from her system. She'd probably wake up by evening.

Just as Qin Feng was about to leave, the girl's phone suddenly rang.

The female teacher who had come was outside taking a call. The girl's parents hadn't arrived yet.

Qin Feng looked around, then walked over and picked up the still-vibrating phone from the bedside. The caller ID showed only two characters.

Seeing the name, he immediately grew alert and glanced at the girl on the bed.

He realized this was probably the culprit!

He grabbed the phone and headed toward the restroom, signaling Zhao Yitian and the nurses to stay quiet.

"Huh? Who are you? Where's Feng Juan?"

The voice on the other end seemed confused upon hearing a man's voice, then immediately turned hostile.

"Why are you looking for her? She's with me right now."

Qin Feng deliberately made his voice sound strange.

"Who are you?"

"Fuck! I'm her boyfriend! Who the fuck are you?"

"You're her boyfriend?"

Hearing this, Qin Feng immediately became more vigilant and shouted loudly.

"I'm her boyfriend! Who the hell are you?! What class are you in? You wanna fight?!"

"What class are you in? I'm bringing people over right now, you believe that?"

The boy on the phone also exploded, sneering with threats.

"Touch my woman? Looks like you don't want to take the college entrance exam!"

"You're pretty bold, huh? Bragging without any backup? Come fight me. I dare you."

By now, Qin Feng was certain of one thing: the caller was a male student from the same school as the patient, and he had some kind of unspeakable relationship with the girl.

It even made him think of something unpleasant!

After all, nobody would save their boyfriend's contact name as "Devil."

"Tell me what class you're in! I'm coming over right fucking now!"

The boy raged on the phone.

"You eat too many energy drinks or something? Why are you so loud?"

Qin Feng held the phone away from his ear and retorted helplessly.

"I'll give you 10 minutes. Bring as many people as you want. The plaza across from the school gate. If you've got the guts, show up!"

He hung up directly.

That was how to provoke someone!

He couldn't let the other party realize he was being tricked. By cutting the call while the boy was at peak fury, he'd have nowhere to vent his rage and would completely lose his rationality.

After hanging up, Qin Feng walked out and found everyone staring at him like he was some rare species.

"Why are you all looking at me like that?"

"I've never heard you curse before. Were you just trading insults with whoever was on the phone?"

Zhao Yitian looked amazed.

"I need to step out. Take care of her."

Qin Feng turned and quickly left, driving away from the hospital straight toward Second High School.

He hoped news of Feng Juan's suicide hadn't spread yet. If the other party learned she'd swallowed sleeping pills, he might realize what was happening.

So Qin Feng gave him only 10 minutes—as little reaction time as possible.

He had his reasons for doing this!

Since the girl wasn't even afraid of death, yet hadn't told anyone why she wanted to kill herself—

That could only mean one thing: she was terrified.

If she was terrified, would she talk when she woke up?

Maybe. Maybe not. Or maybe she'd try to kill herself again.

This wasn't an isolated case, especially among teenagers going through puberty.

So Qin Feng needed to confirm first whether this boyfriend saved as "Devil" was actually the culprit.

He arrived outside Second High School and noticed a group of thirty or forty people gathered in the small plaza across the street.

Some wore the Second High uniform, others didn't. Yellow hair, purple hair, green hair... all kinds of characters.

"Ha. Quite the turnout."

He parked at the school gate and pulled an acupuncture kit from the center console, slipping it into his pocket.

Acupuncture wasn't just for healing. It could also make people tell the truth—

He crossed the street to the plaza. Twenty or thirty teenagers glanced at him, looking somewhat surprised.

This guy was seriously handsome!

Qin Feng spotted several of them squatting on the corridor seats, cigarettes dangling from their mouths.

He walked over and stood in front of them, smiling.

"Who the hell are you?"

One yellow-haired kid arrogantly sized him up.

"You're too young to smoke. Put it out."

Qin Feng shook his head, reached out, and lightning-fast plucked the cigarette from between the kid's fingers.

"Holy shit! You—"

"I have a question for you. Who's Feng Juan's boyfriend?"

The teenager started cursing and tried to stand, but Qin Feng's hand pressed down on his shoulder. He couldn't move an inch.

"That's me!"

Just then, a voice came from nearby.

Qin Feng turned to see a guy about 1.83 meters tall, Second High uniform draped over his arm, standing there with a cocky, slouched posture.

The boy was decent-looking—angular features, the handsome-delinquent type. He had a buzz cut and an earring.

He looked like one of those characters from old Hong Kong or Taiwanese school romance dramas: bad grades, bad temper, but with a bit of roguish charm.

"Who are you?"

The boy approached, looking him up and down curiously.

"Forgot? We just talked on the phone."

Qin Feng smiled faintly and nodded at him.

"I'm Feng Juan's other boyfriend. You must be the Devil?"

"What devil?"

The boy paused, then his face twisted with anger. He threw his uniform on the ground and shoved Qin Feng hard.

"Fuck! So it was you! Stealing my girlfriend? Don't you know who I am? Get him!"

As soon as he finished, Qin Feng saw the surrounding teenagers rushing toward him. He immediately raised his hand to stop them.

"I suggest you think carefully. I'm just here to ask you a few questions. Don't be so impulsive."

"Ask my ass!"

The boy lunged forward, swinging a fist straight at Qin Feng's face. But Qin Feng didn't move an inch. His pupils contracted sharply, instantly locking onto the incoming fist.

Then he simply adjusted his angle and took the punch head-on—without even flinching.

Qin Feng felt a stinging heat on his face. His expression turned cold.

"What did you just say?!"

He stared at the boy, his voice dripping with ice, his eyes sharp as an eagle's, piercing straight to the boy's heart.

"You... Brothers, get him!"

Looking into those eyes, the boy couldn't help but shudder. They were terrifying!

He waved his hand, signaling the surrounding teenagers to swarm him.

"Fine then. This is self-defense."

A strange smile crept across Qin Feng's lips as he murmured softly.

Smack! Smack! Thud!

These kids were in terrible shape physically.

The first two or three to rush him didn't even have time to react before two palms came flying. Their vision blurred, and they went spinning through the air.

The one in front took a kick to the shin and dropped straight to his knees in front of Qin Feng, howling in pain.

If Qin Feng had followed up with a knee strike, the kid probably would have gone into shock with a cerebral hemorrhage, or at least suffered a serious concussion.

But he wasn't that vicious. He just kicked the boy aside.

This was the first time Qin Feng had gone all out using his mixed martial arts skills. Combined with his super vision, he could see everyone's movements in slow motion.

Something he had just discovered: when his pupils contracted and stretched, everyone's movements appeared to slow down by at least five times!

Meaning a punch that should have reached him in one second looked like it took five seconds in his eyes.

His reaction speed had matched accordingly.

So even though these kids outnumbered him, they'd had the misfortune of running into the freak that was Qin Feng.

The plaza echoed with wails and cries of pain. The commotion quickly drew attention.

Passersby pulled out their phones to record. One against thirty-plus—this scene could only be described in two words.
