"Doctor, please save us!"

The two young men saw the complicated, shocked expression on Zhao Yitian's face and pleaded, looking like they were about to cry.

"We don't want to die! It's all that bitch's fault! Please, save us!"

Hearing this, Zhao Yitian couldn't help but glance at Qin Feng beside him.

Qin Feng's lips curled into a mocking sneer.

Calling them deserving wasn't unfair at all!

They had set out to be predators, only to become prey themselves.

Now that they realized there was no undoing what had happened, they wanted to live—while cursing the other party. Unbelievable.

He even suspected that if these two really did have AIDS, they might deliberately infect others just like that woman had.

Although technically they were victims, their disgusting behavior left him with zero sympathy.

"The confirmation period for AIDS transmission is four to six weeks. It's too early to determine whether you've been infected, so don't panic just yet."

Qin Feng stepped forward and addressed them.

"Also, I suggest you stay put during this time and buy home test kits to check yourselves. If confirmed positive, you can go to the CDC to get post-exposure prophylaxis medication. You should be fine."

Even so, the two young men's faces were still filled with terror. After all, this was a terminal illness!

"Oh, and one more thing—don't have any sexual activity during this period. Otherwise, it will accelerate the severity of your condition and could even kill you.

Got it?"

Qin Feng added. Zhao Yitian was stunned.

What did he mean?

That wasn't how AIDS worked!

"Okay, okay. We... we understand."

The two nodded, their faces twisted in misery as they prepared to stand.

Qin Feng pressed them back down, his tone serious.

"Hold on. There's one more thing I need your help with, so you can't leave yet."

Then, under everyone's puzzled gazes, he pulled out his phone and dialed 110.

"This is Municipal First Hospital. We've just admitted two patients who may have been infected with HIV. I suspect someone is maliciously spreading AIDS, seriously endangering public safety."

The moment he said this, the two young men's bodies jolted. Their faces changed dramatically, and they tried to leap to their feet.

But before they could even lift their backsides off the chairs, they felt a tremendous force pin them firmly down.

"If you don't cooperate, do you know how many years you get for rape?

We have your information on file. You won't get far."

Both men trembled slightly, their expressions turning ugly as they sat back down.

They were clearly scared!

About ten minutes later—

The police arrived. At their request, the two men lured the woman out.

She was immediately arrested, and a blood test confirmed she really did have AIDS!

After a brief interrogation, she revealed that she too had been infected during a moment of reckless abandon—by a man she'd met at a nightclub. At the time, she'd even considered jumping off a building.

But then she thought better of it. Why should these disgusting men get off easy?

Since you showed no mercy to me, don't blame me for showing none to you!

She was fairly attractive with a nice figure, and combined with her despair toward life—

She began spending her days drinking at nightclubs, sleeping with different men. It had been nearly three months now.

Knowingly infected, she had transmitted the virus to at least close to a hundred people!

When Qin Feng heard this from the police, he was speechless.

Originally, AIDS was an extremely rare blood disease transmitted primarily through saliva, bodily fluids, and blood—especially through same-sex or heterosexual relations.

China had over 800,000 people living with HIV/AIDS!

This number included patients in the early stage, asymptomatic stage, and late stage of AIDS. Among them, over 80,000 were in the late stage.

These patients often exhibited obvious clinical symptoms along with various opportunistic bacterial infections and tumors, putting their lives at significant risk.

As people's attitudes toward sex became increasingly liberal, public awareness hadn't kept pace with social progress.

Add to that the proliferation of temptations and the rebelliousness of self-centered individualism, and the disease's spread only accelerated.

HIV infection rates were climbing year after year. The situation was extremely dire!

If not controlled in time—if high-risk patients weren't restrained and treated—it could lead to continuous large-scale transmission.

Currently, there was no cure for AIDS anywhere in the world. The only options were early detection, early intervention, and medication to manage it.

But mating was a basic biological instinct. Unable to eliminate the root cause meant the risk would always exist.

This was an unsolvable problem!

One could only hope that society's dregs would be fewer, and that before AIDS spread on a massive scale, the medical field would have more time.

Modern medicine faced too many challenges!

The evolution of diseases had outpaced medical technology by decades. So some illnesses truly weren't the doctor's fault for being unable to cure.

Reality was just that cruel!

"Qin Feng, how did you think of this?"

After the matter was settled, Zhao Yitian looked at him curiously.

"Don't you find that kind of behavior disgusting?"

Qin Feng shook his head with a faint smile, asking in return.

"Yeah, it's disgusting. But those two guys—aren't you worried they'll go spread it to others?"

Qin Feng's expression froze, somewhat helpless.

"There's nothing I can do about that."

Zhao Yitian was momentarily speechless, unable to argue.

Second High School—

In the third-floor dormitory of the senior girls' building—

A girl named Feng Juan hid under her covers, the phone screen illuminating her face, which was filled with fear and dread.

She stared at the messages from a boy's profile picture, trembling all over.

'You're my girlfriend now. You have to go to the same university as me. Wherever I go, you go!'

'So what if you get good grades? Don't forget I still have your photos.'

'If you dare leave me, I'll post the photos on the school forum immediately. What chance will you have then?'

'And you know what I'm capable of. Unless your family moves away, I can find you anywhere in Jiang City!'

'Be good. I'll definitely treat you well. Just fill out the application form I sent you.'

Reading this, Feng Juan's tears fell uncontrollably. She clamped her hand over her mouth to keep from making a sound.

Her mind kept replaying her parents' scolding, her teachers' disgust, her classmates' mockery—and that filthy face.

If her photos were really exposed, she wouldn't just be ruined. Her mom and dad would be humiliated too.

How could they go on living?

And it was all because of her one moment of impulse!

If she hadn't been curious, if she hadn't fallen for his persistent warmth and attention, she wouldn't have given in on the eve of the college entrance exam.

What she got in return was threats and despair!

Her mind went blank. She felt like her life had reached its end.

She opened Taobao and found a store selling sleeping pills that didn't require ID registration.

Customer service said the potency was guaranteed—one pill and you'd sleep for a day.

Feng Juan placed her order—

Three days later—

The night before the college entrance exam—

Feng Juan carried the package to her dormitory, grabbed a bottle of water, and ran to the storage room. She locked the door behind her.

Then she tore open the package and poured all the pills into her palm. At least twenty or thirty of them!

Looking at the sleeping pills in her hand, she couldn't help but tremble. She was scared.

Just then, her phone suddenly vibrated.

She pulled it out and saw the caller ID. The struggle in her eyes immediately turned to dull gray, and a bitter, relieved smile crossed her face.

"Zuo Ran, you'll never threaten me again."

With that, she shoved all the pills into her mouth and frantically gulped down water.

Glug, glug—

She struggled to swallow all the sleeping pills, then collapsed against the wall, her whole body going limp. She jabbed the reject button hard.

Then she opened her messages and began typing—

Municipal First Hospital, Jiang City—

In the cafeteria, Qin Feng's leave had finally ended. Today he was back to work.

At lunchtime, he sat down with Deputy Director Tang Dandan and several other doctors.

Since it was mealtime, the place was packed with medical staff. In an instant, the tables around him filled up.

"Director Qin, back from vacation?"

"Director Qin, haven't seen you in a while! Still as handsome as ever!"

"Director Qin, is the Transplant Center hiring nurses? Can I transfer?"

"Director Qin, you go first. Whatever you want, my treat!"

Warm greetings came from all directions.

"Hello everyone. Yes, yes that's right. Sure, we can arrange that. Haha! You look lovely today too."

Qin Feng smiled and responded to each of them.

He was just that popular. Nothing he could do about it!

"Auntie, I'll have the tomato and eggs."

The cafeteria lady saw him and broke into a smile. She grabbed a large ladle, scooped generously, then deliberately shook it so the tomatoes fell off.

A heaping bowl of eggs!

The other staff stared in disbelief—

Was this really the same Parkinson's-afflicted lunch lady?

After Qin Feng walked off with his bowl of eggs, a young doctor from Internal Medicine stepped up and ordered the same thing.

The lady's smile vanished. She scooped up a ladle, gave her wrist a light flick, and two pieces of egg fell back into the tray.

Then she handed it over.

The young doctor looked at his bowl, then at Qin Feng's, and nearly burst into tears of frustration.

"Why does he get so many eggs while mine is all tomatoes?!"

"That's what Dr. Qin deserves. I gave him quadruple eggs, on me. Got a problem with that?"

The lady waved her ladle, completely unapologetic.

"You... you! I'm going to file a complaint!"

The young doctor fumed, indignant.

"Go ahead! If you had even one-tenth of Director Qin's looks, medical skills, or character... I'd give you eggs too!"

He felt like he'd just taken ten thousand points of critical damage!

If not for his last shred of masculine dignity, he probably would have burst into tears right there!

It really was maddening to compare yourself to others!

Why did being handsome and skilled mean you got to eat better?

When would ugly guys ever get to stand tall?!

Just as Qin Feng finished getting his food, he saw ER Director Zhou Xianren and Dr. Xiao Jing walking over.

"Director Zhou! Here for lunch?"

"Qin Feng, haha let me see what you're eating. Wow! That's quite a spread!"

Zhou Xianren approached with a smile, eyeing Qin Feng's tray piled high with food, a hint of envy in his expression.

"Go get yours. We'll eat together."

After they sat down, Cardiothoracic Director Zhang Fan joined them, then the ENT director, then the Internal Medicine deputy director...

Everyone who saw Qin Feng came over to say hello and then sat down with their trays.

In an instant, Qin Feng's table became the exclusive dining spot for department heads of Municipal First Hospital.

Ring ring ring—

Just as they began eating, Zhou Xianren's phone suddenly rang.

He instinctively pulled it out with lightning speed.

"This is Zhou Xianren."

"Director Zhou, we have an emergency! The situation is serious. Please come take a look."

On the phone, Zhao Yitian briefly explained.

"Good! I'm on my way!"

Zhou Xianren shot to his feet and started running for the exit.

"Director Zhou, what happened?"

Qin Feng quickly asked.

"A student swallowed a large amount of sleeping pills in a suicide attempt. Critical condition."

Zhou Xianren only had time for that one sentence before he dashed out of the cafeteria.

Qin Feng frowned. This didn't sound good!

"I'll go take a look too."

He stood and followed after Zhou Xianren.

Meanwhile, the ER was rushing the female student into the resuscitation room, preparing emergency measures.

By the time Zhou Xianren arrived with Qin Feng close behind, Zhao Yitian was already swamped.

"What happened?"

"A female student from Second High School swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills in a storage room—over thirty pills!"

Zhou Xianren and Qin Feng were both stunned!

Their faces changed dramatically!

Over 30 sleeping pills—that could be fatal!
