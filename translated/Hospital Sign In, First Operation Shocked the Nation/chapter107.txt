Life in a nightclub was always dazzling, dripping with excess.

Qin Feng and the others ordered a few bottles of champagne and beer, watching the young people on the massive dance floor shaking their heads wildly to the pounding DJ beats.

He couldn't help but smile—

On the dance floor, plenty of girls dressed scantily, showing off fair skin and bare backs. The atmosphere crew on the elevated platforms around them wore matching JK skirts, stimulating everyone's senses.

Men both young and older gravitated toward the women, and those who caught their eye would take their hands or drape an arm around their shoulders to dance together.

There were even some who looked quite young, perhaps only teenagers, dancing under the flashing lights.

"Come on! Let's have a drink!"

Shen Yuan picked up a bottle of Ace of Spades champagne, poured everyone a glass, and raised his in a toast.

They clinked glasses and drained them in one go.

Perhaps because of the champagne package they'd ordered—three expensive bottles lit up by spotlights from below, extremely eye-catching—they had attracted quite a few curious gazes, especially from women!

But the dim lighting prevented them from seeing Qin Feng's face clearly. Otherwise, they would have swarmed him already.

Just then, three or four beautiful women in spaghetti-strap dresses were led to their booth.

Qin Feng gave them a quick once-over. Not bad.

He nodded, indicating they could sit down. But all the girls immediately tried to get close to him.

The moment they saw Qin Feng's face, they were stunned by his looks. Their eyes practically glowed!

It was as if they saw him as a little lamb they wanted to devour whole!

Plus, the server had mainly addressed Qin Feng, so this was clearly his show.

But Qin Feng knew places like this all too well. His lips curved slightly as he looked at the girls and pointed to the side, indicating they should sit elsewhere.

Their looks might seem impressive to others, but to him?

Setting aside appearance, Liu Yan'er alone could crush everyone here. And when it came to substance, all his friends were top graduates from prestigious medical schools.

These hostesses?

They were here to relax, not to hook up.

"You're so handsome!"

The girl beside him stared at him intently, poured a drink for both of them, and placed the glass in his hand, speaking excitedly.

Qin Feng lifted his glass slightly in acknowledgment, then downed it.

Soon, after the girls had each toasted him, they all tried to crowd closer to Qin Feng.

Meanwhile, Shen Yuan, Chen Dong, and the others found themselves ignored.

They exchanged glances, suddenly feeling a twinge of regret.

Why had they brought this guy along?

After drinking for a while, Shen Yuan and Liu Jian went to dance on the floor. Shang Xiaojun and Chen Dong remained seated, shouting into each other's ears over the music.

The four girls had surrounded Qin Feng in the middle, drinking with him while their hands started wandering.

His brow furrowed slightly. He waved them off.

The four girls froze, then reluctantly moved away.

This handsome guy was so cold!

Qin Feng stood up, walked onto the dance floor, and joined Shen Yuan and Liu Jian.

The atmosphere here was actually quite nice. The past few days had been stressful, and this was a good way to let loose.

Just then, a tall, striking woman approached him on her own.

What a beauty!

Coffee-colored wavy hair, an oval face, big eyes, elegant brows, a pert nose, slightly upturned lips, and a neck as white as jade.

A pair of long, toned legs so pale they seemed to glow, carrying their owner through constantly changing dance moves. Legs like that—the kind you couldn't get tired of in three years—must look something like this.

He estimated the girl was around 20 years old, about 173 centimeters tall. She wore a tight black halter top.

Her back was held together by just a few thin straps, leaving her flawless skin almost entirely exposed.

The halter stopped just above her chest, the fabric stretched over two rounded peaks. Her bare shoulders looked as though they were carved by a knife—perfect, without a hint of excess. Her slender waist was adorned only by a small, delicate belly button.

The girl's features were extremely alluring. As she danced, those peaks rose and fell with her rhythm, tracing curves that could drive any man to sin.

When this girl saw Qin Feng's face, she was also quite surprised—then her eyes flashed with wild delight.

She deliberately moved closer, her seductive eyes like autumn waves, as if trying to get intimate.

She wasn't Qin Feng's type.

As a doctor, you could visit places like this, but you absolutely couldn't mess around!

The risk level was way too high!

When the girl noticed that Qin Feng didn't seem interested in her, her eyes flashed with annoyance. She even looked herself over.

Was she not attractive enough?

The other men around them were practically breathing fire. After all, this girl had shown no interest in them.

Now she was throwing herself at Qin Feng, and he actually looked reluctant?

But all they could do was seethe in silence, because Qin Feng was simply too handsome!

His looks alone crushed every other man in the place combined!

They just felt... sour—

After dancing for a while, Qin Feng and his friends returned to their booth. By the time they'd finished their drinks, it was 2 AM. They grabbed their jackets and prepared to leave.

Chen Dong was about to pay, but Qin Feng stopped him and handed his bank card to the server.

The night's tab came to over 30,000 yuan—

The others clicked their tongues in amazement. They were all graduates from the same year, yet Qin Feng was already making hundreds of thousands a year.

Meanwhile, they were still earning a few thousand a month. Comparing yourself to others really could make you sick with envy.

As they walked out the front door, everyone had been drinking. Only Qin Feng had driven.

"I called a designated driver. They'll take you guys home in a bit."

Qin Feng pulled out his phone. His Porsche Panamera was a five-seater—just right.

Shen Yuan and the other two didn't object and nodded in agreement.

While they waited for the driver, they noticed a scantily-clad woman slumped over a public bicycle not far from the club entrance, vomiting.

She seemed dazed and barely conscious, but her exposed figure and features still drew second glances.

Standing next to her were two young men with dyed yellow hair, smoking cigarettes. They kept looking at the girl, then glancing around.

One of them walked over, put his arm around the girl's back, patted it gently, then leaned down and said something to her.

The girl shook her head, her half-closed eyes unclear whether she could even see. Then she closed them entirely, leaning against the man as if she'd lost consciousness.

The other young man brought a car around. They helped the girl inside, and in the blink of an eye, they were gone.

The group instantly understood what was happening. Good lord!

And these two seemed like old hands at this. They had waited for the girl to completely lose her judgment before putting her in the car.

"The world's really gone downhill!"

Shen Yuan couldn't help but shake his head. He'd seen this kind of thing even more often in Jinling.

Not only that, but some of these girls actually came alone and drank heavily specifically looking for this kind of thrill.

"When you find a girlfriend, make sure everything's open and transparent. Don't get burned."

Qin Feng patted his shoulder and teased.

"Not me. I already have someone I like."

Shen Yuan rolled his eyes and spoke proudly.

"Oh? Would that be our very own Qiu Ya? Hahaha!"

Liu Jian sidled over with a knowing smirk.

"Get out of here!"

After the driver arrived, they all left the club and headed home.

Qin Feng got back, showered, and found Liu Yan'er already fast asleep. He quietly slipped into the bedroom next door so as not to disturb her.

The next morning, when he opened his eyes, a soft figure had appeared in his arms—that familiar face right in front of him.

At some point, Liu Yan'er had crawled into his bed.

Municipal First Hospital, Jiang City—

Although Qin Feng still had two days of leave, he came to work as usual.

No assigned work couldn't stop him from finding things to do himself!

Qin Feng left his office and headed to one of the consultation rooms, where Zhao Yitian was on duty.

"Qin Feng! You're here!"

"Yeah, I'm on leave with nothing to do. Came to take a look. Don't mind me."

Zhao Yitian stood up happily. Qin Feng nodded and gestured for him to continue—there was still a patient waiting.

After seeing several patients, two young men walked in holding their queue number.

"D-doctor."

One of them spoke with a trembling voice, swallowing hard.

"What's the problem?"

Zhao Yitian took the slip and looked at the two of them.

"We want to... to get tested for..."

They glanced at each other, their expressions tense, fearful, and embarrassed.

But Qin Feng's eyes lit up with interest.

These two looked familiar!

Same dyed yellow hair, similar builds, similar faces.

Weren't these the two young men who had taken that drunk girl away from outside the club last night?

"Get tested? For what?"

Zhao Yitian frowned in confusion.

"You know... that thing."

The other one spoke up vaguely.

"What thing? This is the ER. If you want to get tested for that, you need to tell me what's going on first, then I'll refer you to Urology."

Zhao Yitian was getting exasperated looking at these two. How was he supposed to help if they wouldn't describe their symptoms?

"Here's the thing—we want to know if... if this place can test for AIDS?"

Finally, they managed to get the question out.

Qin Feng's eyebrow arched at the word.

What exactly had these two done last night?

And now they needed to get tested for AIDS.

Zhao Yitian also froze for a moment, immediately becoming alert. This was a serious disease!

"Tell me the specifics, then I'll arrange for testing."

One of the young men pulled out his phone and awkwardly placed it in front of them.

On the screen was a chat interface. It looked like they had just added each other as friends. The other person's profile picture showed a girl who looked rather pretty.

But the conversation made both Zhao Yitian and Qin Feng's jaws drop.

HH's Heart: 'Hey handsome!'

HH's Heart: 'Did you guys have fun last night?'

Handsome AF: 'Hey beautiful, are you free tonight? Let me buy you a drink.'

HH's Heart: 'Hehe, not tonight. But I do have some good news for you.'

Handsome AF: 'What good news?'

HH's Heart: 'Welcome to the AIDS club!'

HH's Heart: '(images of funeral shrouds, white chrysanthemums, and joss paper)'

Zhao Yitian sucked in a sharp breath of cold air.

The two young men before him had gone deathly pale.
