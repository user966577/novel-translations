Three hours later—

In the operating room, Xiaoxia's bone marrow transplant was complete. The next step was monitoring her immune system recovery in the sterile isolation chamber.

Qin Feng had also been moved to a ward to rest. After all, he'd had bone marrow extracted. Despite feeling fine thanks to his excellent physical condition, Hospital Director Zhang Tong had personally insisted that he take a few days to recuperate properly.

As for work, Deputy Director Tang Dandan and Director Ji Zhonghe would handle things together. They absolutely couldn't let anything happen to his health.

Since he couldn't argue his way out of it, Qin Feng stopped refusing and happily accepted the home leave.

When Chen Yuanfang and her husband learned what had happened, they were deeply moved. They specifically bought groceries and rushed over to his penthouse apartment to cook.

"Yan'er, dinner's almost ready. Help Xiao Qin up."

From outside the bedroom came Chen Yuanfang's warm voice.

Qin Feng looked helplessly at Liu Yan'er beside him, who was struggling to contain her laughter. He poked her waist with his finger.

"What are you laughing at?"

"I'm laughing that even you have days like this—lying in bed waiting to be fed."

Liu Yan'er playfully raised her eyebrows, clearly amused.

"Can you ask your parents to go home? They don't need to cook for me. I'm really fine."

Qin Feng covered his face and smiled wryly.

"It's no use if I say so. You'll have to prove it to them yourself."

Liu Yan'er shook her head, looking innocent.

Qin Feng looked her up and down, a mischievous smile spreading across his face.

"Well, you could help me prove it too."

"Me? How would I help prove it?"

Liu Yan'er was confused for a moment, but when she saw his mischievous grin, her face flushed red with indignation.

"You're such a scoundrel! You just had bone marrow extracted and you're still thinking about wearing me out? No way!

Get up and eat. My mom's calling again."

She smacked him hard, then got up and opened the bedroom door.

Qin Feng wanted to cry but had no tears. Looks like he'd have to rely on himself!

The dining table was covered with all his favorite dishes, plus a nourishing pigeon soup.

"Xiao Qin, we won't drink tonight. Eat more. Your aunt pulled out all her best cooking skills for this."

Liu Zheng smiled warmly at him.

The meal was filling. When he tried to help clean up, they stopped him.

At 1 AM, Liu Zheng and Chen Yuanfang left, leaving only Liu Yan'er and Qin Feng.

That night, he once again proved that he wasn't weak at all—in fact, he had plenty of energy.

Like an old-fashioned hand pump from thirty years ago, once started, there was no stopping.

Liu Yan'er believed him now—

The next day—

Qin Feng still went to the hospital. Liu Yan'er was also busy during summer break, preparing her graduation thesis, so she spent every day at home gathering materials.

He was genuinely bored. The research center in Jinling was running smoothly, and the Phase III clinical application had been approved. Human clinical trials would begin soon.

So Qin Feng could only come to the hospital to find something to do.

By now, Xiaoxia had woken up. Finding herself in a small, confined space felt somewhat oppressive.

But when Qin Feng appeared, she smiled.

"Director Qin, thank you! You're our family's great benefactor!"

The moment Xiaoxia's parents saw him, they rushed over to grasp his hands, both dropping to their knees, crying tears of joy.

"Please, don't. Xiaoxia is my patient. It's what I should do. Please, get up."

Qin Feng quickly helped them to their feet, speaking modestly.

But everyone knew the truth. Without Qin Feng, Xiaoxia would truly have been in grave danger.

Especially since Qin Feng hadn't told them about how Xiaoxia had nearly been abducted by human traffickers. Xiaoxia herself hadn't had a chance to mention it before the surgery.

It was Qin Feng who had driven all the way to Peng City and brought her back.

And it was his bone marrow that had saved her life!

Who knew if Xiaoxia could have held on until another perfect match was found?

"Xiaoxia, how are you feeling? Still in pain?"

Qin Feng looked through the glass at the girl lying in bed.

"Mm, a little."

Xiaoxia nodded obediently and answered softly.

"Focus on getting better. Twenty days of recovery and you'll be able to come out, understand?"

"I understand, Brother Qin Feng."

Qin Feng's face broke into a gratified smile. Based on current monitoring, although Xiaoxia's physiological indicators were slightly low, her overall condition was stable.

There wasn't even a hint of rejection, so no immunosuppressants had been prescribed.

This could only be described as extremely fortunate!

The success rate had to be at least 95 percent!

Back in his office—

All his work had been taken over by Tang Dandan and Ji Zhonghe. No matter how much he asked, they wouldn't give it back.

Otherwise, the director would scold them!

Qin Feng could only smile bitterly and give up. With nothing to do, he slumped over his desk.

He opened his phone and happened to see a group message notification pop up.

Shen Yuan: 'Hey everyone, I just arrived in Jiang City today. Only staying two days. Are you guys free tonight? Let's grab some drinks.'

This was a separate WeChat group that Shen Yuan had created. It had about six or seven guys—classmates who were doing their internships at various hospitals in Jiang City.

Liu Jian: 'Class monitor, why did you suddenly come back to Jiang City?'

Liu Jian: 'Tonight? I'd better hurry and finish these medical records first. I've got a huge pile! Ugh...'

Chen Dong: 'Shen Yuan's back? I'm free, but let me check with Xiaoxiao first.'

Chen Dong: 'Qin Feng, I swear I haven't been slacking at work. What about you? Can you come out?'

Shang Xiaojun: 'Director Qin, I heard you donated bone marrow to save a child? Is that true?'

Zhao Chongnan: 'Wait, what? Looks like I'm out of the loop. Director Qin is amazing!'

Shen Yuan: 'Qin Feng, I left Jiang City in such a hurry last time that I never got to properly thank you with a meal. Are you free tonight? I'll wait for you after work!'

Liu Jian: 'I'll wait too! Hahaha! Director Qin, you have to come!'

Shang Xiaojun: 'Me too. Qin Feng is the most impressive graduate of our year. I need some of that good luck to rub off on me.'

Zhao Chongnan: 'Perfect timing—I've got a case I can't figure out. Got chewed out for it today. Director Qin and the great Shen from Jinling can help me analyze it later, please!'

Qin Feng couldn't help but chuckle at the group chat.

After thinking about it, he replied.

Qin Feng: 'I'm on break these days with nothing to do. Tonight I'll wait for Class Monitor Shen to make arrangements! Count me in!'

Seeing this, Shen Yuan was thrilled and immediately replied.

Shen Yuan: 'Great! I'll handle it then. All six of us will have some drinks and catch up tonight!'

Shen Yuan: 'I'll send the location to the group later. 8 PM, be there or be square.'

After that, everyone chatted for a bit more before getting back to their own business.

Medicine wasn't a profession where you could slack off or daydream. Every patient you faced demanded your full attention. Even a single wrong letter on a medical record could lead to serious consequences.

That's why the profession demanded such high standards.

And for four-year undergraduate students like them, unlike most other professions where you just worked after graduation—

You had to pursue a master's degree!

You had to pursue a doctorate!

Medicine was a field dealing with life itself!

It touched upon spirituality, science, and revolutionary significance at a level far beyond what ordinary people could comprehend.

So relatively speaking, making it into a top-tier medical school, completing undergraduate, master's, and doctoral studies, was extraordinarily difficult.

Some even lost their hair before graduating—

Yet even eight-year combined bachelor's-master's-PhD clinical students were only taking their first step upon graduation.

As for a mere bachelor's degree?

Trash!

The kind hospitals didn't even want!

After graduation, everyone was preparing for graduate school entrance exams, working hard and pushing toward top institutions!

After completing a master's, those with the ability would continue to pursue doctorates. By the time they finished their PhD, most would be at least 27 or 28 years old.

Medical students had it rough... (╥﹏╥) Sob!

With nothing else to do, Qin Feng wandered over to the Cardiothoracic Surgery department to chat with Director Zhang Fan and Deputy Director Cao Ke, and gave some pointers to the doctors under them on a few cases.

Then he stopped by Obstetrics and Gynecology, joking around with the female doctors and nurses, making the young women giggle non-stop.

He even helped Dr. Xu Yingying handle a patient. When the patient saw this handsome guy, her eyes went wide and she forgot all about her pain.

Next was Internal Medicine, where he chatted casually with Director Sun Sheng and discussed cases with Director Cheng Hongwu.

Zhang Chen walked into the office, surprised and delighted to see Qin Feng there.

"Director Qin! I haven't seen you since you left Internal Medicine. I've got a tricky patient right now—could you give me some pointers?"

"Director Cheng is right here. It wouldn't be appropriate for me."

Qin Feng gestured awkwardly toward Cheng Hongwu.

"Director Qin, are you mocking me?"

Cheng Hongwu's expression froze, and he muttered unhappily.

"How about I ask on Zhang Chen's behalf?"

"No, no! I'll go, I'll go! Hahaha! Just kidding, just kidding."

Qin Feng quickly stood up, laughed awkwardly, and left the office with Zhang Chen.

Cheng Hongwu clicked his tongue in amazement.

"Old Sun, Qin Feng really is a monster! That case I'd been puzzling over for two weeks—he cracked it in just a few sentences. I can't imagine how he does it."

"Heh heh heh. I got used to it a long time ago. You'll get used to it too."

Sun Sheng smiled and shook his head casually.

"Back then, if Director Zhang hadn't spotted his talent immediately and done everything possible to keep him here, Qin Feng would probably be working in the capital by now.

Mark my words—in the future, Qin Feng will definitely go down in medical history."

Cheng Hongwu fell silent for a moment before replying.

"Times make heroes. Besides extraordinary medical skills, he'll also need the right opportunity to let this golden carp transform into a dragon!"

"We'll see."

After finishing in the ER, it was finally time to clock out.

This was the first time Qin Feng had visited every department in the entire hospital. He'd even chatted with the ENT department for a while.

He decided to pick up Chen Dong first and head to meet Shen Yuan. They could chat for a bit since they hadn't seen each other in so long, and then have dinner together once everyone else arrived.

Around 9 PM, all six of them finally gathered.

They had a happy dinner and chatted for a while. Before they knew it, it was almost midnight.

"Do you guys have plans after this?"

Liu Jian, tall and thin with somewhat handsome features, looked around and asked.

"Nothing for me. I've got work tomorrow."

"Me neither."

Except for Zhao Chongnan, both Shen Yuan and Shang Xiaojun were free. Only Qin Feng and Chen Dong hadn't spoken yet.

Chen Dong looked at Qin Feng, apparently waiting for his answer.

"I'm free. Already filed my leave."

"Then I'll tell Xiaoxiao I'm with you, or she'll kill me."

Chen Dong immediately spoke up after hearing him.

Qin Feng felt like a stampede of alpacas was thundering through his mind. So you're using your boss as a shield against your wife?

"Chen Dong, want me to send you on some business trips?"

"I'll take you guys somewhere fun. Guaranteed good time!"

"We're all upstanding people here!"

Seeing Liu Jian's knowing smile, everyone took a step back.

"What are you imagining? Just follow me."

They paid the bill and left, driving to the entrance of a nightclub.

This had once been one of their memories!

During their junior year finals, a group of guys and girls had made a momentous decision!

Hit up a club!

Then everyone had started their internships. It was a way of commemorating those days.

"I'm game. What about you two?"

Shen Yuan smiled at Qin Feng and Chen Dong.

The two exchanged glances, both seeing the struggle in each other's eyes.

"I... I'll follow your lead."

Chen Dong spoke first.

"Do you want to go in? Be honest!"

"You're paying tonight!"

"Fine, I'll pay!"

With that, Qin Feng's lips curved into a victorious smile as he strode into the club.

He'd been to places like this plenty in his past life. But managing to stick Chen Dong with the bill tonight—that was going to cost him!

"Welcome!"

"Large booth, champagne package, and send over some good ones, understand?"

A server approached the entrance. Qin Feng gave a simple command, and the server immediately nodded respectfully, leading them inside.

"Holy shit! Qin Feng, why do you know all this so well?!"

Shen Yuan couldn't help but curse in surprise. The others stared at him in equal shock.

Qin Feng froze, then quickly launched into denial mode.

"It's not like that! No way! How could I?"

'Crap! Almost blew my cover!'
