Qin Feng showed no mercy. Every strike hit a soft spot.

And with his acupuncture skills, he knew the body's pressure points like the back of his hand. Each blow landed in a place that left his opponents defenseless.

Side ribs, diaphragm, vagus nerve, tanzhong point disruption—

In under three minutes, he'd taken down over twenty of them!

The remaining teenagers were thoroughly frightened and backed away.

The ringleader stared at the pile of groaning, writhing friends at Qin Feng's feet, shock and terror finally showing on his face.

"Now can we have a chat?"

Qin Feng tossed aside the boy he'd been holding—whose face was contorted in pain, body limp—and smiled at the leader.

"Who... who the hell are you?"

The boy swallowed hard, his words coming out stuttered.

Though they acted tough and domineering among their peers, when faced with someone who could actually fight—

They folded instantly.

Classic bullies who only picked on the weak!

"I'm here to ask you some questions about Feng Juan. I suggest you answer honestly. Otherwise, I won't be so polite."

Qin Feng shook his head, slowly walking toward him.

The boy cursed and spun around to run.

The others also abandoned their fallen brothers and scattered like startled birds.

This guy was way too good at fighting!

Over thirty people had mobbed him, and he'd dropped more than twenty without taking a single hit!

Qin Feng snatched up a pebble from nearby and hurled it at the fleeing boy.

The boy cried out in pain, legs buckling as he crashed to the ground, clutching his leg and howling.

Qin Feng walked up to him and reached out. The boy tried to fight back, throwing a punch.

Qin Feng's gaze sharpened. His palm became a finger, jabbing hard into the tanzhong point on the boy's chest.

Instantly, the boy's entire body went rigid. His face flushed crimson as he collapsed, unable to move.

"I... I'm warning you, if you touch me, I'll make sure you go to prison!"

Hearing the threat, Qin Feng pointed to the side.

The boy followed his gesture and saw a phone propped up on a decorative rock, its camera aimed directly at the plaza.

"Know what self-defense is, kid?"

The boy clutched his chest, eyes filled with fear.

"Now tell me. What did you do to Feng Juan?"

Qin Feng stared at him, expression cold, voice harsh.

"What I did with her is none of your business! Where is she?"

The boy glared back defiantly, still stubborn.

Qin Feng grabbed the boy's phone and pressed his finger to unlock it.

"What... what are you doing?"

"Move again and I'll have the nurses carry you out!"

The boy saw his fierce expression and immediately froze, not daring to move.

But watching his phone get unlocked, his face grew increasingly ugly.

Qin Feng opened WeChat and started scrolling through his chat history with Feng Juan.

About two minutes later, Qin Feng's expression gradually darkened. Fury flickered in his eyes.

The chat logs showed not only threats and coercion to make Feng Juan change her college application so they'd attend the same vocational school—

There were also secretly filmed intimate photos of Feng Juan!

It was absolutely depraved!

According to the chat history, Feng Juan's grades were excellent—at minimum a 211 university, with a shot at the elite 985 tier.

But in her messages with this boy, she was practically begging, pleading for him to let her go.

The boy had even used those photos multiple times to make Feng Juan sneak out of her dorm at night to meet him. What they did was obvious.

Qin Feng couldn't hold back anymore.

He raised his hand and delivered a solid slap across the boy's face, making him see stars.

"You little animal! Didn't your parents teach you how to be a decent human being?!"

"Say one more word and I'll make sure you can never speak again!"

The boy had been about to curse after getting slapped, but Qin Feng's icy threat shut him up immediately.

"Hold out your hands."

The boy seethed silently but had lost all his earlier arrogance. He obediently extended both hands.

Qin Feng pulled out a roll of gauze from his pocket and bound the boy's wrists to prevent any dangerous behavior during the drive.

Then he buckled him in and drove straight to the hospital.

Municipal First Hospital, ER ward—

Feng Juan's parents looked at their daughter lying unconscious on the bed, unable to hold back their tears.

"My baby! Why would you do something so foolish? Why didn't you tell Mom? Why did you have to try to kill yourself?"

Her mother lay against the bed, stroking her daughter's face, weeping.

"Teacher Zheng, what exactly happened? Why would my daughter try to commit suicide at school?"

The father struggled to stay calm, turning to the female teacher.

"Feng Juan's father, please don't panic. I'm not entirely sure why Feng Juan tried to do this either. We'll need to investigate."

A flash of panic crossed the teacher's face before she composed herself.

"However, Feng Juan hasn't been doing well at school lately. She's been distracted in class, staring out the window, lost in thought.

Also, some boys have been coming around to see her. There may be some early dating going on."

Hearing this, the father frowned and glanced at his daughter on the bed.

"When did this start?"

"About half a month ago. I didn't think much of it at first since her grades were still good."

After the teacher finished, the father's expression shifted.

They hadn't received any notification!

Tomorrow was the college entrance exam, and now this had happened. No one could accept it!

"Well, the doctor said there shouldn't be any major issues. She bought fake pills. She'll be fine once she wakes up."

"What do you mean 'no major issues'? My daughter tried to kill herself! If it weren't for the fake pills, she'd be dead!"

Hearing the teacher's words, the father finally snapped. He slammed his palm on the table.

"You're her homeroom teacher! You noticed problems with a student but didn't inform the parents for weeks? Is your head full of shit?!"

"Mr. Feng, what's that supposed to mean?!"

The teacher's breath caught, and her expression cooled.

"If you want to argue, take it outside. Don't disturb the other patients."

Zhao Yitian happened to walk in. Seeing them fighting, he cut them off sharply.

The father and teacher stepped out into the hallway. Just then, Qin Feng arrived, dragging the boy along.

Seeing the angry man standing across from the teacher, he guessed this was probably Feng Juan's father.

"Sun Han? What are you doing here?"

The teacher spotted the boy and paused, puzzled.

"Excuse me, is he your student?"

The boy pressed his lips together and said nothing. Qin Feng spoke first, his tone calm.

"No, but he's also a senior at our school."

The teacher shook her head, then looked at the boy with a strange expression.

"Sun Han, are you here to see Feng Juan?"

She knew the boy who had been coming around to see Feng Juan was this very Sun Han.

But it wasn't that she didn't want to intervene—she just didn't see the need!

"Alright, if he's not your student, you don't need to concern yourself. Are you Feng Juan's father?"

Qin Feng heard her and dismissed her entirely, turning to the man.

"I'm Qin Feng, Director of the Transplant Center here at Municipal First Hospital. Could I speak with you privately about something?"

"I'm Feng Juan's father. Yes, alright."

The man was somewhat confused but nodded in agreement.

The three of them entered a conference room. Qin Feng closed and locked the door, then sat down beside the man.

"Mr. Feng, what I'm about to tell you may be beyond what you can imagine. So please try to stay calm, understood?"

The man nodded, but tension was obvious in his demeanor.

Sun Han was about to sit down when Qin Feng shot him a sharp look.

"Stand against the wall! Move again and I'll have the nurses wheel you out!"

Sun Han's body went rigid. Resentment flickered across his face.

But he obediently stood and walked to the wall, glaring at Qin Feng.

Qin Feng ignored him and handed the phone to the father, opening the chat history.

The moment the man saw the chat logs, he froze. Then he began scrolling through them himself.

A minute later, his face was flushed with rage. His whole body trembled, fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white.

"I'll fucking kill you, you little bastard! Motherfucker!"

The next second, after finishing the chat logs, the man exploded from his chair. In two steps he was in front of Sun Han, both hands clamping around his throat.

"Let go."

Qin Feng rushed over. Seeing the boy's windpipe being crushed, unable to breathe, he pried the man's hands apart.

"Cough cough cough!"

The boy dropped to his knees, clutching his throat and coughing violently. He'd clearly been squeezed hard.

If Qin Feng hadn't intervened, the man probably would have strangled him to death!

"I've already called the police and notified his parents. Don't do anything extreme."

Qin Feng held back the nearly berserk father.

"Wait for the police to handle it. He won't get away."

"Let me go! You little animal! You touched my daughter—I'll fucking destroy you!"

The man's eyes were bloodshot, teeth clenched, looking ready to tear him apart.

Knock knock knock—

Just then, someone knocked on the door.

"Qin Feng, open up."

It was Zhou Xianren's voice.

Qin Feng restrained the man, pulled him to the door, and opened it.

Zhou Xianren pushed in, saw Qin Feng gripping the man tightly, saw the man's crazed expression—and froze.

"What happened here?"

His expression grew serious, and he waved over the security guards at the door.

"Bit of a situation. Are the police here?"

Qin Feng shook his head and asked.

"I was just about to tell you. They're here. Plus a couple who say they're looking for their son."

Zhou Xianren nodded.

"Let them in."

Qin Feng guided the man to a chair. Meanwhile, Sun Han had been thoroughly shaken by the earlier incident and had retreated to the far wall.

About two minutes later, two uniformed officers walked in.

Behind them came a heavyset couple. Spotting Sun Han, they immediately rushed over.

"Oh my baby! What are you doing at the hospital? Are you hurt somewhere?"

The woman grabbed the boy, looking him over frantically, her face full of concern.

"Cough cough cough!"

Sun Han saw his parents and couldn't help coughing a few more times.

Only then did the woman notice the angry red finger marks on his neck—clear as day.

"Who did this? Did someone hit you? Tell Mommy! Mommy will make them pay!"

"I did!"

Before she could finish her rant, Feng Juan's father shot to his feet.

"Hit him? I want to skin him alive! Grind his bones to dust! I'll bankrupt myself to destroy him if I have to!"

"Who do you think you are, talking like that?"

The woman flinched at his wild appearance, then snapped back with a dismissive once-over.

"Alright, since everyone's here, please sit. I'm the one who called the police."

Before anyone else could speak, Qin Feng slapped the table.

"Who are you? My son has his college entrance exam tomorrow. We don't have time for this nonsense. Come on, son, let's go home."

The woman glanced at Qin Feng, rolled her eyes, and declared haughtily.

"If you take that little animal out of here today, I'll destroy your entire family! Try me!"

Feng Juan's father stared at Sun Han with bloodshot eyes, pointing at him through gritted teeth.

"Oh really? Touch us with one finger and I'll make sure you rot in prison!"

The woman glanced at her husband and sneered.

Before she could finish, Feng Juan's father kicked a chair out of his way and stormed toward her.

Qin Feng rushed to intercept him. If he let the man get his hands on the boy now, he'd probably beat him to death.

"The police are here. The evidence is solid. Relax."

He spoke quietly, trying to restore some of the man's rationality.

"Fine. You can leave. But Sun Han stays."

Qin Feng turned to the heavyset couple, his voice cold.

"What's that supposed to mean?"

The heavyset man frowned.

Qin Feng looked around the room and gestured to the chairs.

Feng Juan's father sat back down, still breathing heavily. The two officers also took their seats.

After a moment's hesitation, the man sat as well.

Qin Feng also called Zhou Xianren and Zhao Yitian in to sit and observe.

The three of them had been the first to treat Feng Juan, making them all her attending physicians.

Their presence could both clarify the situation and help maintain order.

Once everyone was seated—

Qin Feng took Sun Han's phone, then had Zhao Yitian unlock Feng Juan's phone and bring it over.

He handed both phones to the two officers to review the messages.

At that moment, Sun Han's face went pale. He nervously grabbed the heavyset woman's hand.

He knew that once this came out, he was in deep trouble.

After all, he knew exactly what he'd done—

Two or three minutes later, the officers' expressions changed. Their brows furrowed.

Shock and anger filled their eyes as they looked at Sun Han!

They were family men too. Beneath the uniform, they were ordinary people. One of them, a father to a daughter, was clenching his jaw.

"Officers, this is probably just a portion of the evidence. There may be more on these phones. But based on these chat logs alone—combined with the fact that the victim is currently lying in a hospital bed after a suicide attempt—

I believe that's sufficient for charges, correct?"

Qin Feng took back both phones. He couldn't hand them over to the police yet—at least not until full backups were made.

Who knew if there might be an "accidental hard drive failure"!

"That's enough. But these phones—"

The senior officer nodded and looked at Qin Feng.

"Don't worry. I've already called someone. We'll make backup copies here first, then you can take them. I just want to ensure nothing... unexpected happens. Otherwise, I can't guarantee the consequences."

The two officers exchanged a glance, both recognizing the caution in each other's eyes.

Qin Feng's simple statement carried layers of meaning.

And his arrangements were thorough!

Not only was he preserving evidence, but he was having everything compared and notarized. Once notarized, no matter how much power someone had, they couldn't challenge every copy.

Most crucially—if anything happened to these two phones as physical evidence—

The officers would bear responsibility!

This was essentially a check on public power!

The law is the law—impartial and unbiased!

Most importantly, Qin Feng's identity was somewhat special. With him personally stepping in, this was going to be complicated.

"Don't worry. We'll protect the evidence."

The two officers nodded, then grabbed Sun Han from the floor. All the facts would need to be verified first, including formal interview records.

Feng Juan's father would also need to accompany them to provide a detailed statement.

Just as they reached the parking lot, Sun Han's parents were waiting at the entrance.

"My baby! My poor son!"

Seeing Sun Han being led out, the woman wailed and rushed over, embracing him and sobbing.

"Baby, protect yourself. Mommy and Daddy will find a way to get you out! Sob sob... Don't admit to anything. We'll get lawyers..."

Qin Feng was standing right behind Sun Han. Everyone thought the woman was crying too hard to speak.

But he clearly saw her lips moving between gasps, catching every word.

'Don't admit to anything. We'll get lawyers.'

Qin Feng's gaze turned sharp, the corner of his mouth curling into a cold arc.

"Alright, alright, that's enough."

The officers saw the woman clinging to Sun Han and pulled her off impatiently, then loaded him into the police car. Feng Juan's father got in as well.

Just as the heavyset man and his wife were opening their car doors to leave, Qin Feng grabbed the door handle.

The man paused, looking up at him with a frown.

"What do you want?"

"Hello. I'm Qin Feng, Director of the Transplant Center at Municipal First Hospital. May I ask Mr. Sun's name and profession?"

"Sun Daqiang. Construction. Why do you ask, Director Qin?"

Sun Daqiang was startled, then immediately put on a smile—though wariness flickered in his eyes.

He had assumed Qin Feng was just some young doctor. He hadn't expected him to be a department director.

Now it clicked—this was the young medical prodigy who'd been all over the news in Jiang City lately.

"Oh, nothing. I just happened to hear what your wife whispered in Sun Han's ear."

Qin Feng smiled faintly, gesturing toward the woman.

"Your son did something monstrous, and you still want to protect him? I can't stand by and watch. I'm getting involved.

How about a bet?"

"What bet?"

Sun Daqiang's expression turned strange, his smile fading.

Qin Feng held up one hand in front of Sun Daqiang and said slowly, his voice low:

"I'll make sure he serves at least five years!"

"You—! Hmph!"

Sun Daqiang's expression froze, then shifted to anger.

"Just because you're a doctor? Fine then, let's see. We'll see who wins!"

He slammed the door shut and drove off.

Qin Feng watched them leave the parking lot in their Mercedes S450, eyes narrowing.

"Qin Feng, that was a bit rash. Do you know who Sun Daqiang is?"

Zhou Xianren walked over, frowning and speaking in a low voice.

"Oh? Who is he?"

"He's one of the top three construction magnates in Jiang City. He holds several major development projects for the city. His net worth is at least a billion or more. He's a major player in this city!"

"Well, well. The fat guy's got some clout!"

Qin Feng was somewhat surprised. He nodded.

"That's why I said you were reckless. He's definitely going to throw money at saving his son. Sigh..."

Zhou Xianren shook his head.

Feng Juan's mother still didn't know about any of this. When she found out, she'd probably faint on the spot.

To have her daughter treated like that—how could any mother accept it?

But she would have to know eventually. That would wait until Feng Juan's father returned to tell her.

Only the two of them could console each other and face this together.

"Director Zhou, you head back. Don't worry about this. Transfer Feng Juan to my service. I'll be her primary physician."

Qin Feng thought for a moment, then spoke.

"You really want to wade into this mess?"

Zhou Xianren's frown deepened.

"What if..."

"Relax. I never do anything I'm not sure about."

"Alright then. Let me know if anything comes up. I'll help however I can."

He patted Qin Feng on the shoulder and left.

Qin Feng's expression shifted. He turned to Chen Dong and Lin Xiaoxiao behind him.

"Contact the law firm in the capital. Have them send their best team for this kind of case. As long as they agree to take it, we must win!

This kind of juvenile scum needs to be crushed before it can grow!"

"Understood. I'll reach out to them now."

Chen Dong nodded gravely.

Three months ago, the system had actually gifted him a massive bundle of rewards.

Among them was a partnership with one of the top three law firms in the capital!

This was a firm with a terrifying track record—an unbroken winning streak across the nation.

If Penguin's legal team combined with local resources was called "Certain Victory," then Tianhong was the kind that could turn the tables even with the slimmest evidence.

In an instant, his biggest concern—the legal shield for his future medical foundation and various enterprises—was solved.

And yet, the first time he'd be deploying them was for a patient...

Perhaps that was its own kind of tragedy—

Two days later—

Feng Juan had long since woken up, but her body wasn't able to handle the college entrance exam. Through tears of anguish, she missed it.

Her parents had been agonizing as well. Qin Feng had told them help was available.

After enduring tremendous mental suffering, the family of three finally resisted all of Sun Daqiang's threats and monetary temptations.

It was Feng Juan's determination that steeled her parents' resolve.

Even if they had to leave this city, they would fight for justice for their daughter!

They would never let a criminal walk free!

In the end, they chose to go to court, rejecting the 1.5 million yuan settlement offer.

"These are the nation's top lawyers for juvenile and sexual assault cases. They'll be handling your lawsuit from here on."

Qin Feng gestured to the sharply dressed men and women beside him, their bearing distinguished.

"Hello. We're from Tianhong Law Firm in the capital. Director Qin engaged us specifically to take your case."

The lead middle-aged man stood and addressed Feng Juan's family of three.

"Tian... Tianhong?"

Feng Juan's father heard the name and his face filled with disbelief. His words came out stammered.

"You're really from Tianhong Law Firm in the capital?"

"Absolutely."
