At that same moment.

Several hundred li outside Yan Jing City.

Deep within the Black Wind Mountains.

Death Valley.

The massive altar at the center of the canyon still stood tall.

At its heart, a pitch-black mass of flesh pulsed slowly like a beating heart. It was like a beast driven mad with hunger, waiting to be nourished with blood and flesh.

Three figures stood silently with hands clasped behind their backs beside the altar.

They were three of the Divine Court's Twelve Divine Officials!

Leading them was the Blood Slaughter Divine Official!

Flanking him on either side were the Yin Sha Divine Official and the Netherbone Divine Official!

The three Divine Officials simply stood there casually.

Not a wisp of their auras leaked out.

Yet they seemed like the absolute masters of this domain of death!

At their feet.

A thousand living people, bound in chains and dressed in rags, huddled together trembling.

Their eyes were filled with endless terror.

These people had all been abducted by the Divine Court from towns and villages across the land, or from hunting parties that ventured into the wilderness.

Their only purpose.

Was to serve as sacrifices!

"The time has nearly come."

The Blood Slaughter Divine Official slowly raised his head.

He glanced at the fog-shrouded sky, his voice hoarse and icy cold.

"Begin."

"Let those self-righteous fools in Yan Jing City experience the true might of the Divine Court!"

The Yin Sha Divine Official let out a piercing laugh like a night owl's screech.

From within his robes, he produced a small bottle of ink-green color.

He removed the stopper.

An invisible, eerie wave of energy instantly spread outward.

Those bound sacrifices didn't even have time to let out a single scream.

Their bodies began to rot and melt at a speed visible to the naked eye!

Dissolving into pools of foul-smelling pus and blood!

The Netherbone Divine Official, meanwhile, formed hand seals.

His lips moved, chanting cryptic incantations.

One after another, ink-black runes suffused with evil and malice flew from his fingertips, merging into those pools of corrupted blood.

BOOM!!!

The entire bone-white altar shook violently.

Those pools of blood seemed to gain a life of their own, beginning to boil violently!

They transformed into streams of crimson that raced along the eerie patterns already carved into the altar's surface, spreading rapidly!

Finally, they converged at the altar's very center!

HUM—!!!

A blood-red beam of light, thick as a barrel, suddenly shot up from the altar's center!

Piercing straight into the heavens!

ROAR—!!!

In that very instant.

A terrifying beast's roar—one that seemed capable of rending heaven and earth asunder, filled with endless savagery—erupted from the deepest reaches of the canyon!

The entire Black Wind Mountains trembled violently!

The night was deep as ink.

Atop the eastern gate tower of Yan Jing City.

Lights blazed as bright as day.

Squads of city defense soldiers in heavy alloy armor, wielding various weapons, patrolled back and forth with solemn expressions.

Every face was etched with gravity.

At the highest point of the gate tower.

Eastern District Commander Wang Junyi stood with his hands clasped behind his back.

His brow was tightly furrowed as he gazed into the distance, toward the Black Wind Mountains that crouched in the darkness like some colossal beast.

Though he supported the Grand Marshal's decision—believing that caution was never wrong—

His heart still felt a faint, inexplicable unease.

This feeling had no discernible source, yet it felt utterly real.

"General! You've been standing here for four hours. Perhaps you should rest?"

A deputy general stepped forward and spoke softly.

"No need."

Wang Junyi shook his head.

"My right eyelid keeps twitching."

"I have a feeling that something big is going to happen tonight."

The moment his words fell.

WOO—WOO—WOO—!!!

A series of urgent, wailing alarm sirens suddenly pierced the entire eastern gate defense line!

"Enemy attack!!!"

"It's a beast tide! It's really a beast tide!!!"

From the watchtower.

The sentry on duty let out a hoarse, desperate scream.

Wang Junyi's heart sank like a stone!

He took a single step forward, instantly appearing at the edge of the wall, and looked into the distance.

One glance.

Despite being a battle-hardened veteran who had seen mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

In this moment.

His pupils contracted to their limits!

There.

On the distant horizon.

A tide of black, stretching beyond the limits of sight, swept toward Yan Jing City in an apocalyptic surge, carrying countless crimson points of light.

That was no tide!

It was a legion of death composed of endless ferocious wolves!

Those crimson points gleaming in the darkness were their bloodthirsty eyes!

That terrifying demonic aura surging skyward—a mixture of savagery and slaughter!

It seemed ready to dye the entire night sky blood red!

"Heavens above..."

The deputy general looked at the scene before him.

His legs went weak, and he nearly collapsed to the ground.

"How... how many wolves is that?!"

"At least... over a million!"

Wang Junyi's voice had become incomparably hoarse.

His face was written with unprecedented gravity!

He finally understood.

Where that sense of unease had come from.

This was no ordinary beast tide!

This was a catastrophe that, with the slightest misstep, could utterly destroy Yan Jing City!

A world-ending calamity!

"Pass my orders!"

Wang Junyi snapped out of his shock.

"All units! Enter combat positions immediately!"

"Energy cannons one through ten! Commence indiscriminate carpet bombardment!"

"Close defense guns eleven through thirty! Free fire! Don't be stingy with spirit stones! Hit them with everything we've got!"

"All soldiers! Hold the wall! Not one step back!"

"Yan Jing City is right behind us! Our families are right behind us!"

"Live and die with this city! Fight to the death, never retreat!"

"Fight to the death, never retreat!!!"

Atop the wall, tens of thousands of city defense soldiers roared in unison!

Though their eyes held fear.

What filled them more.

Was the resolve and ferocity of those determined to protect their homeland, even unto death!

HUM HUM HUM...

One by one, the massive energy cannons began charging!

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The sounds rolled like thunder, surging like tides.

One after another, terrifying beams of energy capable of tearing through the void shot into the sky!

And slammed viciously into that black tide of beasts!

SIZZLE! SIZZLE! SIZZLE!

War.

In an instant, it had entered its most brutal phase!

Beneath the city walls.

In mere moments, the ground became a meat grinder of blood and flesh!

Countless ferocious wolves were torn to shreds under the dense barrage of firepower!

Severed limbs flew through the air!

Blood flowed in rivers!

However.

Those wolves seemed to have gone completely mad!

They feared nothing—not even death!

The deaths of their companions didn't inspire the slightest fear in them. Instead, it only further ignited the ferocity buried in their bones!

They trampled over their companions' corpses, splashing through viscous pools of blood...

Charging toward the eastern gate like lunatics!

One thousand meters!

Eight hundred meters!

Five hundred meters!

Two hundred meters!

One hundred meters!

BOOM!!!!!

The terrifying tide finally slammed against the eastern gate!

In that instant.

Heaven and earth shook!!!

"Attack, attack!"

Wang Junyi's expression grew grimmer by the second.

He knew this couldn't go on.

Energy would eventually run out. The defensive formations could be breached.

When that happened, it would be time for close combat with these beasts!

But at that moment.

His keen senses caught an extremely abnormal detail!

Deep within the wolf pack, the largest wolf—the one with the most terrifying aura, the Iron-Spine Wolf King—had not joined the assault at all.

It simply stood quietly at the rear of the beast tide.

Coldly watching the battlefield.

Its gaze wasn't that of a beast.

It was more like that of an experienced human general!

It was observing!

It was searching for weak points in the defense line!

Not good!

A terrible thought exploded in Wang Junyi's mind!

However.

It was already too late!

"ROAR—!!!"

The Iron-Spine Wolf King moved!
