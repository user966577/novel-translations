Lin Jianguo's words had barely fallen when, before Lin Yuan could make any response—

BOOM!!!

Above the Nine Heavens, wind and clouds churned!

A purple thunderbolt, thick as a water barrel, tore through the pitch-black night sky without warning and struck viciously upon the Nation-Guarding Stone Monument in the center of Yan Jing City!

The entire great city trembled violently under this thunderbolt!

Immediately after.

A supreme pressure, a hundred times—no, a thousand, ten thousand times more terrifying than Lin Jianguo's iron-blooded killing aura—cascaded down from the heavens above like a bursting celestial river!

This pressure was so vast, so immense!

As if heaven itself had delivered divine punishment!

As if the gods had opened their eyes!

In an instant!

Throughout all of Yan Jing City, whether sleeping commoners or cultivating martial powerhouses, everyone felt as though their hearts were being gripped by an invisible giant hand!

Breathing stopped!

Heartbeats ceased!

Even their souls trembled under this pressure, as if they could be crushed to powder at any moment!

Countless terrified gazes all turned toward the direction of the Liu family estate!

That was the center of this terrifying pressure!

There, in the sky above the ruins of the Liu estate, space was visibly twisting and collapsing!

Pitch-black spatial rifts, like cracks in an abyss, continuously appeared and vanished!

Finally.

A figure emerged, stepping out from that shattered void. He wore plain gray hemp robes, his hair and beard all white, yet his features were as resolute as a middle-aged man's.

He stood in mid-air, hands clasped behind his back.

Though he made no movement, it seemed as though hundreds of millions of stars were being born and dying around him, as though infinite universes were revolving!

He was the sole sovereign of this heaven and earth!

He was the rules, the order, the... God!

The Liu family's anchor!

Guardian deity of Dragon Xia Country's southern frontier!

A martial legend equal to the Lin family's old War God, Lin Zhan!

Liu Xuanchen!

When he saw the hellscape below—his family estate awash in rivers of blood—

When he sensed that, aside from the crippled Liu Qingtian, not a single Liu family member above Meridian Opening remained—

In those eyes that had seemed still as ancient wells, eyes that had witnessed the rise and fall of ages—fury fierce enough to boil seas and burn the heavens instantly ignited!

"WHO!!!"

"WHO DARES EXTERMINATE MY LIU FAMILY!!!"

A single roar, like divine thunder from the Nine Heavens!

Sound waves transformed into physical shockwaves, spreading madly in all directions!

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

Every building within several thousand meters of the Liu estate collapsed under this roar, reduced to clouds of dust!

Countless people bled from all seven orifices and fainted on the spot!

This was the wrath of a Martial God!

One bout of anger could shatter mountains and rivers!

One word could change the color of heaven and earth!

Lin Jianguo's expression changed. He stepped forward, blocking Lin Yuan behind him.

The iron-blooded killing aura on his body circulated wildly, forming an indestructible golden barrier that blocked every bit of those world-destroying sound waves!

Yet even so, Lin Jianguo felt his blood and qi churning, his spiritual power backflowing. Even the corner of his mouth seeped a trace of blood.

"War God Liu!"

Lin Jianguo steadied his blood and qi, raised his head.

Looking directly at that god-like figure, his voice was equally cold as bone. "Your Liu family colluded with the Divine Court. They deserved death ten thousand times over!"

"BULLSHIT!!!"

Liu Xuanchen's gaze instantly locked onto the father and son.

Those eyes were colder than ten-thousand-year black ice, more terrifying than the depths of hell!

"My Liu family has guarded the southern frontier for generations, shedding blood and sacrificing lives for Dragon Xia Country! What is this nonsense about colluding with the Divine Court?!"

"Lin Jianguo! Today, if you don't give me an explanation!"

"I will have you and your son both buried with my Liu family!!!"

As his words fell.

He suddenly raised his right hand.

And pressed down toward the father and son across empty air!

HUM—!!!

A gray giant palm, formed from endless heaven and earth energy and measuring a thousand zhang, appeared from thin air!

Upon that giant palm, dao principles flowed and divine patterns covered its surface!

As if it were the hand of heaven itself, coming to erase all mortal ants who dared defy the heavens!

Under this palm.

Lin Jianguo's Essence Gathering cultivation seemed so insignificant!

However.

Just then.

An equally ancient cold snort, yet one filled with supreme domineering aura, suddenly rang out from the direction of the Lin estate!

"Hmph!"

"Liu Xuanchen! Do you think this old man is dead?!"

Before the voice faded.

A golden spear gleam, brilliant to the extreme, seemingly capable of tearing apart the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, cleaved through the void, arriving later but striking first!

BOOM—!!!

The spear gleam and that gray giant palm collided violently in mid-air!

BOOM!!!

Terrifying shockwaves spread madly in all directions!

Immediately after.

An equally towering, equally imperiously domineering figure appeared beside Lin Jianguo and his son.

The newcomer was clad in military regalia, wielding a golden dragon spear.

Though his hair and beard were similarly white, his face was filled with iron-blooded authority!

He merely stood there quietly, yet it seemed he was an eternal pillar holding up the heavens, one that would never fall!

The Lin family's old War God!

Lin Zhan!

He too had arrived!

In an instant!

The terrifying auras of two contemporary Martial Gods collided wildly in the sky above Yan Jing City!

CRACK! CRACK!

The entire sky seemed unable to withstand the impact of these two forces and began to crack inch by inch!

All of Yan Jing City wailed!

Countless people found their courage shattered and their souls nearly destroyed under this pressure!

"Lin Zhan! You would also make an enemy of me?!"

Liu Xuanchen looked at that familiar figure, his voice cold to the extreme.

"Make an enemy of you?"

Lin Zhan let out a cold laugh. "My grandson is here. Whoever dares touch a single hair on his head—this old man will see their soul extinguished!"

Domineering!

Unreasonably domineering!

Just then.

Several other figures with equally powerful auras appeared in succession nearby.

Members of Dragon Xia Country's Elder Council!

All present!

This naturally included Lin Yuan's mother!

Every high-ranking official in Yan Jing City had been alarmed!

"Would both Venerable War Gods please calm your anger!"

One elder spoke first, his voice heavy with gravity. "What exactly has occurred to cause both of you to make such a scene?"

Liu Xuanchen's eyes were blood-red. He pointed at the ruins below, his voice hoarse as he roared: "Your Majesty! You've come at the perfect time!"

"The Lin family has slaughtered my Liu family! This enmity is irreconcilable!"

Everyone's gazes turned uniformly toward Lin Jianguo and Lin Zhan.

Facing Liu Xuanchen's accusation and countless questioning gazes.

Lin Yuan finally, unhurriedly, stepped out from behind his father and grandfather.

He raised his head, calmly regarding that enraged Martial God.

Then, in a flat tone as if simply stating facts, he spoke.

"Your Liu family colluded with the Divine Court and attempted to assassinate me."

"Liu Qingtian even offered thirty percent of your Liu family's assets as payment for my life."

"The people? I killed them. The family? I destroyed it."

"Got a problem with that?"

BOOM!!!

The moment these words left his mouth, the entire scene fell deathly silent!

Everyone's minds seemed to have been struck hard by a thunderbolt!

Colluded with the Divine Court?!

That was the crime of treason!

"You... you're spouting nonsense!"

Liu Xuanchen's body shuddered violently.

"Whether it's nonsense or not, see for yourself."

Lin Yuan flicked his finger.

Two remnant soul marks, filled with sinister aura and belonging to Divine Court assassins, appeared in mid-air.

Within those marks was a clear recording of every moment of their transaction with Liu Qingtian!

Iron-clad evidence!

"This..."

Everyone drew in a sharp breath!

Several elders' expressions instantly turned extremely ugly.

One elder stepped forward and spoke solemnly to Liu Xuanchen: "Venerable War God Liu, you have guarded the southern frontier for our Dragon Xia Country for a hundred years. Your service and achievements are immense. We all deeply admire you."

"However, what happened here must be addressed separately."

"Members of your family have committed such a grave crime of treason. It is unforgivable!"

"I trust the Venerable War God has his own judgment in this matter!"

These words were neither servile nor overbearing, yet they also completely blocked all of Liu Xuanchen's paths of retreat!

Liu Xuanchen stared blankly at those two remnant soul marks.

The fury on his face gradually faded.

What replaced it was endless, bone-deep sorrow and disappointment!

He had fought battles his entire life, protecting Dragon Xia Country for a hundred years!

In the end, his own descendants had done something so despicable—something worse than pigs or dogs—betraying their country!

How laughable!

How tragic!

He slowly closed his eyes. In that moment, his towering figure seemed to age considerably.

A long while passed.

He finally opened his eyes again, giving Lin Yuan below one deep look.

That gaze was complex to the extreme.

There was fury, there was unwillingness, there was killing intent...

But more than anything, there was a powerless despair.

In the end, he said nothing.

He merely gave a violent flick of his sleeve.

Turned, stepped into the void, and vanished from everyone's sight.
