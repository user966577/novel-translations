Staring at that figure, Ye Canglan ground out four words through clenched teeth.

The youngest Martial God in all of Dragon Xia!

A mere hundred years old, yet she had already reached the Sky Trampling Realm, commanding submission from ten thousand daos!

The Flying Moon Sword God!

Shangguan Jinghong!

Why was she here?!

But no one could answer his question now.

Because in that brief instant when Shangguan Jinghong had distracted him—

Lin Yuan's seemingly ordinary sword qi had already closed the distance, silent as a whisper.

That sword intent wasn't sharp.

Yet it was vast. Boundless. As if it contained the supreme majesty of all heaven and earth.

"No... no..."

Ye Xuan's pupils trembled violently.

He felt it.

He truly felt it.

That overwhelming, soul-crushing, irresistible... terrifying power.

He wanted to dodge.

He wanted to flee.

He wanted to beg for mercy.

But under the lock of that boundless sword intent—like the very will of heaven itself—

He could do nothing.

He could only watch helplessly as that sword qi grew larger in his vision.

Larger.

And larger still.

He had never known such fear.

He finally understood just how impossibly, absolutely powerful Lin Yuan truly was—a gulf he could never hope to cross.

So...

This was his true strength?

So...

Before him, he really was nothing more than an ant to be crushed at will?

So...

The so-called "Child of Destiny"...

Had been a joke from the very beginning.

BOOM!!!

The sword qi descended.

There was no earth-shaking explosion.

No gruesome scene of flesh and blood flying.

Ye Xuan's body, along with his savage demonic projection, along with all that evil, venomous power—

The instant it touched that crystalline sword qi.

Melted away like snow under sunlight.

Evaporated.

Utterly and completely erased from this world.

Not a single trace of his existence remained.

The gap between him and Lin Yuan wasn't a chasm.

It was... an abyss.

An eternal, insurmountable barrier between mortals and gods.

"I... I'm not satisfied..."

Amid infinite terror and regret.

Ye Xuan, once the pride of heaven.

Let out the final, desperate wail of his life.

Pfft—!

No thunderous sound.

No flashy visual effects.

That faint golden sword qi simply passed through Ye Xuan's body, light as a whisper.

Time seemed to freeze.

The expression on Ye Xuan's face solidified completely.

That savagery, that madness, that venom...

All of it, in this single instant, transformed into endless confusion and emptiness.

He lowered his head.

Struggled to look at his chest, now scattering golden motes of light.

There, a hole had appeared. Not large, not small. Perfectly transparent.

His life force was draining away at a speed he couldn't comprehend.

He tried to speak.

But found his throat could no longer produce a single sound.

He tried to raise his hand, to grasp at something.

But found his body refused to obey him at all.

His consciousness began to blur.

Darkness, like a tide, swallowed him whole.

In the final second of his life.

What he saw was Lin Yuan's face—calm as a passing cloud.

So...

He had always been nothing but a self-deluded clown...

Ye Xuan's massive form crashed to the ground.

Then, under Ye Canglan's bloodshot, nearly bursting gaze—

Like a sand sculpture eroding in the wind, it crumbled inch by inch.

Dissolving into golden motes of light that scattered across the sky.

Until finally, it dispersed completely into the void.

Not a single trace of his existence remained.

Ye Xuan!

The former prodigy of Yan Jing City!

Dead silence.

The entire mountaintop fell into a suffocating, eerie quiet.

Lin Yuan slowly lowered his hand, two fingers still extended like a sword.

As if he had just done something utterly trivial.

"Sigh, honestly."

"Did you really have to make me do this?"

"All this fighting and killing. So pointless."

His lazy demeanor, in Ye Canglan's eyes, was nothing less than the cruelest, most vicious mockery.

"AHHH—!!!"

"Xuan'er!!!"

"My Xuan'er!!!"

After a moment of deathly stillness.

Ye Canglan threw his head back and let out a wail so anguished it could shatter the heavens.

He stared at the spot where Ye Xuan had vanished, his clouded eyes instantly turning blood-red.

Even a tiger, cruel as it may be, won't eat its own cubs.

Ye Xuan was his only son.

His entire hope.

The future of the Ye family line.

But now!

Right before his very eyes!

He had been killed by Lin Yuan—this so-called "waste" he had never given a second thought.

One sword. Instant death.

Body and soul, annihilated.

Not even a corpse remained.

BOOM—!!!

A berserk, murderous aura exploded from Ye Canglan's body, surging toward the heavens.

He had completely lost his mind.

"Lin! Yuan!"

"I! Want! You! Dead!"

Ye Canglan's voice was hoarse. Venomous.

Like a curse from the evil spirits of the Nine Nether Hells.

He abandoned all defense.

Pushed his Essence Gathering cultivation to its absolute limit.

His entire being became a streak of bloody light, charging at Lin Yuan with reckless abandon.

He wanted revenge.

He wanted to tear Lin Yuan into ten thousand pieces.

He wanted to rip out Lin Yuan's soul and burn it with the most vicious flames for a hundred million years.

But.

He was fast.

Someone else was faster.

"Your opponent is me."

A voice devoid of all emotion thundered in his ear.

It was the Flying Moon Sword God—Shangguan Jinghong.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Those ninety-nine streams of moonlit sword qi, as if answering some call, merged into one in an instant.

Transforming into a hundred-zhang sword of moonlight that pierced heaven and earth.

Atop that divine blade, a terrifying edge sharp enough to sever sun, moon, and stars radiated outward.

"Get out of my way!"

Ye Canglan roared, throwing a punch.

His blood-colored fist aura collided with the moonlight blade.

BOOM—!!!

The entire mountaintop shuddered violently.

The solid rock beneath their feet was instantly ground to powder by the shockwave.

Ye Canglan's figure flew backward, spraying a great arc of crimson blood in midair.

True, he was also an Essence Gathering expert.

But compared to a supreme Martial God like Shangguan Jinghong, who had reached the Sky Trampling Realm—he was still leagues below.

One move.

Just one move.

The difference was crystal clear.

"Hahaha... hahahaha!"

Yet.

Despite being gravely wounded by a single exchange, Ye Canglan showed no sign of retreat.

Instead, he broke into even more deranged laughter.

"Shangguan Jinghong! You are strong indeed!"

"But! Did you really think you alone could stop me?!"

"Today! Even if the Jade Emperor himself came! He couldn't save that little bastard!"

As he spoke, he yanked out over a dozen pills from his robes—pitch-black as ink, covered in sinister crimson patterns.

Then, without hesitation, he swallowed them all in one gulp.

Divine Prohibition Pills.

Forbidden pills concocted by the Divine Court in secret.

They could, in a single instant, squeeze out every last drop of a person's potential.

Unleashing power ten times, even dozens of times greater than normal.

The price? Complete destruction of one's cultivation. Becoming a cripple forever.

But Ye Canglan no longer cared.

His son was dead.

What use did he have for his cultivation now?!

His only thought now was to kill Lin Yuan.

At any cost.
