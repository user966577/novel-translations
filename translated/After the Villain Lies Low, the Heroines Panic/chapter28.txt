The next day, early morning.

All of Yan Jing City seemed to awaken like a giant dragon from slumber, erupting with unprecedented vitality and passion.

Countless streams of people and vehicles converged from all directions toward a single destination—

Dragon Xia Country's largest comprehensive martial arts venue: the Dragon's Nest!

Today was the day of the highly anticipated National College Martial Arts League finals!

Outside the Dragon's Nest stadium, it was already a sea of humanity, with colorful banners fluttering everywhere.

Media reporters from across the nation swarmed like sharks smelling blood, surrounding every entrance.

Long-range cameras and floating drone cameras nearly blotted out the sky.

Inside the venue, every seat was filled!

The massive stadium, capable of holding a hundred thousand people, was now packed with frenzied spectators and martial arts enthusiasts!

The roar of the crowd threatened to tear the Dragon's Nest's dome right off!

"The finals are finally here! So exciting! Today is definitely going to be a clash of titans!"

"I know, right! The quality this year is off the charts! In previous years, a fifth-level Marrow Cleansing could compete for the championship. This year? Without sixth level, you can't even touch the finals bracket!"

"Who do you think will win the championship today?"

In the stands, countless people discussed excitedly.

In the front-row VIP section, several senior commentators from major martial arts media outlets were engaged in heated analysis.

"If you ask me, the favorite for the championship has to be that monster from Imperial Military Academy, Qin Zhan!"

A bespectacled commentator spoke with certainty. "Twenty-one years old, Marrow Cleansing Realm eighth level! And rumor has it he cultivates the Profound-rank supreme killing technique 'Dragon Elephant Prison-Suppressing Art.' One punch from him could flatten an armored vehicle into a pancake! Absolutely inhuman!"

"I disagree."

"Magic City Martial Arts Academy's Liu Ruyan is equally formidable! Though she's only at Marrow Cleansing seventh level, her movement technique 'Phantom Light Steps' is eerie and unpredictable, and her 'Soul-Chasing Life-Reaping Sword' is fast beyond measure! Qin Zhan may be powerful, but he might not even be able to touch the hem of her clothes!"

A female commentator beside him shook her head, offering a different view.

"Hey, you're all forgetting about War God Academy's Shi Lei!"

Another rotund commentator chuckled. "That guy's only at sixth level, but his 'Bright King Glazed Body' is absolutely broken! In the match a few days ago, he tanked a seventh-level expert's barrage for half an hour, then wore the guy down until his spiritual power was completely drained. Pure tank and turtle combo—gives everyone a headache!"

"These candidates are indeed all championship favorites..."

Just as everyone nodded, marveling at these top talents, the bespectacled commentator changed the subject.

"However, if we're talking about the biggest topic and the biggest wild card of this tournament, it has to be Capital Martial Arts Academy's—Ye Xuan!"

The moment that name was spoken, everyone's spirits lifted!

"Exactly! That Ye Xuan! Absolutely the biggest dark horse of this tournament!"

"Who wouldn't say so! From an unknown second-level Marrow Cleansing, he's fought his way through, growing stronger with each battle. He's got to be at least fourth level now! And his fighting style is like a madman's—utterly fearless!"

"I heard he's from a grass-roots background too, no backing at all! Now that's a true inspirational story—a Child of Destiny!"

"Tsk, too bad. If that even more monstrous Lin Yuan from Capital Martial Arts Academy had entered the competition, what chance would any of them have? One look from him and the match would probably be over."

"Shh! Don't mention that name! That's not even the same dimension! Let's discuss mortals instead!"

Amid the overwhelming chatter—

The lights in the venue suddenly dimmed!

A massive spotlight beam struck the competitor entrance!

Stirring music resounded through the stadium!

"Ladies and gentlemen!"

"Let us welcome our finals competitors with the warmest cheers—take the stage!"

The host's voice, amplified by the sound system, reached every corner!

"First up! From Imperial Military Academy! The future War God of the military! Qin Zhan!"

A powerfully built young man with a cold face and an aura of iron-blooded dominance strode out.

Just standing there, he gave off a suffocating sense of oppression!

"Second! From Magic City Martial Arts Academy! The rose of the night, the sprite of the arena! Liu Ruyan!"

Under the lights, a woman in red combat attire appeared in one corner of the stage—lithe, graceful, and devastatingly beautiful—moving like a phantom, a lethal smile on her lips.

"Third! From War God Academy! Absolute defense, immovable as a mountain! Shi Lei!"

A man over two meters tall and built like a brown bear stepped forward, each footfall making the stage groan heavily, giving an impression of unshakeable solidity.

Competitors took the stage one after another, each one a dragon among men, a child of heaven!

And when the final competitor was about to appear, the crowd's cheers reached an unprecedented peak!

"Finally! Let us welcome the tournament's biggest dark horse! The comeback king! From Capital Martial Arts Academy—Ye Xuan!!!"

Amid the thunderous roar—

Ye Xuan, clad entirely in black, slowly emerged from the tunnel.

He bathed in the spotlight's glare, under the gaze of millions filled with worship, awe, and fervor.

An unprecedented sense of satisfaction and pride filled his chest!

This—this was everything he wanted!

This—was the stage that belonged to him, Ye Xuan!

He raised his eyes, his cold gaze sweeping over Qin Zhan, Liu Ruyan, and the others on stage, a smirk of arrogance forming at his lips.

Eighth-level Marrow Cleansing?

Bright King Glazed Body?

A bunch of chickens and dogs!

Now he had reached Marrow Cleansing Realm fourth level!

Once he claimed the championship tonight and obtained that generous reward sufficient for another breakthrough—

The gap between him and Lin Yuan would be completely erased!

"Lin Yuan! You coward!"

"While you cower in your estate trembling with fear, watch this!"

"Today, I will become a legend in this very place!"
