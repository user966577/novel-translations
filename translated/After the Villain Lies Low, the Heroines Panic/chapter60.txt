Chen Family, quiet room.

After returning home, Chen Ruoxi didn't even have time to change out of her plain dress still damp with cold before rushing straight here.

Her heart was filled with unprecedented excitement and anticipation!

She looked at the short sword in the refining cauldron, its spiritual light dimmed from failure, took a deep breath, and forced her wildly beating heart to calm down.

Failed products had no more value.

With a casual wave, she retrieved from her storage ring a fist-sized piece of pitch-black Profound Iron.

This was the highest quality refining material she possessed.

Before, she never would have been willing to use it.

But now, she had a confidence she'd never felt before!

"Essence blood as a guide..."

She murmured to herself, recalling every word Lin Ke'er had relayed.

Then, without the slightest hesitation, she pressed two fingers together like a blade and lightly sliced her own fair finger.

A single drop of scarlet blood, faintly luminescent, seeped from the wound.

Carefully, gently, she let this drop of essence blood fall onto the Profound Iron.

Hiss—

The instant the essence blood contacted the Profound Iron, a soft sound emerged.

Like red-hot metal plunged into ice water.

A wondrous sensation of blood calling to blood instantly flooded Chen Ruoxi's heart.

She could feel a faint, barely-there connection forming between herself and this piece of Profound Iron.

It worked!

The first step worked!

Chen Ruoxi's heart surged with joy, but she didn't dare slacken for even a moment.

She immediately sat cross-legged, hands forming seals, as the obscure and complex "Spirit Condensation Incantation" from the "Celestial Craftsmanship Compendium" surfaced in her mind.

"Spirit Condensation Incantation, nurturing..."

Her divine sense, like an invisible, warm stream, slowly flowed into the Profound Iron.

Following Lin Yuan's method, she also added several century-old spiritual herbs matching the Profound Iron's attributes as "nourishment."

Then came the long, tedious nurturing process.

One day.

Two days.

Three days.

For three full days and nights, Chen Ruoxi didn't sleep, didn't eat, didn't drink.

All her focus, all her divine sense, all her spiritual energy was poured without reservation into that Profound Iron.

Finally!

At dawn on the third day, the instant the first ray of sunlight streamed through the window lattice into the quiet room!

Hum—

The Profound Iron in her palm suddenly emitted a clear, resonant hum!

A faint yet crystal-clear wave of life energy transmitted from deep within the Profound Iron!

An artifact spirit!

It was the fluctuation of an artifact spirit!

Chen Ruoxi's eyes snapped open, those cold, clear orbs erupting with unprecedented, dazzling light!

She cradled the warmly radiating Profound Iron, feeling that newborn, naive spirit fluctuation—so full of dependence and closeness toward her.

The shock in her heart was like towering waves, nearly drowning her rationality entirely!

She'd done it!

She'd actually done it!

The bottleneck that had plagued her through countless sleepless nights—just like that, so easily, it was broken!

And all of this was because of that man's casual, offhand guidance!

Lin Yuan...

That name was once again branded, deeply, into the very depths of her soul.

That man wasn't just unfathomably powerful in cultivation, like some god or demon.

Even this vast and profound art of artifact refining was like child's play in his eyes!

A single casual word of guidance had solved what baffled her—this so-called "artifact refining genius"—for days!

This level of mastery...

This breadth of vision...

It had already far exceeded her imagination!

The gap between her and him was ten thousand times larger than she'd ever imagined!

Several days later.

Outside the Lin Family Estate.

Lin Ke'er was once again heading out, hugging a pile of formation materials.

The moment she stepped outside, she spotted that familiar figure.

Chen Ruoxi had come again.

Only this time, her face no longer held the previous anxiety and unease.

In its place was genuine, barely concealed joy and... reverence.

"Big sister Chen!"

Lin Ke'er happily ran over.

Her gaze was immediately drawn to the Profound Iron Chen Ruoxi held in her hands.

That piece of Profound Iron, once utterly ordinary, now radiated a soft spiritual glow, as if it had come alive.

"Wow! Big sister Chen, you did it!"

Lin Ke'er saw the change at a glance, letting out a cry of amazement.

Chen Ruoxi's pretty face showed a genuine smile as she nodded.

"Mm, it's thanks to you."

"Hehe, mainly it's because my brother's amazing!" Lin Ke'er lifted her chin proudly.

Then her bright, sparkling eyes rolled, as if she'd suddenly thought of something.

Instantly, countless little stars appeared in her eyes!

"Big sister Chen, you're so amazing! Then could you... could you help me refine a 'Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror'?"

"I was reading a really old formation book recently, and it said this treasure is super powerful! Not only can it help with formations and multiply their power many times over, it can even warn you of danger in advance!"

Lin Ke'er's face was full of anticipation and longing.

However.

The words "Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror" struck Chen Ruoxi like a bolt from the blue!

She froze completely.

Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror?!

That...

That was a legendary Heaven-rank supreme-quality treasure!

According to ancient texts, refining this mirror required gathering the essence blood of nine different primordial divine beasts!

It also needed ten-thousand-year Profound Crystal as the mirror body, tempered by Nine Heavens Divine Fire for eighty-one days!

Most importantly, one had to master the long-lost divine refining technique—"Nine Dragons Become One"!

Any single one of these requirements was like a fantasy tale for her current abilities!

Forget refining it—she'd only ever seen the names of those materials in books!

Attempting a Heaven-rank supreme-quality treasure at her current level?

This wasn't just overestimating herself—it was pure delusion!

But...

When she looked at Lin Ke'er's eyes, so full of innocence and expectation, without a trace of impurity.

The words of refusal couldn't leave her mouth.

She didn't have the heart to let this adorable little girl who'd helped her so tremendously show a disappointed expression.

After a long silence.

Chen Ruoxi finally, slowly, solemnly nodded.

"Little sister Ke'er."

Her voice carried a determination even she hadn't noticed.

"This treasure is extremely, extremely difficult to refine, and the materials required are exceptionally precious."

"With my current abilities, I'm nowhere near capable."

"But..."

She looked into Lin Ke'er's eyes and made her promise, word by word.

"I will work hard! I will desperately improve my skills!"

"One day, when I can master Heaven-rank artifact refining, I will definitely! Definitely refine it for you!"
