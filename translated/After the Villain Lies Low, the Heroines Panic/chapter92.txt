And so the matter was settled.

News of the Yanjing City defense victory spread like a storm sweeping across all of Dragon Xia Nation in an instant.

The entire country was celebrating.

And the name Lin Yuan exploded onto the scene, pushing aside even the long-established titles of "Grand Marshal," "Mountain-Swallowing Martial God," and "Flying Moon Sword God."

He became the sole core, the sole legend of this epic victory!

Masterminding from behind the scenes, achieving victory from a thousand miles away!

Turning the tide without anyone noticing!

That former good-for-nothing whom all of Yanjing City had treated as a top-tier joke was, in the span of one night, completely elevated to godhood.

Yet as the absolute center of this storm.

Lin Yuan seemed to exist in a different world entirely.

His days returned to that still-water calm, even decadent tranquility.

Every day, he naturally woke well after the sun was high.

Then, attended by pretty maids.

He enjoyed the finest delicacies flown in from every corner of the globe.

In the afternoons.

He would invariably lie back in that grand master's chair in the rear courtyard, letting the sunlight wash over him, occasionally humming a little tune.

That leisurely ease.

That contentment.

All those rumors outside that nearly praised him to the heavens seemed to belong to a different world entirely from this small courtyard.

"Sigh..."

Lin Yuan sank into the chair, his very bones going soft. He lazily yawned, his thoughts drifting unhurriedly through his mind.

"The protagonist Ye Xuan from the original novel is completely cold now."

"The plot of this trashy book has been thoroughly scrambled by me into a pot of porridge. Congratulations are in order."

He knew better than anyone.

The reason he could lie here so contentedly, enjoying this luxurious peace.

Wasn't because of the great victory at Yanjing City.

And certainly not because of his current sky-high reputation.

It was because he was strong!

A kind of strong that let him look down upon and ignore most of the rules and dangers in this world.

"But it's still not enough."

His half-closed eyes suddenly flashed with an almost tangible glint of light.

"The Divine Court remains a nuisance hanging over my head."

"That so-called Divine Sovereign, though not yet fully awakened, is ultimately a massive hidden danger."

"Until I completely, cleanly erase those rats and their rat nest from this world..."

"My perfect lying-flat plan will always have an unavoidable flaw."

Lin Yuan had an utterly clear understanding of his current situation.

The Divine Court was the biggest tumor and villain within human civilization in the original novel.

But precisely because of this, their style of operation would actually be more cautious.

Especially before their ultimate trump card—that so-called Divine Sovereign—truly awakened.

Give them a hundred times the courage, and they still wouldn't dare truly tear things apart with a contemporary superpower like Dragon Xia Nation, backed by multiple Martial Gods, and launch an all-out war.

That wouldn't be revenge.

That would be rushing to reincarnate.

"So when I publicly crushed that Soul-Chasing Order, it seemed arrogant beyond measure, but I was actually drawing a clear red line for them in the most direct way."

"Telling them: don't bother me."

"And they will indeed, as I predicted, temporarily lay low, focusing all their energy on welcoming their Divine Sovereign."

"This is my opportunity."

The corner of Lin Yuan's mouth silently curved into an amused arc.

"This precious period of peaceful development."

"Is enough for my strength to climb quite a bit higher!"

However, just as this thought formed.

BOOM—!!!

A terrifying aura, ancient, domineering, and tyrannical—as if it could crush the eternal sky with one palm—descended without any warning!

The space above the entire Lin family residence began to wail under the pressure of this aura, warping violently!

The air froze, the sunlight dimmed, even the lilting little tune came to an abrupt halt!

Yet.

Lin Yuan, at the very center of this pressure, merely flipped over impatiently, turning his face to the other side.

He couldn't even be bothered to lift an eyelid.

"Ugh, here we go again..."

He mumbled indistinctly.

Before he could finish.

Hummm—!

Yet another completely different aura descended!

This aura was yin-soft and restrained, yet contained a majesty and nobility befitting an empress ruling all under heaven!

Unlike the first, which was domineering and flamboyant, this one was deep as an abyss, unfathomable!

Immediately after!

Two more auras of completely different styles, but equally powerful enough to make ordinary martial artists' livers and gallbladders burst, arrived in succession!

One was sharp, capable, and keen, as if able to see through hearts and control all wealth in the world—the queen's presence of a woman commanding a vast commercial empire!

The other was mischievous, lively, and spirited, yet secretly harmonized with countless profound formations—the aura of esoteric mysteries!

Four!

A full four terrifying pressures capable of making all of Dragon Xia Nation tremble!

At this moment, converged here together!

Transforming this small rear courtyard into a forbidden zone of gods and demons!

"Hahaha! Good! Very good!"

A rough, bold laugh like thunder rolling across the nine heavens exploded forth!

"My grandson Lin Yuan truly hasn't disappointed me!"

"Single-handedly stirring up the winds and clouds of the world!"

"This boldness is far stronger than your worthless father was back in the day!"

As the laughter echoed.

An elder with a full head of white hair but boundless vitality, his eyes more brilliant than the stars in the night sky, appeared out of thin air in the courtyard.

He was Lin Yuan's grandfather.

The legendary Martial God who had single-handedly guarded Dragon Xia Nation for a hundred years, whose fame resounded across the globe!

Lin Zhan!

"Yuan'er."

A regal, peerlessly elegant figure followed close behind.

The moment she appeared, even the domineering aura around them seemed to soften by three degrees.

She looked at Lin Yuan, her eyes clear and cool as autumn water, filled with complex emotions—pride, comfort, and a hint of gentle reproach.

"The Yanjing City matter—you handled it very well."

"But publicly crushing the Divine Court's Soul-Chasing Order was still a bit too rash."

This was Lin Yuan's mother.

A member of Dragon Xia Nation's Elder Council, publicly acknowledged as the most powerful female Elder!

Su Qin!

"Oh, Mother! You just don't understand!"

A stunningly beautiful woman wearing a high-end professional suit, with a graceful figure and a cold, queenly demeanor commanding a vast business empire, walked over with a laugh.

She moved gracefully to Lin Yuan's side, extending her delicate jade hand to intimately hook his arm.

"Our little brother here—this is called dominance!"

"It's using the most direct, most unreasonable method to tell those skulking rats!"

"Our Lin family is not to be trifled with!"
