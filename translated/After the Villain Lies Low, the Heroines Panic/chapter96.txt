Just at that moment.

Lin Yuan, lying in the chair, seemed to have slept enough.

He lazily stretched.

Then, slowly and leisurely sat up.

He glanced at the two figures standing like wooden posts at the courtyard entrance, his brow furrowing with impatience.

"Ugh, here we go again..."

"Honestly, can't a man just get a proper afternoon nap around here?"

He grumbled.

Then, under the stunned gazes of Lin Jianguo and Xiao Zheng.

The aura within his body...

Changed.

BOOM—!!!

A vast, tremendous aura suddenly erupted from within him, shooting straight to the sky!

But strangely.

This aura didn't spread outward in the slightest.

Instead, it was perfectly contained around Lin Yuan's body, as if gilding him in golden light, adding several degrees of majesty to his presence.

At the same time.

The surging qi sea within Lin Yuan finally could no longer be restrained.

Like the most violent primordial beast, it raised heaven-reaching waves and exploded completely.

The final bit of realm barrier.

Was utterly destroyed by that boundless, terrifying deluge!

Qi Sea Realm Ninth Level!

Breakthrough!

Meridian Opening Realm First Level!

Meridian Opening Realm Second Level!

Meridian Opening Realm Third Level!

Xiao Zheng's eyes went wide.

His eyeballs nearly flew out of their sockets!

What was he witnessing?!

Consecutive breakthroughs?!

How was this possible?!

And yet...

This was only the beginning!

Boom! Boom!

Two more muffled sounds, like heartbeats!

That steadily climbing aura, after a brief pause, surged again!

Meridian Opening Realm Fourth Level!

Meridian Opening Realm Fifth Level!!!

Only then did that terrifying aura finally, slowly subside.

The entire rear courtyard fell into deathly silence.

Lin Jianguo, though this Grand Marshal had weathered countless storms, now stood slack-jawed, his chin nearly hitting the ground!

He knew his son was a monster!

But he hadn't known.

His son had become monstrous to this appalling degree!

And beside him, Xiao Zheng had long since turned to stone!

His mind was a complete blank!

Every drop of blood in his body seemed to freeze solid in that instant!

Before coming, he had imagined ten thousand different scenarios of meeting Lin Yuan, but not once had he imagined this one!

As for Lin Yuan, the mastermind behind it all.

He merely yawned again, rubbing his bleary eyes.

He looked at the two dumbstruck men and spoke with a face full of resignation: "What are you staring at? Never seen someone sleep before?"

Xiao Zheng: "..."

Lin Jianguo: "..."

The air seemed gripped by an invisible hand.

Completely frozen.

Xiao Zheng's stern face, usually devoid of smiles, was now utterly rigid.

The shock in his eyes defied description.

It was the kind of utter bewilderment that comes from having your worldview shattered, stomped on, and ground up seventeen or eighteen times.

Taking a nap...

And shooting from Qi Sea Realm Ninth Level Peak straight up like a rocket to Meridian Opening Realm Fifth Level?!

This... this was still human?!

Before today, he had imagined countless possibilities.

He'd thought Lin Yuan might be an arrogant, untouchable genius with his nose in the air.

He'd thought he might be a scheming young lord with depths like the sea.

But never in his wildest dreams had he expected that the future hope of Dragon Xia he was here to recruit would be such a...

Brazenly lazy, outrageously arrogant...

Monster!

"Ahem!"

It was Lin Jianguo who finally, with great effort, came back to his senses first.

He shot a vicious glare at his rebellious son.

Then turned around and squeezed out a smile more hideous than crying at the long-departed Xiao Zheng.

"Well... General Xiao."

"Apologies for the embarrassment."

"My son... he's not usually like this."

Even as he said it, the excuse felt utterly powerless and unconvincing.

Xiao Zheng drew a deep breath, then another!

His chest heaved violently, as if trying to expel all the shock through his lungs.

He forcibly suppressed the churning waves in his heart.

As a soldier, his strong psychological fortitude allowed him to barely maintain surface composure.

He performed a formal military salute to Lin Yuan.

"Lin Yuan... schoolmate."

He had wanted to say "Young Master," but the words reached his lips and felt wrong.

In the end, he settled on the most ordinary form of address.

"My name is Xiao Zheng. Third Corps Commander of Dragon Xia Nation's Northern Guard Legion."

His voice remained steady and strong.

Only the slight tremor at the corner of his eye betrayed his extremely unsettled inner state.

Lin Yuan finally deigned to shift his gaze from his father to this uninvited guest.

He lazily raised an eyelid.

"Oh."

One word.

Not one syllable more.

Xiao Zheng's mouth twitched almost imperceptibly.

He fought back the urge to throw a punch and continued.

"I've come today to represent the military, to represent the Marshal himself, with an official invitation for you to join Dragon Xia Nation's military!"

Having said this.

He straightened his chest, his blazing gaze fixed on Lin Yuan.

The majesty and presence befitting an iron-blooded general unconsciously radiated outward.

He was certain.

No hot-blooded man of Dragon Xia could refuse this supreme honor!

However.

Lin Yuan merely dug at his ear.

Then, with obvious disgust, flicked away what he'd extracted.

"Not going."

Two more words.

Clean.

Decisive.

Without a shred of hesitation.

As if Xiao Zheng's impassioned invitation was no different from some street vendor hawking gym memberships.

"Wh-why?"

Xiao Zheng was completely dumbfounded.

This wasn't how the script was supposed to go!

The normal sequence should be: the other party acts flattered, makes a few token protests, then he presses with reason and emotion, and finally the other party tearfully agrees!

How did it just get shut down like that here?!

"Why?"

Lin Yuan laughed.

His eyes filled with pity.

"Let me ask you something, General Xiao."

He slowly stood up.

That aura belonging to Meridian Opening Realm Fifth Level, which had just settled, faintly emanated once more.

He raised a finger and tapped his temple.

"Do I look like I need those so-called resources of yours?"
