After a long while.

Lin Jianguo finally came back to his senses from that overwhelming shock.

He took a deep breath, forcefully suppressing the surging waves of astonishment in his heart.

His face revealed a complex smile, tinged with bitterness, relief, and pride all at once.

The younger generation surpasses the old!

He, the older wave, hadn't even begun to show his strength, yet it seemed he was about to be swatted onto the beach by his son's towering tidal wave!

"Alright, Dad, stop looking at me like I'm some kind of monster."

Lin Yuan waved his hand dismissively, cutting off his father's complex inner monologue.

The laziness on his face receded somewhat.

In its place was a hint of solemnity.

"The Liu family was only the beginning."

Lin Yuan gazed toward the direction of the vast Ten Thousand Mountains shrouded in the darkness of night, speaking quietly.

"Hmm?"

Lin Jianguo raised an eyebrow.

In an instant, he switched from being a father stunned speechless by his son back into the decisive, sharp-minded Grand Marshal.

He immediately understood what Lin Yuan was implying.

"You mean... the Divine Court?"

"What else?"

Lin Yuan shrugged.

Because he knew the plot in advance, he was aware that Yan Jing City would face a terrifying beast tide.

That beast tide was also part of the Divine Court's schemes.

Now that the Divine Court had suffered such a major loss at his hands, they would likely retaliate with doubled intensity. The beast tide could come early—and be far more devastating!

He had to be prepared!

"An organization capable of casually dispatching two top-tier Meridian Opening assassins—their strength definitely far exceeds our imagination."

"As Grand Marshal, you know more about this than I do!"

"They've suffered such a huge loss here, and even their chess piece, the Liu family, which they cultivated for years, was uprooted entirely."

"Do you really think they'll just let this go?"

Lin Yuan's voice was calm.

But every word struck Lin Jianguo's heart like a hammer!

Indeed!

The Divine Court!

This mysterious organization lurking in the shadows like a venomous serpent!

If they dared to assassinate the Grand Marshal's son, what wouldn't they dare to do?!

"A cornered dog will jump over the wall."

"But the Divine Court isn't a dog."

"They're a king cobra hiding in the shadows, deadly and venomous."

"Having failed once, their next retaliation will be thunderous and earth-shattering!"

"They'll use the most insane, most brutal methods to take revenge on us and intimidate anyone who dares challenge their authority!"

Lin Yuan turned his head to look at Lin Jianguo, speaking evenly.

Lin Jianguo's heart sank!

His resolute face was instantly covered with an icy, storm-before-the-calm solemnity!

He understood!

He completely understood what his son meant!

The Divine Court's next retaliation wouldn't just target Lin Yuan alone!

They would seek revenge against the entire Lin family!

Or even...

Very likely, against all of Yan Jing City!

They might use a catastrophic disaster to wash away the shame of this failure!

"You mean..."

"They'll make a move on Yan Jing City?!"

Lin Jianguo's voice became hoarse.

"Nine out of ten."

"Our Lin family is the stabilizing pillar of Yan Jing City. To strike at us, they must first throw the entire city into chaos!"

"And for rats hiding in the sewers like them, creating chaos is what they're best at—and what they love doing most."

"So, Dad, think bigger."

"Stop fixating on small fry like the Liu family."

"Our real enemies are coming."

Lin Yuan nodded.

Lin Jianguo could no longer remain calm!

Looking at his son, his tiger-like eyes held an unprecedented degree of shock!

This level of insight!

This perceptiveness!

This precise judgment of the situation!

It had far surpassed what any young man should possess!

A freak!

An absolute freak!

In both strength and wisdom!

"I understand."

Lin Jianguo nodded heavily.

His upright frame seemed to transform into a towering mountain capable of holding up heaven and earth!

An aura of iron blood, dominance, and supremacy over all burst forth from his body!

"The Divine Court..."

He slowly uttered these two words, his voice ice-cold and murderous!

"I don't care what their background is or what backing they have!"

"Since they dared to extend their claws onto Long Xia's territory, onto the heads of Lin family members!"

"Then I'll personally chop off their claws along with their heads!"

"Pass my orders!"

He turned sharply and barked into the void.

Hum—!

Two figures in black military uniforms, exuding a thick scent of blood, materialized like phantoms, silently kneeling on one knee.

Shadow Guards!

The Grand Marshal's most mysterious and elite direct forces!

Every single one of them was a killing machine who had crawled out of mountains of corpses and seas of blood, capable of fighting a thousand!

"Grand Marshal!"

Their voices rang out in unison, devoid of emotion.

Lin Jianguo didn't turn around.

He continued gazing at the dark night sky, which seemed to conceal endless dangers. His voice was like millennia-old ice.

"First, effective immediately, Yan Jing City enters maximum combat readiness! City defense forces patrol around the clock, defensive level raised to maximum!"

"Second, order the three war zones—North, West, and South—all stationed forces to immediately contract their lines toward Yan Jing City in an encirclement formation! Within a thousand li, not even a fly gets in!"

"Third, activate the Heaven's Eye system, monitoring all anomalies around the clock! Especially those A-rank and above demon beast forbidden zones—keep them under constant surveillance!"

"Fourth, notify the Council of Elders. Tell them I said Yan Jing City faces upheaval. Have them prepare!"

One order after another issued clearly and rapidly from Lin Jianguo's mouth.

Each one was enough to shake the entire Long Xia Kingdom!

This was the authority of the Grand Marshal!

With a single word, he could determine the life and death of tens of thousands!

With a single command, he could mobilize a million troops!

"Yes!"

The two Shadow Guards responded without hesitation.

Then their figures merged back into the darkness, vanishing from sight.

As if they had never appeared.

The ruins were left with only the father and son, Lin Yuan and Lin Jianguo.

Lin Yuan watched his father's swift, decisive manner—the way he could stir up the winds of the world with a wave of his hand—and nodded in satisfaction.

Having a reliable father really did put one at ease.

Many troublesome matters didn't require him to handle personally.

He only needed to speak a few words, then wait.

"Alright, orders have been given, this place is destroyed enough, time to head back."

Lin Yuan turned to leave.

"Hold on!"

Lin Jianguo called out to him.

"What?"

Lin Yuan turned back, looking impatient.

Lin Jianguo saw his son's carefree attitude and felt his eye twitch again.

He took a deep breath, trying to make his voice sound as calm as possible.

"You... be honest with me."

"What is your actual cultivation level right now?"

This question had been weighing on him for a while!

One stomp that leveled hundreds of Liu family elites!

One finger that broke through a Gang Transformation expert's ultimate attack!

A single thought that deployed a barrier that even Meridian Opening assassins couldn't approach!

Was this...

Was this really something a Qi Sea Realm cultivator could do?!

He felt like his entire understanding of martial realms was about to be completely overturned by his own son!

"You wouldn't understand even if I told you."

"The path I walk isn't the path of ordinary martial artists."

Lin Yuan shrugged.

"..."

Lin Jianguo fell silent once more.

Not the path of ordinary martial artists?

That was certainly true!

Judging by Lin Yuan's performance, where did he resemble an ordinary martial artist at all?

He was utterly astounded!
