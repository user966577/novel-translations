And so, several more days passed.

On this day.

Chen Ruoxi conquered another profound, difficult section.

BOOM—!!!

Within her Sea of Consciousness, it felt as if universes were forming, stars being born!

All those artifact-refining challenges that had once plagued her, leaving her utterly baffled—now melted away like snow in sunlight, dissolving effortlessly!

So spiritual power circuits could be constructed this way!

So material fusion didn't have to follow the rules of elemental harmony and opposition!

So the so-called "artifact spirit"—it could be... created from nothing!

Her worldview, in that moment, was utterly overturned!

She was like an elementary student who had just learned addition and subtraction, suddenly handed a complete calculus answer key!

No—this was ten thousand times more astounding than calculus!

This was the realm of the divine!

Chen Ruoxi slammed the tome shut!

She dared not read further!

She feared her divine soul would burst from that boundless ocean of knowledge!

She panted heavily, her chest heaving.

That cool, composed face was now flushed with an almost feverish red.

That was the ultimate excitement, the ultimate shock!

For a long while.

She finally managed to calm her racing heart.

Her gaze fell once more upon the tome's cover.

"Celestial Craft Illustrated."

These four characters were no longer mere words in her eyes.

They were a key—to the supreme divine realm!

And the one who had given her this key...

"Lin Yuan..."

She murmured his name again, unconsciously.

The name seemed to carry some kind of magic.

Making her overexcited thoughts gradually grow clear.

Practice!

She must practice immediately!

Only by putting her hands to work could she truly experience even a fraction of this sacred text's mysteries!

Chen Ruoxi shot to her feet!

She scanned her surroundings.

Her gaze quickly locked onto an ornamental bronze crane incense burner in the corner of her sitting room.

It was an ordinary item.

Crude workmanship, no spiritual fluctuations—its only value was looking decorative.

Before, she wouldn't have given it a second glance.

But now...

In her eyes, that incense burner had become a pile of base materials to be disassembled and reassembled at will!

"You'll do!"

Chen Ruoxi's beautiful eyes blazed with unprecedented fervent light!

She strode to the incense burner without hesitation and extended her fair jade hand.

HUM—!

A wisp of pale blue, slightly chilly spiritual power flowed from her palm.

This was her natal spiritual power—ice-attribute.

In the past, she'd always believed this attribute was only suited for refining ice-type artifacts.

But just now, in the "Celestial Craft Illustrated," she'd seen a theory that shattered her worldview.

All things can serve as foundation, all methods can serve as function!

"Disassemble!"

Chen Ruoxi uttered a low command!

Following a basic illustrated method she had just comprehended, she controlled her spiritual power like countless fine silver needles, instantly piercing into the bronze incense burner's interior.

The next second!

Something miraculous occurred!

That solid bronze incense burner made no sound whatsoever, silently decomposing into a cloud of the purest bronze powder, floating in midair!

Meanwhile, the impurities within were frozen into tiny ice crystals by her ice-attribute spiritual power, falling to the ground with a pitter-patter!

Purification!

In merely a single breath, she'd completed a purification step that would have taken her hours before, requiring earthfire and various auxiliary materials!

And the purity of purification was a hundred times higher than any previous attempt!

"Heavens..."

Chen Ruoxi couldn't help but gasp!

She suppressed her inner joy, drew a deep breath, and began the next step.

"Reassemble!"

Her hands traced mysterious, elegant patterns through the air!

The floating bronze powder, as if pulled by some mystical force, began rapidly reconverging!

This time, they no longer took the shape of an incense burner.

Instead, they gradually outlined in midair... the form of a hairpin!

"Solidify!"

Chen Ruoxi's forehead was already beaded with fine perspiration.

At her current cultivation level, performing such precise manipulations simultaneously put enormous strain on her divine soul and spiritual power!

But her eyes blazed with frightening intensity!

HUM—!!!

As her final hand seal formed!

The hairpin floating in midair suddenly blazed with brilliant azure light!

A clear spiritual power fluctuation, belonging to a magical artifact, instantly permeated the entire sitting room!

It worked!

It really worked!

She had actually used an ordinary incense burner, bare-handed, in just a few minutes, to refine a simple magical artifact!

Chen Ruoxi extended her hand, and the azure hairpin drifted gently into her palm.

Cold to the touch.

She could feel that though this hairpin was only Profound-Rank lower grade.

The spiritual power circuits within it were more mysterious, more perfect than any Profound-Rank upper grade artifact she had ever seen!

Simply by infusing spiritual power, it could activate a respectable protective ice shield!

"I... I did it..."

Chen Ruoxi stared blankly at the hairpin in her hand.

Her eyes, unknowingly, had grown moist.

She slowly clenched her fist.

That "Celestial Craft Illustrated," that bronze hairpin, and that figure lounging lazily on the couch...

It all felt like a dream.

A dream she dared not even dream—the most beautiful dream!

"Lin Yuan..."

She pressed the cool hairpin tightly against her chest.

"What kind of person are you, really?"

"What exactly did you intend... by giving me this treasure?"

She couldn't understand.

Couldn't guess.

But one thing she was absolutely certain of.

From today on, her life would be utterly transformed—because of that man!

Meanwhile.

The humiliation Chen Yu suffered at Lin Yuan's hands festered in his heart.

Like a venomous snake gnawing at him.

Every time he recalled the scene at the banquet—himself prostrated like a dead dog before Lin Yuan—he felt a bone-piercing shame.

That was simply the greatest stain of his life, a disgrace he could never wash away!

"Lin Yuan! I will make you pay!"

He raged in his room, his fist smashing viciously into the wall.

A deep crack instantly appeared on the wall.

He knew that with his own strength, he couldn't possibly match Lin Yuan.

The power Lin Yuan had displayed so casually was beyond his comprehension.

But he refused to accept it!

He absolutely refused to let it go!

"Right—the Wilderness Hunt!"

Chen Yu's eyes lit up.

The Wilderness Hunt was a grand event jointly hosted by Yan Jing City's major aristocratic families.

Every year, large numbers of young scions entered the wilderness depths to hunt demonic beasts and temper themselves.

The wilderness was vast and boundless, overrun with demonic beasts, including some of terrifying power.

Each year during the hunt, geniuses fell within, dying to demonic beasts or consumed by other dangers.

Chen Yu's eyes flashed with viciousness.

Opportunity!

This was the perfect chance for revenge!

In the wilderness, everything was unpredictable.

With proper planning, even if Lin Yuan had heaven-reaching abilities, he might not emerge unscathed!

He steeled his resolve—during the hunt, he would make Lin Yuan pay dearly, washing away his shame!

Chen Yu began secretly contacting other aristocratic scions.

First to come to mind was Liu Mingxuan.

Though Liu Mingxuan outwardly showed wariness toward Lin Yuan, Chen Yu knew that Liu Mingxuan's interest in Chen Ruoxi—and the public humiliation Lin Yuan had dealt him—must have bred resentment.

Such hatred was enough to make them temporary allies.

Deep in the night, Chen Yu slipped out of the Chen estate.

He arrived at a secluded teahouse where Liu Mingxuan was already waiting.

"Young Master Liu!"

Chen Yu lowered his voice, his face wearing a fawning smile.

Liu Mingxuan held a teacup, taking a light sip, his expression carrying a hint of disdain.

He naturally looked down on trash like Chen Yu, but to deal with Lin Yuan, he could temporarily make use of him.

"Chen Yu, what brings you here?"

Liu Mingxuan's voice held a note of arrogance.

Chen Yu embellished his plan, painting Lin Yuan as an arrogant, eyes-above-everyone fool who even disrespected the Liu family.

"Young Master Liu, that Lin Yuan is far too arrogant! He dared to humiliate me in public, and didn't even give the Liu family face! If we don't teach him a lesson, he'll only become more insufferable!"

Chen Yu ground his teeth.

Hearing this, Liu Mingxuan's eyes flashed with a sinister glint.

Though he thought Chen Yu was exaggerating, the fact that Lin Yuan had caused the woman he had his eye on to show such "strange fascination" in public did leave him displeased.

"What do you propose?"

Liu Mingxuan set down his teacup, a hint of interest in his voice.

Seeing Liu Mingxuan's interest, Chen Yu's heart leaped with joy. He immediately laid out his entire plan.

"The Wilderness Hunt! Young Master Liu, in the wilderness, anything can happen! We can..."

The two conspired in the dim teahouse.

They subsequently contacted other family scions—most of whom had grievances with Lin Yuan or resented his dominance.

Among them were even some from first-tier families.

"When the time comes, even if Lin Yuan has heaven-reaching abilities, he won't make it out of the wilderness alive!"

Chen Yu's eyes blazed with crazed light.

Liu Mingxuan merely gave a cold laugh.

He was confident that with so many joining forces, no matter how strong Lin Yuan was, he wouldn't escape!
