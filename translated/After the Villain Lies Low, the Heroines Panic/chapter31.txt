Silence!

After a full ten seconds of deathly silence!

The entire Dragon's Nest stadium was instantly engulfed by an unprecedented wave of frenzy, like a volcanic eruption!

"Holy shit—!!!"

"What did I just see?! One punch! Just one fucking punch! A veteran powerhouse at Marrow Cleansing sixth level was insta-killed?!"

"You're telling me a Marrow Cleansing second level did that kind of damage? You call that second level? That's clearly a prehistoric beast wearing a second-level disguise!"

"Too terrifying! Too insane! What kind of monster is this Ye Xuan? Wasn't he just at Marrow Cleansing second level recently? Did he level up again?"

"I know, right! That upgrade speed—even a rocket isn't that fast!"

"He definitely popped pills! No! Even pills wouldn't make him this strong! He must have used some forbidden secret technique!"

"Who cares what he used! Winning is what matters! From today on, I'm Ye Xuan's die-hard fan! So damn hyped!"

Countless spectators, faces flushed with excitement, screamed themselves hoarse.

Those commentators who had confidently predicted Ye Xuan would be eliminated here now looked like they'd been slapped hard across the face.

Their cheeks burned, eyes filled with shock and disbelief.

Ye Xuan!

In this moment, that name had completely ignited the entire venue!

He was no longer just a dark horse—he was a primordial beast capable of crushing everything!

Inside the VIP box.

Unlike the frenzy outside that threatened to tear off the roof, it was so quiet here you could hear a pin drop.

Lin Yuan maintained his lazy posture.

But those originally bored eyes now narrowed slightly, his brow furrowing almost imperceptibly.

He wasn't shocked by Ye Xuan's power, of course.

In his eyes, forget Marrow Cleansing fourth level—even if Ye Xuan ascended on the spot and became some earthbound immortal, he'd still be nothing more than a slightly stronger ant.

The reason he frowned was that he'd detected something... discordant in the punch Ye Xuan had just unleashed.

That power appeared wild and formidable.

But to Lin Yuan's perception—which rivaled divine insight—it seemed chaotic and unstable.

Like a shoddy engine forcibly fed the highest-grade aviation fuel.

On the surface it roared thunderously, but internally the components were on the verge of collapse, ready to explode at any moment.

"Interesting..."

Lin Yuan's lips curved into an amused arc.

He could clearly sense that Ye Xuan's life essence was being burned and squandered at a visible rate.

That power didn't belong to him at all.

It seemed more like... something forcibly catalyzed by an external force.

"I see."

Lin Yuan's gaze seemed to penetrate space, penetrate Ye Xuan's flesh and blood, and see directly into the depths of his Sea of Consciousness.

That trembling yet outwardly calm ancient soul.

The Supreme Dao Ancestor!

So it was that old thing playing tricks.

At the same time, he detected a familiar scent from Ye Xuan's violent spiritual energy—the medicinal aura of the Huangfu family's pills.

Thousand-Year Fire Lingzhi?

Tsk tsk. To raise a dog that could bite, the Huangfu family had really invested heavily.

One burning life, one providing fuel.

Their coordination was quite synchronized.

Unfortunately...

In the end, it was just crooked methods that couldn't be brought into the open.

In Lin Yuan's view, the current Ye Xuan wasn't a martial artist at all.

He was more like a puppet controlled by two external forces!

Paying the price of his future, burning his soul, performing what he thought was a comeback masterpiece.

Laughable, and pitiable.

"This is getting... increasingly boring."

Lin Yuan shook his head, the flicker of interest in his eyes quickly fading.

He'd thought this Child of Destiny might bring him some different entertainment.

Instead, it was just the same old "grandpa in the head" plus "treasure delivery boy" cliché.

He didn't even have the desire to keep watching.

Just then, Gu Ningxue pushed open the door and walked in.

She had just finished her second-round match—another effortless one-move kill.

"It's chaos out there."

Gu Ningxue walked over to the sofa and sat down.

Without a word, she grabbed a bottle of Spirit Spring Water and chugged it down, treating the place like her own home.

A few seconds later.

She tossed the empty bottle aside and, catching her breath, said, "That Ye Xuan is a bit stronger than I expected. There's something strange about his power."

As a seventh-level Marrow Cleansing expert, she could naturally see some clues.

But her perception was far less terrifying than Lin Yuan's.

She could only vaguely sense something was wrong with Ye Xuan's power, unable to see through its essence.

"Strong?"

Hearing this, Lin Yuan chuckled as if he'd heard a joke.

"That's not strong. That's courting death."

He glanced at the arena below.

At Ye Xuan, basking in the spotlight, enjoying the crowd's cheers, his face full of arrogance and self-satisfaction.

His tone was flat, as if stating a simple fact.

"Every punch he throws now is another nail in his own coffin."

Lin Yuan's voice wasn't loud, but every word struck Gu Ningxue's heart like a hammer.

She whipped her head around, beautiful eyes filled with shock!

What did he mean?

He could actually see through Ye Xuan's situation so clearly?!

"Care to be more explicit?"

Gu Ningxue's interest was piqued.

"Just watch and you'll see!"

Lin Yuan yawned.

Facing this riddle of a man, Gu Ningxue knew she wouldn't get any more out of him.

Lin Yuan said nothing more.

When he looked back at that imperious figure below the arena, his gaze had completely changed.

Into a complex mix of pity and disdain.

A genius who thought he'd reached the summit, not knowing that beneath his feet lay an abyss ten thousand zhang deep.

And all this truth...

Was seen through at a glance by the lazy man in the box.
