Meanwhile.

At the highest point of the Dragon's Nest stadium, in a VIP box with a perfect view and extreme luxury—

Lin Yuan was lazily reclining on a soft leather sofa.

Through the massive one-way floor-to-ceiling window, he gazed with little interest at the ant-sized arena below.

His table was laden with rare spirit fruits and pastries, while two pretty maids stood respectfully nearby, ready to attend to him at a moment's notice.

He was here purely to find a different place to sleep.

Just then, the box door was gently pushed open.

A dashing, striking figure swept in with a pleasant fragrance.

It was Gu Ningxue.

"Oh my, Young Master Lin. I thought you really had no interest in this 'kiddie playdate' game?"

Gu Ningxue crossed her arms and walked over to him with a smile, her tone full of teasing.

She had also changed into a sleek black martial attire today, outlining her stunning figure to perfection.

Her long hair was tied up high, giving her a heroic air.

"Can't be helped. Gotta keep up appearances." Lin Yuan yawned and gestured at the sofa beside him. "Sit."

Gu Ningxue didn't stand on ceremony, sitting down beside him and popping a purple grape into her mouth.

Her beautiful eyes roamed, watching the arena below, and she asked, "So? Any thoughts on today's matches?"

"None."

Lin Yuan's answer was as brief as ever.

"What about... Ye Xuan?"

Gu Ningxue's gaze fell on that black-clad figure currently basking in the crowd's adulation, brimming with confidence. "He's the hottest favorite for the championship right now. Do you think he can win today?"

Ye Xuan?

Deep in Lin Yuan's eyes, a hint of amusement flickered.

He mused to himself.

This guy, without me as his "ATM" providing massive resources, had certainly had a much rockier early development than in the original novel.

Still, he was the protagonist of this book after all—fate's favored son.

Even without me, his heaven-defying luck probably led him to some new fortuitous encounter in some obscure corner.

Making it all the way to the finals was proof enough.

He was rather curious to see how far this Child of Destiny, whose wings he had clipped as a butterfly effect, could ultimately go.

His inner thoughts raced, but Lin Yuan's verbal response remained that lazy, contemptuous drawl.

"Ye Xuan?"

"Just a defeated opponent. Nothing to see."

Gu Ningxue was amused by his boundless arrogance.

She knew, of course, that Lin Yuan had every right to say such things. But she wasn't here today just to chat.

She was the captain of Capital Martial Arts Academy's team. Today, she too had to compete.

According to the original plot, this National League championship was to be decided between Ye Xuan and Gu Ningxue.

Though Gu Ningxue was at Marrow Cleansing seventh level, higher than Ye Xuan at the time—

And she had also cultivated the Gu family's secret Earth-rank upper-grade technique, the Glazed Snow Heart Sword Art.

Her swordsmanship was quite accomplished and formidable.

But in the final showdown, Ye Xuan would trigger his protagonist halo and break through mid-battle.

In the end, he would narrowly defeat Gu Ningxue and claim the championship, stepping onto the second peak of his life.

But now, the plot had been completely derailed by Lin Yuan.

Without the pile of resources, Ye Xuan had stumbled his way here through unknown fortuitous encounters.

But his foundation was shaky, his combat power far below his same-stage self from the original novel.

Meanwhile, Gu Ningxue remained that steadily progressing seventh-level Marrow Cleansing genius.

One waning, one constant—if Ye Xuan wanted to win?

Hard as climbing to heaven!

Lin Yuan looked at this heroic woman beside him, who seemed to have developed quite a fondness for him, and for once felt moved to offer some guidance.

After all, having her give Ye Xuan a good beating was indirectly venting his own frustrations. Why not?

He casually picked up a spirit fruit and said between bites, in an offhand tone:

"The people down there—Qin Zhan, Liu Ruyan, whoever—none of them are a threat to you."

"Just keep an eye on that Ye Xuan."

"That guy's like a cockroach that won't die. He's got plenty of tricks up his sleeve. Don't get careless and capsize in the gutter."

Gu Ningxue was slightly startled.

She hadn't expected Lin Yuan to say this to her.

Though it sounded like a casual remark, she knew that with Lin Yuan's vision and strength, every assessment he made carried immense weight!

She looked at Lin Yuan seriously and nodded solemnly.

"I understand."

With that, she took a deep breath and rose from the sofa.

"Well then, I'm off."

"Go! I'm rooting for you!"

Gu Ningxue turned and left.

Her upright back carried an air of unyielding resolve.

Lin Yuan sank deeper into the sofa, found a more comfortable position, and casually picked up a Cloud-Peak Immortal Cake, slowly popping it into his mouth.

Sweet but not cloying, melting on the tongue, brimming with spiritual energy.

Mm, not bad.

As for the matches below?

Consider them...

After-dinner entertainment—a monkey show.

Inside the Dragon's Nest stadium, as all competitors took the stage, the atmosphere was pushed to its absolute peak!

"Ladies and gentlemen! Distinguished guests!"

The host's voice, carried by the top-tier amplification formation, rang crystal clear in every corner, brimming with passion and infectious energy.

"The moment we've all been waiting for has finally arrived!"

"The National College Martial Arts League finals—officially begin!"

BOOM——!!!

Cheers erupted like thunder, threatening to tear the entire dome apart!

Countless spectators leaped to their feet, waving their arms, screaming the names of their favorite competitors!

Above the arena, a giant light screen lit up.

Names and portraits of competitors began scrolling rapidly!

"First round draw—begin!"

All eyes locked onto that screen!

Seconds later, the screen froze.

The first matchup was clearly displayed for all to see.

【Capital Martial Arts Academy · Gu Ningxue VS Tiannan Martial Arts Academy · Zhao Wenwu】

"Ooh! The first match is our Capital Martial Arts Academy's captain, Goddess Gu Ningxue!"

"Her opponent is Tiannan Academy's Zhao Wenwu—fifth-level Marrow Cleansing, reportedly quite formidable with his 'Mountain-Splitting Fist'!"

"Hehe, this'll be good! One's a graceful and elegant sword genius, the other's a fierce and mighty fist expert!"

Under the gaze of the entire crowd, Gu Ningxue and the young man named Zhao Wenwu both stepped onto the arena.

Zhao Wenwu looked at the stunning woman across from him, a hint of solemnity in his eyes, but even more—burning battle intent!

"Senior Gu, please instruct me!"

With a low shout, he didn't hesitate and launched his attack first!
