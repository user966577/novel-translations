BOOM!!!

An aura ten times, a hundred times more violent than before erupted from Ye Canglan's body.

His flesh began to wither and shrivel.

His full head of black hair turned snow-white in an instant.

He had traded his entire life and cultivation for this brief moment of invincible power.

"Die!!!"

Ye Canglan roared again.

This time, his speed reached its absolute peak.

So fast that even Shangguan Jinghong could barely catch a fleeting afterimage.

Not good!

For the first time, Shangguan Jinghong's expression changed.

She hadn't expected Ye Canglan to be this insane.

This utterly reckless.

However—

At that very moment of crisis.

A voice boomed down from the ninth heaven—rough, bold, and brimming with absolute dominance—like thunder crashing to earth.

"Hmph! A mere traitor of the Divine Court dares run wild in Dragon Xia?!"

"Ye Canglan! Your opponent is me!"

BOOM—!!!

The instant those words fell.

A towering figure, seeming large enough to hold up heaven and earth, plummeted like a meteor and slammed down directly in front of Ye Canglan.

CRASH!!!

The earth shook violently once more.

An enormous crater appeared out of nowhere.

When the dust cleared, a bald giant over two meters tall slowly straightened to his full height. His body was forged of steel-like muscle.

He stood bare-chested, his bronze skin covered in crisscrossing, savage scars.

Every scar seemed to tell the tale of a brutal, desperate battle.

He simply stood there.

Yet that aura of pure, overwhelming power was enough to warp the very space around him.

"The Mountain-Swallowing Martial God... Tie Kuang!"

Ye Canglan stared at the demon-like man before him, shuddering involuntarily.

Another apex Martial God of Dragon Xia.

And one renowned for strength and defense—the Mountain-Swallowing Martial God, no less.

Shangguan Jinghong alone had been enough to run him ragged.

Now Tie Kuang had arrived as well.

It was over.

Completely over.

"Shangguan, long time no see. Your sword is still as fast as ever."

Tie Kuang flashed his teeth in a grin, his laugh booming like a great bell.

"Iron Madman. Another second and that old bastard would have gotten through."

Shangguan Jinghong's voice remained cool.

"Haha! Well, I'm here now, aren't I?"

Tie Kuang laughed heartily.

Then he slowly turned his head.

Those eyes, round as copper bells, fell upon Ye Canglan.

That gaze was like looking at a dead man.

"Come on then."

"Let's see how much the Divine Court's lapdog is really worth."

"KILL—!!!"

Facing two of Dragon Xia's most supreme Martial Gods.

Ye Canglan knew he had no way out.

His withered, desiccated face—the price of consuming the Divine Prohibition Pills—was filled with endless madness and resolve.

He let out a defiant roar.

And launched his final, suicidal attack.

"A firefly's glow dares compete with the moon?"

The Mountain-Swallowing Martial God snorted with contempt.

He didn't use any fancy techniques.

He simply clenched his fist—a fist the size of a cooking pot—tight.

One punch. Thrown.

BOOM—!!!

This punch had no external release of aura.

No surge of energy.

Only the purest, most primal, most domineering... absolute power that could shatter the void itself.

Where the fist passed, space cracked apart inch by inch.

Pitch-black spatial rifts spread wildly in every direction.

This punch seemed capable of punching a hole straight through heaven and earth.

On the other side.

The Flying Moon Sword God wasn't idle either.

Her cold eyes narrowed slightly.

"Moon Falls, Stars Sink."

She spoke those four words softly.

Her voice was ethereal, distant.

Yet it carried an unmistakable sense of judgment.

HUM—!!!

That hundred-zhang divine blade, forged from ninety-nine streams of moonlit sword qi, blazed with brilliant light.

A massive, luminous moon materialized above the sword.

Then.

Countless stars, woven from the purest sword qi, slowly emerged around that moon.

The moon as guide.

The stars as formation.

A terrifying sword intent filled with killing frost and annihilation instantly locked onto Ye Canglan.

On one side—absolute, overwhelming power pushed to the extreme.

On the other—a sword formation honed to the ultimate edge of lethality.

Two apex Martial Gods, striking as one.

The combined might far exceeded the simple sum of one plus one.

Before this world-ending, cataclysmic force.

Ye Canglan's so-called power, bought by burning his very life—

Seemed so pale.

So powerless.

So laughably absurd.

"Kill me then. The Divine Court... the Divine Court will never let you go. You will face ten thousand times the Divine Court's wrath..."

"Long live the Divine Master! The Divine Court is eternal!!!"

"NOOO—!!!"

He felt it—that inescapable threat of death, resonating from the very depths of his soul.

He wanted to dodge.

He wanted to flee.

But there was nowhere to run.

No path of escape.

His body and soul were locked tight by that terrifying fist intent and sword intent.

All he could do was watch helplessly.

Watch that iron fist capable of crushing all things.

Watch that sword formation of moon and stars capable of annihilating all things.

Draw closer... and closer still.

The next instant.

Fist arrived.

Sword fell.

BOOM—!!!

A flash of white light—so blinding it defied all description—illuminated everything for ten thousand miles.

That light devoured all.

Swallowed all.

Destroyed all.

An eternity seemed to pass.

When that world-ending radiance finally faded.

The mountaintop was devastated.

The peak that had once towered high had been sheared away by thousands of meters.

On the ground remained a bottomless crater in the shape of a fist.

And another terrifying pit, crisscrossed with countless sword scars.

As for Ye Canglan?

He, along with his bitter curses and frenzied resentment, had been completely erased from existence by this apocalyptic strike.

Body and soul, annihilated.

Scattered to ash and dust.

The battle was over.

Shangguan Jinghong and Tie Kuang slowly withdrew their auras.

Their combined assault, though devastatingly powerful, had also taken a tremendous toll.

Both their faces showed faint traces of exhaustion.

However.

When their gazes fell upon Lin Yuan—who had stood watching the entire time without so much as a hair out of place—

That exhaustion vanished instantly.

Especially Shangguan Jinghong.

She understood better than anyone.

That single sword Lin Yuan had used to slay Ye Xuan—it had looked plain, unremarkable.

But the supreme sword intent within it—returning to simplicity, the great dao in its most basic form—

Even she felt inferior by comparison.

This man.

This son of the Grand General.

This young man everyone believed to be the "waste" of the Lin family.

Just how terrifying was his talent?!

Given time.

His attainments in the way of the sword would surely reach unimaginable heights.

"Young Master Lin, thanks to your intelligence, we were able to eliminate Ye Canglan, one of the Divine Court's officials, today."

Shangguan Jinghong gave Lin Yuan a slight nod, offering a respectful bow.

"Martial God Shangguan, you're too kind."

Lin Yuan waved his hand dismissively.

"Haha! Lin boy! You really know how to hide your strength!"

"That sword just now—beautiful! Way better than these old arms and legs of mine!"

Tie Kuang walked over as well, his voice still booming.

But the look he gave Lin Yuan was filled with deep respect.

"Just routine. Everyone sit down, don't get excited."

Lin Yuan waved again.

"..."

Both Shangguan Jinghong and Tie Kuang felt their mouths twitch.

Routine?

One-shotting a seventh-level Aura Transformation expert who'd taken forbidden pills?

That's routine?!

If the so-called "geniuses" out there saw this "routine" of yours—

They'd probably shatter their dao hearts on the spot and shut themselves away forever.

"Alright, let's not stand around here. This side's handled, but over there—" Lin Yuan jerked his chin toward the Yan Jing battlefield. "—things are still heating up."

Both of them sobered at his words.

Right.

The traitors Ye Canglan and his son had been dealt with.

But the real threat—

That Baleful Blood Dragon, rivaling a Rebirth Realm expert—

Was still rampaging.

With that thought, neither hesitated further.

"Young Master Lin, until we meet again."

"Lin boy, next time let's grab a drink!"

They cupped their fists to Lin Yuan.

Then transformed into two streaks of light, rocketing toward the main battlefield of Yan Jing City.
