Yan Jing City. Main battlefield.

Gold and black collided, erupting in a blinding flash of annihilation.

Lin Jianguo's massive golden fist, forged from pure concentrated aura, slammed into the world-ending beam spewed by the Baleful Blood Dragon.

BOOM—!!!

Shockwaves beyond description radiated outward from the point of impact.

The sky wailed.

The earth cracked.

Countless wolves and human soldiers locked in combat couldn't even muster a hint of resistance before being torn to shreds by the devastating aftermath, reduced to mist of blood.

In midair, Lin Jianguo's form flew backward, carving a long arc through the sky before crashing heavily into the eastern gate's wall.

CRACK!

That wall—reinforced and cast from special alloys—was smashed into a web of massive fractures by his impact.

"General!"

On the wall, countless soldiers let out horrified screams.

"Cough... cough..."

Lin Jianguo struggled to rise from the indent in the wall, spitting out a mouthful of scalding blood.

His face was deathly pale.

His dark green military uniform was torn to tatters, his body covered in wounds so deep the bone showed through.

His aura had weakened to its absolute nadir.

He had lost.

Even as an Essence Gathering Realm expert—the Grand General of Dragon Xia—facing this horror that had reached the Rebirth Realm...

He had still lost.

"ROAAAAR—!!!"

Having landed a successful blow, the Baleful Blood Dragon let out a violent, triumphant roar.

Its massive body began slowly advancing toward Yan Jing City.

Each step made the entire earth tremble violently.

Despair.

Utter, complete despair crashed over every heart like a freezing tide.

Even the General had fallen.

What could they possibly use to stop this world-ending beast?!

"Beast! I'll fight you to the death!"

Zhao Tianlong, commander of the Western District, let out a furious roar.

Drenched in blood, he gripped his notched and battered greataxe and prepared to charge the Baleful Blood Dragon in a final, desperate gamble.

"Old Zhao! Get back!" Wang Junyi grabbed him, his voice hoarse. "Going up there is suicide!"

"So what if it is?!" Zhao Tianlong's eyes were crimson. "Even if I die, I'm taking a chunk of that beast's flesh with me!"

"Fight to the death! Never retreat!"

Every soldier erupted in one final, desperate war cry.

They knew they were doomed.

But they were soldiers of Dragon Xia.

Behind them lay Yan Jing City. Tens of millions of their countrymen.

Even in death, they would die on their feet.

They would use their flesh and blood to form this final line of defense.

"ROAAAAR—!!!"

The Baleful Blood Dragon seemed enraged by these insignificant insects.

It stopped, its eyes—like blood-red lanterns—locking onto Zhao Tianlong.

A pressure so terrifying it defied description crashed down.

THUD!

Some soldiers with weaker wills collapsed to their knees under that pressure, blood streaming from every orifice.

Zhao Tianlong bore the brunt of it. He felt as if an invisible mountain was crushing him, his bones creaking under the unbearable strain.

But he was still laughing.

Wild. Defiant.

"Come on then!"

He roared with every last ounce of his strength.

The Baleful Blood Dragon's patience seemed to have run out.

It opened that maw—large enough to swallow mountains—and a dark crimson glow of annihilation began to gather in its throat.

Death's shadow fell over the entire eastern gate.

Everyone closed their eyes, awaiting the final judgment.

Lin Jianguo leaned against the ruined wall, trying to stand again, trying to charge once more. But his body refused to obey.

All he could do was watch helplessly as that annihilating beam was about to consume his most loyal soldiers.

"NOOO—!!!"

He let out an anguished, desperate roar.

But at that very moment of crisis—

A brilliant sword light, like a star plummeting from beyond the ninth heaven, tore through the darkened sky.

That sword light was impossibly fast, carrying an aura that could cut through anything, slashing viciously at the Baleful Blood Dragon.

"Roar?"

The dragon seemed to sense the danger. The energy gathering in its throat stuttered.

It whipped its head aside, narrowly avoiding the lethal strike.

SHING!

The sword light grazed past its horn, leaving a gash so deep it reached the bone on its supposedly impenetrable scales.

A spray of foul-smelling dragon blood erupted from the wound.

"GRAAAAAH—!!!"

The searing pain made the Baleful Blood Dragon let out a howl of agony.

This sudden turn of events left everyone stunned.

Who?

Who could possibly wound this terrifying monster?!

They looked toward the source of that sword light. A graceful figure, long sword in hand radiating cold brilliance, descended from the sky and landed steadily on the wall.

The newcomer wore white robes purer than snow. Features beyond compare. An aura cold as frost. Like an immortal fairy from the Moon Palace who had descended to the mortal world.

"It's... it's the eldest young lady of the Gu family! Gu Ningxue!"

A sharp-eyed soldier recognized her and let out an incredulous cry.

Gu Ningxue!

Why was she here?!

Before anyone could recover from their shock—

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several more figures leaped onto the wall in quick succession.

One wore a form-fitting purple combat suit that accentuated her explosive curves. In her hand, a chain-blade glinted with cold light. Valiant and heroic.

"The Song family's Song Yao!"

Another daughter of the Four Great Families!

Behind them followed a group of young people in various attire, but all radiating impressive auras.

They were the young generation of Yan Jing City's great powers.

"Ningxue! That was too reckless!"

A voice, sounding somewhat delicate but tinged with anxiety, rang out.

It was Chen Ruoxi of the Chen family.

Beside her stood a girl whose expression was nervous but whose eyes blazed with unwavering determination.

"Ke'er?"

The gravely wounded Lin Jianguo's clouded eyes flickered with surprise when he saw her.

It was his youngest daughter—Lin Ke'er.

"Father!"

The moment Lin Ke'er saw her father's wretched state, her eyes reddened instantly as tears spilled uncontrollably.

"Ke'er, quickly! The Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror!"

Chen Ruoxi urged Lin Ke'er.

"Mm!"

Lin Ke'er fought back her tears and nodded firmly.

With a flip of her hand, an ancient, unassuming eight-trigram mirror appeared in her palm.

At the same time, Chen Ruoxi produced dozens of gleaming weapons—throwing knives, short swords, javelins—all of which floated around Lin Ke'er.

"Formation, rise!"

Lin Ke'er formed hand seals, chanting under her breath.

The Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror blazed with brilliant light as golden, arcane patterns flew from its surface, connecting all the weapons together into a mysterious killing formation.
