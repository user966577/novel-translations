"What's happening?!"

"The spiritual energy of heaven and earth... why is it suddenly going berserk?!"

"Heavens! Look at the sky! Those... are those rivers of spiritual energy?!"

Countless martial artists were jolted awake from their cultivation.

Countless ordinary people stepped out of their homes and looked up at the sky.

Their faces were written with expressions of shock.

They witnessed a scene they would never forget for the rest of their lives.

There, above Yan Jing City.

Thousands upon thousands of white rivers, formed from pure spiritual energy, tore through the clouds and pierced heaven and earth.

Their destinations were remarkably uniform.

Finally, above the Lin family estate, they converged into a single massive spiritual energy vortex that blotted out the sky.

That vortex rotated slowly.

With each rotation, the entire space trembled!

It was as if an ancient deity was slowly awakening at the center of that maelstrom!

At the Chen family.

Patriarch Chen Tianhao burst out of the council hall.

Looking at the apocalyptic scene in the sky, he was completely dumbfounded!

"Is this... someone breaking through?!"

"You've got to be kidding! Even an Essence Gathering expert breaking through couldn't cause such a huge disturbance!"

At the City Lord's Manor.

Several old men in brocade robes, their auras unfathomably deep, likewise stared at the sky in shock.

"The direction... it's the Lin family!"

"Could it be... Grand Marshal Lin Jianguo is breaking through?!"

"No! Grand Marshal Lin is already at the peak of Essence Gathering! If he broke through, that would be the legendary... impossible! Absolutely impossible!"

At that same moment.

Inside the Lin family estate, in the study.

Lin Jianguo, who had been handling military affairs, suddenly raised his head.

"This aura..."

He took a single step.

His figure instantly vanished from where he stood.

The next second.

He appeared in the back garden.

When he saw that the sky-covering spiritual energy vortex was centered directly on his cross-legged son.

Even with his composure as the Grand Marshal.

In this moment.

His mind went completely blank!

His mouth hung open, eyes wide as copper bells!

That resolute face was written with utter disbelief!

"This is Yuan'er... breaking through Qi Sea Realm?!"

Qi Sea Realm.

Breaking through from the sixth level to the ninth level.

In any martial artist's cultivation journey, this would only count as an ordinary, minor threshold.

Never mind someone like Lin Jianguo at Essence Gathering.

Even any random Meridian Opening or Gang Transformation martial artist.

When they broke through such minor realms, they would at most cause some slight fluctuations in spiritual energy within a few hundred or few thousand meters.

But now!

His son, Lin Yuan!

His single breakthrough had drawn the spiritual energy from the entire Yan Jing City—thousands of li in every direction!

Creating such an apocalyptic phenomenon!

This had already completely overturned Lin Jianguo's understanding!

This simply defied all reason!

This could no longer be explained by terms like "genius" or "prodigy"!

Yet.

Before he could recover from this tremendous shock.

The phenomenon in the sky underwent another astonishing change!

RUMBLE—!!!

That massive spiritual energy vortex, after absorbing a sea of heaven and earth's spiritual energy, suddenly began spinning faster!

Immediately after.

Brilliant purple rays of light burst forth from the center of the maelstrom!

That purple light was vast and endless, stretching without end!

In an instant, it dyed the western sky!

Purple Qi from the East, thirty thousand miles!

An indescribable aura—noble, vast, supremely exalted—spread from within that purple qi!

Under the shroud of this aura.

Throughout all of Yan Jing City, everyone—regardless of cultivation level, regardless of status or standing.

In this moment, felt an impulse rising from the depths of their souls—the urge to bow down in worship!

Thump!

Thump!

Thump!

In the streets.

Countless civilians and weaker martial artists could no longer withstand this pressure. Their legs went weak, and they nearly dropped to their knees in unison.

Even those who barely managed to stay standing had faces full of reverence.

Immediately after.

An even more inconceivable scene appeared.

Within that canopy of purple qi.

One after another, golden lotus flowers—constructed from the purest energy—bloomed from thin air!

Heavenly flowers rained down!

Golden lotuses sprang from the earth!

A sound—ethereal and transcendent, as if drifting down from the Nine Heavens above—began to echo softly in everyone's ears.

That celestial music carried a strange, magical quality.

All who heard it felt their minds become clear and empty, as if their very souls had received an unprecedented cleansing and elevation!

"This... this..."

Lin Jianguo stared blankly at the divine spectacle in the sky. His entire being had gone completely numb.

Purple Qi from the East!

Golden Lotuses from the Earth!

Ethereal celestial music!

His son...

Just what kind of monster was he?!

After the shock subsided.

Lin Jianguo's heart—the heart of a Grand Marshal—instantly cooled and calmed.

He knew!

Such an earth-shaking phenomenon was certainly an auspicious sign of the highest order.

But at the same time.

His son was now at the critical juncture of breakthrough and absolutely could not be disturbed by even the slightest distraction.

"Shadow Guards!"

Lin Jianguo let out a sharp bark.

HUM—!

The space behind him rippled and warped.

Dozens of black-clad figures, faces covered by cold masks, reeking of blood.

Appeared like phantoms, silent and soundless.

"Present!"

"Pass my orders!"

Lin Jianguo's voice was ice-cold and piercing, filled with unquestionable dominance!

"Lock down the entire city!"

"The Lin family estate is the center. Everything within ten li is now a restricted zone!"

"Anyone—regardless of identity, regardless of origin—who dares to trespass..."

"Kill! Without! Mercy!"

Those final four words, he practically squeezed out through gritted teeth, one by one.

The murderous intent that radiated made even the surrounding air seem ready to freeze!

"Yes!"

The Shadow Guards responded in low voices.

Then their figures merged back into the darkness.

At the same time.

The million-strong armies of the three war zones stationed outside the city also received the Grand Marshal's highest directive.

Countless iron-armored torrents began to converge and assemble toward Yan Jing City!

An invisible net—one that would make any evildoer tremble with fear—instantly enveloped the entire city!

Having done all this.

Lin Jianguo finally let out a slow breath.

"Daddy, Brother is..."

Lin Keer had already become incoherent.

"Keer, watch carefully. How much you gain from this depends entirely on you!"

Lin Jianguo spoke with profound meaning.

He turned around.

Looking at Lin Yuan, who was enveloped in a gentle purple glow, and at Lin Keer beside him, whose little mouth had fallen open into an "O" shape.

That heart of his—the heart of a father—swelled with boundless pride.

My son—Lin Jianguo's son!

Possesses the bearing of an immortal!
