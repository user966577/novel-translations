Crack.

A soft sound.

That ink-black token, concentrated with endless malice, shattered in Lin Yuan's hand.

No earth-shattering energy explosion, no flashy special effects.

It simply... broke.

Reduced to the finest black powder, swept away by the gale atop the wall, vanishing without a trace.

As if it had never existed.

As if that terrifying token representing the Divine Court's relentless pursuit was truly just a worthless plastic toy.

Deathly silence.

Atop the eastern gate wall, the thunderous cheers celebrating survival came to an abrupt halt.

Time seemed to be paused in this moment.

Everyone's movements froze in place, their expressions solidifying.

Tens of thousands of gazes were nailed to that slender figure.

Though not particularly tall, he somehow gave the impression of being able to hold up the sky itself.

The only thing left in everyone's mind was shock, bewilderment, and an indescribable... fear!

A madman!

This man was an absolute madman!

Did he even know what he had just done?!

What he crushed wasn't a token!

It was the Divine Court's face!

It was the dignity of that terrifying organization lurking in the world's shadows, looking down upon all living beings!

He was using the most direct, most arrogant, most uncompromising method to...

Declare war on the Divine Court!

"Yuan... Yuan'er..."

Lin Jianguo's lips trembled, each word squeezed out through clenched teeth.

He wanted to scold him, wanted to say "you were too rash," wanted to roar "are you out of your mind!"

But the words reached his lips and not a single one came out.

Looking at Lin Yuan's utterly calm face, his heart suddenly surged with a powerful sense of unfamiliarity.

Was this... still his son?

On the other side.

Shangguan Jinghong and Tie Kuang, these two pillars of Dragon Xia's martial world, both furrowed their brows.

This kid...

Did he really have something to rely on?

Or was he so arrogant as to not know the heights of heaven?!

The Flying Moon Sword God Shangguan Jinghong's eyes, usually cold as ice, now churned with towering waves.

As Martial Gods with a powerful nation backing them, they naturally didn't need to fear the Divine Court.

But this young man Lin Yuan!

He had actually used such a humiliating method, in front of tens of thousands of people, to grind the Divine Court's face into the dirt!

This wasn't provocation!

This was blood feud that could only end in death!

The Divine Court's revenge would surely come with unimaginable fury!

"Lin Yuan..."

"You... were too rash."

Even Shangguan Jinghong's voice carried a rare hint of hoarseness.

However, facing the concern of three powerhouses and the terrified reactions of tens of thousands of soldiers.

Lin Yuan merely dug at his ear impatiently.

"Rash? Was I?"

He turned his head, glancing at his convenient father and the two Martial Gods, breaking into a grin, utterly unconcerned.

"Look, Dad, and you two Martial Gods."

"Can't you think a bit bigger?"

"It's just the Divine Court. Just some rats hiding their heads and showing their tails. What's so scary about them?"

"If they don't come looking for me, I'd eventually have to go find them anyway. Now that they're delivering themselves to my door, isn't that saving me the trouble? I don't even have to search for their lair."

Lin Yuan's voice wasn't loud.

Yet every word struck like a heavy hammer against everyone's hearts!

Everyone's minds completely crashed!

A total blank!

This guy... he actually wants to go looking for trouble with the Divine Court?!

Does he think the Divine Court is some stray dog he can kick at will?!

"As for this Soul-Chasing Order..."

Lin Yuan curled his lip, his disdain completely unconcealed.

"Child's play."

"They can use this thing to lock onto your aura, so why can't I trace it back and find their location?"

"Too bad."

He sighed, his face full of regret.

"My hand was a bit too fast just now. Forgot to keep a trace of the aura as a lead."

"Oops, pure accident."

"..."

"..."

"..."

Lin Jianguo, Shangguan Jinghong, and Tie Kuang—the three great figures exchanged looks, completely at a loss for words.

"Alright, alright, stop looking at me like that."

Lin Yuan waved his hand impatiently.

"The guy's dead. Hurry up and clean the battlefield, everyone back to whatever you were doing."

His gaze shifted back to that massive dragon corpse, instantly blazing with interest.

"Such a huge lizard can't be wasted."

"The dragon liver—absolutely must be steamed!"

"The dragon heart—stir-fried!"

"The dragon ribs—definitely braised!"

"And this dragon whip... tsk tsk tsk... Dad, you've been looking a bit run-down lately. We definitely have to save this for you, help you recover your vitality!"

Pfft—!

Lin Jianguo nearly choked to death on the spot!

His stern face instantly turned the color of pig liver!

You're the one who's run-down!

I'm perfectly fine!!!

Watching Lin Yuan enthusiastically assess the corpse like some food connoisseur evaluating premium ingredients.

Everyone present was completely numb.

That threat capable of plunging all of Yanjing City into despair.

That imminent mad revenge from the Divine Court.

In this moment.

All seemed so laughable.

Meanwhile.

Tens of thousands of kilometers from Dragon Xia Nation.

In an unknown sea shrouded in eternal darkness and a mist of death.

A floating island carved entirely from black crystal hovered silently above the lightless waters.

At the island's center stood a dark temple piercing the clouds.

In the temple's deepest chamber.

A room of absolute silence, where even time seemed frozen.

Atop a hundred-meter-tall altar, twelve identical ink-black tokens were enshrined.

They circled a massive, indistinct divine statue, slowly rotating, emanating a terrifying aura that made one's heart palpitate.

Suddenly!

CRACK!!!

A crisp shattering sound rang out in this absolutely silent chamber, piercingly loud!

One of the twelve tokens exploded without warning!

Reduced to a handful of lifeless black powder.

Hummm—!!!

Almost at the same instant!

That vague and indistinct divine statue—its tightly closed eyes suddenly snapped open!

The entire dark temple shook violently!

A formless, indescribable aura—vast, ancient, filled with endless majesty and divinity—erupted into wakefulness from the statue!

An ancient god who had slumbered for eons, in this moment, cast its gaze upon this world!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The next second.

The void around the altar warped violently, and eleven phantasmal figures radiating different terrifying auras appeared out of thin air!

Some were wreathed in black demonic flames that could incinerate the heavens.

Some had bodies composed of the purest biting ice, freezing the very space where they stood.

Others were enveloped in endless thunder, with ten thousand thunder dragons roaring with their every movement!

These eleven figures varied in form and aura.

But they shared one thing in common!

Unimaginably powerful!

Merely standing there, the wisps of aura they released were enough to make all of space wail and submit!

They were the absolute rulers of the Divine Court, standing above billions of followers!

The Twelve Divine Officials!
