Outside Yan Jing City.

A desolate mass grave.

Two figures, like ghosts, silently stepped out of the void.

Both wore pitch-black night clothes.

On their faces were cold bronze masks without any markings.

Their bodies emitted not a single trace of spiritual energy.

As if they were two phantoms that didn't exist in this world.

One of them, slightly taller, went by the codename Ghost Owl.

Meridian Opening Realm, fifth layer!

The other, slightly shorter, went by the codename Shadow Blade.

Meridian Opening Realm, third layer!

The top assassin duo among all the Divine Court's emissaries below the Twelve Divine Officials!

Working together, they had once assassinated a peak Meridian Opening Realm powerhouse!

They were the sharpest, darkest killing blade in the Divine Court's hands!

"Ghost Owl, what do you think of this mission?"

Shadow Blade's voice was like two pieces of metal scraping together, sharp and grating.

"Just a Qi Sea Realm brat."

Ghost Owl's voice was full of disdain and arrogance. "The higher-ups are making way too big a deal of this."

"Sending both of us Meridian Opening experts together."

"Using a sledgehammer to crack a nut?"

Shadow Blade let out a cold laugh: "The Liu family paid thirty percent of their holdings. For such a price, the higher-ups naturally want to ensure nothing goes wrong."

"Besides, the target's strength and identity are both unusual."

"He's the grandson of that old bastard Lin Zhan. And I hear this guy made quite a show of himself at the Wilderness Hunt!"

"Though he's Qi Sea Realm, he supposedly has combat power rivaling Meridian Opening—truly terrifying!"

Ghost Owl's tone grew a few shades more serious.

"Hmph, so what if it's Lin Zhan?"

"Once we take that brat's head and escape far away, what can Lin Zhan do to us even with his heaven-reaching abilities?"

"True enough." Shadow Blade nodded. "Yan Jing City's defenses seem to have been strengthened recently."

"We'll need to find a way to slip in."

Ghost Owl's gaze swept toward a main road not far away.

A Liu family trade caravan was slowly approaching.

"Isn't our way in coming right now?"

A cruel smile appeared on Ghost Owl's face.

Half an hour later.

The Liu family caravan passed through Yan Jing City's gates without obstruction.

The guards on duty only performed a routine document check before waving them through.

No one noticed.

The caravan now had two extra "guards"—completely devoid of any life signs, like corpses.

Night gradually fell.

The entire city of Yan Jing was shrouded in tranquility.

Lin Family Estate.

Rear garden.

Lin Yuan maintained his unchanging posture, lounging in his personal reclining chair.

Beside him, Lin Ke'er was clutching a thick formation manual, her little brow furrowed tightly.

"Brother, this Two-Elemental Dust Formation is so hard! I just can't understand it."

Lin Ke'er pouted, her face full of distress.

Lin Yuan didn't even bother opening his eyes.

"If you can't understand it, read it a few more times."

"Use your heart to sense it. The essence of formations is the evolution of rules, not rote memorization."

"Oh..."

Lin Ke'er nodded, half-understanding.

Then she asked curiously: "Brother, didn't you say the Liu family people would come cause trouble? Why isn't there any movement at all?"

"Soon."

Lin Yuan said lightly.

"The flies have already reached the door."

"I just don't know if there are two, or more."

The corner of his mouth curved into a cold, amused arc.

He'd been waiting for these fools for quite some time now.

Perfect opportunity to test out a little something he'd recently comprehended.

Just then.

Outside the Lin family estate, in the shadows a hundred meters away.

Two black figures, like geckos, clung silently to a wall corner.

It was Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade!

They had been lurking here for a full two hours.

"The timing is about right."

Ghost Owl signaled to Shadow Blade.

"Prepare to move!"

"That brat's room is the third one to the east. Window's not closed."

"I'll take point, you provide support!"

"Finish the fight in three breaths!"

Shadow Blade nodded.

The two exchanged glances, simultaneously suppressing their auras to the absolute limit.

Then.

Their figures transformed into two barely perceptible wisps of black smoke, drifting toward the seemingly unguarded wall of the Lin family estate!

Closer!

Even closer!

Ten meters!

Five meters!

One meter!

A cruel, confident smirk of imminent success had already formed at the corner of Ghost Owl's mouth.

He could already imagine that in the next second, he would appear at the bedside of that brat named Lin Yuan.

Then, with one slash, sever his fragile throat!

However!

Just as their fingertips were about to touch that cold wall!

A sudden change!

HUM——!!!

A transparent ripple, nearly invisible to the naked eye, with the Lin family estate as its center, suddenly expanded outward!

This ripple carried no earth-shaking might.

Nor any heaven-destroying aura.

It was like the gentlest spring breeze.

But!

When this breeze lightly brushed across the bodies of Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade!

The two top Divine Court assassins suddenly went rigid!

Their pupils contracted to pinpoints!

A terror originating from the depths of their souls, enough to freeze their very spirits—like a billion primordial divine mountains—came crashing down!

"N-not good!!"

Ghost Owl's heart let out a horrified roar!

He wanted to retreat!

He wanted to flee!

He wanted to use every means possible to get away from this terrifying barrier, like a demon god's domain!

But it was too late!

That invisible pressure, like an unseen hand of a god, clamped down on their bodies!

In an instant, everything crumbled!

Pff! Pff!

Two muffled sounds.

Their bodies flew backward ten times faster than they'd come!

BOOM! BOOM!

Two thunderous crashes!

They slammed hard into a decorative rock formation a hundred meters away!

The entire structure, built from solid stone, instantly shattered into flying debris!

"Pfft——!"

Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade simultaneously spewed out huge mouthfuls of blood, collapsing like dead dogs in the rubble.

Their faces were written with utter disbelief and... terror!

They'd lost?

They hadn't even touched the Lin family wall.

And some unknown barrier had instantly left them critically injured?!

"We're exposed! Run!"

Shadow Blade's reaction was lightning-fast.

He forced down the churning blood and qi in his body, and the stabbing pain from his soul, letting out a hoarse cry.

He struggled to rise from the ground.

However.

A lazy voice, like a death knell from the depths of the Nine Nethers, slowly echoed in their ears.

"You came all this way."

"What's the rush to leave?"

"Won't you stay for some tea first?"
