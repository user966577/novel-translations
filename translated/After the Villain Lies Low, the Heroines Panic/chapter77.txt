"Daddy, did Brother... did he finish breaking through?"

By then, Lin Ke'er had also trotted over on her little legs.

She tilted her small head up, her big eyes full of adoring little stars.

"Mm, it's done."

Lin Jianguo took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing the surging waves in his heart.

He patted Lin Yuan's shoulder, and that face—frozen like a ten-thousand-year glacier—squeezed out a smile uglier than crying.

"Good! Good indeed! As expected of my son, Lin Jianguo's son!"

"Our Lin family has worthy successors! Dragon Xia Country's future is bright!"

By now, he had no idea what words could describe his son's monstrous talent.

He could only use the most plain and unadorned language to express his overwhelming pride!

"Alright, alright, Dad, stop getting emotional."

"Just routine operations. Everyone sit down, don't get worked up."

Lin Yuan waved his hand impatiently.

"..."

Lin Jianguo's mouth twitched.

Routine operations?

You call this routine operations?!

If those so-called "geniuses" out there saw your routine operations, their dao hearts would probably shatter on the spot, and they'd shut themselves away until death!

Just then.

A Shadow Guard appeared behind Lin Jianguo like a phantom, dropping to one knee.

"Report! Grand Marshal!"

"Large-scale movement of low-tier vicious beasts detected on the outer edges of the Black Wind Mountains! They're rapidly migrating toward Yan Jing City!"

"The frontier army's reconnaissance battalion reports this appears to be... a precursor to a beast tide!"

These words instantly froze the warm, slightly boastful atmosphere!

Lin Jianguo's pupils contracted sharply!

It had come!

It had really come!

Yuan'er's prediction had come true!

"Understood."

Lin Jianguo waved his hand, and the Shadow Guard vanished once more.

His expression became incomparably grave.

"Yuan'er, go rest. Leave what comes next to me."

Before he finished speaking.

His figure had already disappeared from where he stood.

Yan Jing City, City Defense Army Supreme Command.

The atmosphere was oppressively tense.

Lin Jianguo sat in the main seat wearing a dark green military uniform, his face like still water, commanding authority without anger.

Below him sat over a dozen high-ranking generals with stars on their shoulders, each exuding an aura of iron-blooded killing intent.

They were the highest decision-making body of Yan Jing City's entire defense system!

"That's the situation."

A staff officer had just finished reporting the latest intelligence from the front lines.

"The anomalies in the Black Wind Mountains are growing in scale. Although currently they're only first and second-tier low-level vicious beasts, their numbers have already exceeded one hundred thousand! And they're still increasing!"

"According to the Heaven's Eye system's energy monitoring, multiple powerful energy sources are awakening deep within the mountains!"

As his words fell.

Dead silence filled the command center.

After a moment.

A burly general with a thick beard and an apparently fiery temper slammed his hand on the table and stood up.

"What's there to fear!"

"They're just some low-tier beasts! However many come, we'll kill them all!"

"Grand Marshal! This general requests to go into battle! Give me thirty thousand elite soldiers, and I guarantee I'll slaughter those beasts until not one is left!"

This man was the Western District Commander, Zhao Tianlong!

A peak Aura Transformation Realm expert!

Renowned for his courageous fighting and fearlessness in the face of death!

"General Zhao, please remain calm."

Another general stood up—this one looked refined and scholarly, wearing gold-rimmed glasses.

"Grand Marshal, I believe General Zhao's view is somewhat overly optimistic."

"Every year when autumn transitions to winter, the Black Wind Mountains have small-scale beast tides. That's normal. But this time, the scale is so large, and the timing is early—I fear there's more to this than meets the eye."

"Furthermore, Grand Marshal, you just issued orders a few days ago to put the entire city on maximum combat readiness. Looking at it now, your judgment was completely correct!"

"We absolutely cannot let our guard down!"

This was the Eastern District Commander, Wang Junyi!

Also at peak Aura Transformation Realm, renowned for his meticulous thinking and clever strategies.

His words immediately drew agreement from some of the generals.

"Indeed! The Grand Marshal's foresight is admirable!"

"Fortunately we prepared in advance, otherwise we'd definitely be scrambling now!"

However.

There were also those with different opinions.

A thin general with sinister eyes let out a cold laugh and spoke slowly.

"General Wang, you're giving those beasts too much credit."

"In my view, this is just a slightly larger ordinary beast tide."

"As for the Grand Marshal's 'foresight'?"

He shot a pointed glance at Lin Jianguo in the main seat.

"A few days ago, Young Master Lin's breakthrough caused quite the commotion—the whole city knows about it."

"The Grand Marshal loves his son dearly, and being overly nervous is only human nature."

"But mobilizing a million soldiers for something this minor, putting the whole city on edge—if word gets out, won't people laugh at Yan Jing City for being timid as mice?"

As these words left his mouth.

The temperature in the entire command center seemed to drop several degrees.

Everyone's eyes turned in unison toward Lin Jianguo.

The thin general was the Northern District Commander, Li Mo.

A notorious old rival who had long been at odds with Lin Jianguo.

His words, on the surface, analyzed the situation—but in reality, every sentence cut to the heart!

He not only questioned Lin Jianguo's decisions but even dragged Lin Yuan into it!

Such malicious intent!

"Li Mo!"

Zhao Tianlong and Wang Junyi let out simultaneous roars of anger!

However.

Lin Jianguo merely raised his head, slowly.

In those deep eyes, there was no anger—only an icy, extreme indifference.

BOOM—!!!

An indescribable, terrifying pressure—one that seemed capable of crushing the eternal azure sky—suddenly erupted from his body.

The aura of an Essence Gathering Realm expert swept through the entire command center without reservation!

Thump!

Li Mo, who had been speaking so snidely just moments ago, didn't even have time to grunt.

His entire body felt as if an invisible divine mountain had slammed down upon him.

His knees buckled, and he crashed heavily to the ground!

The hard alloy floor was dented clearly where his knees struck!

"Are you trying to tell me how to do my job?"

Lin Jianguo's voice was very light, very calm.

But to Li Mo's ears, it was no different from a death sentence!

That icy voice, like cold wind from the Nine Nethers, instantly froze the entire command center.

Li Mo knelt on the ground, his entire body trembling violently like chaff in the wind.

His face drained of all color, deathly pale!

Cold sweat poured from his forehead like a stream.

He wanted to beg for mercy.

But he found his throat gripped by an invisible hand, unable to produce even a single syllable.

Fear!

Endless fear engulfed him in an instant.

Only now did he truly feel the absolute, chasm-like gap between himself and this Grand Marshal!

Before this power, his peak Aura Transformation cultivation was nothing but a joke!

"Grand Marshal, please calm your anger!"

"Grand Marshal, please!"

The other generals were also scared out of their wits!

They rose in unison, bowing to Lin Jianguo, not daring to breathe loudly.

Lin Jianguo ignored them.

He simply stared coldly at Li Mo, kneeling on the ground.

"I don't care what personal issues you have with me."

"But using the lives of tens of millions of citizens as chips in your political games."

"Li Mo, what audacity!"

"I'll ask you once more."

"If this isn't an ordinary beast tide."

"If the city falls."

"If Yan Jing City runs red with blood."

"Can you bear that responsibility?!"

Every word Lin Jianguo spoke struck Li Mo's soul like a ten-thousand-pound hammer.

"I... I..."

Li Mo's mouth hung open, but he couldn't utter a single word.

Could he bear it?

What could he possibly bear it with?!

"Hmph!"

Lin Jianguo gave a cold snort and slowly withdrew that terrifying pressure.

Li Mo collapsed to the ground as if granted amnesty, gasping for breath like a fish out of water.

"Pass my orders!"

Lin Jianguo's gaze swept across the room.

His voice was cold and commanding.

"First, effective immediately, the entire army enters Level One combat readiness! All soldiers on leave are to return to their posts immediately!"

"Second, activate defensive formations at all four major gates—East, South, West, and North! I want energy at maximum output!"

"Third, airship units, take to the skies! Conduct comprehensive carpet reconnaissance of the Black Wind Mountains! I want to know not just where those beasts are, but what they're doing!"

"Fourth, notify the Council of Elders—the Divine Court may have made their move! Have them prepare for the worst!"

"Is that clear?!"

"Yes, Grand Marshal!"

All the generals roared in unison, their voices shaking the heavens!

No one dared utter another word of objection!
