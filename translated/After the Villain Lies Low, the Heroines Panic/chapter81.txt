The war had entered its most intense phase.

With Lin Jianguo serving as the linchpin and the four regional commanders charging fearlessly into battle, morale among the human forces had reached unprecedented heights.

The beast tide, on the other hand, was in shambles.

Having lost their four most powerful leaders, their once-coordinated assault instantly crumbled into chaos—a scattered mess with no direction.

Though their numbers remained staggering enough to make one's scalp tingle, in the face of absolute power and sky-high morale, numerical superiority had lost all meaning.

"Kill! Kill! Kill!"

Zhao Tianlong fought like a man possessed, his mountain-cleaving greataxe carving bloody arcs through the air. Around him, corpses of beasts had piled into small hills.

Wang Junyi, Chen Beixuan, and Li Mo were no different.

They were four razor-sharp blades, plunging deep into the heart of the beast tide, tearing and rending without mercy.

The scales of victory were tipping inexorably toward humanity.

Thunderous cheers erupted from the city walls. Soldiers brimmed with fighting spirit. Those with sufficient strength joined the battle formations below, clashing directly with the beasts. Those lacking the power manned energy cannons and other weapons, contributing however they could.

They could almost see the light of victory.

And yet.

Lin Jianguo's expression remained as still as a frozen lake.

His deep-set eyes weren't watching the one-sided slaughter below. Instead, they were fixed on the distant Black Wind Mountains, shrouded in darkness.

The unease in his heart hadn't faded. If anything, it had grown stronger.

Something was wrong.

Terribly wrong.

The Divine Court—that mysterious organization lurking in the shadows, one that even he regarded with extreme wariness—had orchestrated this unprecedented beast tide of tens of millions. Was this really all they had to offer?

Just these so-called "great demons" that couldn't even survive a single punch from him?

This wasn't the Divine Court's style.

This felt more like... a test.

Or perhaps...

A grand sacrifice.

A terrifying thought exploded in Lin Jianguo's mind.

Sacrifice!

Using the lives of these tens of millions of beasts, along with all that spilled blood and accumulated resentment, as an offering!

To summon... something far more horrifying!

"Not good!"

Lin Jianguo's face changed drastically.

He spun around and bellowed at the signal officer on the wall: "Relay my orders! Full retreat! Everyone fall back to the walls! Now!"

But it was too late.

The moment his words left his lips—

RUMBLE—!!!

The entire earth began to shake violently.

The tremors were ten thousand times more terrifying than when the beast tide had first struck the gates.

It was as if some ancient horror imprisoned in the deepest pits of the Nine Nether Hells had broken free of all its chains.

And was about to return to the mortal world.

An indescribable aura!

Erupted from the deepest reaches of the Black Wind Mountains!

That aura was overwhelming. Tyrannical. Savage.

In an instant, it blanketed the entire world.

Under its oppressive weight, both the blood-soaked human soldiers and the fearless beasts alike froze in place.

Their bodies trembled violently.

Their souls screamed in terror.

This was a primal, irresistible, absolute fear—as deeply ingrained as instinct itself.

Like ants before a god.

"What... what is that..."

Zhao Tianlong's axe fell still.

For the first time, his fierce battle-hardened face showed an expression of pure dread.

He lifted his head with great difficulty.

There, on the distant horizon, a thick canopy of blood-red clouds had materialized, blotting out the sky completely.

Lightning crackled within those clouds. Pitch-black bolts of electricity writhed like serpents through the crimson haze.

Even the heavens seemed to tremble before whatever was about to descend.

Then.

A massive blood-red claw—so enormous it defied description—thrust out from the clouds.

That claw blocked out the sun.

A single talon was larger than an entire mountain.

It tore through space with casual ease.

And crashed down.

BOOM—!!!

The earth collapsed for hundreds of miles in every direction.

Countless beasts didn't even have time to scream before they were crushed into paste by that terrifying force.

A colossal claw print, bottomless and vast, appeared before everyone's eyes.

Then.

A head emerged slowly from the blood clouds—so massive it dimmed the sun and moon, drained the color from heaven and earth.

A grotesque dragon's head, covered in bone spurs and armored in pitch-black scales.

The Baleful Blood Dragon.

Its crimson eyes opened slowly, gazing down at the insignificant creatures below with cold indifference.

In that moment, the entire battlefield fell silent.

Everyone stared at this horrifying existence, suddenly aware of just how small they truly were. An icy chill rose from the depths of their hearts.

The next second.

It opened its cavernous maw and let out a roar.

"ROAAAAR—!!!"

The sound wave became tangible, sweeping toward Yan Jing City like a wave of pure annihilation.

Pff! Pff! Pff!

The four regional commanders bore the brunt of it.

Even with their peak Aura Transformation Realm cultivation, they couldn't withstand this devastating sonic assault.

All four spat out mouthfuls of blood simultaneously.

A single roar.

Had gravely wounded four peak Aura Transformation experts.

This creature's power was at least peak Essence Gathering Realm, possibly even Rebirth Realm—far beyond what ordinary men could hope to match.

Despair.

Endless despair descended upon every heart.

What could they possibly use to fight a monster like this?!

"Vile beast!"

At that moment, Lin Jianguo let out a thunderous shout.

His towering figure erupted with dazzling golden light.

The pressure of an Essence Gathering Realm expert surged skyward without restraint.

He would personally crush this abomination.

But.

The Baleful Blood Dragon merely glanced at him coldly.

Then opened its maw once more.

This time, it wasn't a sound wave.

It was a pitch-black beam of annihilation, condensed from infinite death itself.

The beam moved with impossible speed.

In an instant, it crossed the hundred-mile gap.

Aimed straight at Lin Jianguo.

Lin Jianguo's pupils contracted.

He wanted to dodge.

But he realized that the space around him had been locked down by an invisible force.

There was nowhere to run.

He could only take it head-on.

So be it!

"Break!"

Lin Jianguo roared.

He channeled every ounce of his protective aura into his fists.

That massive golden fist materialized once more, rising to meet the annihilation beam.

BOOM—!!!

In that moment, the world seemed to lose all sound and color.

Only that blinding light remained.

Gold clashing against black.

---

Lin Family Estate.

Rear garden.

Lin Yuan felt the violent shockwaves rippling through the air.

He slowly opened his eyes.

A hint of helpless resignation flickered across his gaze.

"The Baleful Blood Dragon should be making its entrance right about now. Guess it's time for this young master to take the stage... Honestly, can't they just let me be a salted fish in peace?"

He rose to his feet.

Dusted off his clothes.

Then took a single step forward.

And vanished.
