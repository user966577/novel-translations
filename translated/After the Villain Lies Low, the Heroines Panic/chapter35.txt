BOOM!!!!!

In that moment, the entire Dragon's Nest fell into an unprecedented, time-freezing silence!

Every single one of the hundred thousand spectators stood frozen in place like statues, faces filled with horror.

Their gazes locked onto the collapsed arena.

Onto the figure kneeling in the rubble, blood-soaked and utterly wretched, smashed down by a golden sword qi from the heavens.

That was...

Ye Xuan?

That imperious young demon god whose battle intent had blazed to the sky, who'd been about to kill his opponent just moments ago?

Just like that... he lost?

Felled by a sword qi from nowhere, one move, instantly defeated?!

What the hell kind of plot twist was this?!

The golden sword qi that had caused all this didn't dissipate after suppressing Ye Xuan.

It hovered above his head like the sword of Damocles, radiating pressure so terrifying it could freeze the very soul!

Just then.

At the stadium's highest point, from the doorway of a VIP box now shattered beyond recognition.

A tall figure, hands clasped behind his back, slowly stepped out from the shadows, walking on air.

Step by step, he walked through the void as if on solid ground.

He released no aura whatsoever.

But every step he took seemed to land on everyone's heart, making breath itself falter!

He wore simple casual clothes.

His features were handsome, his expression indifferent, as if everything that had just happened had nothing to do with him.

As he appeared, the deathly silence was instantly shattered!

Replaced by countless cries mixed with shock, frenzy, awe, and disbelief!

"Lin... Lin Yuan! It's Senior Lin Yuan!"

"My god! The one who struck was him!"

"Wasn't he not competing? Why is he here?!"

In the rubble, Ye Xuan struggled to lift his head.

When he saw that figure treading on air toward him, his pupils contracted to pinpoints!

Lin Yuan!

It was him again!

That bastard again!

BOOM—!!!

A pain a thousand times worse than being crushed by sword qi—humiliation and despair from the depths of his soul—flooded through him like a bursting dam!

He wanted to stand!

He wanted to resist!

He wanted to roar his fury at that lofty figure!

But—he couldn't!

Under that golden sword qi's suppression, forget standing—moving a single finger was a luxury!

He felt his spiritual power completely sealed!

His proud heart, the one that had believed itself destined by heaven—

Was being crushed underfoot by that figure, in the cruelest, most contemptuous way, ground to dust!

How could this be?!

Why?!

He'd fought so hard, burned his life, paid any price to finally stand on this stage of glory!

He'd thought he could finally stand at the same height as Lin Yuan!

He'd thought he could finally trample that bastard beneath his feet!

But the result?

Reality delivered the most resounding, most brutal slap across his face!

The gap between him and Lin Yuan hadn't shrunk at all.

Instead, it had widened to a chasm so vast that even looking up at it left him suffocating, despairing—

An abyss!

This can't be real!

This must be an illusion!

"AHHH—!"

Ye Xuan howled in silent anguish.

Trying to mobilize the Supreme Dao Ancestor's power in his consciousness, trying to burn the last of his life origin!

But before that pure, ultimate sword qi from what seemed like the divine realm.

All his struggles were so pale, so laughable.

Just then, Lin Yuan had arrived above the arena.

He looked down at that ant-like figure kneeling in the rubble, trembling.

Slowly, he spoke.

His voice was flat, not loud, but it clearly reached every corner of the stadium.

"The National College Martial Arts League has its rules."

"First, contestants are forbidden from using evil path forbidden techniques, burning their lives, and abusing external forces."

"Second, contestants are forbidden from harboring killing intent toward other competitors or attempting murder."

Lin Yuan's gaze swept slowly across Ye Xuan's face, twisted with rage and despair.

Finally, in a tone of pronouncement, devoid of emotion, he said:

"You violated both."

"According to the rules, severe punishment is warranted."

BOOM—!!!

These few words were a hundred times crueler than that sword qi!

They completely shattered the last illusion and dignity in Ye Xuan's heart!

He hadn't just lost!

He'd lost utterly! Lost all reputation!

All his previous effort, all his victories.

In this moment, became a joke! A clown who broke the rules and used forbidden arts!

"NO—!!!"

Ye Xuan let out a howl of ultimate despair.

Lin Yuan couldn't even be bothered to spare him another glance.

He simply snapped his fingers casually.

The golden sword qi hovering above Ye Xuan's head, as if receiving final orders, crashed down!

PFFT—!!!

Ye Xuan could no longer withstand this physical and mental double crushing. He sprayed a mouthful of heart's blood.

His knees gave out completely, his entire body collapsing!

Then, like a pool of mud, he crumpled into the cold rubble, losing consciousness entirely.

Lin Yuan's flat, almost cold pronouncement struck like a final hammer of judgment on every heart!

The entire Dragon's Nest remained deathly silent!

All eyes converged on that figure who had descended like a god only to fall to dust in an instant—Ye Xuan.

Cheating?

Forbidden arts?

Murder?

These words, like sharp knives, sliced the "inspirational icon," "underdog comeback" image Ye Xuan had built into pieces!

Just then, the referee and a team of medical personnel in white uniforms finally snapped out of their daze, scrambling onto the ruined arena.

They carefully skirted the golden sword qi still radiating terrifying pressure, reaching the unconscious Ye Xuan.

Leading them was an elderly man in the Martial Alliance's special robes, his aura profound.

He was this tournament's head referee, a peak Transformation Realm powerhouse of great renown!

He first glanced at Lin Yuan floating in the air.

Then crouched down, producing a jade disc that emitted soft light from his robes, and placed it gently on Ye Xuan's forehead.

HUM—!

The jade disc blazed with light!

But barely a second later, that soft white glow suddenly turned a piercing, danger-signaling blood-red!

A series of sharp, urgent alarm sounds erupted from the disc!

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!

Seeing this, the head referee's expression darkened instantly!

He shot to his feet.

Raising the jade disc, with a voice brimming with rage, he announced to the entire crowd:

"By the Demon-Breaking Spirit Disc's detection!"

"Contestant Ye Xuan's body indeed contains extremely dominating, vicious forbidden technique energy residue! His life origin is in severe depletion!"

"Such techniques harm both self and others—they are explicitly forbidden demonic evil arts by the Martial Alliance!"

"Student Lin Yuan's words are completely accurate!"

BOOM—!!!

If Lin Yuan's accusation had lit the fuse.

Then the head referee's official, irrefutable verdict was equivalent to detonating an entire armory!

The entire crowd exploded!

"Holy shit! Confirmed! It really was forbidden arts! Really was demonic techniques!"

"I knew something was wrong with him! How could some nobody's strength explode like that in such a short time? Turns out he took the crooked path!"

"Damn! Fraud! He's a complete fraud! And I worshipped him as my idol! Fuck that!"

"Some 'comeback king'! He's just a madman who'll stop at nothing to win, even throwing away his humanity!"

"Thank god Senior Lin Yuan stepped in! Otherwise Goddess Gu would've been in danger! That Ye Xuan really was trying to kill her!"

Public opinion underwent an earth-shattering reversal in that moment!

One second ago, Ye Xuan was a revered legend.

The next, he'd become a street rat everyone wanted dead!

Those fans who had cheered madly for him now wore expressions of zealotry transformed into the rage and disgust of the deceived!

In the rubble.

Several workers hauled the unconscious Ye Xuan up like a dead dog, preparing to remove him.

The head referee took a deep breath and returned to the arena's center.

His gaze swept the crowd, his voice booming:

"Contestant Ye Xuan, for using prohibited forbidden arts and harboring lethal intent toward another competitor, has severely violated league rules!"

"I hereby announce: Ye Xuan is stripped of all results and qualifications from this tournament!"

"Therefore!"

He paused, his gaze falling on that peerlessly elegant woman who had stood quietly throughout.

His voice filled with admiration.

"This National College Martial Arts League's ultimate champion is—"

"Capital Martial Arts Academy, Gu Ningxue!!!"

ROAR—!!!

Thunderous applause and cheers rose to the heavens!

This time, it was heartfelt, pure, untainted—genuine admiration and congratulations for the true victor!

Gu Ningxue stood there, bathed in infinite glory.

But her gaze wasn't on any of the cheering spectators below.

She only raised her head, quietly watching that figure standing in the void, seemingly out of place in this noisy world.

Her beautiful eyes shimmered.

Filled with gratitude, awe, curiosity...

And a trace of something even she hadn't noticed—

Admiration.
