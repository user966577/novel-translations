In the days that followed.

Lin Yuan's life finally, completely returned to that decadent, even degenerate, tranquility he had so dreamed of.

Yanjing City's savior?

Dragon Xia Nation's young hero?

These sky-high titles seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with the man lying all day in his rear courtyard grand master's chair.

He couldn't even be bothered to go to school anymore.

Regarding this, the president of Capital Martial Arts University not only voiced no complaint.

He waved his hand magnanimously and directly awarded Lin Yuan the first-ever "Lifetime Honorary Professor" badge in the university's history.

Furthermore, he sincerely expressed.

Whenever Professor Lin had a moment to spare and felt like giving the students a lecture, he was welcome at any time.

The entire university would receive him with the highest honors.

Becoming a professor before even graduating...

Now that was some treatment!

When Lin Yuan received the gleaming golden badge, he merely curled his lip in disdain.

He casually tossed it to a household maid to use as a nutcracker.

"Ah, what a boring life."

Lin Yuan sank into the grand master's chair, lazily rolling over, the sunlight stretching his shadow long.

These past few days, the System hadn't been idle.

Ding-dong notification sounds occasionally chimed in his mind.

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for lying flat for 10 hours. Reward: Profound-Rank Lower-Grade Profound Spirit Pill!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for lying flat for 3 days. Reward: Earth-Rank Top-Grade Dragon God Spear!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for lying flat for 11 days. Reward: Heaven-Rank Lower-Grade "Chaos Heart Sutra"!]

System notifications streamed continuously.

Lin Yuan couldn't even be bothered to lift an eyelid.

These items had already piled up like mountains in his System space.

For his current self, they were no different from a pile of junk.

Heaven-Rank top-grade cultivation methods and divine weapons weren't everyday cabbages—as for these lesser items, he couldn't be bothered to look at them twice.

However...

Lin Yuan could clearly sense.

That vast, boundless golden qi sea within his body had accumulated to an unprecedented, terrifying critical point!

The qi sea churned, golden waves surging to the heavens!

The tremendous energy nearly burst his entire dantian!

Qi Sea Realm Ninth Level Peak!

That invisible barrier to the next realm had long been battered by this torrential force until it teetered on the verge of collapse.

All it needed was one final push.

"Meridian Opening Realm..."

The corner of Lin Yuan's mouth silently curved upward.

Meridian Opening Realm!

All meridians throughout the body, every limb and bone, flowing freely without obstruction.

When that time came, lifespan, strength, even the soul would undergo an earth-shaking transformation!

"Those rats from the Divine Court are probably running around like headless chickens, busy preparing for their so-called Divine Sovereign."

"Should be able to enjoy peace and quiet for a while longer."

"Perfect timing to use this opportunity to push my realm up a notch."

Meanwhile.

Outside the Lin family residence, a military off-road vehicle came to a silent stop.

The door opened.

A man wearing a crisp general's uniform, golden stars on his shoulders, with a stern face and hawk-sharp eyes stepped out.

His body carried an iron-blooded killing intent forged through countless battlefields.

Simply standing there, he was like an unsheathed blade, making the very air feel heavier.

This man was named Xiao Zheng.

One of the youngest generals with real power in Dragon Xia Nation's military, deeply trusted by the Marshal.

"General Xiao, your presence honors us! Forgive me for not coming out to meet you!"

Lin Jianguo had already been notified and personally came out to welcome him, wearing a polite smile.

"Grand Marshal Lin, you're too kind."

Xiao Zheng performed a standard military salute to Lin Jianguo, neither humble nor arrogant.

"I've come today under the Marshal's orders."

The two walked shoulder to shoulder into the reception hall.

After taking their seats as host and guest, Xiao Zheng got straight to the point, directly stating his purpose.

"Young Master Lin Yuan's performance in the Yanjing City battle has come to the attention of the Marshal and the entire military high command."

His voice rang clear and strong, carrying a hint of undisguised admiration.

"Masterminding from behind the scenes, turning the tide! Single-handedly saving millions from fire and flood!"

"Such achievements, such talent—truly a blessing for our Dragon Xia Nation!"

Xiao Zheng's blazing gaze fixed on Lin Jianguo.

"The Marshal's intention is to invite Young Master Lin Yuan to join the military."

"With his abilities, the military is willing to pour all resources into nurturing him!"

"In the future, he will surely become, after you and Elder Martial God Lin, our Dragon Xia Nation's new pillar of strength!"

Every word rang with conviction, full of sincerity.

However.

Lin Jianguo, upon hearing this, showed a rather peculiar expression on his face.

It was the kind of expression where one wanted to laugh but couldn't, so could only desperately hold it in.

Getting him to join the military?

To serve the nation?

What an international joke!

That rebellious son probably only wanted to serve his grand master's chair for the rest of his life!

Lin Jianguo knew better than anyone what kind of character his son actually had.

Getting him to go to military camp and live that strictly disciplined life? He'd probably tear the whole base apart!

"Ahem."

Lin Jianguo coughed twice, covering his awkwardness.

He knew perfectly well.

This matter had a hundred-and-ten-thousand percent chance of going nowhere.

But since the other party was sent by the Marshal, representing the military's highest will, he couldn't just refuse outright.

That would be slapping the Marshal's face, wouldn't it?

"General Xiao, I understand your purpose."

Lin Jianguo pondered for a moment, then rose to his feet.

"However, that child Yuan'er... has a rather... unique temperament."

"I can't make this decision for him."

"How about this—I'll take you to see him personally, and he can give you an answer himself."

Lin Jianguo decided to just toss this hot potato directly to that rebellious son.

Let him personally devastate this young general's worldview.

"Excellent!"

Xiao Zheng's eyes lit up as he immediately stood.

In his view.

Being able to serve the nation and achieve glory was an honor no red-blooded man could refuse!

He believed that with reason and emotion, he could surely persuade the young genius named Lin Yuan!

However.

He was still too young.

The two passed through the front hall, walking toward the rear courtyard.

The closer they got, the tighter Xiao Zheng's brow furrowed.

He keenly sensed that the air in this rear courtyard seemed to be permeated with an extremely pure, incredibly peaceful life energy.

One deep breath made him feel as if even the bottleneck within his body had loosened somewhat!

What an amazing blessed land this was!

The moment he followed Lin Jianguo into the rear courtyard.

He froze completely.

There it was.

In the center of the courtyard.

A young man lay sprawled in a grand master's chair, sleeping soundly, drool nearly dribbling down.

Sunlight bathed his entire body.

Coating him in a layer of lazy gold.

Xiao Zheng: "..."

This...

This was that legendary young hero who turned the tide?!

This vibe...

Was it... a little off?!
