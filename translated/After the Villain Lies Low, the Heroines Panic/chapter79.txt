Its massive body, large as a small hill, suddenly reared up on its hind legs!

Its two front paws gleamed with a chilling light sharp enough to tear through metal!

It opened its blood-red maw, but its target wasn't the seemingly impregnable city gate!

Instead, it aimed at an unremarkable node on the city wall!

That spot was the weakest point in the entire eastern gate's defensive formation—where the energy flow was at its most vulnerable!

"ROAR—!!!"

A single roar!

A beam of ink-black energy, condensed to the extreme and brimming with destructive force, erupted from its jaws!

Wherever that beam passed, space itself groaned in agony, unable to bear the strain!

"No! Quick! Maximum power output! Stabilize the formation!"

Wang Junyi's face went deathly pale in an instant!

He had never imagined!

That this beast actually possessed such terrifying intelligence!

Not only had it seen through the defensive formation's weakness!

It had used the simplest, most brutal method to launch the most lethal strike!

Too late!

Everything was too late!

That black beam of destruction moved impossibly fast!

Almost at the same instant Wang Junyi's shout rang out.

BOOM—!!!

The beam had already smashed viciously into that vulnerable node!

HUM HUM HUM HUM—!!!

The enormous pale-gold energy barrier covering the entire eastern wall began to tremble violently, shaking uncontrollably!

One after another, cracks visible to the naked eye spread like spiderwebs in all directions, radiating from the point of impact!

CRACK!

CRACK!

One tooth-grinding sound of shattering after another echoed across the entire battlefield!

That city-protecting formation—supposedly capable of withstanding the full-force attack of an Essence Gathering expert—now hung by a thread!

"Hold! Hold it together!!!"

Wang Junyi's eyes turned bloodshot. His protective aura surged from his body recklessly, desperately trying to repair the formation node that was on the verge of collapse!

However.

How could the Iron-Spine Wolf King give him that chance?

"ROAR!"

It let out a low growl filled with contempt.

Then its massive body transformed into a streak of black lightning, leaping high into the air!

Its target was none other than Wang Junyi!

It intended to personally tear apart this human commander who dared to stand in its way!

"Beast! You court death!"

Wang Junyi roared in fury!

He knew he had become the target!

There was nowhere to run!

Then so be it—he would fight!

"Yan Jing City! Fight to the death, never retreat!"

He let out an earthshaking roar, transforming into a streak of light as he leaped down from the city wall!

He charged directly at the Iron-Spine Wolf King!

As the Commander of the Eastern District!

He was this defense line's final barrier!

BOOM!!!

Man and wolf collided violently in mid-air!

Raging protective aura clashed against demonic power brimming with destructive force!

A visible shockwave exploded outward!

Countless low-tier wolves scaling the city walls were instantly pulverized into clouds of blood mist by that shockwave!

Wang Junyi's figure was sent flying backward. A great spray of blood erupted from his mouth in mid-air.

The Iron-Spine Wolf King was also forced back dozens of meters before steadying itself.

They were evenly matched!

Though Wang Junyi was at a slight disadvantage!

After all, he was human. In terms of raw physical strength, he was inherently inferior to these demonic beasts renowned for their power!

"General!"

On the wall, countless soldiers cried out in anguish.

"I'm fine!"

Wang Junyi forcibly stabilized himself in mid-air, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. Yet his eyes only grew wilder, more resolute.

"Again!"

He charged once more!

Blades flashed and claws slashed! Fangs met steel!

Man and wolf engaged in the most primal, most bloody, most savage combat beneath the city wall!

Every collision produced deafening explosions.

Every exchange sent blood spraying through the air.

Wang Junyi had gone completely berserk.

His battle armor had long since been shattered beyond recognition!

Claw wounds deep enough to expose bone covered his entire body!

Yet he seemed to feel no pain whatsoever!

In his eyes, there remained only battle! Battle! And more battle!

However.

Just as Wang Junyi was giving everything he had to hold off this terrifying Wolf King.

Something changed in the rear of the beast tide!

ROAR—!!!

HOWL—!!!

Several more roars filled with savagery and madness erupted from different directions!

Three more massive beasts—each with an aura no weaker than the Iron-Spine Wolf King—burst forth from the wolf pack!

One was covered head to toe in black scales, like a moving fortress—an Earth Rampage Bear!

One had wings sprouting from its ribs and spewed poisonous mist from its mouth—a Shadow Venom Serpent!

And one was wreathed entirely in roaring flames—a Three-Headed Hellhound!

Their targets were remarkably unified!

All aimed at Wang Junyi, who was locked in bloody combat with the Wolf King!

"No! General, watch out!"

The deputy general on the wall went pale with terror at the sight.

A single Wolf King had already pushed General Wang Junyi to his absolute limits!

Now three more beasts of equal power had appeared!

This was nothing short of an inescapable death trap!

Wang Junyi's heart also sank to rock bottom!

He sensed the lethal threats approaching simultaneously from three directions!

He wanted to dodge!

But he couldn't escape at all!

The Iron-Spine Wolf King had him completely pinned down!

"It's over..."

A bitter smile of resignation appeared on Wang Junyi's face.

He had given everything he had.

In the end, he still couldn't change this outcome?

Yan Jing City...

Forgive me!

But at this critical juncture.

The very instant those three great demons' attacks were about to land on his body!

A voice—cold, devoid of all emotion, yet filled with supreme dominance—

Rang out across heaven and earth like a divine decree from the Nine Heavens above.

"Hmph!"

"A pack of beasts dares to act presumptuous before my Dragon Xia Country?!"

RUMBLE—!!!

That voice seemed to carry the supreme power to make words into reality!

The instant it fell!

Heaven and earth suddenly darkened!

A colossal fist—formed from protective aura so pure it had become solid gold, blotting out the very sky—appeared from thin air!

Upon that massive fist, killing intent soared to the heavens!

It was like the fist of judgment from the gods themselves!

This fist was so similar to the one that had crushed Liu Qingtian!

Yet the power it contained was not just ten times, but a hundred times greater!

"This... this is..."

Wang Junyi, who had already closed his eyes to await death, suddenly snapped them open!

He saw that golden divine fist descending from the heavens!

He felt that familiar, overwhelming presence—so domineering that his very soul trembled!

It was the Grand Marshal!

It was the Nation-Guarding Grand Marshal, Lin Jianguo!

He had come!

BOOM—!!!

The golden fist descended, carrying terrifying power capable of suppressing all eternity and crushing everything in its path!

Its target wasn't just one of the beasts!

It was all of them!

The Iron-Spine Wolf King!

The Earth Rampage Bear!

The Shadow Venom Serpent!

The Three-Headed Hellhound!

Under the shadow of that golden fist, all their struggles seemed so pale and powerless!

"ROAR... HOWL..."

They let out their final, most wretched and despairing death cries!

The next second.

The fist fell!

The earth split!
