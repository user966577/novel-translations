This woman had a smoking hot figure and striking beauty.

Her wavy hair gave her a look that was both mature and lazily wild—she was definitely a knockout.

Too bad Lin Yuan had zero interest in women right now.

Women would only slow down his lying-flat progress.

"Cheers and worship?" Lin Yuan pursed his lips, completely uninterested. "Can that stuff be eaten? Can it get me an extra ten minutes of sleep? If not, don't bother me."

Gu Ningxue couldn't help but laugh at his response. She took two steps closer, and a pleasant fragrance washed over him.

"You really have no sense of romance."

Her beautiful eyes swept over him appraisingly. "But I have to admit, you were really cool today."

"Oh."

Lin Yuan's reaction was as bland as listening to a weather report.

He'd always been cool. Did he need someone else to tell him that?

"Alright, if there's nothing else, I'm heading out. Gotta go home and catch up on sleep." Lin Yuan waved his hand, turned, and walked away without a hint of reluctance.

Watching his carefree retreating figure, the smile on Gu Ningxue's face grew even deeper.

"What an interesting man..."

Lin Family Estate.

The moment Lin Yuan walked through the door, he sensed something was off.

In the living room.

His businesswoman sister Lin Mengyao and his genius formation master little sister Lin Ke'er were seated on opposite ends of the sofa, both pairs of beautiful eyes fixed on him.

"Oh, everyone's here?"

Lin Yuan yawned and prepared to head straight upstairs.

"Stop right there!"

Lin Mengyao's cool voice rang out.

Today she wore a crisp white business suit.

Her long hair was pinned up, revealing her snow-white, slender neck. Her entire being radiated a "domineering CEO" aura.

"Brother! Brother!"

Lin Ke'er bounced down from the sofa like a little rabbit.

She ran up to Lin Yuan, tilting her delicate little face upward, her eyes full of anticipation. "How did the tournament go? Did you beat that annoying Ye Xuan so badly he was crawling on the ground?"

Lin Mengyao also fixed him with a scrutinizing gaze.

She tapped the table lightly, a hint of teasing at the corner of her lips. "Let me guess—our family's young master fought one match, got tired, and ran off somewhere to slack off and sleep?"

In their impression, although Lin Yuan wasn't weak, with his lazy personality, there was no way he could have lasted until the end.

Lin Yuan looked at their "we totally get it" expressions, then lazily flopped onto the sofa and found the most comfortable position.

"Oh, the tournament."

"It's over."

"Got first place."

He said the most shocking words in the most casual tone.

The air froze instantly.

Lin Ke'er blinked her big watery eyes, her little brain struggling to process.

Lin Mengyao was stunned for a full three seconds before her elegant brows shot up and she said irritably, "Lin Yuan! Did you sleep so much you're talking in your dreams? You? First place? I'd believe it if you said last place!"

"Exactly! You must be bragging!"

Lin Ke'er chimed in, though her big eyes still couldn't hide a glimmer of hope.

"Believe it or not."

Lin Yuan closed his eyes, clearly too lazy to explain further.

"Just check the academy's official website if you don't believe me. What's the big deal?"

Seeing his utterly confident demeanor, Lin Mengyao's suspicion wavered.

This little punk...

Could he actually be telling the truth?

Half-believing, she pulled out her communicator.

Her jade-like fingers tapped quickly, connecting to the Dragon Xia Country Capital Martial Arts Academy's official website.

On the front page, in bold red enlarged font, was a headline that could give any Lin family member a heart attack—

【UNPRECEDENTED! SHOCKING THE CROWD! LIN FAMILY'S YOUNG PRODIGY LIN YUAN CLAIMS THIS YEAR'S SCHOOL CHAMPIONSHIP WITH ABSOLUTE DOMINATION!!!】

Below was a high-definition photo.

In the photo, Lin Yuan stood in the center of the arena with an indifferent expression.

And at his feet lay the Child of Destiny, Ye Xuan—suppressed by a single thought, kneeling on the ground, vomiting blood, utterly pathetic!

"Holy... crap..."

Lin Mengyao, who always minded her image and was the epitome of an upper-class businesswoman, saw the photo and headline. Her red lips parted slightly, and a crude exclamation slipped out.

Her stunningly beautiful face was written with shock, disbelief, and utter incredulity!

It was true!

It was actually true!

Her lazy-to-the-bone little brother actually got first place?!

And in such an...

Inconceivable crushing manner?!

"Sis, sis! What happened?"

Lin Ke'er was hopping with impatience.

Lin Mengyao mechanically turned her head and showed her the communicator screen.

When Lin Ke'er saw the photo, her little mouth instantly formed an "O" shape, followed by an earth-shaking cheer!

"Waaaah! Brother! Brother, you're so cool! You're amazing! I knew my brother was the best in the world!"

The little girl's face flushed red with excitement as she transformed into a koala, pouncing on Lin Yuan and bouncing up and down.

Lin Mengyao finally snapped out of her massive shock.

She looked at her brother on the sofa, pestered by their little sister and wearing a look of utter resignation. Her expression became incredibly complicated.

Pride, gratification...

But mostly a surreal feeling of "my family's pig actually learned to find truffles."

"You little brat!"

She walked over, reached out, and firmly poked Lin Yuan's forehead, but her voice couldn't hide the joy within.

"Not bad! So you've been hiding this up your sleeve! Playing the pig to eat the tiger! Tell me, did you secretly go somewhere to train under a master?"

"I told you I was a genius, and you didn't believe me." Lin Yuan looked as if it were only natural. "A mere school championship—isn't that a piece of cake? What's there to make a fuss about?"

"Oh, please!"

"Give you some sunshine and you really think you're glowing! But... you did well today, worth a reward! Come on, I'll personally cook you a feast to celebrate!"

Lin Mengyao was so amused by his smug attitude she laughed despite herself.

"Wow! Sis is going to cook herself!"

Lin Ke'er cheered with joy.

Under the warm lights, the family walked happily toward the dining room, laughter filling the air.

Meanwhile.

Northern Frontier, Demon Burial Abyss.

Wind and snow still howled, malevolent energy piercing the sky.

Old butler Uncle Zhong's figure appeared respectfully on the communicator screen through an encrypted connection.

He reported everything—Lin Yuan's championship victory and the sisters' shocked yet ecstatic reactions back home—in full detail, with generous embellishment.

After hearing the report.

Lin Zhan's face, as unyielding as a ten-thousand-year glacier, slowly, slowly blossomed into an extremely rare smile.

Though it vanished in a flash, it seemed to melt some of the bitter cold around him.

"Hahaha... good! Very good!"

He couldn't help but laugh heartily, the sound bold and resonant, making the entire ice mountain hum.

"That little brat finally did something to make me proud!"

"I used to think he was a useless fool who only knew how to chase girls. Now I see I misjudged him!"

"My Lin Zhan's grandson—even lying down, he has to be number one under heaven!"
