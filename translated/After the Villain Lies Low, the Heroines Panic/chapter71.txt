This... this was...

Liu Qingtian was utterly terrified.

That iron-blooded killing aura was so domineering, so tyrannical!

As if an absolute god of slaughter commanding hundreds of millions of armored troops had descended upon the mortal realm!

Under this presence.

Liu Qingtian's meager 罡 Transformation Realm pressure was like candlelight meeting the bright moon—instantly crushed into nothingness!

He felt his very soul trembling violently under the impact of this killing aura, as if it could collapse at any moment!

He struggled to raise his head.

There, a towering figure like a demon god had appeared in mid-air at some point.

He wore a military-green greatcoat, his expression cold as still water.

In those deep eyes burned rage fierce enough to incinerate the Nine Heavens!

It was none other than Dragon Xia Country's Nation-Guarding Grand General!

An Essence Gathering Realm powerhouse!

Son of Lin Zhan, father of Lin Yuan!

Lin Jianguo!

He had arrived!

"Why are you here?"

"Didn't you say you wouldn't need an hour? It's only been a few minutes."

Lin Yuan saw his old man and was slightly taken aback.

Then, somewhat helplessly, he pursed his lips.

"I was worried you'd demolish this place too thoroughly. It'd be hard to explain to the higher-ups later."

Lin Jianguo let out a cold snort, slowly descending from mid-air.

His gaze swept over the scattered limbs and the Liu family estate that now resembled ruins. Even his eye couldn't help but twitch.

This kid really didn't hold back at all!

But...

Well done!

Then, his ice-cold gaze fell upon Liu Qingtian, who lay collapsed on the ground.

"Liu Qingtian!"

"What audacity!"

"You dared collude with the Divine Court to assassinate my son!"

"Did you want your entire Liu family to be buried alongside you?!"

Lin Jianguo's voice carried not a shred of emotion.

But every word struck Liu Qingtian's heart like invisible thunder!

Liu Qingtian could no longer withstand this pressure. He violently spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, and his entire aura instantly withered.

His face was filled with endless despair!

It was over!

Lin Jianguo had personally arrived!

His Liu family was truly, utterly finished!

He regretted it!

He truly regretted it!

He never should have provoked the Lin family! And he definitely shouldn't have provoked Lin Yuan, this monster!

But in this world, there was no medicine for regret!

"General... General Lin..."

Liu Qingtian's throat produced hoarse sounds like a broken bellows.

"Spare... spare me..."

"I... I am willing to offer up everything the Liu family has! I only ask that the General leave a single bloodline for my Liu family..."

Now, he only hoped to trade everything for a chance at survival!

However.

Lin Jianguo merely looked at him coldly.

Those eyes regarded him as one would a dead man.

"Bloodline?"

"From the moment you colluded with the Divine Court and harbored killing intent toward my son."

"Your Liu family no longer deserves to have a bloodline."

As his words fell.

Lin Jianguo suddenly raised his right hand.

A terrifying power, countless times stronger than Liu Qingtian's so-called "Heaven-Burning Palm," rapidly gathered in his palm!

The spiritual energy of heaven and earth seemed to be completely drained in this instant!

A sky-covering giant fist, formed from refined golden energy so pure it had become solid, appeared from thin air!

Upon that giant fist, runes circulated and killing intent soared to the heavens!

As if it were the fist of judgment from the gods themselves!

"NO—!!!"

Liu Qingtian watched that golden giant fist descending from above and let out his final, shrill, desperate wail!

He wanted to resist!

He wanted to flee!

But before this absolute power capable of suppressing all things, his every struggle appeared so pale and powerless!

BOOM!!!

The golden giant fist crashed down!

CRACK!

CRACK!

CRACK!

A dense succession of sounds that set teeth on edge—the sound of bones shattering—erupted from within Liu Qingtian's body!

His limbs, his organs, his extraordinary meridians...

Under this single punch, all were shattered inch by inch!

His dantian and qi sea were completely destroyed by that domineering golden energy, reduced to nothing!

"Urgh..."

Liu Qingtian's eyes bulged wide, his mouth gaping open.

Fresh blood mixed with fragments of internal organs sprayed wildly from his mouth.

His life force was fading at a visible rate!

He was crippled!

Utterly crippled by Lin Jianguo with a single punch!

From a lofty 罡 Transformation Realm powerhouse, he had become an utter waste, inferior even to an ordinary person!

This enormous fall from the clouds into hell was ten thousand times more painful than simply being killed!

"Take him away."

Lin Jianguo withdrew his hand, his voice ice-cold.

"Hand him to the Military Justice Division for rigorous interrogation!"

"Yes, sir!"

Two figures in standard military uniforms, their bodies emanating iron-blooded auras, emerged from behind Lin Jianguo.

They lifted Liu Qingtian, now no better than mud, and dragged him away, disappearing into the night.

Lin Yuan watched his old man's clean, efficient methods and pursed his lips.

"Dad, wasn't that punch a bit too heavy?"

"If you beat him to death, how are you going to interrogate him about the details of his collusion with the Divine Court?"

Lin Jianguo shot him a look and said irritably.

"Relax, he won't die."

"I know how to control my strength."

The night wind blew past.

It carried the scent of blood and the pungent smell of charred remains.

The entire Liu family estate had been completely reduced to ruins.

Lin Jianguo looked at this scene of utter devastation before him, then looked at his son who seemed as calm as if he'd just taken a casual stroll. The shock in his heart surged like towering waves!

Just now, though he had been far away, his divine sense had been locked onto this place the entire time.

He had seen every moment of Lin Yuan's battle with Liu Qingtian with perfect clarity.

That cyan sword gleam that had cleaved the scarlet giant palm!

That purple lightning that protected his body and made Liu Qingtian unable to break through even with all his might!

And that supreme might that crushed everything with a mere gesture!

This was absolutely not power that a Qi Sea Realm martial artist could possess!

"Yuan'er..."

Lin Jianguo swallowed hard.

On that face that had remained unchanged for ten thousand years, for the first time, an expression of disbelief—even terror—appeared.

He stepped forward, instantly appearing before Lin Yuan. His tiger-like eyes stared fixedly at his own son.

That gaze was like he had discovered a new continent.

"What you just used... was that Boundless Sword Intent?"

Boundless Sword Intent!

That was a supreme divine ability of Heaven-Grade pinnacle quality!

Legend said that when this sword intent emerged, it could draw upon the stars of the Nine Heavens and sever ten thousand miles of vast seas!

It was the forbidden sword dao of legend, capable of slaying gods and exterminating demons!

How could this have appeared on his own son?!

"And! That lightning protecting your body... that aura... is that the Nine Heavens Thunder Emperor Scripture?!"

"No! It's not just the Nine Heavens Thunder Emperor Scripture!"

"That physique impervious to all laws, capable of suppressing the heavens... could it be... the legendary Primordial Sacred Body?!"

He felt his entire worldview being completely overturned, then ground to dust!

Primordial Sacred Body!

What kind of concept was that?!

Among hundreds of millions of supreme physiques, it ranked first—the supreme, sacred body!

Eternal and indestructible! Impervious to all laws!

His own son...

Was actually a Primordial Sacred Body?!

Lin Jianguo's mind went blank.

He knew his son was strong, was a prodigy!

But he had never imagined that his son had already reached this terrifying, inconceivable level that completely defied common sense!

Boundless Sword Intent!

Nine Heavens Thunder Emperor Scripture!

Primordial Sacred Body!

Any single one of these divine abilities, if revealed, would be enough to drive the entire world mad!

Yet now, these three legendary forbidden powers had simultaneously appeared on one person!

This...

How were others supposed to live?!

Though he was busy with official duties and rarely came home, giving his son little supervision.

But surely he wasn't so estranged that he'd miss something like this?

This...

Was this still his son???

At this rate...

It would only be a matter of time before his son surpassed him.

However.

Facing his father's utterly shocked expression.

Lin Yuan simply spread his hands and spoke in a matter-of-fact tone: "I already told you, I'm a genius."

"..."

"..."

One sentence.

Just this simple sentence.

Directly rendered the Nation-Guarding Grand General Lin Jianguo speechless.

He stood with his mouth agape, feeling as though his throat had been stuffed with ten thousand tons of cement, unable to utter a single word.

Genius?

You call this genius?!

This is straight-up hacking!
