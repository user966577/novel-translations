That family of immortals finally left.

Lin Yuan heaved a long sigh of relief.

The whole world was peaceful again.

In the rear courtyard, that serenity and harmony belonging to him alone was restored once more.

The sunlight was just right, the breeze gentle.

He lay back in that creaking grand master's chair and closed his eyes.

This was the life.

All that fighting and killing was too exhausting.

Saving the world and whatnot was too troublesome.

Being a quiet salted fish was what suited his temperament best.

However.

This pleasant comfort didn't last long.

A slightly hurried, somewhat hesitant set of footsteps broke the courtyard's peace.

Lin Yuan's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.

Why was someone else coming?

Couldn't a man just take a proper afternoon nap?

He couldn't even be bothered to lift his eyelids. He simply thought impatiently that if whoever it was didn't have anything important, he'd just throw them out and be done with it.

"Lin Yuan."

A clear voice, tinged with complex emotions, rang out in the courtyard.

It was Gu Ningxue.

Today she wore a practical martial arts uniform that accentuated her already curvaceous, fiery figure.

But her expression now was nowhere near as confident as her physique suggested.

On that usually proud face was written shock, confusion, and... a sense of defeat she herself hadn't noticed.

"I really never thought..."

Gu Ningxue looked at the man lying in the chair, seemingly fast asleep, and drew a deep breath, her voice somewhat hoarse.

"You... were actually this impressive."

"Overnight, you became famous throughout Yanjing."

"Now, everyone in the city is saying you're our Yanjing City's savior."

Lin Yuan finally deigned to move a little.

He shifted into a more comfortable position, turning to face away from Gu Ningxue.

His voice carried the thick nasal tone of someone just waking up.

"What's so surprising about that?"

"I told you ages ago, I'm a genius."

"You're the one who didn't believe me."

"..."

Gu Ningxue's breath caught sharply!

Those beautiful phoenix eyes went wide in an instant!

A surge of indescribable shame and frustration rushed to her heart!

Yes!

He had told her long ago!

Before the Wilderness Hunt, on the Capital Martial Arts University campus, in every seemingly absurd chance encounter!

He had used that devil-may-care, seemingly joking tone to declare his "genius" status over and over!

But what had she thought back then?

She had only thought him an uneducated, glib playboy!

Had only thought every word from his mouth was a clumsy pickup line to get her attention!

She had never believed him!

Had even been full of disdain and contempt deep down!

Yet now, reality had delivered a resounding slap across her face!

The man she had once looked down upon now stood at a height she would have to give everything just to look up at!

He could save an entire city, tens of millions of lives, without anyone noticing!

And her?

In that brutal siege defense, giving her all had only allowed her to barely protect herself and kill a handful of beasts.

The gap!

A gap like a chasm between heaven and earth!

Gu Ningxue's nails dug deep into her palms, bringing a sharp sting.

That sting made her heart, proud to the extreme, clench painfully as well.

No!

I, Gu Ningxue, will not accept defeat!

I must train even harder!

Someday, I will catch up to you!

I...

The bold declaration in her heart hadn't quite taken full shape.

Another set of footsteps came from the courtyard entrance.

A girl in an elegant long dress walked gracefully toward them, her bearing refined, her features exquisite as a painted immortal.

She lacked Gu Ningxue's aggressive fighting spirit, carrying instead an aura of scholarly refinement.

But those bright eyes shone with an almost fanatical focus and dedication toward something.

It was Chen Ruoxi!

Gu Ningxue's pupils contracted slightly.

Why was she here too?

At Capital Martial Arts University, she and Chen Ruoxi were considered the unmatched twin prodigies of two different fields.

One was the undisputed darling of the martial world.

The other was the future grandmaster of artifact refining.

Though not close friends, they recognized each other as peers of equal caliber.

But right now, Chen Ruoxi's face wore an expression Gu Ningxue had never seen before—a mix of reverence, gratitude...

And even a hint of the anxious timidity of a student meeting their class teacher.

Moreover, from start to finish, her gaze was locked on the man lying in the grand master's chair!

As if, in this entire courtyard, nothing else existed but him!

"Lin Yuan... schoolmate."

Chen Ruoxi walked up to Lin Yuan and bowed deeply.

Her posture was respectful to the extreme!

"I... I came specifically to thank you!"

Her voice was clear and melodious.

BOOM!!!

Gu Ningxue's mind took another heavy blow!

Here to thank him too?!

Just how many earth-shaking things had this man done behind everyone's backs?!

Lin Yuan finally condescended to crack his lazy eyes open a sliver.

He glanced at the artifact-refining genius before him, bent so low.

"Thank me?"

"For what?"

At these words.

Chen Ruoxi's fair, pretty face instantly flushed red to her ears.

She stammered, waving her hands frantically as she explained: "It's... it's about guidance in artifact refining!"

Artifact refining?!

Gu Ningxue's ears perked up!

"...Every time little sister Ke'er asks you and comes back to tell me the answers, I feel like the clouds part to reveal the sun—everything suddenly makes sense!"

Chen Ruoxi's eyes sparkled, full of fervent admiration!

"You only needed the simplest few sentences to point out every flaw in all my approaches! That feeling... it was like standing at the foot of a mountain and suddenly glimpsing the scenery at the peak!"

"I... I really don't know how to thank you enough!"

The entire rear courtyard fell into deathly silence once more.

Gu Ningxue was completely petrified.

She stood frozen in place, motionless, like an exquisite ice sculpture.

But in her mind, a tsunami of twelve-magnitude proportions was crashing!

So that's...

How it was?

So Chen Ruoxi, equally proud as a white swan in the artifact-refining world.

Had secretly been seeking guidance from Lin Yuan all along?!

This...

This was even more unbelievable than the Yanjing City defense victory!

That man...

He wasn't just possessed of unfathomable strategic brilliance!

He didn't just have martial talent of immeasurable depth!

He... he actually had grandmaster-level attainment in the ancient, abstruse art of artifact refining?!

Was this even human anymore?!

Just as Gu Ningxue's worldview was about to completely collapse into dust.

Lin Yuan's lazy voice rang out again.

He stretched, his bones crackling in a series of pops, finally sitting up straight from the grand master's chair.

"Lin Yuan... no! Master Lin!"

"Your great kindness—Ruoxi will never forget it!"

Chen Ruoxi once again bowed deeply to Lin Yuan!

"Alright, alright."

"It was nothing, not worth mentioning."

Lin Yuan waved his hand impatiently, lying back down.

"..."

From start to finish.

Gu Ningxue said nothing.

She simply used an examining gaze, sweeping back and forth between Chen Ruoxi and Lin Yuan.

That look seemed to say:

When did you two get together?
