Humans and beasts alike!

Everyone stared blankly at this sudden turn of events!

Minds went completely blank!

The next second!

BOOM—!!!

A thunderous cheer erupted from the city wall like a tsunami!

"It's... it's reinforcements! Our reinforcements are here!"

"That power... it's the Mountain-Swallowing Martial God! It's Lord Tie Kuang!"

"And that sword qi! It's the Flying Moon Sword God! It's Lord Shangguan Jinghong!"

"Two Martial Gods! Both of our Dragon Xia Nation's Martial Gods are here!"

"We're... saved! Yanjing City is saved!!!"

In this moment, all the soldiers were moved to tears.

They threw down their weapons, embracing each other in wild celebration!

Cheering!

Leaping!

Releasing all their joy at surviving the calamity!

In the sky above.

The two streaks of light slowly faded.

Revealing two magnificent figures within!

The Mountain-Swallowing Martial God, Tie Kuang!

And the Flying Moon Sword God, Shangguan Jinghong!

They had arrived!

"Perfect timing!"

On the city wall, a sharp glint flashed through Lin Jianguo's deep eyes.

He forcibly suppressed his injuries, mobilizing every last drop of his remaining protective aura.

"Wang Junyi! Zhao Tianlong! Chen Beixuan! Li Mo!"

"Lend me your strength!"

He bellowed!

"Yes, Grand Marshal!"

The four commanders didn't hesitate for a moment!

They simultaneously poured their protective aura unreservedly into Lin Jianguo's body.

Hummm—!!!

Lin Jianguo's body once again erupted with dazzling golden light.

His weakened aura climbed steadily in that moment.

Though still far from his peak condition.

It was enough!

"Kill!"

Lin Jianguo roared.

His figure shot toward the heavens, arriving before those two silhouettes!

At this very moment.

In the sky above, three figures formed a triangle, completely surrounding that massive Baleful Blood Dragon.

On the left stood the Grand Marshal Lin Jianguo, wearing dark green military attire with a grave expression, surrounded by eight golden streams of protective aura.

On the right stood the Mountain-Swallowing Martial God Tie Kuang, bare-chested with bulging muscles, radiating pure physical power.

Above them both.

The Flying Moon Sword God Shangguan Jinghong, clad in silver-white armor, magnificently elegant, surrounded by ninety-nine streams of moonlit sword qi.

Three absolute powerhouses who could make any enemy tremble with fear.

Assembled here!

The air seemed to freeze.

Time itself came to a complete stop.

Without a moment's hesitation.

"Die!"

Lin Jianguo threw a punch!

The golden divine fist streaked across the sky like a meteor.

Carrying enough force to suppress all ages and crush everything, it smashed toward that invincible dragon of the ages!

At the same time.

Tie Kuang and Shangguan Jinghong also moved!

"Hahaha! Count me in, Brother Lin!"

Tie Kuang laughed heartily, throwing both fists!

"Divine Demon Prison Suppression!"

Two equally domineering fist auras, one left and one right, sealed off all the Baleful Blood Dragon's escape routes!

"Nine Heavens, Flying Moon!"

Shangguan Jinghong's voice was ethereal and distant.

Her shattered Moonlight Divine Sword instantly reformed.

Then split into nine.

Nine divine swords transformed into nine streaks of light, forming a killing sword formation filled with endless murderous intent!

Three supreme powerhouses!

In this moment, simultaneously unleashed their most powerful, deadliest strikes!

Fists that could suppress mountains and rivers!

Swords that could sever stars!

This was a killing formation that could change the color of heaven and earth!

"ROAR—!!!"

The Baleful Blood Dragon let out an enraged roar.

It refused to show weakness!

It had absolute confidence in its physical body!

It suddenly whipped its massive tail, like a steel mountain range, straight at Tie Kuang!

BOOM—!!!

Fist and tail collided violently in mid-air.

A visible shockwave exploded outward!

The surrounding clouds were instantly shredded by the impact!

Tie Kuang's figure was sent flying hundreds of meters backward!

But the Baleful Blood Dragon's massive tail also had scales shattered and flesh mangled!

A pure collision of strength!

An even match!

However!

The battle had only just begun!

At the very instant Tie Kuang and the Baleful Blood Dragon traded blows.

Lin Jianguo struck!

"Suppress!"

He thrust out a palm!

That massive golden fist, blotting out the sky, appeared once more!

But this time, its target wasn't the dragon's body.

It was the void above its head.

BOOM—!!!

The fist descended!

That space seemed to freeze solid from this single punch.

A formless, mountain-heavy pressure of suppression suddenly pressed down on the Baleful Blood Dragon!

"Roar..."

The dragon's body suddenly sank.

Its movements became impossibly sluggish.

It felt as if ten thousand primordial mountains were pressing down upon it!

It was pinned!

The Baleful Blood Dragon sensed an unprecedented threat of death.

It let out a panicked roar.

Demonic energy within its body erupted desperately.

Trying to break free from Lin Jianguo's suppression.

However!

Too late!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

That terrifying sword formation composed of countless stellar sword qi had already descended upon it!

In an instant!

Blood sprayed everywhere!

Scales flew in all directions!

Those supposedly indestructible scales that could withstand nuclear bombardment.

Before the stellar sword qi, were torn and pierced like paper!

"ROAR—AHHH—!!!"

The Baleful Blood Dragon let out the most agonizing, most miserable howl of its entire existence.

In an instant, thousands upon thousands of bone-deep sword wounds appeared all over its body!

Crimson dragon blood sprayed from its wounds like waterfalls!

The entire sky rained an eerie shower of blood!

"Kill! Kill! Kill!"

On the city wall.

Zhao Tianlong and the other commanders, watching this scene in the sky, felt their blood boiling.

They seized this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Leading the tens of thousands of soldiers whose morale had peaked, they launched the fiercest counterattack against the beast tide below, now thrown into complete chaos!

"For Yanjing City!"

"For Dragon Xia Nation!"

"KILL!!!"

Battle cries shook heaven and earth!

The humans had sounded the horn of victory!

"Now!"

In the sky above.

A sharp glint flashed through Lin Jianguo's eyes.

He keenly caught a split-second opening!

"Brother Tie! Shangguan!"

A thunderous shout!

The unspoken understanding between the three was demonstrated perfectly in this moment!

"Haha! Coming!"

Tie Kuang laughed heartily.

His retreating figure suddenly reversed direction mid-air.

His speed, even faster than before!

His strength, even more powerful!

"Break! For! Me!"

He roared.

His fist smashed once more onto the Baleful Blood Dragon's massive skull!
