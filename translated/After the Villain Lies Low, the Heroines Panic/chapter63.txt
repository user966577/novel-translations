Ever since making that seemingly impossible promise, Chen Ruoxi had thrown herself into a near-obsessive state.

Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror!

A Heaven-rank supreme-quality treasure!

This had been an unreachable dream, one she'd never even dared to imagine!

But now, this dream had become her sole purpose!

For those pure, expectant eyes of Lin Ke'er, she was willing to challenge the impossible!

After returning to the family, the first thing she did was convert every resource she'd accumulated over the past twenty years into cash!

Whether it was gifts from family elders (though being overlooked in the family meant this sum wasn't much—still, the Chen family was wealthy, so it was considerably more than an ordinary family could offer), rewards from completing missions, or even those refining materials she'd once treasured like gold—she converted them all into spirit stones without hesitation!

Then, through various covert channels, she frantically scoured the black markets of Yan Jing City, paying premium prices for the materials needed to refine the Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror.

Thousand-year Profound Crystal, Nine Heavens Divine Iron, Earth Core Fire Jade...

Each of these was a priceless treasure with no market!

In just ten days, her substantial fortune of spirit stones was completely depleted.

Fortunately, after paying this enormous price, she finally gathered most of the primary materials.

As for the most critical, hardest-to-obtain essence blood of nine divine beasts—through black market bounties, she'd managed to acquire five types.

White Tiger, Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, Qilin, and Bifang blood.

Each one had cost her massive resources and effort.

But the remaining four had vanished like stones dropped into the ocean, without a trace.

Especially... Azure Dragon essence blood!

According to legend.

This supreme treasure existed only in the depths of the Eastern Sea, condensing only from the remains of a true dragon!

Forget Yan Jing City—even across all of Dragon Xia Country, none had appeared for centuries!

This was an almost insurmountable chasm!

Yet, just as Chen Ruoxi was at her wit's end, nearly falling into despair.

Lin Ke'er, that little angel like a lucky star, appeared before her once again.

That day, Lin Ke'er mysteriously pressed a small jade bottle made of warm jade into her hands.

"Big sister Chen, quick, look! Is this what you're looking for?"

Chen Ruoxi opened the stopper, puzzled.

ROAR——!!!

A stream of dragon qi, pure to the extreme and filled with supreme majesty, shot toward the sky from the bottle!

A phantom azure dragon shadow coiled and roared in the air, as if about to punch a hole through the heavens!

"Azure... Azure Dragon essence blood!!!"

Chen Ruoxi's mind went blank!

She cradled that small jade bottle, both hands trembling violently!

Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined this legendary supreme treasure would appear before her this way!

"Little sister Ke'er, this... this is too precious! I can't accept it!"

Chen Ruoxi recovered her senses and immediately tried to return the bottle.

"Aiya, just take it, big sister Chen!"

But Lin Ke'er put her hands behind her back, refusing no matter what.

She stuck out her tongue and whispered a bit guiltily: "This... I 'borrowed' it from my brother's treasury..."

"My brother has the most treasures! They just sit there gathering dust in corners. One drop of blood missing, he definitely won't notice!"

The little girl said one thing but thought another—her heart was pounding wildly.

Of course she'd taken it "openly and honestly."

That day, while in Lin Yuan's treasury, she'd just casually mentioned, "Big sister Chen seems to still need a drop of blue dragon blood."

And her lazy bum brother hadn't even lifted an eyelid, just pointed randomly at a dusty corner shelf.

"There's a bottle over there. Take it to play with, and stop bothering me."

Just that simple.

As if that bottle of Azure Dragon essence blood—precious enough to drive the entire world mad—was no different from a roadside pebble in his eyes.

With the crucial Azure Dragon essence blood secured, the remaining three types also arrived one after another through Lin Ke'er's "help."

The materials were finally complete!

Chen Ruoxi didn't waste a single moment, immediately returning to her chamber.

First, she set up a massive spirit-gathering formation around the perimeter, forcibly drawing spiritual qi from ten miles in every direction.

Then she summoned her refining cauldron, took a deep breath, and adjusted her mental state to its peak.

The refinement began!

Three full days and nights!

Chen Ruoxi didn't sleep, didn't eat, didn't drink!

She poured every ounce of energy, divine sense, and spiritual power without reservation into that refining cauldron!

Melting materials!

Carving runes!

Fusing spiritual energy!

Every single step consumed massive amounts of her strength!

Several times during the process, she nearly fainted from depleted spiritual energy and overdrawn divine sense.

Each time, Lin Ke'er appeared like a caring little helper.

Right on time, she'd be at the chamber door with trays of fragrant spiritual fruits and priceless medicinal pills.

It was precisely these supplies that allowed Chen Ruoxi to grit her teeth and persevere, time after time!

Finally!

In the depths of the third night!

When the final, most complex, most profound "Nine Dragons Become One" rune was successfully carved onto the mirror surface with her last ounce of strength!

BOOM——!!!

The entire refining cauldron erupted with an unprecedented, dazzlingly brilliant golden light!

That light instantly pierced through the chamber's ceiling, shooting straight into the clouds!

A terrifying spiritual pressure expanded in all directions!

The mirror was complete!

Chen Ruoxi, dragging her utterly exhausted body, looked at the Bagua mirror quietly hovering in mid-air, still radiating intense heat.

Her face showed a relieved, contented smile.

On the mirror's surface, nine lifelike miniature golden dragons chased each other, coiling and swimming, emitting deep dragon roars that shook the soul!

She didn't even have time to admire her masterpiece before grabbing this scalding Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror and rushing out of the chamber.

She placed it in the hands of Lin Ke'er, who had been waiting outside.

"WOOOW!!!"

Lin Ke'er took the mirror, which was larger than her face, and immediately let out an earth-shaking cheer!

She hugged the mirror lovingly, so excited she spun in circles several times on the spot.

Then she grabbed Chen Ruoxi's hand and ran all the way to the Chen family's back mountain.

"Big sister Chen, let's try it out!"

Lin Ke'er raised the Nine Dragon Bagua Mirror and channeled a thread of spiritual energy into it.

HUM——!!!

Mirror light flashed!

A visible golden Bagua diagram, formed of pure golden light, instantly expanded outward with the mirror as its center!

The spiritual qi of heaven and earth within a hundred-mile radius seemed drawn by some fatal attraction, frantically converging toward the diagram!

All of Yan Jing City was shaken!!!
