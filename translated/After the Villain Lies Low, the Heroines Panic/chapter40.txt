In that moment.

You could hear a pin drop!

Everyone looked like ducks with their necks grabbed—eyes bulging, expressions as if they'd seen a ghost!

Not far away, Liu Mingxuan, who had maintained an elegant smile thinking he had victory in hand, saw his smile freeze solid! His powerful Qi Sea fifth-level perception let him understand better than anyone just how terrifying that pressure had been!

And behind Chen Tianhao, Chen Ruoxi clamped her small hand over her mouth, barely stifling a scream!

Her cool, beautiful eyes churned with unprecedented shock!

This was...

The fiancé she'd always thought was a wastrel, a simp...?

Lin Yuan slowly withdrew his hand, and that terrifying pressure dissipated like smoke.

Chen Yu collapsed like a puddle of mud, gasping violently, his gaze toward Lin Yuan filled with nothing but endless fear.

Lin Yuan picked up a wine glass from a nearby servant's tray, took a light sip, and looked down at the now-ashen Chen Tianhao.

"Now, do you still think I, Lin Yuan, am unworthy of your Chen family?"

Silence.

Deathly silence.

Chen Tianhao's lips trembled, unable to produce a single word.

Just as everyone assumed Lin Yuan would seize this chance to humiliate the Chen family and reclaim the engagement—

Lin Yuan set down his glass, his tone shifting.

"However..."

"I, Lin Yuan, never force anything."

"If Patriarch Chen finds this engagement unsuitable, then let it be void."

He rose, looking down from above, and spoke in a pronouncement-like voice:

"From this day forward, your Chen family and my Lin family are strangers."

With that, he didn't spare anyone another glance, turning to stroll toward that corner he'd had his eye on all along.

Leaving behind a venue full of petrified guests, and Chen Tianhao—whose face cycled through shades of green and white as if he'd been slapped across the face a hundred times in public.

Chen Tianhao's face was ashen, his dignity in ruins, but he dared not say another word.

He watched Lin Yuan's retreating back, a flash of mortification in his eyes.

Liu Mingxuan stood rooted to the spot, brow furrowed, privately musing that Lin Yuan's strength was far deeper than he'd imagined.

That pressure just now had made even his heart skip—this was no ordinary playboy's power.

In the banquet hall, the air seemed to freeze.

Everyone was shocked by Lin Yuan's overwhelming display, and sighed at the Chen family's complete loss of face.

Lin Mengyao followed Lin Yuan with a light smile, as if everything that had just happened was merely a minor interruption.

In a corner of the banquet, Chen Ruoxi's heart churned with a hundred emotions.

Her exceptional talent for artifact-refining gave her an innate reverence for the powerful.

Lin Yuan's casual suppression of Chen Yu, and that pressure that made her very soul tremble, made her realize this was no power an ordinary playboy could possess.

All her previous dissatisfaction and contempt had evaporated, replaced by intense curiosity—and a complex feeling she couldn't quite name.

Especially watching him crush her brother with a single blow...

Strangely, she felt a peculiar sensation stir within her.

After all, at home she was always overlooked by her father and mocked by her brother.

Yet Chen Ruoxi would only swallow all her emotions.

Today's scene made her feel as though Lin Yuan was standing up for her!

She watched his departing back, hesitated a moment.

Finally, she gathered her courage, lifted her skirt, and hurried after him.

"Lin... Lin Yuan!"

She called out softly.

Lin Yuan's steps paused. He turned slowly.

He looked at the somewhat disheveled young woman, his brow furrowing almost imperceptibly.

"Something you need?"

His voice still carried that hint of laziness.

Chen Ruoxi caught up to him, slightly breathless.

She raised her head, complex emotions swirling in her cool eyes.

"Today at the banquet... thank you."

She said softly.

Lin Yuan heard this and actually chuckled. That smile held amusement and confusion.

"Thanking me?"

He asked back.

Chen Ruoxi froze, momentarily at a loss.

She hadn't expected this reaction from Lin Yuan.

She'd thought he would enjoy her gratitude, maybe even use the opportunity to say something more. But Lin Yuan's response was completely unexpected.

She paused, trying to compose herself.

"About the engagement..."

She began softly, trying to explain something.

Lin Yuan heard "engagement" and frowned again.

He assumed she wanted to cling to him. Irritation sparked within.

He casually produced an ancient-looking tome from within his robes and tossed it to Chen Ruoxi.

"A small gift for you."

Lin Yuan said flatly, his voice cold and absolute. "Don't bother me anymore. The engagement matter—I, Lin Yuan, keep my word. It's dissolved. There's no going back."

With that, he walked away without another glance, heading toward that quiet corner of the banquet.

Chen Ruoxi stood frozen, staring at the unassuming ancient text in her hands. Four large characters were written on it: "Celestial Craft Illustrated."

At first she thought nothing of it, assuming Lin Yuan had just tossed her something random to brush her off. But when she casually flipped through a few pages, her body went rigid, her composed expression instantly replaced by fervent excitement!

This was no worthless scrap!

This was clearly a supreme method of artifact-refining never before seen in the world!

The concepts and techniques within surpassed all her knowledge!

She felt as if a door to an entirely new world had just opened before her!

"How... how is this possible?!"

Chen Ruoxi's breathing grew rapid.

Her heart pounded like a drum, her eyes shining with disbelief. She clutched "Celestial Craft Illustrated" as if holding the world's most precious treasure.

Lin Yuan—how could something he casually tossed out be a supreme artifact-refining method?

Could he also have exceptional talent in the Dao of artifact-refining?

Impossible!!!

Chen Ruoxi's mind reeled.

She felt she had stumbled upon some incredible secret!

Just as Chen Ruoxi held the "Celestial Craft Illustrated" in trembling excitement, a system notification rang in Lin Yuan's mind.

【Ding! Congratulations, Host, for successfully brushing off Chen Ruoxi and maintaining your lying-flat enterprise!】

【Reward obtained: Heaven-Rank supreme artifact-refining technique—Grand Mystery Treasure Refinement Scripture!】

Meanwhile, Chen Ruoxi treated her discovery like a treasure.

She couldn't even wait to finish the banquet—she immediately returned to the Chen estate and shut herself in, studying the "Celestial Craft Illustrated" day and night.

Over the following days.

Chen Ruoxi became a hermit, immersed daily in the wonders the "Celestial Craft Illustrated" revealed.

Her artifact-refining skills advanced by leaps and bounds. In mere days, she'd broken through multiple bottlenecks, reaching heights that even family elders couldn't dream of.

She felt her artifact-refining abilities improving at an unprecedented pace.

Problems that had once plagued her now dissolved effortlessly before this ancient text. Her techniques grew more exquisite, her understanding of materials reached entirely new depths.

Yet the Chen family remained blind to her progress.

Chen Yu, humiliated before Lin Yuan, had nowhere to vent his fury and took it all out on Chen Ruoxi.

"You worthless thing! How dare you come back! You've disgraced the entire family!"

The more Chen Yu dwelled on it, the angrier he became. He pointed at Chen Ruoxi's nose and cursed: "You even had the nerve to cozy up to him—still pining for him? Dream on! Thinking you can turn things around by clinging to that waste Lin Yuan? Keep dreaming!"

His taunts dripped with cruelty.

"Ruoxi, you've disappointed me deeply!" Chen Tianhao said coldly. "You think taking some worn-out book will change anything? You've only brought shame to our family!"

Her father Chen Tianhao was also furious that she'd accepted a book from Lin Yuan.

Chen Ruoxi didn't argue. She simply endured it all in silence.

She treated her father's and brother's rebukes as background noise, burying herself daily in the Celestial Craft Illustrated!
