In that instant.

Time seemed to freeze.

Space solidified completely.

Across the entire battlefield, the deafening battle cries, the wretched beast howls, the thundering of energy cannons...

Every sound vanished without a trace.

Whether it was the tens of thousands of soldiers fighting desperately atop the city walls.

Or the endless, fearless tide of a million wolves beneath them.

Every gaze, every beast's stare, was drawn irresistibly to that golden fist in the sky—so massive it blotted out the heavens!

What was that?!

Was that divine punishment?!

Was that heaven and earth's judgment?!

That was the towering fury of Dragon Xia Country's Nation-Guarding Grand Marshal!

RUMBLE!!!

The fist crashed down!

An explosion unlike anything before tore across the battlefield, rolling like thunder.

The terrifying shockwave swept outward in all directions like a tidal wave of apocalyptic proportions!

Those four beasts that had been so invincible just moments ago—the ones that had pushed Wang Junyi to the brink of death, four peak Aura Transformation Realm apex predators!

Their bodies, along with their supposedly indestructible flesh, their overwhelmingly powerful demonic force, even their unwilling and terrified souls...

The instant they made contact with that golden fist.

Like ice beneath the blazing sun.

They evaporated!

Yes!

Evaporated!

That domineering, utterly pure and overwhelming golden aura had completely erased them from existence!

Not even the slightest trace remained!

One punch!

Just one punch!

Instant kill!

Four peak Aura Transformation Realm demon kings!

Deathly silence!

The entire battlefield fell into an eerie, suffocating quiet.

The million-strong wolf tide halted its frenzied assault.

In their crimson eyes—eyes that had been filled with nothing but bloodlust and savagery—for the first time, an emotion called "fear" appeared!

Their kings were dead!

Killed by that man who had descended from the heavens like a god—obliterated with a single punch!

"Gulp..."

Atop the city wall, a young soldier swallowed hard.

His body trembled violently!

But not from fear!

It was from extreme, uncontrollable excitement and fervor!

"The Grand... Grand Marshal..."

He mumbled those three words.

The next second.

BOOM—!!!

The entire eastern gate wall erupted!

"It's the Grand Marshal! The Grand Marshal is here!"

"We won! We won!"

"Long live the Grand Marshal! Long live Dragon Xia Country!"

Cheers like a tsunami of roaring waves shot into the sky!

The sound even drowned out the howls of the beast tide, spreading across all of Yan Jing City!

Every soldier's face was written with the relief of survivors and the fervent worship that came from the depths of their hearts!

Their morale soared to its peak!

Wang Junyi hovered dumbly in mid-air.

He stared at the spot where the four demon kings had vanished, now marked only by a bottomless, massive fist print.

His mind was completely blank.

Just moments ago, he had been a hair's breadth from death.

And now, the one who had pulled him from the fire was the man he most admired—the man every soldier in Dragon Xia Country revered as a living legend!

He slowly turned his head.

There, a towering figure like a demon god had appeared in mid-air at some point.

He wore a dark green Grand Marshal's uniform, his expression cold as still water.

In those deep eyes burned rage fierce enough to incinerate the Nine Heavens!

It was none other than Lin Jianguo!

"Wang Junyi."

Lin Jianguo's voice was calm.

"This subordinate... present!"

Wang Junyi snapped back to his senses and saluted Lin Jianguo with a crisp military salute while still floating in mid-air!

"If you can't hold, fall back."

"Where there's life, there's hope."

Lin Jianguo said flatly.

Wang Junyi's eyes instantly turned red!

He knew the Grand Marshal wasn't reprimanding him.

He was showing concern!

"Grand Marshal! This subordinate... this subordinate is incompetent!"

"This subordinate is willing to live and die with the eastern gate!"

He straightened his spine, his voice resolute as iron!

Lin Jianguo said nothing more.

He simply turned around slowly.

His ice-cold gaze swept across the million-strong wolf tide below—now thrown into chaos and fear!

"A pack of vermin!"

He slowly spoke these four words.

His voice wasn't loud.

Yet it rang clearly in every person's ears.

And in every wolf's ears!

"ROAR—!!!"

At that moment!

From the western gate of Yan Jing City came a roar equally filled with savagery and battle-madness!

"Hahahaha! Grand Marshal! You've stolen all the glory at the eastern gate! Leave some for me!"

A burly figure shot from the western gate tower like a cannonball!

He crossed dozens of li in a single leap and slammed directly into the beast tide outside the western gate!

BOOM!!!

The very earth shook!

Thousands of beasts were instantly pulverized into clouds of blood and flesh by his landing!

It was none other than Western District Commander Zhao Tianlong!

"KILL!!!"

Zhao Tianlong let out a thunderous roar. Wielding a massive mountain-cleaving battleaxe, he tore through the beast tide like a tiger among sheep, commencing a frenzied, bloody massacre!

Immediately after!

From the southern gate!

A streak of cyan sword light shot toward the heavens!

Wherever the sword light passed, hundreds upon thousands of beasts were instantly cleaved in two!

Southern District Commander, the Azure City Sword Master, Chen Beixuan! Entered the fray!

From the northern gate!

Li Mo's face was deathly pale, but his eyes held a glint of determination.

He knew this was his only chance to atone for his earlier transgression!

"Soldiers! Follow me—KILL!"

He roared and was the first to charge down from the wall!

The Four District Commanders!

Four peak Aura Transformation Realm powerhouses!

In this moment, they simultaneously launched the most ferocious counterattack against the endless beast tide from all four directions!

In an instant!

Outside all of Yan Jing City, battle cries shook the heavens! Blood flowed in rivers!

The situation was being stabilized at a visible pace!

However.

Just when everyone thought this catastrophe was about to be quelled.

Several hundred li away.

In that canyon reeking of death and evil—Death Valley.

The Blood Slaughter Divine Official watched through his crystal ball as the four demon kings were erased by that golden fist, and as Lin Jianguo descended like a god of war.

Beneath his twisted demon mask came a low, hoarse, cold laugh.

"Lin Jianguo... Essence Gathering Realm..."

"Indeed, quite strong."

"But did you think this was over?"

"No..."

"The true feast of terror."

"Has only just begun!"

As he spoke, he slowly extended his hand.

He pointed toward the center of the altar—toward that pitch-black ball of flesh that was pulsing frantically, as if driven to the extreme limits of hunger!

"Go forth."

"My most perfect creation."

"Go and devour them!"

"Go and let them experience true despair!"
