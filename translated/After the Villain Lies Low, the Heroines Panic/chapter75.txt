Outside Yan Jing City.

Deep within towering mountains and ridges.

A secluded canyon shrouded in endless black mist, filled with the aura of death.

In the deepest depths of this valley of death.

Atop an eerie altar constructed from countless massive bones.

A figure clad in a blood-red robe, face hidden behind a twisted demon mask, stood silently with hands clasped behind his back.

No spiritual energy fluctuations emanated from him whatsoever.

It was as if he had perfectly merged with this environment steeped in death and evil.

He was one of the Divine Court's Twelve High Priests!

The Blood Slaughter High Priest!

Hum—!

The void before him rippled and distorted.

A pitch-black figure materialized from thin air.

From the token came a respectful voice.

"Reporting to Lord High Priest, the Yan Jing City operation... has failed."

"Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade are dead. The Liu family has been razed overnight by Lin Jianguo."

Hearing this news.

Behind that demon mask, the Blood Slaughter High Priest's face showed no change in expression.

His voice was hoarse, cold, as if emerging from the depths of the Nine Nethers.

"Understood."

Just three simple words.

No indication of joy or anger.

The voice on the other end of the token paused, seemingly hesitant.

"Lord High Priest, then... our next plan..."

"The plan proceeds as scheduled."

"Lin Yuan's appearance is merely an insignificant variable."

"In fact, his drawing all of Lin Jianguo's attention makes our plan even more advantageous."

"The life or death of a single chess piece is irrelevant."

"What matters is the final outcome of the game."

The Blood Slaughter High Priest spoke flatly.

As he spoke, he slowly raised his hand.

In his palm rested a fist-sized mass of flesh, black as ink, pulsing like a heart.

That fleshy orb was covered with bizarre, constantly writhing crimson patterns.

With each beat, the entire canyon trembled!

An indescribable aura—filled with violence, bloodlust, and the desire for destruction—emanated wildly from that orb of flesh!

"The fifty million souls of Yan Jing City shall become the finest sacrifice. As for the Lin family, that so-called Grand Marshal, and that so-called genius..."

"They shall witness this world wail and sink into despair!"

"Let this decaying world feel the wrath of the Divine Court!"

---

Since the Liu family's destruction and the great houses of Yan Jing City coming to beg forgiveness.

For several days straight.

Lin Yuan's life had returned to its rare tranquility.

No more foolish flies dared to disturb his sleep.

The entire city had fallen into an atmosphere of outward calm but inner tension.

On the surface, all was peaceful.

But beneath, the storm was already brewing!

Under Lin Jianguo's single command, the city's defense level had been raised to the highest in history!

Squad after squad of city defense soldiers in heavy armor, wielding various weapons, patrolled every corner of the city around the clock.

The grim atmosphere made even the air feel heavier.

Countless civilians and martial artists sensed this unusual atmosphere. Everyone became cautious, not daring to cause any trouble.

However.

This external tension hadn't affected the back garden of the Lin family estate in the slightest.

Here, everything remained peaceful and serene.

Lin Yuan was still lying in his exclusive reclining chair, unchanging as ever.

Eyes half-closed, breathing deep and long.

As if he had become one with heaven and earth.

Not far away, Lin Keer sat cross-legged on a blue stone, her small face tense, her little brows knitted into a frown.

Before her lay dozens of spirit stones carved with arcane runes.

Her small hands were rapidly forming one complex seal after another.

Wisps of faint spiritual energy flowed from her fingertips, attempting to connect those spirit stones together.

She was setting up the Two Principles Micro Array!

But this formation was simply too profound and mysterious.

No matter how she tried, those spirit stones couldn't form an effective energy circulation.

"Hum..."

As she completed her final seal.

One of the spirit stones trembled violently, and the runes carved upon it instantly dimmed.

The entire foundation collapsed.

All the spirit stones returned to their original state.

"Ugh! Failed again!"

Lin Keer drooped her little head in dejection, her face full of disappointment.

"Brother... this formation is so hard. I feel like my head is going to explode, and I still can't set it up."

She pouted, looking pitifully toward Lin Yuan.

"Formations are alive."

"You're treating it as dead."

"You're only imitating its form without comprehending its essence."

"Form and essence together—that is the great dao."

Lin Yuan didn't even open his eyes, speaking matter-of-factly.

These past few peaceful days, Lin Yuan had spent most of his time guiding his sister's formation cultivation.

Now, in just a few simple sentences, he pointed out the crux of the matter.

Every word he spoke struck Lin Keer's heart like a morning bell and evening drum!

That's right!

Formations are alive!

She had only been memorizing by rote the runes and steps from the diagrams.

She had never truly used her heart to feel the meaning of this formation's existence, its most fundamental rules!

From the very beginning, she had taken the wrong path!

BOOM!!!

In that instant.

Lin Keer felt as if a thunderbolt had exploded in her mind.

All those places she couldn't figure out, couldn't understand before.

In this moment, everything became clear!

Enlightenment poured over her like sweet nectar!

The fog in her mind parted completely!

"I... I understand now!"

Lin Keer's eyes suddenly lit up, sparkling with an unprecedented, brilliant light!

She took a deep breath and closed her eyes once more.

This time.

She didn't rush to form seals.

Instead, she let her mind sink completely inward.

Using her heart to feel the energy contained within each spirit stone.

Using her heart to commune with the most primordial rules between heaven and earth.

One minute...

Two minutes...

Ten minutes...

Suddenly!

Lin Keer's eyes snapped open!

Her hands became a blur of afterimages!

This time, her movements flowed like water, completed in one breath!

Filled with an indescribable sense of dao.

HUM—!!!

As her final seal fell.

Those dozens of spirit stones simultaneously burst with dazzling radiance.

Golden threads of light connected them perfectly together.

A complete miniature formation, emanating an arcane aura, appeared from thin air!

An invisible force field spread outward from the formation's center.

Within the area covered by the formation.

Space itself visibly warped.

"I did it! I actually did it!"

Lin Keer looked at her creation and leaped three feet in the air with excitement.

Her little face was flushed as she looked toward Lin Yuan in his reclining chair.

"Brother! Look! I did it!"

This time, Lin Yuan finally opened his eyes slowly.

He glanced at the miniature formation, and the corner of his mouth curved into a faint arc.

"Not bad."

He nodded slightly.

Receiving her brother's praise made Lin Keer happier than breaking through an entire major realm!

Just then.

Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly.

He could clearly sense it.

Inside his body, his qi sea—which had been calm as a still lake—was now beginning to ripple.

That bottleneck from the sixth level of Qi Sea Realm to higher realms had begun to loosen.

"About to break through..."

Lin Yuan's face showed a hint of helplessness.

"Sigh, honestly."

"All I want is to quietly be a salted fish."

"But my strength just won't allow it!"

The bottleneck had loosened.

The breakthrough was imminent.

Lin Yuan knew he couldn't suppress it any longer.

That power about to burst forth was like a volcano ready to erupt—any attempt to hold it back was futile.

"So be it."

"Might as well break through early."

Lin Yuan thought to himself.

The threat of the Divine Court hung over his head like a Sword of Damocles.

Though he appeared calm and unconcerned on the surface.

In truth, he knew better than anyone.

This would be an unprecedented hard battle!

Increasing his strength was the most important thing right now.

With that thought, Lin Yuan hesitated no longer.

He slowly straightened his posture.

This simple movement caused Lin Keer nearby to pause briefly.

Because she rarely saw her brother assume such a serious posture.

"Keer, step back a bit. Whatever happens next, don't panic."

Lin Yuan's voice remained calm.

"Oh... okay! Got it, Brother!"

Though Lin Keer didn't know what was about to happen, she nodded obediently and retreated to the far end of the back garden doorway.

Lin Yuan took a deep breath.

Then slowly closed his eyes.

No earth-shaking eruption of aura.

No flashy gestures to draw upon heaven and earth's spiritual energy.

He just sat there, quietly.

However!

The instant his eyes closed.

A sudden change occurred!

BOOM—!!!

An invisible yet supremely domineering power exploded outward from within Lin Yuan!

Throughout the entire Lin family estate's back garden, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth—so dense it was nearly tangible—went into complete chaos!

It was as if subjects summoned by their emperor.

As if a dam had burst, releasing a torrential flood.

Heedless of all else, spiritual energy surged toward Lin Yuan's body!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Violent whistling filled the air!

Centered on Lin Yuan, a massive vortex of pure spiritual energy became visible to the naked eye!

"Oh my heavens!"

In the distance, Lin Keer couldn't help but cover her mouth with her small hands!

She could feel it.

The surrounding spiritual energy was being drawn away at a speed she couldn't begin to comprehend!

Yet this was only the beginning!

When all the spiritual energy in the back garden had been drained.

That supremely domineering suction didn't stop!

Instead, it expanded outward in an even more terrifying fashion!

HUM—!!!

The entire Lin family estate!

The entire street where the estate stood!

The entire district where the street was located!

Finally—the entirety of Yan Jing City!

Within a radius of several hundred li, all spiritual energy of heaven and earth seemed to lose control!

From the mountains, from the rivers, from the earth veins, from the void itself—spiritual energy surged forth wildly!

Transforming into visible white torrents!

From all directions, converging toward a single point!

That point.

Was the Lin family estate!

In an instant!

The entire Yan Jing City was thrown into complete uproar!
