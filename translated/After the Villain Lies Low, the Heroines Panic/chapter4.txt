Lin Yuan could even feel tiny electric arcs flowing through his blood.

"Amazing!"

He stretched comfortably, feeling unprecedentedly powerful.

The Primordial Sacred Body handled automatic idle leveling, while the Nine Heavens Thunder Emperor Scripture provided world-destroying offensive power.

This combination was simply perfect!

Early the next morning.

When the first rays of sunlight filtered through the massive floor-to-ceiling windows into his room, Lin Yuan finally woke leisurely.

He nestled in a sofa made from exotic beast hide worth millions, too lazy to move even a finger.

"Young Master, you're awake."

An old butler in a tailcoat, his hair combed meticulously, approached.

Behind him followed two pretty maids—one carrying toiletries, the other a platter of glistening, spiritually-infused fruits.

Lin Yuan opened his mouth.

One maid immediately placed a peeled Purple Jade Grape into it.

Sweet juice and pure spiritual energy burst in his mouth, flowing down his throat to nourish his organs.

This was the life of a top-tier second generation—decadent, yet boring.

Uncle Zhong, the old butler, looked at his young master's "food comes to mouth, clothes come to body" salted fish appearance, a flash of helplessness and worry in his eyes.

The young master used to be infatuated with that Li family girl, but at least he was diligent about cultivation, still had some drive.

But ever since rejecting the Li girl yesterday, the young master seemed to have become a completely different person, becoming...

Lazy to the extreme.

The entire day, aside from eating and sleeping, he just lay there spacing out.

This state made Uncle Zhong, who had watched Lin Yuan grow up, deeply uneasy.

He silently withdrew.

Going to a hidden room, he used a special encrypted communication device to report the situation here and his concerns to the Lin family's pillar of strength.

Dragon Xia Country, Northern Frontier, a frozen wasteland of eternal ice.

This was a forbidden zone for humans, where countless powerful and terrifying beasts lurked.

At this moment, a towering figure stood atop an icy peak.

He was imposingly built, his white hair dancing wildly.

Merely standing there, the surrounding space warped around him, wind and snow not daring to approach within a hundred meters.

This was Lin Yuan's grandfather—the legendary War God who had single-handedly guarded the nation for a century—Lin Zhan!

"ROAR!"

An earth-shaking bellow.

A nine-headed serpent emperor, its body as massive as a mountain range, burst from beneath the ice.

Nine hideous heads spewed frost capable of freezing souls, lunging at Lin Zhan.

This beast could easily annihilate a major city!

Yet Lin Zhan didn't even lift an eyelid, merely raising his hand casually and striking down through the air.

"Noisy."

BOOM—!

The sky was instantly torn apart.

A heaven-supporting giant hand formed from infinite spiritual qi appeared from nowhere, crashing down with world-destroying might!

The invincible nine-headed serpent emperor couldn't even manage a scream before being slammed deep into the planet's core by the giant palm.

Along with hundreds of miles of glaciers, reduced to nothingness!

Having done all this, Lin Zhan acted as though he'd merely swatted a fly.

Just then, the communicator on his wrist beeped.

Lin Zhan tapped it lightly.

The communicator screen lit up, displaying Uncle Zhong's figure.

"The Young Master continues to... lie flat today. Fed three Purple Jade Grapes this morning. Mental state and vital signs all normal..."

Looking at the report's contents, those eyes capable of bringing down stars revealed a complex, indescribable emotion.

Disappointment, helplessness, but most of all, a deep weariness.

Behind him, a middle-aged general in military uniform, his aura unfathomably deep, respectfully stepped forward and said quietly, "War God, another demonic tide from the abyss has been suppressed by your palm. It's just... this news from home, you see..."

Lin Zhan waved his hand, his gaze still fixed on the communicator.

Those simple lines of text seemed to give him more of a headache than the billions of demons in the abyss below.

He let out a long sigh, his voice carrying a weariness no one could understand.

"Ah..."

"Forget it, let him be."

Lin Zhan waved his hand, his voice tired. "Before, the boy spent all day chasing after some girl, embarrassing himself. Now that he knows to stay home and enjoy life, that's actually an improvement..."

"As long as he doesn't cause trouble for the family, doesn't go out being a simp again, let him lie however he wants."

"My grandson Lin Zhan's—even if he lies there like a puddle of mud, no one in this world would dare touch a hair on his head!"

As his words fell, the communicator shut off.

Lin Zhan's gaze once again turned toward the depths of the frozen wasteland, his eyes becoming sharp as blades.

As long as he hadn't fallen, he could hold up a sky where his descendants could lie flat as they pleased!

Dragon Xia Country.

Capital Martial Arts Academy, Advanced Cultivation Class.

In the bright, spacious cultivation room.

Dozens of students sat cross-legged, listening to the teacher on the platform explain the principles of spiritual power circulation.

In the back corner of the classroom.

Lin Yuan was leaning against the wall, snoring away, drool nearly trickling out.

To him, what the teacher taught was nowhere near as fast as his passive automatic cultivation. Attending class was pure waste of time.

Just then, a waft of fragrance drifted over.

Li Xuan'er walked gracefully to Lin Yuan's desk.

She had clearly dressed up carefully today—a light blue dress that made her skin appear snow-white, her temperament pure and innocent.

She'd learned her lesson from yesterday. Her face wore a sweet, charming smile, her voice soft and cloying.

"Lin Yuan gege, wake up~"

Her voice was neither too loud nor too soft, just enough for the surrounding classmates to hear.

In an instant, everyone's attention in the class, including the teacher on the platform, converged on them.

"Damn, here we go again!"

"Campus Beauty Li is looking for Lin Yuan again. What does she want this time?"

"This is gonna be good. Look at that simp face of Lin Yuan's—he's definitely going to eagerly agree again."

"Everyone knows Li Xuan'er is close to that commoner genius Ye Xuan. Whatever she gets from Lin Yuan, eighty percent of it probably goes to Ye Xuan."

The surrounding classmates whispered among themselves, their faces showing expressions of enjoying the show.

They were all waiting to watch Lin Yuan go "simp mode" again, performing another annual emotional drama.

Li Xuan'er ignored the murmuring.

She looked at Lin Yuan confidently and continued in that sickeningly sweet voice, "Lin Yuan gege, I've hit a bottleneck in my cultivation recently. I'm about to break through, just missing an 'Ice Soul Orchid' to stabilize my realm. Won't you help me, please~"

As she spoke, she even swayed her slender waist slightly, blinking her big watery eyes at Lin Yuan, looking utterly pitiful.

This was her killer move—in the past, whenever she used this, Lin Yuan couldn't resist.

However, this time, she faced a Lin Yuan whose core had been replaced.

Lin Yuan was woken by the noise, slowly opening his drowsy eyes. He couldn't even be bothered to lift his eyelids, merely giving her a casual glance.

Ice Soul Orchid?

He remembered—this was prepared for Ye Xuan.

In the original novel, Ye Xuan's cultivation had gone wrong.

Cold qi invaded his body, nearly causing Qi Deviation. It was this Ice Soul Orchid that saved him from the crisis.

And because of this blessing in disguise, he comprehended an ice-element technique.

You want to take my stuff to save your lover boy?

A mocking curve appeared at the corner of Lin Yuan's lips. His thin lips parted, uttering a single word.

"Scram."
