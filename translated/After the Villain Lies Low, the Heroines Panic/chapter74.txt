The Liu family was finished!

Overnight, this second-tier elite clan that had been entrenched in Yan Jing City for centuries was uprooted completely, turned to dust in the annals of history.

This news swept through all of Yan Jing City with unstoppable speed!

Countless people, upon hearing the news, had the same first reaction—disbelief.

What kind of joke was this?!

That was the Liu family!

Their patriarch, Liu Qingtian, was a Gang Transformation expert!

The clan even had one of the two War Gods, the old ancestor Liu Xuanchen, guarding them!

How could such a behemoth just vanish overnight?!

However.

When they saw the ruins of the Liu family estate, razed to the ground.

When they heard that the military had completely sealed off all Liu family businesses and begun hunting down Liu family remnants.

They had no choice but to believe!

Then, one explosive, hair-raising piece of news after another came flooding out through various channels!

"Did you hear?! The Liu family colluded with the Divine Court and was caught red-handed with ironclad evidence!"

"What?! The Divine Court?! That infamous evil organization that everyone wants dead?!"

"That's right! Apparently, Patriarch Liu Qingtian spent thirty percent of his family's wealth to hire the Divine Court's top assassins to assassinate the Lin family's Young Master Yuan!"

Hiss—!

The moment this news broke, everyone sucked in a cold breath!

Insane!

The Liu family had truly gone insane!

They actually dared to try assassinating the Lin family's little ancestor?!

That was Old War God Lin Zhan's beloved treasure, Grand Marshal Lin Jianguo's reverse scale!

Wasn't this just an old man hanging himself—tired of living?!

"Then what?! Then what?! Did the assassination succeed?!"

Someone asked impatiently.

"Succeed my ass!"

The well-informed source's face showed an extremely exaggerated expression, a mixture of terror and worship. "You can't even imagine what happened last night!"

"Apparently, those two Divine Court Meridian Opening assassins didn't even get close to the Lin family gates before a barrier casually laid by Young Master Yuan severely injured them on the spot!"

"Then Young Master Yuan, single-handedly, stormed the Liu family!"

"One stomp! Just one stomp! And hundreds of Liu family elites were all crushed into blood mist!"

"Liu Qingtian at Gang Transformation fought back desperately, but he couldn't even break through Young Master Yuan's defenses! He was crippled in a single move!"

BOOM!!!

The crowd completely exploded!

Everyone who heard these words felt their scalps go numb!

One stomp to kill hundreds of elites?!

One move to cripple a Gang Transformation expert?!

Was this...

Was this something a human could do?!

That Lin family heir, rumored to spend his days either browsing the internet or lounging in the sun—he was actually terrifying to this degree?!

"That's not even the scariest part!" The man swallowed hard, his voice trembling. "The scariest thing is that the Liu family's old ancestor, War God Liu Xuanchen, rushed back from the Southern Frontier!"

"And then?! Did the two War Gods fight?!"

Everyone's hearts rose to their throats.

"Fight my ass!" The man slapped his thigh. "The Lin family's Old War God, Lin Zhan, also appeared! The two War Gods faced off in the sky—heaven and earth practically shattered!"

"But the result? When Young Master Lin Yuan presented the ironclad evidence of the Liu family colluding with the Divine Court, War God Liu Xuanchen didn't dare let out a single fart. He slunk away with his tail between his legs!"

"Throughout the whole thing, Young Master Lin Yuan just stood there from start to finish, calm as can be!"

"That bearing, that presence! It was simply like a deity descending to the mortal world!"

Dead silence!

The entire teahouse fell into dead silence!

Every face showed only endless, bone-deep terror and reverence!

They finally understood.

The heavens over Yan Jing City hadn't changed.

Rather, from the very beginning, there had only ever been one sky!

And that was the Lin family!

As for the name Lin Yuan—from this day forward, it had completely replaced Lin Zhan and Lin Jianguo as the most forbidden existence in all of Yan Jing City!

In an instant, the upper echelons of Yan Jing City completely erupted.

Countless clans and sects fell into unprecedented, tremendous panic.

Especially those families that had been close to the Liu family, or had secretly contributed to the "Slaughter Yuan Alliance" affair.

They were scared out of their wits!

"Quick! Hurry, hurry, hurry!"

"Get that thousand-year Blood Ginseng from the treasury!"

"Prepare the carriage! I'm going to the Lin family immediately! To beg forgiveness!"

"Patriarch! Our Li family previously funded the Liu family with a huge sum! Will the Lin family let us go?"

"Whether they let us go or not, we have to go! If we don't go, it's truly a dead end!"

Similar scenes played out repeatedly within the great houses of Yan Jing City.

Countless patriarchs and elders were like ants on a hot pan, restless with anxiety.

They frantically gathered their rare treasures.

Then, with the most humble and fearful hearts, they swarmed toward the Lin family estate.

They were going to plead guilty!

They were going to beg for mercy!

They were going to express their highest respect and loyalty to the Lin family!

In stark contrast to all this.

Was the Chen family.

Inside the council hall.

Patriarch Chen Tianhao listened to the detailed report about the Liu family's destruction that his servants had brought back.

His hand holding the teacup was trembling violently!

But not from fear!

It was from extreme, uncontrollable excitement and relief!

"Haha... hahahaha!"

He shot up from his seat and let out a hearty, cathartic laugh.

He had bet correctly!

He had actually bet correctly!

The Chen family, at the most critical moment, had chosen the right side!

"The Patriarch is wise!"

"Indeed! Thank heavens we got in early with the Lin family, otherwise our Chen family's fate now would probably be no better than the Liu family's!"

The elders in the hall were all glowing with relief and lingering fear.

The looks they directed at Chen Tianhao were filled with endless admiration.

Back when the Patriarch had decided to offer up the "Star Vein Mine" as a pledge of allegiance, they had all objected strenuously.

Looking back now, how shortsighted they had been!

Compared to the survival of the entire clan, what was a mere mine?!

"From today onward, our Chen family follows only the Lin family's lead!"

"Pass my orders! Starting now, all Chen family forging resources go to the Lin family first! Spare no cost! Ask no questions!"

Chen Tianhao slammed the table, his voice resolute.

"Yes!"

The entire Yan Jing City had completely changed because of Lin Yuan!

Inside the forging chamber.

Chen Ruoxi had also received the news.

Her beautiful, refined face was written with disbelief and shock!

Lin Yuan...

He had single-handedly wiped out the entire Liu family?!

One stomp to kill hundreds of Liu family elites?!

One move to cripple Liu Qingtian at Gang Transformation?!

Even the Liu family's War God ancestor could only retreat in silence before him?!

This...

Chen Ruoxi felt her heart pounding wildly!

She knew Lin Yuan was strong!

She knew Lin Yuan's forging techniques had reached divine levels!

But she had never imagined.

That Lin Yuan's martial strength was also terrifying to this degree—enough to overturn everyone's imagination, utterly inconceivable!

That was the Liu family!

A behemoth that could rival the Lin family!

Just like that... gone?

"Ruoxi! My dear daughter!" Chen Tianhao was so excited his face was flushed red. "The smartest decision your father ever made in his life was listening to you and pledging allegiance to the Lin family!"

"You have no idea! Those families that used to oppose our Chen family are now scared shitless, preparing lavish gifts overnight, wanting to come apologize and beg forgiveness from our Chen family!"

"Our Chen family is truly going to soar to the heavens this time!"

Chen Tianhao's wild joy didn't really register with Chen Ruoxi.

In her mind, there was only one thought.

So...

This was his true self?

That young man who usually seemed so lazy, as if nothing could spark his interest.

Inside him, he actually hid an ancient beast capable of devouring heaven and earth!

If he didn't cry out, so be it—but once he did, it shocked the world!

If he didn't strike, so be it—but once he struck, it was thunder and lightning, earth-shattering!

For some reason.

Chen Ruoxi didn't feel afraid at all.

Instead, an unprecedented, bone-deep sense of security, along with some inexplicable feeling that made her heart race and cheeks flush, grew wildly in her heart.

This was a real man!

Domineering!

Invincible!

Able to hold the fate of all living beings in his hand, able to sever the sorrows of eternity!

Those beautiful eyes of hers instantly blazed with an unprecedented, brilliant light.

No!

I can't keep slacking off like this!

His world is the sea of stars above the Nine Heavens!

And if I can't keep up with his pace.

I can only ever be left behind, looking up at his back!

At the Gu family.

Gu Ningxue sat quietly by the window.

In her hands, she held a cup of tea that had long gone cold.

Her pretty face was deathly pale, without a trace of color.

Those eyes that were once so quick and clever.

Now were filled with confusion and... fear!

In her mind, the news she had just heard—the one capable of overturning her entire worldview—was still echoing madly!

The Liu family... gone?

Wiped out by Lin Yuan, alone?

How was that possible?!

How was that possible!!!

How did that guy Lin Yuan keep shattering her understanding of the world every single time?!
