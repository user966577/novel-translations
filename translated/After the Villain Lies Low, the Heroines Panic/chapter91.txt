"First Divine Official, what happened?"

A figure shrouded entirely in gray mist, his voice hoarse as if two pieces of sandpaper were rubbing together, spoke first.

"Why suddenly activate the highest-level Divine Descent Assembly?"

His code name was Plague.

He commanded all illness and calamity in the world.

"Heavenly Punishment has fallen."

The First Divine Official, the Divine Sovereign Proxy, whose figure was the most solid and whose aura was the most unfathomable, spoke calmly from his position at the center of the altar.

His voice betrayed not the slightest emotional fluctuation.

As if discussing something as trivial as the weather being nice today.

However!

"What?!"

"Heavenly Punishment... is dead?!"

"What kind of joke is this! Wasn't his mission in Dragon Xia Nation just a simple feint?!"

"Who did this?! Did those old monsters from Dragon Xia Nation intervene?!"

The moment these words fell!

The silent chamber exploded!

One after another, thoughts filled with shock, fury, and disbelief collided wildly in the space!

Divine Officials!

These were Divine Officials of the Divine Court!

Representatives of the Divine Sovereign in the mortal world!

Each one was an absolute powerhouse who had killed their way out of mountains of corpses and seas of blood!

In nearly a thousand years since the Divine Court's founding, the number of fallen Divine Officials could be counted on one hand!

Today!

Another one had fallen!

This was the most severe, most blatant provocation against the entire Divine Court!

"Silence."

The First Divine Official uttered two words.

That chaotic, violent atmosphere was instantly suppressed by an even more powerful, more unquestionable will!

The entire chamber returned to silence.

All the Divine Officials refocused their attention on him.

The First Divine Official slowly raised his hand.

Hummm—!

A three-dimensional projection made of pure energy appeared in the air above the altar.

Within the projection was the final moment before Ye Canglan's fall!

The Mountain-Swallowing Martial God Tie Kuang's void-shattering domineering punch!

The Flying Moon Sword God Shangguan Jinghong's star-severing killing sword formation!

And...

Grand Marshal Lin Jianguo's all-suppressing golden divine seal!

Three of Dragon Xia Nation's supreme powerhouses combining their attacks!

Heaven-destroying and earth-shattering!

Even these Divine Officials who considered themselves above all, who styled themselves as gods, couldn't help but sharply narrow their pupils at this sight!

The projection shifted.

The scene changed to Ye Xuan being killed by Lin Yuan with a single sword stroke.

That seemingly ordinary, yet containing the profound truth of returning to simplicity, crystalline sword qi!

That vast, mighty pressure like heavenly authority descending!

Finally.

The image froze on Lin Yuan's calm face.

Froze on his final action of casually crushing the Soul-Chasing Order, full of disdain and provocation!

CRACK—!!!

The projection dissipated.

Inside the chamber, a deathly silence.

But everyone knew this was merely the calm before the storm!

"Outrageous!!!"

Sure enough!

The next second!

A Divine Official whose entire body blazed with roaring flames, with the most explosive temper, code-named Judgment, let out a furious roar!

"A mere mortal dares to challenge the dignity of the gods!"

"I request to take action! I will personally erase that brat called Lin Yuan, along with the entire city of Yanjing, from the map!"

"Indeed! If we don't avenge this, what face does our Divine Court have left?!"

Another Divine Official holding a massive scythe, his entire body radiating death energy, code-named Harvest, also spoke in a sinister tone.

"Dragon Xia Nation must pay the price in blood for their actions!"

For a moment, emotions ran high!

The thick killing intent nearly tore down the entire temple!

However.

At this moment.

An icy voice rang out, ill-timed.

"Foolish."

The speaker was a female Divine Official with a slender figure, surrounded by countless wind blades.

Her code name was Tempest.

She swept a cold, disdainful gaze over her clamoring colleagues.

"Ye Canglan deserved to die."

"For his worthless son, he defied the Divine Sovereign's plan and turned a perfect feint into a stupid personal vendetta!"

"His death was his own doing! He can blame no one!"

"As for revenge?"

Tempest let out a cold laugh.

"Is there anything in your heads besides killing?"

"Didn't you see? The timing of those two Dragon Xia Nation Martial Gods was too coincidental! That means our plan was seen through from the very start!"

"And that kid called Lin Yuan... he's an enormous variable!"

"Before we figure out exactly what his background is, a reckless attack will only repeat Ye Canglan's mistake!"

"You—!"

Divine Official Judgment flew into a rage!

"Tempest! Are you making excuses for the enemy?! You're shaking the faith of our Divine Court!"

"I'm merely stating facts."

Tempest refused to back down, meeting him head-on.

"Unlike certain people whose heads are filled with nothing but muscle!"

"You're asking for death!"

"Come then! You think I'm afraid of you?!"

Just as an internal battle was about to erupt.

"Enough."

The First Divine Official's emotionless voice rang out once more.

He said just two simple words.

Yet the tension-filled atmosphere instantly vanished into nothing.

Judgment and Tempest both snorted coldly and turned their heads away.

The First Divine Official's will slowly swept over every figure present.

"Ye Canglan defied the divine decree. His death was deserved."

"But..."

His voice suddenly dropped!

A bone-piercing killing intent descended with a crash!

"The dignity of the gods shall not be challenged!"

"Dragon Xia Nation must pay the price."

"That mortal called Lin Yuan must die even more!"

Hearing this, Divine Official Judgment's face showed a satisfied, cold smile.

While Divine Official Tempest's brows furrowed tightly.

However.

The First Divine Official's next words left everyone stunned.

"But not now."

He slowly raised his head, and those deep eyes that seemed to contain the stars of the universe looked toward that indistinct divine statue.

His gaze was filled with fanatical devotion.

"The Divine Sovereign is about to fully awaken from his slumber."

"Our plan has reached its most critical moment."

"Before then, any action that could affect the plan must be forbidden!"

"By my divine decree!"

The First Divine Official's voice suddenly became solemn and majestic!

"From this day forth, all Divine Court members enter silent mode!"

"Simultaneously, activate the highest-level wanted order!"

"I want to know everything about that mortal called Lin Yuan!"

"His past, his present, his every secret, his every weakness!"

"When the Divine Sovereign descends upon this world..."

"I will make him pay the most painful price for his arrogance today, in endless despair and regret!"

His voice echoed long in the empty chamber.

Carrying an unquestionable intent of judgment!

All the Divine Officials knelt on one knee in unison.

With the most fanatical, most devoted voices, they cried out together.

"By the divine decree!"

"The Divine Sovereign, eternal!"
