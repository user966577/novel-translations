As his words fell.

He suddenly thrust out his hand, fingers curved into claws, and viciously plunged them into Wang Teng's chest!

"AAHHH——!"

Wang Teng let out a blood-curdling scream that barely sounded human!

He could clearly feel his blood essence and spiritual energy being frantically, continuously drained through Ye Xuan's arm!

His body was rapidly shriveling!

Meanwhile, Ye Xuan wore an expression of pure ecstasy!

He could feel an unprecedented, powerful force madly growing within him!

"So... so powerful!"

"Lin Yuan! Just you wait! Soon... soon I'll be able to trample you beneath my feet! Return everything you did to me a hundredfold, a thousandfold!"

Several seconds later.

Wang Teng had become a desiccated corpse.

And Ye Xuan withdrew his hand with satisfaction, feeling the surging power within him, secretly overjoyed!

"Master, look, I've become stronger again!"

He boasted proudly to the Supreme Dao Ancestor in his mind.

However, his sea of consciousness remained deathly silent.

The Supreme Dao Ancestor didn't respond.

Ever since Ye Xuan had started associating with his mysterious and powerful father, the old ancestor had become increasingly quiet.

First, Ye Xuan's father possessed unfathomable strength that made even this remnant soul deeply wary, fearing exposure.

Second... watching Ye Xuan walk further and further down this dark path filled him with complicated emotions.

Of course he wanted Ye Xuan to grow stronger.

Because only if Ye Xuan became strong enough would he have a chance to escape this damned ring and gain new life!

But... he didn't want the price to be Ye Xuan completely falling into the demonic path, becoming a monster that knew only slaughter and devouring!

When you're old, you learn to be cautious—some things require playing it safe!

This kid was beyond saving!

He must have been blind back then!

How did he pick someone with such a twisted mentality?

He'd seemed honest on the surface—who knew he was rotten to the core inside?

If he'd known earlier, he would have rather...

Unbidden, another figure surfaced in the Supreme Dao Ancestor's mind.

That young man who lounged lazily in his chair, yet suppressed everyone with a single thought, treating all the world's heroes as nothing.

Lin Yuan!

That kid, though unconventional in his ways and seemingly a slacker, possessed the true bearing of an emperor—that temperament, that presence!

What a pity... what a pity!

For the first time, the Supreme Dao Ancestor felt the urge to cut his losses and run.

Seeing that the Supreme Dao Ancestor wasn't speaking, Ye Xuan gave a contemptuous snort.

He didn't need this old fossil's guidance anymore!

Just then, a tall middle-aged figure and an alluring feminine silhouette emerged from the darkness.

It was Ye Xuan's father and Li Xuan'er.

"Very good, Xuan'er, this is exactly how it should be."

Ye Xuan's father looked at the corpse on the ground, a satisfied smile spreading across his face.

"To stand above others, you must climb over their bones!"

Beside him, Li Xuan'er stood silently, not saying a word.

But the strange, icy aura emanating from her had grown even denser than before!

As time passed.

The number of participants in the Wilderness Hunt was rapidly dwindling.

Flashes of light from eliminated contestants flickered across every corner of the wilderness.

Those who survived to this point were all true elites.

In a quiet bamboo grove.

Gu Ningxue deflected her opponent's attack with a single sword stroke, then closed the distance. Her jade-white fingers lightly tapped his forehead.

Hum——!

The young master from the noble family stiffened, then was blasted away by an irresistible force.

On the rankings board.

Her name sat firmly in third place, behind only Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu.

She sheathed her sword and stood poised, her expression cold, preparing to leave.

Suddenly!

Several piercing gusts of wind came at her from different directions!

Gu Ningxue's beautiful eyes narrowed. With a light tap of her toes, her figure floated backward like a graceful swan, narrowly dodging the ambush.

"Who's there?!"

She demanded coldly.

"Heh heh, worthy of being the eldest daughter of the Gu family, the number one genius of Capital Martial Arts Academy. You really do have some skill."

The words were accompanied by frivolous laughter.

Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu, leading over a dozen elite heirs from various families, slowly emerged from deep within the bamboo grove.

Their gazes upon Gu Ningxue were filled with ill-intentioned greed.

"Liu Mingxuan? Chen Yu? What do you think you're doing?"

Gu Ningxue's brow furrowed tightly.

"Doing what?"

Chen Yu licked his lips, his smile ferocious.

"Why, we'd like to invite Miss Gu to come with us."

Liu Mingxuan added from the side: "That coward Lin Yuan is hiding in Black Wind Valley and won't come out. We have no choice but to use some... unconventional methods to lure him out!"

"Once we have you in our hands, do you think that Lin Yuan won't obediently come out to die?!"

"Despicable!"

Frost instantly covered Gu Ningxue's beautiful face.

"Hahaha! Despicable? The winner takes all! Once we kill Lin Yuan, who would dare say a word against us?"

Chen Yu laughed wildly, then waved his hand.

"Brothers, get her! Remember, we need her alive!"

"Yes!"

Those dozen-plus prodigies instantly transformed into wolves, lunging at Gu Ningxue!

Facing Chen Yu's undisguised ferocity and Liu Mingxuan's arrogant confidence, Gu Ningxue's cold, beautiful face showed not a trace of fear.

All that remained was an icy intent like a ten-thousand-year glacier.

She didn't even bother with another word.

Clang——!

A clear sword cry rang through the bamboo grove!

The long sword in her hand, like a stream of autumn water drawn from the Nine Heavens, its light flowing, instantly transformed into a sky full of sword shadows, sweeping toward those dozen-plus prodigies on her own initiative!

"Overestimating yourself!"

"Everyone together, cripple her!"

Those so-called elite heirs, seeing Gu Ningxue dare to attack first, sneered and drew their weapons. Spiritual energy erupted as they closed in from all sides!

Blade light, sword shadows, fist winds, palm strikes!

Dozens of terrifying attacks containing Marrow Cleansing Realm cultivation instantly wove together into an airtight net of death, seeking to swallow Gu Ningxue whole!

Yet Gu Ningxue's figure, within that deadly web of attacks, transformed into an ice butterfly dancing gracefully.

Her footwork followed some profound rhythm.

Every twist and turn perfectly avoided the most lethal strikes.

The long sword in her hand had become death's fangs.

Ding! Ding! Clang!

The crisp sound of clashing metal rang out like dense raindrops!

Each flash of her sword brought a muffled grunt from a noble heir as they stumbled backward in disarray!

Their attacks, seemingly ferocious, couldn't so much as touch the hem of Gu Ningxue's garments!

Instead, her elusive swordwork had them scrambling, their formation instantly thrown into chaos!

In barely a dozen breaths, four or five of them had been wounded by her sharp sword qi, leaving deep gashes on their arms and shoulders that cut to the bone!
