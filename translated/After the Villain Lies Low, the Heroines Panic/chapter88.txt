CRACK—!!!

A clear sound of shattering bone echoed across heaven and earth!

The Baleful Blood Dragon's impossibly hard skull actually cracked from this single punch!

Meanwhile, Lin Jianguo mobilized every last drop of his remaining protective aura.

"Heaven! Suppressing! Seal!"

BOOM—!!!

A massive square seal, condensed from pure golden protective aura, appeared out of thin air!

Then, carrying the supreme power to suppress all ages and seal gods and demons!

It stamped heavily onto the Baleful Blood Dragon's brow!

Hummm—!!!

The Baleful Blood Dragon's body suddenly froze!

All the ferocity and violence in its crimson eyes instantly vanished without a trace!

Replaced by a deathly stillness of...

Blankness!

Its divine soul had been completely suppressed by this seal!

"One Sword, Soaring Immortal!"

At that very instant.

Shangguan Jinghong's cold voice rang out like a death sentence.

Her world-piercing Moonlight Divine Sword, in this moment, restrained all its brilliance.

All its power condensed into a single point—the sword's tip!

Then.

It transformed into a seemingly ordinary, yet impossibly fast sword light that could even sever time itself!

Squelch—!

A flash and gone!

The massive, ferocious dragon head.

Flew into the air!

Thud!

The Baleful Blood Dragon's movements completely froze.

The next second, that mountain-sized headless dragon corpse plummeted from ten thousand meters high and crashed onto the earth.

BOOM!!!

The entire city of Yanjing trembled violently!

Time seemed to pause.

Across the entire battlefield, the deafening battle cries came to an abrupt halt.

Everyone's movements stopped.

Whether it was the human soldiers still fighting desperately, or the surviving beasts now completely terrified.

Everyone stared blankly at that massive corpse, still oozing foul-smelling dragon blood.

Stared at that hideous dragon head falling from the sky.

Minds went blank.

Dead?

That terrifying Baleful Blood Dragon that had descended like a god of destruction, pushing all of Yanjing City to the brink...

Just like that, it was dead?!

After a brief silence.

BOOM—!!!

A tsunami-like roar of celebration erupted from every corner of Yanjing City!

"We won! We won!"

"Hahaha! We won! We defended Yanjing City!"

"Long live the Grand Marshal! Long live the Martial Gods! Long live Dragon Xia Nation!!!"

Countless soldiers threw down their weapons, embracing each other in tears!

Countless citizens rushed from their shelters onto the streets, howling at the sky!

In this moment!

The entire city was boiling over!

A tidal wave of victory swept through all of Yanjing City!

The thunderous cheers merged into a heaven-shaking wave of sound, as if trying to overturn the clouds above!

On the city wall.

Whether battle-hardened veterans or fledgling warriors experiencing their first fight, everyone's face was filled with frenzied joy at having survived.

They embraced, shouted, threw their weapons high into the air!

We did it!

After that desperate, brutal, blood-soaked battle!

After facing that god-like, seemingly invincible Baleful Blood Dragon!

In the end, they had defended this city of heroes that carried the glory and hope of Dragon Xia Nation!

Wang Junyi, Zhao Tianlong, Chen Beixuan, Li Mo.

The four commanders were also drenched in blood, looking utterly haggard.

Their bodies were covered in wounds of all sizes, and their protective aura had long been exhausted.

Yet their spirits had never been more exhilarated!

Dragging their weary bodies, they walked step by step toward those three god-like figures.

"Grand Marshal!"

"Martial God Shangguan!"

"Martial God Tie Kuang!"

All four dropped to one knee, performing the most reverent salute!

"This battle, without you three turning the tide, our Yanjing City would have been doomed!"

Wang Junyi's voice was filled with heartfelt gratitude and admiration.

"Indeed!"

Zhao Tianlong's gruff voice now carried a hint of lingering fear. "Especially you, Grand Marshal! Such divine foresight, such preparation in advance! To think you had already arranged for both Martial Gods to stand ready for support!"

"If not for that, by the time that beast reached the walls and we tried calling for help... it would have been too late!"

"Grand Marshal's strategic brilliance—we could never hope to match it!"

Chen Beixuan and Li Mo nodded in complete agreement and admiration.

In their view.

The reason they won this battle.

Was certainly because Shangguan Jinghong and Tie Kuang arrived in time to turn the tide.

But the greatest credit still belonged to Grand Marshal Lin Jianguo!

It was his far-sighted strategic vision, surpassing everyone else's, that laid the most solid foundation for this victory!

However.

Facing everyone's praise and admiration.

Lin Jianguo only slowly shook his head.

On his resolute face appeared a complex, bitter smile.

"This credit... I don't deserve it."

What?!

The moment these words left his mouth, the entire crowd was shocked!

Everyone's cheering seemed to be seized by an invisible hand, suddenly silenced!

The four commanders exchanged bewildered glances, faces full of confusion.

What did the Grand Marshal mean?

Could there be some unknown story behind all this?

Just as everyone fell into confusion and speculation.

A somewhat slight figure unhurriedly walked up from the city wall stairs.

He wore casual clothes, completely out of place on this brutal battlefield of blood and fire.

He patted nonexistent dust from his body, his face even carrying a hint of drowsiness, as if he had just woken up.

It was Lin Yuan!

Everyone's gaze was unconsciously drawn to him.

Lin Jianguo, looking at this son who made him both proud and exasperated.

He took a deep breath.

In his deep eyes blazed unprecedented pride!

He slowly raised his hand.

Under the stunned, shocked, confused gazes of tens of thousands of soldiers.

He pointed at Lin Yuan!

"The one with true foresight isn't me."

"It's him!"

"My son, Lin Yuan!"

BOOM—!!!

Earth-shattering!

If Lin Jianguo's earlier denial had merely confused everyone.

Then these words were like a billion-megaton nuclear bomb detonating in everyone's minds!

The entire eastern gate wall fell into deathly silence once more!

Everyone's eyes went wide, mouths agape!

Their expressions frozen solid!

As if witnessing the most unbelievable, most absurd thing in the world!

Lin... Young Master Lin?!

That legendary good-for-nothing who only knew how to indulge in pleasure?!

That person the entire city used as a negative example?!

Though recent events had proven that this young master possessed talent and cultivation far beyond ordinary people, hearing Lin Jianguo say this still came as an enormous shock!

What kind of joke was this?!

How... how was this possible?!

However.

Lin Jianguo's next words shattered all their doubts, all their disbelief, into pieces!

"Before the beast tide erupted, Yuan'er predicted that the Divine Court's methods wouldn't stop there! That million-strong wolf tide was merely an appetizer—the real killing blow was yet to come!"

"It was he who had me contact Martial God Tie Kuang and Martial God Shangguan in advance, having them ready to provide support at any moment!"

Lin Jianguo's voice rang clear and strong, echoing in everyone's ears.

He paused, his gaze sweeping over face after face, all frozen in shock.

His voice suddenly rose!

"And that's not all!"

"Do you all remember the Wilderness Hunt from before?!"

"Ye Canglan led Divine Court assassins to set up an elaborate trap, attempting to wipe out our Dragon Xia Nation's young generation of geniuses in one fell swoop!"

"That time too! It was Yuan'er!"

"He saw through all of Ye Canglan's schemes in advance! He devised the strategy to turn their trap against them! That's the only reason we could snatch victory from certain death! That's why Ye Canglan ended up shooting himself in the foot!"

Boom! Boom! Boom!

One after another, these heaven-shaking secrets!

Like the most violent thunderbolts, struck everyone right on the crown of their heads!

Wang Junyi's mind went blank!

Zhao Tianlong's massive frame trembled violently!

Chen Beixuan nearly lost his grip on his sword, almost dropping it!

Li Mo was so ashamed he wanted to find a hole in the ground to crawl into!

So that's...

How it was?

So the Wilderness Hunt victory wasn't a fluke!

So this Yanjing City defense victory wasn't luck either!

Behind it all was that young man they had never truly looked at, even secretly despised in their hearts.

Turning the tide without anyone noticing!

It was him!

Without anyone realizing, he had pulled the entire city, tens of millions of lives, back from the brink of destruction!

What terrifying wisdom!

What heaven-defying strategy!

In an instant, countless gazes filled with shock, horror, guilt, admiration...

All manner of complex emotions converged on Lin Yuan!

Facing this scene of being the center of attention.

Lin Yuan's face showed a hint of impatience.

"Dad, why are you saying all this?"

He scratched his head, somewhat helplessly explaining:

"This really isn't any kind of prophecy."

"It was just simple... putting myself in their shoes."

"The Divine Court—what kind of people are they? A bunch of lunatics hiding in the shadows, unable to see the light! Such people are petty and vindictive. After eating such a big loss at the Wilderness Hunt, how could they possibly swallow that anger?"

"So their revenge was definitely coming."

"And it would definitely be even crazier, even more reckless than last time."

Lin Yuan's voice was very calm.

As if merely stating a simple fact that one plus one equals two.

"I just... thought one step further ahead than everyone here."

The entire place fell silent.

The commanders' faces flushed red with shame.

One step further?

Yes!

Just that one step!

Yet it was the distance between heaven and hell!

Between life and death!

"Young... Young Master Lin..."

Zhao Tianlong, this iron-boned man, now had a quiver in his voice.

He suddenly bowed deeply to Lin Yuan.

"I, Zhao Tianlong, am a rough man! Before, I failed to recognize a great man when I saw one! I... I apologize to you!"
