That lazy voice was like a demon god's whisper from the depths of the Nine Nethers, yet also like a divine pronouncement from one seated high in the Nine Heavens.

Every word transformed into an invisible heavy hammer, smashing against the souls of Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade!

Tea? You want us to drink tea?!

We came to kill you! We're the Divine Court's top assassins!

But now...

Forget killing anyone—they hadn't even touched a corner of his clothes.

They hadn't even figured out which way the Lin family gate opened before some bizarre barrier had instantly reduced them to critical condition!

What kind of terrifying power was this?!

"Run!"

For the first time, Ghost Owl's eyes showed an emotion called fear!

This Lin family wasn't some dragon's den or tiger's lair!

This was a death abyss that devoured everything!

The intelligence was wrong! Completely wrong!

This Lin Yuan wasn't some Qi Sea Realm brat!

He was a monster! An ancient beast wearing human skin!

The two forcibly suppressed their churning blood and qi, leaping from the rubble, transforming into two streaks of black smoke as they desperately fled in opposite directions!

However.

They'd barely made it three meters.

"Hum——"

That invisible, all-encompassing pressure descended once again!

Thud!

Thud!

Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade were like insects swatted from midair by invisible hands!

Their knees slammed heavily into the cold ground.

The solid stone pavement instantly cracked!

Their legs had been forcibly shattered by that pressure!

"Ahhh——!"

Intense pain drew agonized screams from them both.

But what drove them to deeper despair was that bone-deep, irresistible absolute suppression!

Before this power.

Their Meridian Opening cultivation, their prided movement techniques, their assassination skills honed over half a lifetime...

All became a joke!

A thoroughly laughable, pathetic joke!

"Running?"

Lin Yuan's voice drifted over, unhurried, from the direction of the rear garden.

"Did I say you could go?"

As his words fell.

A figure, yawning, slowly emerged from the darkness.

It was Lin Yuan.

He didn't even bother assuming a fighting stance, hands stuffed in his pockets, face showing a hint of annoyance at being disturbed.

"Who... who the hell are you?!"

Shadow Blade looked at this youth strolling toward him, voice shrill and distorted with extreme terror.

"Me?"

Lin Yuan pursed his lips.

"Just an innocent young man who wants to sleep but keeps getting bothered by flies."

"Since you're so reluctant to leave, stay forever."

His tone was as casual as if he were remarking on nice weather.

But to Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade, it was nothing less than the grim reaper's final notice!

"Bastard!"

"We'll take you down with us!"

Desperation birthed ultimate madness!

Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade exchanged looks, each seeing resolute death in the other's eyes!

They knew today they had no chance of leaving alive!

In that case!

They'd drag this monster to hell with them!

"Nether Blood Sacrifice! Burn our souls!"

Both let out shrill howls!

BOOM! BOOM!

Two streams of ink-black, blood-red flames, filled with evil, violence, and death, erupted from the crowns of their heads!

This was the Divine Court's forbidden technique!

Burning their own souls as the price for an instant burst that exceeded their limits—the ultimate attack!

The cost: soul annihilation, eternal damnation with no rebirth!

In a flash!

Their auras began surging at a terrifying rate!

That horrifying energy fluctuation even caused the air above the entire Lin family estate to violently distort!

Two towering phantom demon gods, constructed from blood-colored evil energy, slowly materialized behind them, standing ten zhang tall!

"Die!"

"Nether God Claw!"

Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade's voices no longer sounded human.

Their soul-burning bodies transformed into two streaks of blood light, madly lunging toward Lin Yuan!

Those two heaven-obscuring demon claws tore through the air with enough force to crush mountains, reaching ruthlessly for Lin Yuan's head!

This strike!

Could instantly kill any peak Meridian Opening expert!

However.

Facing this heaven-destroying attack.

Lin Yuan didn't even bother raising an eyelid.

He just pursed his lips with some impatience.

"So noisy."

Then.

He slowly raised his right hand.

No earth-shattering spiritual energy explosion.

No heaven-destroying terrifying aura.

He simply snapped his fingers.

"Snap."

The crisp sound rang exceptionally clear in the quiet night.

At that very instant.

A pressure beyond description—as if from the primordial chaos at the universe's beginning—absolute and supreme—crashed down!

Time seemed to freeze.

Space seemed to solidify.

Those two invincible demon god phantoms, those two mountain-rending nether claws...

The moment they touched this pressure.

Like snow under sunlight, they began silently melting, dissolving...

Without even a single ripple!

"Im... impossible..."

Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade's bodies froze in midair.

Their crazed, ferocious expressions instantly petrified, replaced by endless, bone-deep horror and despair!

Their ultimate attack!

Their soul-burning, all-or-nothing killing strike!

Just like that... gone?

Broken by a snap of the fingers?!

This had exceeded their comprehension!

This was not power that belonged to mortals!

This was... the power of gods!

Just as their souls shattered and their consciousness was about to collapse.

Lin Yuan's lazy voice sounded once more.

"Alright, show's over."

He raised his eyes and flicked a finger.

Crackle——!

A purple lightning bolt, thin as a hair, flashed from his fingertip.

Fast to the extreme!

So fast that neither space nor time could capture its trajectory!

Two soft sounds.

That purple lightning effortlessly pierced through the brows of Ghost Owl and Shadow Blade.

No screams.

No struggling.

The moment the lightning pierced them, their bodies turned into two handfuls of utterly insignificant ash, scattered by the evening breeze, vanishing completely between heaven and earth.

As if they had never existed in this world.

Just then.

From the dissipating ash came a faint soul remnant wave, filled with dying resentment.

"It was... the Liu family... Liu Qingtian... thirty percent of holdings... to buy your life..."

Before the words finished, that last wisp of remnant soul was completely annihilated by the power of the Purple Heaven Divine Thunder.

Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly.

"The Liu family?"

Before he could think further.

A towering figure, carrying a terrifying iron-blooded killing aura, appeared behind him.

It was Lin Jianguo!

He had obviously also heard that dying confession.

That eternally unchanging ice-mountain face was now covered with murderous intent cold enough to freeze the Nine Nethers!

"The audacity of the Liu family!"

"The audacity of Liu Qingtian!"

"Colluding with the Divine Court to assassinate my son!"

"Do they want their entire clan exterminated?!"

Lin Jianguo took one step forward, and the entire Lin family estate trembled!

The killing intent radiating from him had almost become tangible!

Lin Yuan looked at his old man's murderous demeanor and could only sigh helplessly.

Then, finally, he straightened up from his lazy posture.

He stretched, his bones crackling in a series of pops.

"What a pain."

He gazed in the direction of the Liu family, and for the first time, those dark eyes flashed with an icy, heart-chilling gleam.

"Looks like some trash won't give me peace unless I clean it up personally."

He turned to look at Lin Jianguo.

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly into a cold arc: "Dad, don't bother the city garrison. I'll personally visit the Liu family and have a nice chat with them."
