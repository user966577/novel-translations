Uncle Zhong stood at the bathroom door, hearing the young master's calm words, and his entire body stiffened for a moment.

Open the gates... release the dogs?

He had been at Lin Yuan's side for so many years, and this was the first time he had heard the young master use such a ruthless, even humiliating method against anyone.

Especially when that someone was Li Xuan'er, whom he had once held dearly in his heart.

It seemed the young master had truly let go completely.

No—it should be said he had never truly held on.

The worry and hint of sympathy in his heart instantly vanished, replaced by a sense of satisfaction and relief from the depths of his being.

"Yes, Young Master. I understand." Uncle Zhong bowed respectfully, then turned around. His face resumed that immaculate butler expression, but deep in his eyes flickered a cold gleam.

Anyone who made the young master uncomfortable should be prepared to bear the consequences.

Outside the estate, the cold wind was desolate.

Li Xuan'er stood alone beneath a streetlight's shadow, her delicate body trembling slightly in the wind, her face pale as paper.

Just then, the heavy, ornate gilded gate slowly opened a crack.

Li Xuan'er's heart lurched, and a spark of hope ignited in her eyes.

Was it him? Had he decided to come see her after all?

However, what walked out from behind the gate was not the figure she longed for, but a squad of guards in black uniforms—imposing, radiating an iron-blooded aura.

The squad leader's gaze was sharp as a blade.

He walked straight up to her, stood at attention, and spoke in a completely emotionless, businesslike tone: "Good evening, miss."

"According to Article 7, Section 3 of the Dragon Xia Country Estate Management Regulations, and Article 19 of the Yan Jing City Appearance Management Law, extended loitering, lingering, and dumping of large garbage within one hundred meters of private residences is prohibited."

The squad leader's voice wasn't loud, but in the silent winter night, each word landed like a resounding slap across Li Xuan'er's face.

Extended loitering...

Dumping large garbage...

Her face drained of color instantly!

She knew.

The "large garbage" they were referring to was her!

Endless humiliation crashed over her like a bursting dam.

"I... I just..."

Her lips trembled as she tried to defend herself, but she found her throat blocked as if stuffed with cotton—not a single word would come out.

The squad leader seemed not to notice her utterly humiliated expression and continued in that icy tone: "Additionally, according to our estate's internal security protocols, for any individuals behaving suspiciously in the vicinity of the estate who do not heed warnings, we reserve the right to..."

He paused, his gaze sweeping over Li Xuan'er's ashen face, then spoke word by word: "Open the gates. Release the dogs."

BOOM—!

Those four words were a hundred times more cruel than all the previous humiliation combined!

Like a red-hot iron hammer, they ruthlessly shattered the last shred of fantasy and dignity in Li Xuan'er's heart.

So in his eyes.

She wasn't even as good as some "suspicious person" off the street.

He couldn't even be bothered to come humiliate her personally. He simply shooed her away like swatting a fly, sending security to handle it.

No, she wasn't even as good as a fly.

At least swatting a fly required doing it yourself.

And dealing with her required only...

Releasing the dogs.

"Pfft—"

Li Xuan'er could no longer withstand the massive blow. She suddenly spat out a mouthful of heart blood, her body swaying as if about to collapse.

The squad leader merely watched her coldly, as if observing an object that had nothing to do with him.

Li Xuan'er stumbled backward several steps.

Looking at that gate—so close yet so impossibly far—a smile uglier than crying twisted her face.

She finally understood.

The gap between her and Lin Yuan was never about family background, talent, or effort.

It was an unbridgeable chasm rooted in the very level of their existence.

She had thought she'd chosen a shortcut to the summit, but instead she'd been sprinting down a road of self-destruction.

She had thought Ye Xuan's rise was her most successful investment.

Now it seemed that was nothing but a clown, performing a pathetic farce at the cost of burning his own life.

And she was the most foolish audience member—handing the clown a knife, thinking she'd share in the glory.

She staggered around, dragging her shattered heart, and disappeared into the thick darkness of night.

Meanwhile.

At the National College League competitor hotel.

Ye Xuan sat cross-legged on the bed.

Forcibly suppressing the waves of weakness from the technique's backlash.

The "Blood-Burning Dragon Transformation Art" gave him power, but the side effects were equally obvious.

He could feel his life essence draining away at a slow but irreversible pace.

But he didn't care!

As long as he could defeat Lin Yuan, any price was worth it!

He opened his computer.

Looking at the news praising him to the skies all over the internet.

Looking at the forum posts hailing him as "the future of Dragon Xia martial arts," a powerful sense of satisfaction filled his heart.

He had succeeded!

He had finally crushed that guy's spotlight completely!

Now!

Who in all of Dragon Xia didn't know the name Ye Xuan?

And Lin Yuan?

Just a coward hiding in his estate, too scared to even enter a competition!

"Lin Yuan, do you see this?"

"This is the glory that should belong to me!"

Ye Xuan's gaze became intensely fervent. He stared fixedly toward the direction of the Lin Family Estate outside his window.

"Once I take the championship, I'll personally come to your door!"

"When that time comes, I'll show you who is the true protagonist of this era!"
