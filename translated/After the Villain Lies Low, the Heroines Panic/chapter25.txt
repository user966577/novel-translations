While the outside world was turned upside down by a single video, the Lin family estate remained a picture of peaceful tranquility.

Lin Yuan lay sprawled on the living room's priceless exotic beast-skin sofa.

Eyes half-closed, enjoying life.

Beside him, a beautiful, shapely personal maid was carefully peeling a crystalline, spirit-energy-rich Purple Jade Grape before gently placing it at his lips.

"Mmm..."

Lin Yuan smacked his lips in satisfaction.

Now this was the life!

Fighting and killing?

Nonexistent.

Chasing fame and fortune?

Too exhausting.

Lying around was the most comfortable.

Just as he was savoring this rare peace, preparing to take another nap—

A flurry of hurried footsteps approached.

"Big brother! Big brother! I'm here!"

The person arrived before her voice did.

A small pink figure bounced in like a happy little bunny.

It was his genius formation-master little sister, Lin Ke'er.

Ever since Lin Yuan had casually pointed out several fatal flaws in her prized "Nine-Twist Dragon Trap Formation," Lin Ke'er had completely transformed into his number one fangirl, constantly pestering him with questions about advanced formations.

Lin Yuan looked at his sister who had bounded to his side, blinking her big watery eyes, her face full of eagerness to learn, and felt a headache coming on.

So annoying!

This young master just wants to lie flat in peace. Who wants to discuss formations with you!

"Big brother, explain it to me again! That theory about spatial node transposition—I still don't quite understand..."

Lin Ke'er clung to his arm, shaking it constantly, pleading sweetly.

"Stop, stop, stop!"

Lin Yuan sat up impatiently.

He knew that if he didn't get rid of this little imp, his peaceful afternoon would be completely ruined.

His mind turned, and he suddenly remembered a cultivation method the system had rewarded him with a few days ago.

"Zhou Tian Star Array: Remnant Chapter"!

Though it was merely a fragment of an ancient divine formation, its complexity and profundity were over a hundred levels above Lin Ke'er's "Nine-Twist Dragon Trap Formation"!

Got it!

A subtle, mischievous smile formed at the corner of Lin Yuan's mouth.

He cleared his throat and said with an air of affected profundity, "Ahem, Ke'er, that Nine-Twist Dragon Trap Formation is too elementary. There's no point studying it all the time."

"Huh?" Lin Ke'er blinked, her little mouth pouting slightly. "But it's an Earth-Rank upper-grade formation! How is that elementary?"

"I recently happened to obtain a remnant scroll of an ancient formation. I find it rather interesting."

Lin Yuan spoke slowly, deliberately leaving her in suspense.

"An ancient formation?!"

Lin Ke'er's eyes instantly lit up like two brilliant stars.

As a formation fanatic, those four words held fatal appeal!

"What is it?! Let me see!"

She urged impatiently.

"Well..." Lin Yuan pretended to ponder. "This formation is called the 'Zhou Tian Star Array.' It's quite profound—probably still too advanced for you. I'm afraid it might damage your confidence. You should stick to your Dragon Trap Formation for now."

The goading technique!

Simple, but effective!

Sure enough, when Lin Ke'er heard this, her little face flushed red, and she puffed up her small chest indignantly.

"Big brother, you're underestimating me! I'm a once-in-a-century formation genius! There's no formation I can't figure out! Hand it over!"

"Fine, fine. Since you insist."

Lin Yuan spread his hands with an expression of "you asked for this, don't blame me," and casually transmitted the information of that remnant chapter directly into Lin Ke'er's mind via divine sense.

Hum——!

An incomparably vast, complex, and abstruse flow of information instantly flooded into Lin Ke'er's Sea of Consciousness.

Just the opening section on a single basic formation node contained tens of thousands of variations, involving spatial laws, temporal laws, the power of stars, and countless other profound principles!

Lin Ke'er froze completely.

Her pretty big eyes instantly lost focus, her little mouth formed an "O" shape, and her entire being seemed to have its soul extracted, turning into a statue.

A full minute passed.

She finally snapped back to reality.

Then she burst into a scream more excited than any before!

"Divine... divine work! This is a true divine-grade formation!"

Without even glancing at Lin Yuan again, she turned and dashed toward her personal formation laboratory, shouting like a woman possessed as she ran:

"No! I must figure this out! Nobody disturb me!"

Watching his sister's "possessed" retreating figure, Lin Yuan lay back down with satisfaction.

Done!

By his estimate, given her level, just scratching the surface of this remnant chapter would take her at least ten days to two weeks.

The world was finally peaceful.

However, this thought hadn't even lasted three seconds—

The crisp sound of high heels clicking against the floor approached from afar.

His businesswoman elder sister, Lin Mengyao, arms crossed, strode over with queenly steps.

"Tsk, tsk, tsk."

Lin Mengyao circled the sofa once, looking down at him from above, her lips curved in a teasing smile.

"Our family's young master is quite the celebrity in the capital now. You just sleep at school and end up trending at number one."

She waved the light-brain in her hand. On the screen played the video of Lin Yuan bringing Huangfu Zhuo to his knees with "a single glance."

"Care to explain how you scared that insufferably arrogant Huangfu family genius into fleeing with his tail between his legs, all with just one look?"

Lin Yuan didn't even bother opening his eyes. He took another spirit fruit from the maid's hand and chewed it slowly.

"Explain what? Nothing to explain."

He swallowed the fruit and replied in a matter-of-fact, bland tone:

"He was just too weak. Couldn't handle a scare."

Lin Mengyao choked at his humble-brag response, caught between laughter and exasperation.

Lin Yuan paused, as if remembering something, and added:

"If this is the caliber of the Huangfu family's younger generation..."

"I'd say the Huangfu family isn't far from finished."
