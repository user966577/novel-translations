"No... impossible..."

Ye Xuan's voice rasped like a broken bellows, hoarse and powerless.

He lay collapsed in the human-shaped crater he'd carved, every bone in his body seemingly shattered, the pain crashing over him in waves.

But no pain, however intense, could compare to the collapse and despair in his heart at this moment!

A single finger!

Just one casual finger!

The supreme power he'd been so proud of—exchanged for by devouring countless prodigies' blood essence, which he believed could crush everything—was nothing but a joke.

Broken effortlessly!

He didn't even have the qualifications to make his opponent take him seriously!

Why?

How can this be?!

Towering resentment transformed into endless madness, burning in his chest!

Li Xuan'er's condition was even worse.

A bloody hole gaped in her chest, her aura weakened to the extreme. For the first time, that seductively beautiful face showed fear.

She looked at that man holding Gu Ningxue, not a wrinkle out of place—and felt that what she faced wasn't a human at all.

But an ancient demon god wearing human skin!

An emotion welled up.

It was fear... from the depths of her soul!

Just then.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Dozens of figures in uniform black robes, emanating evil auras, shot out from the surrounding shadows like specters!

They instantly surrounded this ruined bamboo grove, sealing it tight!

The lead black-robed figure glanced at Ye Xuan and Li Xuan'er lying on the ground like dead dogs, then at the unharmed Lin Yuan and Gu Ningxue in his arms.

A hoarse voice emerged from beneath his hood.

"It seems the plan has hit a small snag."

"But no matter."

"Capture them all. Those who resist—kill without mercy!"

"Yes!"

Dozens of black-robed figures responded in unison, their voices thick with bloodlust!

They were the elite of the "Divine Court," under Ye Xuan's father's command.

Each possessed strength no less than peak Qi Sea Realm.

Several squad leaders had even reached Meridian Opening Realm!

Such a massive force was enough to sweep through any faction in the Wilderness Hunt!

And their objective was to capture all the prodigies here in one fell swoop!

Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu, collapsed on the ground, felt all color drain from their faces at this sight!

It was over!

Completely over!

Out of the tiger's den and into the wolf's lair!

Today, they were truly going to die here!

However.

Facing this siege that would make any prodigy despair.

Lin Yuan's face actually showed a hint of... an amused smile.

He gently set the still-recovering Gu Ningxue down on a clean stone.

Then he straightened up, cracked his neck with a series of pops.

"Perfect."

He drawled lazily, his voice soft but clear to every ear.

"Qi Sea Realm sixth level cultivation—haven't had a proper workout yet."

"You'll do for a warm-up."

As his words fell.

He moved.

With a casual flick of his hand!

Whoosh whoosh whoosh——!

Over a hundred crystalline spirit stones, like a goddess scattering flowers, flew from his palm.

They didn't fall to the ground. Instead, they hovered in mid-air, instantly arranging themselves according to some profound pattern.

HUM——!!!

The next second!

The sky went dark!

The clear sky was instantly replaced by endless darkness.

The next second.

A canopy of stars, twinkling with cold light!

The celestial phenomena across a radius of dozens of miles had been forcibly altered by him alone!

"What... what is this?!"

"A formation! It's a formation! When did he set up a formation?!"

"My spiritual energy! My spiritual energy flow has been suppressed by at least fifty percent!"

All the black-robed figures were aghast.

They felt as though they'd been thrown into the deep sea, pressure closing in from all directions, infinite and inescapable.

Every star seemed like a primordial divine mountain pressing down on their souls, making even breathing incredibly difficult.

This was...

The Grand Celestial Star Formation!

Though it was merely a fragment Lin Yuan had obtained from the System, wielding not even one percent of the original's power.

But against this pack of dogs and chickens? More than enough!

"Kill! Kill him! At any cost!"

The lead black-robed figure howled in terrified fury!

He knew that if this dragged on, every last one of them would be crushed to death by this eerie stellar power!

"Kill!"

Dozens of Divine Court assassins, fighting through the immense pressure.

Roaring, they channeled all their evil energy, transforming into a flood of black that charged toward Lin Yuan standing at the formation's center!

They would use the most brutal method to tear this formation-caster apart!

Lin Yuan watched the approaching figures, the corner of his mouth curving into a cruel arc.

"Warm-up's over."

"Now, time to send you... on your way."

Lin Yuan's voice was soft.

But in this space of absolute silence constructed from stars, it rang exceptionally clear.

Each word was like an invisible hammer, smashing heavily against the hearts of all the Divine Court members!

Warm-up... over?

This...

This was just a warm-up?!

Using a miraculous formation to crush them all like ants, pinning them to the ground, unable to move!

This... was merely a warm-up?!

Then how terrifying must the real attack be?!

A fear a thousand times stronger than death itself flooded over them like icy water, instantly drowning their reason!

This was no young genius from Yan Jing City!

This was clearly an ancient demon god... wearing human skin!

Yet.

Lin Yuan's face showed not a flicker of emotion.

He simply, slowly, raised his right fist.

His movements were unhurried.

So slow that everyone present could clearly see his pale, slender fingers curl one by one, gradually clenching.

No earth-shattering momentum.

No world-destroying spiritual energy fluctuations.

Just an ordinary clenching motion.

Yet this simple action made the Divine Court assassins' pupils contract to pinpoints.

They sensed an unprecedented, fatal crisis!

As if what Lin Yuan held in his hand wasn't his fist.

But rather...

The power over life and death of the entire universe!

"Grand Void Shattering Fist."

Five soft words fell from Lin Yuan's lips.

Then.

He casually threw a punch at the black-robed figures prostrated below!

BOOM——!!!

This punch!

Had no fist wind!

Had no light effects!

But!

The instant Lin Yuan threw his punch!

The billions of stars hanging in the firmament above seemed to receive some supreme command!

They blazed with unprecedented, dazzling brilliance!

The next second!

A wondrous yet terrifying scene unfolded!

One!

Ten!

A hundred!

Thousands upon thousands of massive stars actually left their original orbits!

Trailing long, magnificent tails of flame, like an apocalyptic meteor shower!

Carrying a terrifying power capable of ripping through spacetime and crushing all things, they came crashing down upon the Divine Court members on the ground!

The scene was like the end of the world!
