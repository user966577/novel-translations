Hummm—!

The entire eastern gate wall trembled slightly from the emergence of this power.

"You... What are you all doing here?! This is absurd!"

Wang Junyi finally reacted, unleashing a furious roar at the group of young masters and mistresses who had suddenly appeared.

"This is a battlefield! Not a playground for children! Get back immediately!"

"Commander Wang."

Gu Ningxue spoke, sword in hand, her voice clear and cold.

"When the city faces destruction, every citizen bears responsibility."

Her voice wasn't loud, but it carried absolute conviction.

"Though we may be women, we understand the duty to our nation. If Yanjing City falls, we'll die anyway. Rather than sit and await death, we'd rather fight with everything we have!"

"Well said!"

Song Yao cracked her chain blade with a crisp clatter.

She planted one foot on the edge of the wall, her purple figure fluttering in the wind.

"I, Song Yao, want to see just how hard these beasts' bones really are!"

"When the city faces destruction, every citizen bears responsibility!"

"Fight to the death! Defend our homeland!"

The other young nobles also drew their weapons, crying out in unison.

Their faces might still hold traces of youth, but their eyes burned with the same resolve as battle-hardened veterans!

"You..."

Wang Junyi looked at these young people, momentarily at a loss for words.

What could he say?

That they didn't know the heights of heaven or the depths of earth?

Yet here they were, demonstrating the courage and duty of Dragon Xia's children through their actions!

"Good! Good! Good!"

Zhao Tianlong leaned on his massive battle-axe and roared with laughter.

"Well spoken! When the city faces destruction, every citizen bears responsibility! Today, we'll give these beasts a fight they'll never forget!"

"Kill!"

Gu Ningxue wasted no more words. With a single command, she transformed into a streak of white lightning, charging toward the endless wolf army below the walls.

Her sword light flickered like dancing pear blossoms, each flash instantly slaying a vicious wolf!

"Hmph! Let's see who can kill more!"

Song Yao let out a sharp cry, her chain blade striking like a venomous serpent, instantly wrapping around an elite-class wolf and squeezing tight!

Squelch!

The wolf didn't even have time to scream before being shredded into a spray of bloody chunks!

"Go!"

On the wall, Lin Ke'er's small face was serious as she activated the Nine Dragon Eight Trigrams Mirror.

The dozens of weapons forming her killing formation instantly became a torrent of steel, diving down and carving a long, bloody corridor through the wolf pack!

For a moment, the tide of battle seemed to have been stemmed.

These top young talents of Yanjing City displayed combat power far beyond their years.

Their arrival was like a shot of adrenaline, reigniting the fighting spirit of soldiers who had already fallen into despair!

"Kill them! For Yanjing City!"

"Fight these beasts to the death!"

Battle cries once again shook heaven and earth.

However, that most terrifying Baleful Blood Dragon, after a brief moment of surprise and anger, showed a hint of human-like disdain in its crimson eyes.

It couldn't even be bothered with those "insects" slaughtering the ordinary wolves.

It had only one goal.

To destroy the city before it!

"ROAR—!!!"

Another earth-shattering roar.

This time, instead of gathering light, it moved its pillar-like limbs and charged toward the eastern gate wall!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The earth wailed and cracked beneath its trampling!

Its massive body, carrying an overwhelming pressure, crashed forward like a moving primordial demon mountain!

"No! Stop it, quickly!"

Wang Junyi's face went deathly pale.

If it hit the wall directly, the entire section would be instantly pulverized!

"Frozen Snow Sword Formation!"

Gu Ningxue shouted, pointing her sword as several sharp sword qi shot toward the dragon's eyes.

"Heaven's Net!"

Song Yao's chain blade extended infinitely, attempting to bind the dragon's massive feet.

"Nine Dragon Execution!"

Lin Ke'er pushed her formation to its absolute limit!

Yet all these attacks, landing on the Baleful Blood Dragon's massive body, were like ants trying to topple a tree—laughable and futile!

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sword qi struck its eyelids without leaving even a white mark before bouncing away.

The chain blade that could shred elite wolves was blasted away by a tremendous force the instant it touched the dragon's scales.

Even the most powerful weapon formation only raised a few insignificant sparks on the dragon's body.

The gap!

An unbridgeable gap!

This wasn't even a fight on the same level!

"It's over..."

Those two words rose in everyone's hearts.

But at that moment, an even more despairing scene unfolded.

Behind the Baleful Blood Dragon, the beast tide that had begun to thin suddenly grew dense again.

Endless dark masses of beasts, like a bursting dam, surged from the edge of the horizon.

Moreover, these beasts' auras were even stronger and more violent than before!

More and more strange beasts!

Endless!

It was as if every beast in the wilderness was converging on Yanjing City!

The glimmer of hope that had just ignited was now completely crushed, replaced by even deeper despair.

"The west... The west side too!"

A soldier on lookout screamed hoarsely, his voice cracking with sobs.

"South... South gate under attack! Requesting backup! Requesting backup!"

Broken, static-filled cries for help came through the communication devices from other sectors.

Surrounded on all sides!

The entire city was encircled!

However!

At this critical moment!

Two voices—one male, one female—suddenly rang out.

One was rough and domineering, supremely overbearing!

The other was clear and ethereal, razor-sharp!

Like thunder from the nine heavens, they resounded across the entire world!

"Hmph! What a magnificent beast! How dare you wound my Dragon Xia Nation's Grand Marshal! Do you truly think our Dragon Xia Nation has no one left?!"

"Sword, come!"

BOOM—!!!

The instant those words fell!

Two brilliant streaks of light shot from the horizon at a terrifying speed that seemed to ignore space itself!

One was a pure, powerful golden light filled with overwhelming force.

Like a meteor falling from beyond the nine heavens!

Arriving last but striking first!

It smashed heavily onto that massive head of the Baleful Blood Dragon just as it was about to attack.

BOOM—!!!

An earth-shattering explosion!

That invincible Baleful Blood Dragon—the world-ending light beam already gathered to its peak in its mouth—was forcibly suppressed back!

It let out an enraged roar.

The other streak of light!

Was a silver sword light, cold as moonlight yet sharp enough to sever all things!

That sword light didn't attack the Baleful Blood Dragon.

Instead, it swept across the city wall like a silver heavenly river!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

In an instant!

Below the wall, the tens of thousands of beasts frantically climbing—

Their bodies suddenly froze!

The next second.

Countless fine lines of blood appeared on their bodies!

Then.

SPLAT—!!!

Thousands upon thousands of beasts were simultaneously sliced into a rain of flesh and blood by that omnipresent, terrifying sword qi!

Just one sword!

It cleared every enemy below the eastern gate!

The entire battlefield fell into deathly silence once more!
