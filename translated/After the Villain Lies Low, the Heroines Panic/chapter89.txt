Dead silence.

Zhao Tianlong's heartfelt apology was like a boulder thrown into a lake, sending towering waves through everyone's hearts.

The mighty Commander of the Western District!

An Aura Transformation Realm expert!

Now bowing deeply to a young man!

Yet no one present thought there was anything wrong with this.

On the contrary, they thought it perfectly natural!

This bow—Lin Yuan deserved it!

"Alright, alright."

Lin Yuan waved his hand somewhat wearily, gesturing for Zhao Tianlong to rise.

What he hated most were scenes like this.

His gaze shifted to the massive dragon corpse below the wall, casually changing the subject.

"We may have won this battle."

"But what do you all plan to do with this giant lizard's carcass?"

The moment these words left his mouth.

Indeed, everyone's attention was instantly drawn to it.

The joy of victory gradually faded.

Replaced by gravity and contemplation.

"This Baleful Blood Dragon was a Rebirth Realm level terror. Its entire body is priceless treasure!"

One general's eyes blazed as he spoke.

"Exactly! Dragon scales can forge armor! Dragon bones can refine artifacts! Dragon blood is a supreme tonic! If properly utilized, it could raise the overall strength of our entire Yanjing City to another level!"

"But..." Wang Junyi frowned deeply, his voice grave. "This is also a hot potato! To summon it, the Divine Court sacrificed tens of millions of beasts—what an enormous cost! They definitely won't let this go!"

Everyone's hearts sank at these words.

Indeed!

Treasure was nice, but you needed to be alive to enjoy it!

They had already experienced firsthand how strange and powerful the Divine Court was.

Who knew what other terrifying tricks those shadowy lunatics might have up their sleeves!

For a moment, everyone was caught in a dilemma.

Watching their troubled expressions.

Lin Yuan yawned and spoke lazily.

"Why wouldn't we take the treasure?"

"As for the Divine Court's revenge? We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."

He spoke as if it were nothing.

As if that terrifying, mysterious organization was nothing in his eyes.

He walked to the edge of the wall, looking down at the dragon corpse with the appraising eye of a seasoned butcher examining meat on a cutting board.

"This dragon blood contains boundless life essence. Diluted and refined into Dragon Blood Body Tempering Liquid, we can give every soldier in the city a collective marrow cleansing and meridian strengthening."

"The dragon scales are impervious to fire and water, resistant to blades and swords. Strip them off and custom-forge a set of Blood Dragon Battle Armor for every commander-level officer and above. That alone will multiply their defensive capabilities."

"The dragon bones and tendons are supreme materials for forging divine weapons. Crush them and integrate them into weapons—that can more than double their power..."

Lin Yuan's voice was unhurried.

Point by point, item by item, he laid it all out clearly.

With each sentence, the eyes of every general present grew brighter!

Even Lin Jianguo, Shangguan Jinghong, and Tie Kuang—these three supreme experts—looked at Lin Yuan with undisguised amazement!

Many of these methods for utilizing beast materials.

Were secret techniques passed down from ancient times!

Lost for hundreds of years!

This kid...

How did he know all this?!

"Young... Young Master Lin..." one general couldn't help but stammer, "How... how do you know these secret techniques?"

"Oh."

Lin Yuan replied casually.

"I saw them in some old, tattered book once."

"Found it interesting, so I memorized it."

Everyone: "..."

Ancient books again?!

Is your family's book collection some kind of all-encompassing encyclopedia?!

Just as everyone's admiration for Lin Yuan was about to break through the heavens.

A sudden development!

"Report—!!!"

A soldier tasked with cleaning the battlefield scrambled up the wall, face pale as death!

In his hand, he held something high!

"Grand... Grand Marshal! My lords! In... in those ruins, we found... this!"

Everyone's gaze instantly converged on it!

In the soldier's hand was a palm-sized ink-black token!

The token was forged from some unknown material, ice-cold to the touch.

"This is..."

Tie Kuang's pupils suddenly contracted.

"A Divine Official Token!"

Shangguan Jinghong's cold voice also carried a hint of gravity.

"It's the identity token of a Divine Court core leader—a 'Divine Official'!"

"But... something seems off about this token." Her brows furrowed slightly. "It seems to be... wreathed in some kind of malicious curse power!"

Lin Yuan said nothing.

He simply reached out slowly.

Taking the token from the trembling soldier's hand.

Ice-cold, bone-piercing to the touch.

A sinister spiritual force, full of killing intent, tried to drill into his mind through his fingertips!

However.

The instant that spiritual force made contact with Lin Yuan's vast, ocean-like power.

It was like a drop of water falling into boiling oil!

Hiss—!

A soft sound.

Instantly evaporated without a trace!

Lin Yuan's expression remained completely calm.

But his voice carried a faint chill: "This isn't an ordinary token. It's a Soul-Chasing Order. There's some kind of power link on it that can connect with another paired token miles away."

Everyone was stunned at these words.

What was this thing?

Lin Yuan slowly raised his gaze, sweeping across the crowd.

"The one Ye Canglan carried was the child token."

"The moment he was killed by the two Martial Gods, the person holding the parent token, miles away, already knew everything that happened here."

BOOM!!!

Everyone's hearts sank!

The joy of victory that had just settled was instantly swept away!

However.

Lin Yuan's next words plunged them into an even icier abyss!

"That's not all."

"The parent token can also clearly record the complete aura of whoever dealt the final blow to the child token's holder."

He paused.

His gaze lingered briefly on Shangguan Jinghong and Tie Kuang.

Finally, it fell upon his own hand.

"In other words..."

"The Divine Court doesn't just know Ye Canglan is dead. They know clearly that it was Martial God Shangguan and Martial God Tie Kuang who killed him together."

"And they know..."

"It was I who killed Ye Xuan."

The air seemed to freeze completely in that moment.

The enemy had already locked onto their targets!

What kind of mad, terrifying, relentless revenge would they face from the Divine Court?!

The two Martial Gods would be fine.

Their combat power already stood at the apex, so they needn't worry too much about this level of threat.

But what about Lin Yuan?

His talent was extraordinary, but he was still only at the Qi Sea Realm.

Yet Lin Yuan at this moment merely smiled faintly.

That smile clearly held a hint of amusement, a hint of disdain.

"So what if they know?"

He slowly raised his hand.

Looking at the Soul-Chasing Order in his palm as if it were some insignificant toy.

"Want to come for revenge? Let them come."

"I..."

"Will be waiting."

CRACK—!!!

The instant those words fell.

That impossibly hard ink-black token shattered in Lin Yuan's palm!

Reduced to scattered powder!

Drifting away on the wind!
