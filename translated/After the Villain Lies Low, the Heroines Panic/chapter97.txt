"Lin Yuan, schoolmate!"

He raised his voice, making one final effort.

"You may not fully understand what joining the military means!"

"It means supreme honor!"

"It means the sacred duty of defending our nation and protecting our people!"

"It also means..."

Xiao Zheng's voice was filled with persuasive power.

"The nation will allocate every possible resource to you!"

"The most advanced cultivation methods! The finest medicinal pills! The most powerful divine weapons... All the sealed cultivation manuals in the national treasury—you may browse them at will!"

"Every cultivation holy land within Dragon Xia Nation's borders—you may enter and exit freely!"

Every word rang with conviction!

Each sentence hammered home like a heavy weight.

Any ordinary martial artist hearing this.

Even masters who had been famous for years—upon hearing such conditions, they would absolutely go wild with excitement!

Even Lin Jianguo's eyelids twitched at these words.

In his heart, he exclaimed that the Marshal had really put everything on the line this time!

However.

He turned his head.

And saw his rebellious son's face growing even more impatient.

"Are you done?"

Lin Yuan yawned.

Xiao Zheng instinctively nodded.

He felt that his offered conditions had already reached the pinnacle of this world.

He refused to believe anyone could turn them down!

"Done talking? Then hurry up and leave."

Lin Yuan waved his hand dismissively, like shooing away a buzzing fly.

"Don't hold up my nap."

"You..."

Xiao Zheng choked, nearly passing out on the spot.

He stared at Lin Yuan in disbelief.

"Could it be that everything I just said... you're not moved at all?"

"Moved?"

Lin Yuan laughed.

His eyes filled with pity.

"Let me ask you something, General Xiao."

"Do you have some kind of misunderstanding about the word 'genius'?"

He slowly rose to his feet.

That aura belonging to Meridian Opening Realm Fifth Level, which had just settled, faintly emanated once more.

He raised a finger and tapped his temple.

"Do I look like I need those so-called resources of yours?"

BOOM—!!!

These words!

Like divine thunder from the nine heavens!

Struck Xiao Zheng right on the crown of his head!

His entire body froze as if struck by lightning!

Mind completely blank!

Right...

Resources?

Did he need them?

A monster who could break through five consecutive levels to Meridian Opening Realm Fifth Level just by taking a nap!

What resources could he possibly need?!

His own presumptuous, seduction-filled promises just now.

Looking back at them now.

Were so laughable!

So stupid!

Like a billionaire showing off his few pounds of gold to an immortal!

Embarrassing!

Embarrassing beyond measure!

Xiao Zheng's face instantly flushed to the color of pig liver.

He wished he could find a crack in the ground to crawl into!

"Alright, alright."

Lin Yuan had already reclined back onto his "throne," adjusting himself into a comfortable position and closing his eyes.

"Dad, see the guest out."

Lin Jianguo: "..."

He walked over to Xiao Zheng, who had lost his soul and stood there like a wooden chicken, and patted his shoulder.

His face carried a hint of helpless apology.

"Ahem, General Xiao."

"You see... this..."

"I told you before, this child has a rather... unique temperament."

Xiao Zheng turned his head mechanically.

He looked at Lin Jianguo, his lips moving for a long time before finally squeezing out a dry, hoarse sentence.

"Grand... Grand Marshal Lin."

"I... I understand now."

He understood.

He completely understood.

Some people aren't born to follow rules.

They exist to break rules, even to create rules!

"Sorry for the trouble I've caused."

Lin Jianguo sighed, his tone carrying a hint of resignation.

Though this outcome had been entirely within his expectations.

"No... no trouble at all."

Xiao Zheng shook his head, only a bitter smile remaining on his face.

"This matter, I will report truthfully to the Marshal."

"As for... how to proceed from here, we'll... we'll just have to see."

Having said that.

He performed a somewhat stiff military salute to Lin Jianguo.

Then turned around.

With heavy steps, he left this rear courtyard that had shattered his entire worldview.

His retreating figure.

Lonely.

Forlorn.

Full of the deep self-doubt of a promising young general questioning his entire life.

Lin Jianguo watched him leave, shaking his head helplessly.

He turned, his gaze falling once more on his son, who had merged completely with the sunlight.

In the end.

A thousand words.

Condensed into a single sigh, heavy with complicated emotions.

"Ahhh..."

"This rebellious son..."

On the outskirts of Yanjing City, Dragon Xia Nation Military Headquarters.

This was the most heavily guarded, most austere heart of the entire nation.

Steel and discipline were the eternal themes here.

Every inch of air seemed soaked with the scent of iron and blood.

A military off-road vehicle came roaring in, kicking up dust, screeching to a halt before the headquarters building.

The door opened.

Xiao Zheng stepped out, looking as if his soul had departed.

His crisp general's uniform now appeared somewhat disheveled.

Those eyes, usually sharp as a hawk's, were now filled with lost confusion.

As if half his soul had been extracted.

"Hm? Isn't that General Xiao?"

"What happened to him? He looks like he's lost his mind."

"Didn't he go to the Lin residence under the Marshal's orders to recruit that young hero? Could it be... he was refused?"

"What kind of joke is that! Who would dare refuse our military's recruitment?!"

Officers passing by, seeing Xiao Zheng in this state, all showed surprised expressions, whispering among themselves.

They only knew that Yanjing City had produced a young hero named Lin Yuan.

But the specific details were merely hearsay, without true understanding.

In their view, being personally recruited by the military, by the Marshal himself, was an enormous honor!

A blessing that had ancestors' graves smoking with good fortune!

How could anyone possibly reduce General Xiao to such a state?

Xiao Zheng paid no attention to the gazes and whispers around him.

He walked with stiff steps directly into that building symbolizing Dragon Xia Nation's highest military authority.

The Marshal's Office.

The air was heavy.

An elderly man with a massive build, a full head of silver hair, and a face etched with the marks of years and warfare sat behind the desk.

Simply sitting there.

The iron-blooded killing intent emanating from him was enough to dim heaven and earth.

He was Dragon Xia Nation's supreme military commander, one of its pillars of strength!

Marshal Zhao Lie!

"You've returned?"

Zhao Lie didn't raise his head, his voice calm yet carrying a power that could see through hearts.

"Yes, Marshal."

Xiao Zheng stood at attention and performed a standard military salute.

His voice sounded somewhat hoarse.

"The result."

Zhao Lie slowly looked up, those sharp eyes falling upon Xiao Zheng.

"...Failed."

Xiao Zheng forced these three words from his throat with difficulty.

Zhao Lie's face showed no expression of surprise.

As if this outcome had long been within his expectations.
