This was the businesswoman elder sister, Lin Mengyao.

"That's right, that's right! Big Brother is the best!"

"Whatever Divine Court—if they dare bother Big Brother, I'll use a hundred and eight linked grand formations to blow their lair sky-high!"

A little loli wearing a sparkly Lolita dress, twin-tails bouncing, with features as delicate as a porcelain doll, rushed over like a gust of wind.

Her skirt poofed with each step, adorably so.

Reaching Lin Yuan, the little girl climbed onto his back like an agile koala, hands and feet wrapped around him.

This was Lin Ke'er.

Plus the one already standing to the side, looking at this family of immortals with a face full of bitter resignation and a splitting headache—the Grand Marshal himself.

Lin Jianguo.

And with that.

The entire Lin family had once again rarely assembled!

"..."

Lin Yuan felt his sister hanging on his back and the heart-stopping softness pressing against his arm.

He sighed helplessly, long and deep.

"Look..."

"Could you all get off me first?"

"You're heavy!"

He looked absolutely disgusted as he shook his body, as if trying to shake off some troublesome accessories.

"Also, you're really interfering with my sunbathing, you know?"

The moment these words left his mouth.

The entire courtyard fell into deathly silence.

Lin Zhan's heroic laughter froze awkwardly on his face.

Su Qin's regal features showed an expression of helpless exasperation.

Lin Mengyao rolled her stunning eyes so hard they nearly flew to the sky.

Lin Jianguo's mouth twitched violently, veins popping at his temple, wishing he could stuff this rebellious son back into the womb to be remade!

Only Lin Ke'er completely ignored everything, continuing to rub her cheeks against his neck.

"I don't care, I don't care, I just want to hug you!"

"You brat!"

Lin Zhan was the first to snap out of it, blowing his beard and glaring, his aura turning violent again.

"Getting cocky now, are you? You dare complain about your own grandfather?"

"Come, come, come!"

He beckoned to Lin Yuan, his knuckles cracking.

"Let Grandpa personally weigh how much you've grown!"

"To think you had the nerve to rub those Divine Court scum's faces in the dirt in front of the whole city!"

Lin Yuan finally deigned to lift his eyelids and gave him a glance.

"Not fighting."

"Boring."

His voice was lazy, but carried an unquestionable certainty.

"Your measly three-legged cat skills aren't worth my time."

Pfft—!

Lin Jianguo nearly choked to death right then and there.

His eyes instantly bulged round as saucers, his pointing finger shaking like he had Parkinson's.

"You rebellious son! Rebellious son!"

"Is... is that how you talk to your grandfather?!"

That was Lin Zhan!

Dragon Xia Nation's anchor! The ceiling of combat power!

A legendary Martial God who could make the whole world shake with one stomp!

And from this rebellious son's mouth, it became... three-legged cat skills?!

"Hahaha! Good! Very good, three-legged cat skills!"

Lin Zhan wasn't angry—instead, he laughed. The appreciation in his eyes grew even thicker, nearly overflowing.

"Bold!"

"Worthy of being my Lin Zhan's seed!"

His blazing gaze fixed on Lin Yuan, as if trying to see through him completely.

"Kid, you know full well the Divine Court's revenge won't be long in coming."

"Are you really ready?"

Lin Yuan yawned again, a few physiological tears seeping from the corners of his eyes.

"Ready for what?"

"Just a bunch of rats waiting for me to find them and clean them out in one sweep."

"My only worry right now is one thing."

He slowly sat up straight, his face showing, for once, a hint of vexation.

"When the time comes, I really hope their rat nest has enough treasures stored up."

"Otherwise, if I go through all that trouble for nothing, wouldn't that be a wasted trip?"

The entire Lin family: "..."

This Versailles attitude was simply too strong!

Strong enough to choke someone to death!

"You child..."

Mother Su Qin was the first to shake her head helplessly.

She walked to Lin Yuan, extending her jade-smooth hand to lovingly stroke his cheek.

"You've gotten thinner."

"You must have suffered out there?"

Lin Yuan: "?"

He instinctively looked down at himself.

Seemed like... his waistline had actually gained a couple of ounces.

"Mom, I really haven't suffered."

"I just eat and sleep every day, sleep and eat. Life's been particularly boring."

Lin Mengyao was laughing so hard beside them that flowers seemed to bloom, sweetening the entire courtyard air.

"Mom, you really don't need to worry about him."

"Your precious son is now Yanjing City's savior, Dragon Xia Nation's great hero."

"Who would dare make him suffer?"

As she spoke, she pulled from her seemingly small but actually spacious handbag a card that was entirely black and gleamed with a strange luster.

"Little Brother, this is an Ultimate Black Card issued by Sister's Global Bank."

"No spending limit, accepted anywhere in the world."

"Buy whatever you want, just swipe it."

"Consider it an advance on your allowance from Big Sis."

Lin Yuan's eyes lit up and he reached out without the slightest hesitation to take it.

"Now that's more like it, Big Sis knows me best."

"Ke'er! Ke'er has presents too!"

Lin Ke'er produced, like presenting treasures, a large pile of glittering bottles, jars, and various little trinkets from behind her back.

"Big Brother, this is my newest creation—the Nine Revolutions Soul-Returning Pill! No matter how badly you're hurt, as long as you have a single breath left, one pill will have you bouncing back!"

"And this—a Pure Spirit Jade Pendant that makes you immune to all poisons!"

"And this—a Substitute Formation Disc that can block a Martial God's full-power strike for you!"

"And there's also..."

Looking at what his little sister was pulling out—any single item of which would drive any major power in the outside world into a frenzied bidding war—Lin Yuan's lips curled up in satisfaction.

Truly worthy of being my good little sister!

Finally.

Everyone's gaze fell uniformly upon Lin Jianguo.

Lin Jianguo: "..."

He felt an unprecedented, mountain-crushing pressure.

The old man had given the highest spiritual affirmation.

His wife had given motherly tender care.

His eldest daughter had given inexhaustible money.

His youngest daughter had given a pile of life-saving divine artifacts.

Now it was his turn.

What could he give?

Fatherly love like a mountain...

...of fists?

Looking at Lin Yuan's eyes, which held a hint of expectation.

Lin Jianguo's stern national-character face turned an unusual shade of red. He coughed twice, trying to ease the awkwardness.

"Ahem!"

"Well... Yuan'er."

"Your father, I've been... a bit tight on funds lately..."

"How about I lend you my Grand Marshal's seal to play with for a couple of days?"

Lin Yuan's face immediately fell.

"Tch."

He let out an undisguised sound of disdain, waved his hand dismissively, and flopped back into the grand master's chair.

"Alright, alright, stop crowding around me."

"Everyone go do whatever you need to do."

"I just want to be a peaceful, world-detached salted fish..."

"Why is this great dream of mine so hard to achieve?"

He sighed long and deep.

His voice filled with endless weariness and resignation.
