The golden light faded.

Dust filled the air.

When everything settled.

The scene wrought by that world-destroying palm was fully revealed to all.

A giant palm print, a thousand meters deep, covering a hundred-mile radius, was branded upon the earth.

Within the print, everything had been leveled, reduced to primordial dust.

Outside the print, grass and trees flourished, completely intact.

The control over power had been precise to the extreme!

Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu lay collapsed at the very edge of the palm print.

They could clearly feel that if they'd moved one centimeter forward, they would have been instantly vaporized like those mountains, leaving not even a speck of dust.

Death had just danced a waltz on the tips of their noses.

The two exchanged a glance, both seeing the other's pants soaked through with fear and the stench of urine.

Then, eyes rolling back, they simply fainted dead away.

The shock was too great.

Their pitiful psychological resilience couldn't handle it at all.

High in the sky.

Lin Zhan stood with hands clasped behind his back, his brow furrowed slightly.

He gazed down at the center of that massive palm print.

There, space was still twisting abnormally.

A faint but incredibly tenacious evil aura was seeping through the warped spatial rift.

"Hmph, had some tricks after all."

Lin Zhan's face showed a flash of surprise.

"Actually used a secret technique to forcibly tear open a spatial rift. Escaped like a cicada shedding its shell."

"But even if you escape for now."

He slowly withdrew his hand, his tone flat.

"Marked by my 'Heaven-Suppressing Seal,' your soul will suffer the burning of law fire day and night. A fate worse than death."

As for that escaped Ye Canglan, he seemed completely unconcerned.

As if he'd merely swatted a particularly resilient fly.

Lin Yuan's expression was equally calm.

He knew his grandfather's strength, and he knew Ye Canglan's level.

With this human ceiling present, Ye Xuan's villain father could have all the tricks in the world and still be nothing but a punching bag!

This was what absolute power meant!

The only thing worth noting was...

Besides Ye Canglan, the others who had vanished from the scene were Ye Xuan and Li Xuan'er.

"Oh?"

Seeing this, Lin Yuan's lazy face finally showed a hint of amusement.

"Wounded that badly and still didn't forget to take his precious son along."

"Such fatherly love is truly... moving."

Of course he knew the real reason wasn't affection for his son.

Ye Xuan was the most important piece in that man's plans.

The vessel to carry his ambitions.

Before the plan was complete, he would never let Ye Xuan die before his eyes.

"Got away cheap."

Lin Zhan gave a cold snort, clearly somewhat dissatisfied with this outcome.

But he didn't pursue further.

His purpose in coming today was primarily to intimidate.

To intimidate the Divine Court, and to intimidate those in Yan Jing City who didn't know their place and dared to scheme against his grandson.

Now, that purpose had been achieved.

More than achieved, in fact.

He slowly turned, his gaze falling upon his precious grandson.

He examined him carefully from head to toe.

Finding that Lin Yuan was indeed completely unharmed, not a hair out of place, he finally nodded with satisfaction.

"Not bad."

"Qi Sea Realm sixth level, solid foundation, deep and long breath."

"Much stronger than that father of yours who only knows how to bury his head in family affairs."

If Lin Jianguo heard this, he'd probably faint crying in the bathroom.

Lin Yuan curled his lip, too lazy to respond.

He walked over to Gu Ningxue's side. Seeing that she had fully absorbed the medicinal pill's power and her color had returned to a healthy flush, he asked:

"Can you walk?"

Gu Ningxue nodded and rose from the stone.

She looked at Lin Yuan, then at Lin Zhan hovering in the air like a god, her cold, beautiful face still somewhat dazed.

Everything that had happened today had hit her too hard.

She felt her worldview had been run over by a steamroller, back and forth, a dozen times.

First Lin Yuan.

Then Lin Zhan.

This grandfather and grandson pair—one more monstrous than the other.

One more inhuman than the other.

What kind of dragon's den and tiger's lair was this Lin family anyway?

"Grandfather, things are settled here. I'm taking her back first."

Lin Yuan waved casually at Lin Zhan.

"You should head back and rest too, old man."

With that, not waiting for Lin Zhan to respond.

He directly grabbed Gu Ningxue's hand, his figure flashing as they transformed into a streak of light, speeding toward the Wilderness Hunt exit.

The movement was smooth and seamless, not a moment's hesitation.

As if staying one more second would delay his sleep.

"You little brat!"

Lin Zhan watched his grandson's retreating figure, caught between laughter and exasperation.

In all the world, only this one person dared speak to him this way.

He shook his head, and his gaze fell upon those two "prodigies" who had fainted in terror, collapsed on the ground like dead dogs.

Liu Mingxuan.

Chen Yu.

His sharp eyes flashed with cold frost.

"The Liu family, the Chen family..."

He murmured to himself.

"Seems like comfortable days have lasted too long."

"Even forgotten where they're supposed to reach their claws."

Lin Zhan didn't spare another glance at those two scared-unconscious wastes.

He merely took one last, deep look at his grandson.

That gaze held gratification, held pride, and most of all, a heartfelt sense of honor.

Then.

His figure, as if it had never appeared, silently melded into the void and vanished.

With his departure, that pressure crushing all eternity and suppressing the heavens also dissipated like smoke.

Heaven and earth seemed to return to normal.

But everyone knew.

Some things had changed forever.

That palm print branded upon the earth—bottomless, seemingly piercing through the entire planet—was the most direct, most terrifying proof!

Like a scar that would never fade, silently telling the world of the apocalyptic scene that had just occurred!

Just then.

A trembling voice, carrying infinite awe, sounded through some amplification device, abruptly ringing out above the wilderness.

"The... the Wilderness Hunt... has ended... early."

"All... all participants will be... teleported back to the plaza..."

The voice was halting, filled with the terror of having survived a catastrophe.

Clearly, those bigwigs in the observation tower had also witnessed this battle of gods through their screens.

Their worldviews had been equally shattered!

Points?

Rankings?

Before power of this apocalyptic magnitude, did any of it matter?

Not at all!
