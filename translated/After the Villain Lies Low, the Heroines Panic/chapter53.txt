That talon was wreathed in countless wailing vengeful spirits, emanating a death aura capable of corroding all things!

It tore through space, ignored distance!

In an instant, it appeared above Lin Yuan's head!

Seeking to crush him, along with the earth beneath his feet, into powder!

The power of this strike far surpassed Ye Xuan's and Li Xuan'er's combined assault!

It was even several times more terrifying than the blood demon god's dying blow!

Yet.

Facing this world-destroying palm.

Lin Yuan's face still wore that lazy, half-asleep expression.

He couldn't even be bothered to raise a hand.

He just curled his lip, seeming somewhat impatient.

Just as that death talon was about to descend!

KA-BOOM——!!!!!!!

A thunderous explosion!

A bolt of golden lightning, brilliant as the sun, descended like divine wrath from the Nine Heavens!

It arrived second but struck first!

At a speed that transcended causality, it slammed viciously into that pitch-black death talon!

Sizzle——!

At the same time!

An ancient voice, containing supreme divine might, enough to crush the heavens—like rolling thunder—exploded in the depths of everyone's souls!

"Vermin of the Divine Court!"

"Touch a hair on my grandson and see what happens?!"

This voice!

Ancient, domineering, filled with unquestionable supreme authority!

Every word was like a true star, smashing heavily against everyone's hearts!

Like billions of volcanoes erupting simultaneously!

That world-destroying fury made the entire wilderness tremble violently!

"Pff——!"

The first to bear the brunt was that imperious Ye Canglan!

His body shuddered as if struck by lightning, and a mouthful of pitch-black blood sprayed uncontrollably from beneath his hood!

His aura, terrifying enough to freeze space.

Before this voice, it was like a child's toy—instantly, overwhelmingly, utterly crushed!

He jerked his head up, his voice filled with disbelief as he cried out!

"Lin... Zhan?!"

This name seemed to carry some forbidden magic!

For the first time, Ye Canglan's voice held fear!

As his words fell.

A figure slowly stepped out of the void.

It was an elderly man in a simple Tang-style outfit, with snow-white hair and beard.

He looked like an ordinary old man from next door.

But as he simply stood there.

All the light in the world seemed to gather upon him.

He was heaven!

He was the Dao!

He was the sole truth in this world!

It was Dragon Xia Country's anchor, the nation-protecting War God—Lin Zhan!

"Grandfather! You finally came!"

Lin Yuan flashed Lin Zhan a knowing smile.

That's right!

The reason the old man had come here was precisely because Lin Yuan had tipped him off in advance.

He'd told his grandfather that Ye Canglan of the Divine Court would appear at this Wilderness Hunt, intending harm against the prodigies.

As Dragon Xia Country's strongest War God.

How could Lin Zhan possibly allow his own grandson to be put in danger?

"Hmph!"

Lin Zhan gave a cold snort, glaring at his precious grandson with a mix of exasperation and amusement. "If I hadn't come, were you planning to punch a hole through the sky?"

Though his words were scolding.

But those sharp eyes of his were filled with undisguised appreciation and... pride!

Good lad!

A formation conjured with a thought, a punch that shattered stars, a sword that became an ocean!

Such methods, such style!

A thousand times stronger than when he himself was young!

Truly worthy of being Lin Zhan's grandson!

Then.

Lin Zhan's gaze slowly fell upon that black-robed figure.

In that instant.

The neighborly old man's aura vanished without a trace.

In its place was divine majesty like that of a god descending to the mortal world!

"A rat skulking in the shadows."

Lin Zhan's voice was calm.

Yet it made Ye Canglan feel a pressure more terrifying than death itself!

"Fifty years ago, I slaughtered your kind until you fled Yan Jing City like beaten dogs, throwing away your armor."

"Fifty years later, you vermin actually dare to show your faces again?"

"It seems last time's lesson wasn't thorough enough."

Ye Canglan's body was shaking violently!

He couldn't figure it out no matter how hard he tried!

Lin Zhan!

This old monster who should have been guarding the Northern Domain defense line against the foreign races!

How could he appear here without any warning?!

The intelligence was wrong!

The intelligence had a fatal error!

"Go!"

Not a moment's hesitation!

Ye Canglan's mind held only this single word!

Against this living legend, this god of slaughter!

Forget fighting—he couldn't even muster the courage to raise a hand!

He frantically channeled all his evil energy as black death power shot toward the sky, transforming into a pitch-black streak of light, trying to tear through space and flee!

"Trying to leave?"

Lin Zhan's face curved in a contemptuous, cold smile.

"Before me, do you think you can escape?"

He slowly raised his right hand.

Then, toward that black streak about to vanish into the void, he casually brought his palm down!

RUMBLE RUMBLE RUMBLE——!!!!!!!

The sky collapsed!

The entire wilderness sky, under this single palm, seemed to become a fragile pane of glass!

Shattered by an invisible celestial hand!

A massive palm, formed from pure golden law power, blotted out sun and moon, covered the firmament!

It simply descended toward the ground below!

No target!

It attacked this heaven and earth!

This space!

Everything within a hundred-mile radius!

Before this absolute, crushing power!

Any technique, any movement, any divine ability—all seemed so pale and laughable!

"NO——!!!"

Ye Canglan let out a howl of ultimate despair!

His death power, capable of tearing through space, before that golden palm, was instantly crushed into nothingness like paper!

He felt like a mosquito frozen in amber!

He could only watch helplessly as that world-destroying attack drew closer and closer!

BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The golden palm finally fell.

It struck the earth heavily!

In that instant.

The entire world lost all sound.

Lost all color.

All that remained was that blinding, ultimate... gold!

Within a hundred-mile radius.

All mountains, rivers, trees, rocks...

Everything was completely erased from the physical plane under this single palm!

The earth was forcibly carved into a bottomless, boundless... giant palm print!

The edges of the print were smooth as mirrors!

The surrounding atmosphere had been compressed into solid form by the terrifying energy!

Like divine punishment!

Like... the end of days!

Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu, collapsed in the distance, had been scared completely senseless.

Their mouths hung open, drool flowing without awareness.

Their minds could no longer process this scene that exceeded the limits of imagination.

If Lin Yuan was a demon god.

Then this Old War God... what was he?!

A creation god... who creates demon gods?!
