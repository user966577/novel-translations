"Useless! A bunch of useless trash!"

Chen Yu stood outside the battle ring, watching this scene unfold, and immediately erupted in curses.

Over a dozen people ganging up on one woman, and they were still being suppressed!

If word of this got out, where would they put their faces?!

Liu Mingxuan's expression was equally ugly.

His eyes narrowed, fixed on Gu Ningxue's footwork and sword techniques, a flash of barely concealed wariness in his gaze.

He'd always known Gu Ningxue was recognized as the top genius of Capital Martial Arts Academy, with formidable strength.

He hadn't expected her to be this formidable!

Every seemingly effortless stroke of her sword contained an extremely profound sword intent, always breaking through the enemy's strongest attack with minimal cost!

"Formation!"

Liu Mingxuan finally barked out a cold command!

"Use the Liu family's Four Symbols Heaven-Lock Formation to trap her! Don't let her keep dodging!"

Hearing the order, the remaining dozen-plus heirs rallied and immediately shifted positions with trained precision!

Four Liu family members took up positions at the cardinal directions—east, south, west, and north—their spiritual energy instantly linking together!

Hum——!

A visible energy barrier shot up from the ground, forming a massive cage that instantly sealed off all of Gu Ningxue's escape routes.

Meanwhile, the other family heirs seized the opportunity to launch an even more ferocious assault!

"Let's see where you run this time!"

Seeing this, Chen Yu's face split into a savage grin once more.

Gu Ningxue's brow finally creased slightly.

With her space restricted, her prized agility had been reduced to its minimum effectiveness.

Facing attacks from all directions simultaneously, she took a deep breath and channeled every ounce of spiritual energy into her sword!

"Three Feet of Ice!"

With a clear shout, she thrust her sword into the ground.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

An extreme cold burst forth with her at the center!

Visible frost, like living serpents, spread rapidly across the ground in all directions!

The temperature inside the formation plummeted instantly.

Those heirs charging at the front felt a bone-piercing chill invade their bodies, their movements immediately becoming sluggish and stiff!

However, in that split second when her old force was spent and her new force had yet to rise!

A treacherous blade light, like a lurking viper, tore through the cold air, silent and swift, slashing toward the back of her neck!

It was a Chen family heir who had been hiding in the crowd, waiting for this moment!

He'd been waiting precisely for this fatal opening!

This strike was fast and vicious!

Gu Ningxue's alarm bells screamed as she tried to parry, but it was already too late!

Just at this critical moment.

Whoosh——!!!

A piercing whistle suddenly tore through the air from deep within the bamboo grove.

A sinister purple streak of light, faster and fiercer than that sneak attack, arrived first despite leaving last.

Carrying a domineering, overwhelming force, it smashed against the ambushing short blade!

"Clang!"

A crisp ring!

The Chen family heir felt an irresistible force surge through him. In an instant, his tiger's mouth split open, and the short blade in his hand was sent flying!

His entire body was whipped backward by that domineering force, sent flying seven or eight meters, blood spraying from his mouth.

"Who's there?!"

Liu Mingxuan and Chen Yu's expressions changed as they whipped around toward the source of the streak.

A figure landed silently.

That lithe, captivating silhouette, outlined by a form-fitting combat suit like an elegant leopard, slowly emerged from the shadows of the bamboo grove.

It was Song Yao!

In her hand, she gripped a purple chain blade, its tip still faintly trembling with a humming sound.

"Liu Mingxuan, Chen Yu, over a dozen people bullying one girl. You two are really something."

Song Yao's lips curved in a mocking, cold smile.

Those lively eyes of hers were filled with undisguised contempt.

Seeing who had arrived, a complex look flickered through Gu Ningxue's cold eyes, but she still said softly, "Thank you."

"Don't mention it," Song Yao said without looking back, her gaze locked onto Liu Mingxuan. "I just find them annoying."

"Song Yao?" Chen Yu's face instantly turned stormy. "This is none of your business. I suggest you stay out of it!"

"Stay out of it?" Song Yao acted as if she'd heard the biggest joke. She scoffed. "Every point in this wilderness is 'my business.' I've decided to stick my nose in today!"

"You!"

Chen Yu was left speechless.

"Good, very good!"

Liu Mingxuan's eyes flashed with greed and ruthlessness.

His anger turned to laughter: "Since Miss Song is here too, perfect! Saves us the trouble of looking for you!"

"Gu Ningxue, Song Yao! The two most gifted women in Yan Jing City, and today they're both going to fall into our hands!"

"Capture both of them! Our points from this hunt will shoot straight to the top! And we can use them to lure that waste Lin Yuan out!"

Liu Mingxuan's voice was filled with excitement.

This was simply a heaven-sent opportunity!

Killing two birds with one stone!

No, three birds with one stone!

"Brothers, no more mercy! All together! Capture them!"

At Liu Mingxuan's command, those heirs who had been somewhat hesitant instantly had their eyes blaze with greedy fire.

That's right!

One was the eldest daughter of the Gu family, one was the princess of the Song family!

Either one represented massive points and supreme glory!

Now both had delivered themselves to their doorstep—what was there to hesitate about?!

"Kill!"

Everyone charged like they'd been injected with stimulants, lunging madly at Gu Ningxue and Song Yao once more!

"Careful!"

Gu Ningxue warned as she and Song Yao stood back to back, facing the enemy together again.

Song Yao's arrival had clearly improved the situation.

Gu Ningxue's sword walked the path of grace and precision, responsible for point-kills and defense.

While Song Yao's chain blade was sweeping and wild, domineering and fierce, responsible for wide-area suppression and clearance!

One hard, one soft; one still, one moving!

Though the two were fighting together for the first time, relying on their combat instincts as top-tier prodigies, their coordination was seamless!

For a time, sword light and whip shadows interweaved, actually managing to hold off the siege of over a dozen prodigies!

Within the bamboo grove, explosions of spiritual energy rang out endlessly, debris and broken bamboo flying everywhere!

However, two fists couldn't match four hands!

No matter how strong they were, there were only two of them!

There were simply too many opponents!

And every single one was a master within the Marrow Cleansing Realm!

The battle continued for nearly ten minutes.

Both Gu Ningxue's and Song Yao's breathing had begun to grow labored.

Their spiritual energy was being consumed at an alarming rate under such high-intensity combat!

"Can't drag this out any longer!" Liu Mingxuan's eyes flashed with cold light. He signaled Chen Yu. "Let's attack together and end this quickly!"

"Fine!"

Chen Yu had been itching to act.

The instant his words fell!

"Gale Slash!"

Chen Yu roared, and the war saber "Gale" in his hand blazed with azure light. A terrifying saber aura several meters long, carrying the shriek of tearing air, slashed horizontally at the two women!
