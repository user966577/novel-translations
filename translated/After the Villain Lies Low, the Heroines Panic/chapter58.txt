Chen Family, quiet room.

Chen Ruoxi sat cross-legged on a prayer cushion, her normally untouchable beauty now etched with exhaustion and confusion.

In the refining cauldron before her, a newly formed short sword emitted unstable hums, the spiritual glow on its blade flickering on and off as if it might extinguish at any moment.

Ever since the Wilderness Hunt ended, Chen Ruoxi had locked herself in here. Seven days and seven nights straight, not once stepping outside.

The "Celestial Craftsmanship Compendium" Lin Yuan had given her had opened a door to an entirely new world!

The artifact refining techniques recorded within were exquisitely refined, overturning every belief she'd held for the past twenty years!

In just seven short days, her refining skills had undergone an earth-shaking transformation!

Common-grade magical artifacts that once took days of painstaking effort to analyze—now she could comprehend their entire structure in a single thought.

Those complex, obscure spiritual energy circuits had become as simple and clear as children's doodles in her eyes.

Three days ago, she'd even successfully refined a Profound-grade supreme-quality "Ice Spirit Hairpin"!

This was an achievement she wouldn't have dared dream of before!

However.

When she opened the chapter on "Nurturing Artifact Spirits" with full confidence, she crashed headfirst into an impenetrable wall!

She'd strictly followed the method recorded in the manual, carefully infusing her purest spiritual energy into her most prized creation, attempting to awaken its slumbering artifact spirit.

But!

No matter how many times she tried, that short sword remained like a stubborn stone, utterly unresponsive.

Just now, during her final attempt, the short sword in the cauldron suddenly shuddered.

A violent surge of spiritual energy rushed back through her arm in a fierce backlash!

Dozens of fine blood marks instantly appeared on Chen Ruoxi's arm, blood staining her pure white sleeves crimson.

The piercing pain brought her back to her senses.

She looked at her arm, seared by the spiritual energy, then at that "Celestial Craftsmanship Compendium" she'd treasured like a holy relic, and her face showed deep helplessness.

Something was wrong!

Something had to be wrong!

She'd analyzed and re-analyzed for three days and nights, running through every word, every step of the manual in her mind no fewer than ten thousand times!

Yet she still couldn't find where the problem lay.

She realized this was no longer something mere comprehension could solve.

There had to be some deeper secret she didn't know about!

And the person who could answer this question—in all the world, there was probably only one.

Lin Yuan!

That man's figure appeared in her mind, unbidden.

She remembered how he'd casually tossed this manual to her like it was trash—a secret text that would drive the entire artifact refining world into a frenzy.

She remembered how in the wilderness, he'd conjured formations with a thought, shattered stars with a fist, transformed a sword into a boundless ocean—true divine miracles!

She remembered how, facing that world-ending palm from his grandfather Lin Zhan, he'd still yawned lazily...

An unprecedented sense of defeat, intertwined with an even stronger desire that threatened to burst from her chest!

She took a deep breath and slowly rose to her feet.

In those cold, clear eyes flickered a determination she'd never shown before.

If you don't understand, go ask!

With that thought.

She changed into her most presentable plain-colored dress and carefully arranged her black hair.

Then, with the utmost care, she placed that "Celestial Craftsmanship Compendium" into an exquisite brocade box.

After finishing all this, she didn't notify anyone.

Alone, carrying both anxiety and anticipation, she came to the gate of that estate—one that had become like holy ground throughout all of Yan Jing City.

The Lin Family Estate.

The grand gates radiated an aura of authority under the sunlight.

Only two ordinary guards stood at the entrance.

But Chen Ruoxi could sense the faint aura of iron and blood about them.

This was an aura that could only be forged in mountains of corpses and seas of blood!

Just two gatekeepers, yet they were battle-hardened elites who had been through war and seen death!

Chen Ruoxi's heart sank a little further.

She adjusted her dress, stepped forward, and gave the two guards a slight bow.

"I am Chen Ruoxi. I have an important matter and wish to see Lin Yuan... Young Master Lin."

Her voice carried a nervousness she herself hadn't noticed.

One of the guards looked at her, his face expressionless.

His voice was polite enough, yet carried an unquestionable firmness: "Miss Chen, my apologies. Our young master has given orders that no one is to disturb him."

Chen Ruoxi's mind went blank.

She'd imagined countless possibilities.

Being mocked, being given the runaround, even being chased away outright.

But she never imagined it would be this—a sentence so casual, yet one that completely blocked all her hopes!

"I... I'm not here to dredge up the past!"

Chen Ruoxi panicked and hurried to explain, "I'm here to ask for guidance on artifact refining! I..."

However, the guard only shook his head, cutting her off.

"Miss Chen, please return."

"Those were the young master's exact words."

The other guard, perhaps feeling some pity for her, unprecedentedly added one more sentence.

After that.

The two guards stood like statues once more, falling silent, not sparing her another glance.

Chen Ruoxi stood there, frozen in place.

A breeze passed by, lifting the hem of her plain dress, tousling the hair she'd so carefully arranged.

She felt like a tremendous joke.

Endless grievance and unwillingness welled up in her heart.

She desperately wanted to just turn around and leave.

But...

She couldn't do it!

The technique for "Nurturing Artifact Spirits" was like an invisible hook, firmly embedded in her heart!

She wasn't willing to accept this!

She wasn't willing to stop here!

She bit her lip and stood there outside the gilded gate, letting the cold wind blow.

But her gaze was fixed firmly on the pavilions visible deep within the estate.

She wasn't leaving!

Today, she would wait right here!

She refused to believe that man could stay inside forever!

Time passed, second by second.

The sun moved from its zenith, slowly slanting westward.

Chen Ruoxi still stood at the Lin Family Estate's entrance like a statue waiting for her lover's return.

The two guards at the gate never looked at her once more from start to finish.

As if she were nothing but empty air.

Just as Chen Ruoxi's heart sank bit by bit toward rock bottom, about to be swallowed by despair.

A clear voice, bright as silver bells, suddenly rang out from within the estate.

"Charge! Little bunnies of the back mountain, the great demon lord Lin Ke'er is coming!"

Creak—

The side gate of the estate was pushed open.

A little girl bounced out—twin pigtails, pink princess dress, porcelain-doll features so adorable it should be illegal—carrying a stack of formation jade slips taller than herself.

It was the little princess of the Lin Family, Lin Ke'er.

She was heading to the back mountain to test her newly developed "Automatic Bunny Capture Formation."

The moment she stepped out, she spotted the figure standing in the cold wind, her silhouette looking particularly thin and lonely in her plain dress.

"Huh?"

Lin Ke'er stopped, tilting her adorable little head.

Her big eyes, brighter than stars, blinked as she curiously examined Chen Ruoxi.

This big sister is so pretty.

I feel like... I've seen her somewhere before?

Oh! I remember now!

It was at that banquet last time!

She seems to be...

Big sister from the Chen Family!

Lin Ke'er was a natural social butterfly, especially when the other person was a pretty big sister.

She immediately trotted over on her little legs, pitter-patter.

"Big sister Chen, why are you standing out here? It's so cold—aren't you coming in to sit?"

Lin Ke'er tilted her face up, her voice soft and full of concern.

Chen Ruoxi's whole body stiffened.

Looking at this little girl who had suddenly appeared like a warm little sun, she was momentarily at a loss.

Lin Yuan's... little sister?

She recognizes me?

A tremendous surge of hope, like an erupting volcano, instantly scattered all the grievance and despair in her heart!
