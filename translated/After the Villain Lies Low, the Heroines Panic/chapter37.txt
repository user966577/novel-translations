"Help me?"

Ye Xuan seemed to have heard the world's funniest joke.

He forced his agonized body to produce a hoarse, crazed laugh.

"Haha... hahahaha!"

"You? A woman I threw away like garbage, a worthless thing whose Dao heart was destroyed—what could you possibly do to help me?"

His voice dripped with undisguised contempt.

In his view, the current Li Xuan'er was even more pathetic than him!

At least he had once shone, once stood on that stage under everyone's gaze!

And Li Xuan'er?

From beginning to end, she was just a pitiful clown clinging to men!

"What can I do?"

That strange smile on Li Xuan'er's face didn't waver.

She slowly extended her hand, five fair, slender fingers spreading before Ye Xuan.

HUM—

A wisp of pitch-black energy, thick as petroleum and emitting an unnerving aura of corruption and decay, slowly rose from her palm.

The instant this energy appeared, the entire room's temperature seemed to plunge by several degrees!

The air filled with a rotting, evil scent.

"What... what is this?!"

Ye Xuan's laughter stopped abruptly. He stared at that black mist, horror appearing on his face for the first time!

From that energy, he sensed something extremely evil, extremely dominating, extremely...

Crazed!

The Blood-Burning Dragon Transformation Art burned life origin and fortune.

But this black mist gave him the sensation of...

Devouring souls!

"You..." Ye Xuan stared at Li Xuan'er in disbelief. "You... how could you..."

"Surprised, aren't you?"

Li Xuan'er withdrew her palm, and that wisp of black mist vanished instantly, as if it had never existed.

Her smile grew more playful.

"Ye Xuan, did you think you were the only one in this world with fortuitous encounters? That only you were chosen by heaven as the Child of Destiny?"

She leaned close to his ear.

In a voice only they could hear, like a devil's whisper, she said softly: "While you were burning yourself like a clown on that arena, fighting for your so-called championship."

"I... had already found the true path to the summit."

"A shortcut that doesn't require talent, doesn't require resources, doesn't even require effort—only... the offering of your soul!"

Every word hit Ye Xuan's already-collapsed defenses like a sledgehammer!

He was completely dumbfounded!

He'd always assumed Li Xuan'er, after he abandoned her and Lin Yuan crippled her, would fade away like sewage in some dark corner.

He'd never imagined!

This biggest trash in his eyes had also gained unknown power!

A power even more evil, even stronger than his!

Why?!

WHY?!!

A jealousy and resentment more intense than ever gnawed at his heart like venomous snakes!

"Do you see now?"

Li Xuan'er straightened, looking down at his face twisted with envy.

"This is my basis for helping you."

She paused, her voice filled with ultimate temptation.

"I know you hate Lin Yuan, would love to grind his bones to ash."

"So would I."

"We can work together. I can share part of this power with you. It can repair your shattered meridians, return you to your peak in the shortest time! Even... make you stronger than before!"

"By then, if we join forces, even Lin Yuan... might not be unbeatable!"

Kill Lin Yuan!

Those four words exploded like thunder in Ye Xuan's mind!

His eyes, dead with despair, instantly rekindled with crazed fire!

Revenge!

He wanted revenge more than anything!

But...

He looked at Li Xuan'er, and the last shred of reason kept him wary.

"What's the price? Nothing in this world is free. What do you want?"

Ye Xuan's voice was hoarse as sandpaper scraping.

"Smart."

Li Xuan'er nodded approvingly.

"My demand is simple."

She extended a finger, tapping lightly on Ye Xuan's chest.

"I want your... loyalty."

"From now on, you, Ye Xuan, will be my dog. I tell you to bite someone, you bite. I tell you to do something, you do it."

"Are you... willing?"

Humiliation!

Unprecedented humiliation!

Making him, once a heaven's chosen, a future martial champion, become a dog for a woman he'd despised most?!

"You're dreaming!"

Ye Xuan roared without thinking!

"Really?"

Li Xuan'er showed no surprise. The curve of her lips grew colder.

"It seems you haven't recognized your situation."

"You think you still have a choice?"

"Right now, your reputation is ruined. The Huangfu family has long since discarded you. You're a rat everyone wants dead!"

"Without me, for the rest of your life, you can only lie on this bed, rotting away in endless regret and agony like a worthless thing!"

"Meanwhile, Lin Yuan, the one who trampled you—he'll live better and better, more and more gloriously! He'll enjoy everything that should have been yours! Championship, glory, and... Gu Ningxue!"

"And you—you can only watch helplessly! Powerless!"

"NO—!!!"

Every word from Li Xuan'er was like a knife stabbing his most painful spots!

Ye Xuan howled like a beast. He couldn't accept it! He absolutely couldn't accept such a future!

"Well? Have you decided?"

Li Xuan'er's voice was like a death curse.

"Choose to be a worthless thing worse than a dog for the rest of your life, or... be a mad dog that can personally take revenge?"

"The choice is in your hands."

The entire room fell into deathly silence.

Only Ye Xuan's heavy, suppressed breathing remained.

Time passed, second by second.

His face cycled through wild expressions.

Struggle, unwillingness, rage, hatred...

Finally, all emotions solidified into one—

Complete, irreversible madness!

He slowly raised his head.

Those crimson eyes fixed on Li Xuan'er.

Word by word, he squeezed through clenched teeth:

"Fine..."

"I... agree... to... your... terms!"

As Ye Xuan's hoarse voice fell in that silent room.

Li Xuan'er's pale, numb face finally showed a genuine, victorious smile.

She knew she'd gambled correctly.

For a man like Ye Xuan—arrogant to the bone, yet completely consumed by hatred—dignity was far less important than revenge.

"Very good."

Li Xuan'er nodded with satisfaction.

"From now on, you belong to me."

She wasted no more words, stepping forward and hauling Ye Xuan up from the bed.

"This place isn't safe. The Martial Alliance people will come to 'talk' to you soon. We need to leave immediately."

Ye Xuan didn't resist.

He let Li Xuan'er support him like a soulless puppet, walking step by step out of this room filled with humiliation and despair.

Night, deep as ink.

Two figures, each harboring ulterior motives, both twisted by hatred, silently avoided all surveillance and guards, leaving the hospital.

They, like two ghosts melting into darkness.

Vanished completely into Yan Jing City's night.
