Meanwhile.

A hundred miles from the Yan Jing City battlefield, atop an unnamed mountain peak.

Two figures stood with hands clasped behind their backs, observing the apocalyptic scene in the distance.

It was Ye Canglan and his son—the former commoner prodigy of Yan Jing City—Ye Xuan.

"Father, the Divine Court really went all out this time."

Ye Xuan watched the towering Baleful Blood Dragon in the distance, along with the devastating clash of power that seemed about to tear the sky apart. His face twisted with fanatical excitement.

"That Lin Jianguo may call himself the Grand General of Dragon Xia and claim to be an Essence Gathering expert, but against a beast like that? He'll meet his end here!"

"Once Lin Jianguo dies and the Lin family falls, all of Yan Jing City—no, all of Dragon Xia—will be ours for the taking!"

Ye Canglan's face was equally smug.

He could already see it: the Lin family destroyed, Yan Jing City drowning in blood, and himself ascending as a meritorious hero of the Divine Court, ruling over all.

The Divine Court's plan was flawless.

First, they'd used the tens of millions of beasts as sacrificial offerings, wearing down Yan Jing City's fighting strength.

Then they'd summoned this Baleful Blood Dragon, a creature rivaling Rebirth Realm experts.

This was an open stratagem.

This was absolute, overwhelming power.

What could Lin Jianguo possibly do to stop it?!

What could Dragon Xia possibly do?!

However.

Unlike his father's excitement, Ye Xuan's attention wasn't really on the cataclysmic battlefield.

His eyes swept frantically across the entire area.

As if searching for something.

"Father, with all this chaos... why hasn't Lin Yuan shown his face yet?"

Ye Xuan's voice dripped with unconcealed, bone-deep hatred.

He didn't care whether Lin Jianguo lived or died. He didn't care if Yan Jing City burned.

He only cared about Lin Yuan.

The man who had humiliated him time and again. Who had taken everything from him. Who had turned him into a laughingstock across the entire city.

He wanted Lin Yuan dead. Utterly and completely.

"A mere Qi Sea Realm ant. In a battle of this magnitude, he's probably already been pulverized by the shockwaves."

"Or maybe he's hiding in some corner right now, trembling like a rat."

Ye Canglan let out a contemptuous snort.

"No! He'll definitely appear!"

"That bastard is full of tricks. There's no way he'd die that easily!"

"But it doesn't matter. Once the Divine Court flattens Yan Jing City, I'll personally dig him out of whatever hole he's hiding in!"

Ye Xuan's voice was absolute certainty.

A vicious, savage grin spread across his face.

However.

The moment those words left his mouth—

A voice drifted from behind them. Playful. Languid.

"Looking for me?"

"No need to go through all that trouble."

"I'm right here."

BOOM!!!

That voice struck like thunder from the heavens, exploding in the minds of both Ye Canglan and Ye Xuan.

Every hair on their bodies stood on end.

They whirled around.

There, less than ten feet behind them, a tall figure stood quietly.

He wore casual clothes, hands stuffed in his pockets, a harmless smile on his face.

Who else could it be but Lin Yuan?

"You... you..."

Ye Canglan's pupils contracted violently.

The smug expression that had been on his face moments ago was now replaced by utter terror.

How was he here?!

How had he appeared?!

He was an Essence Gathering Realm expert!

Within a radius of dozens of miles, not a blade of grass could stir without his notice!

But now—

Lin Yuan had materialized behind him without a sound.

And he... hadn't sensed a thing.

How was this possible?!

This was completely beyond his comprehension!

"Lin! Yuan!"

Unlike his father's shock, the moment Ye Xuan laid eyes on Lin Yuan, his vision went blood-red.

Old grudges! New hatred!

Every humiliation, every resentment, every drop of venom—

In this moment, it all burst forth like a dam breaking.

"You piece of trash! You dare show your face in front of me!"

"Today is the day you die!"

Ye Xuan let out a feral, bestial howl.

BOOM—!!!

A horrifying power reeking of blood erupted from within him.

His body began to expand in a grotesque manner.

Crimson patterns, like living things, crawled frantically across his skin.

His aura skyrocketed at a terrifying rate.

First level of Aura Transformation!

Third level!

Fifth level!

Finally, it climbed all the way to the seventh level!

This was the forbidden power the Divine Court had bestowed upon him.

Seventh level of Aura Transformation!

Against Lin Yuan, a mere Qi Sea Realm cultivator? Crossing an entire major realm and several minor ones? What was there to fear?!

"Die!!!"

Ye Xuan roared.

The next instant, his figure became a crimson bolt of lightning, carrying murderous intent that blotted out the sky, hurtling straight at Lin Yuan.

That berserk power made the very space around them groan in protest.

And yet.

Facing a strike that would make any Aura Transformation expert's face change—

Lin Yuan didn't even bother raising an eyelid.

He simply took a single, casual step forward.

Then.

Two fingers together, forming a sword.

A single slash through the air toward that crimson lightning.

No earth-shaking momentum.

No dazzling special effects.

Just an ordinary, unremarkable strike.

Shing—!

A seemingly plain golden sword qi materialized from nothing.

Yet.

This sword qi—

Seemed to transcend infinite time and space.

With the overwhelming force of a collapsing mountain, it appeared before Ye Xuan.

One sword.

Its brilliance piercing the heavens, tearing the sky asunder!!!

"Not good!"

Ye Canglan, watching from the side, went pale the instant he saw that golden sword qi.

From within it, he sensed an aura that made even his scalp tingle—pure, concentrated destruction.

What terrifying power!

This man...

Was horrifyingly strong!!!

His son couldn't block this.

There was absolutely no way he could block this!

"Insolent brat! How dare you!"

Ye Canglan bellowed in rage.

He could no longer afford to be shocked. His Essence Gathering cultivation exploded outward without reservation.

He thrust out a palm, and a massive handprint materialized, attempting to crush that sword qi directly.

As an Essence Gathering expert, he had the confidence to do so.

But!

The instant his palm was about to touch that golden sword qi—

Everything changed.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A series of sword cries rang out—cold, proud, and infinitely sharp—echoing across heaven and earth.

Then.

Ninety-nine streams of sword qi, pure as moonlight in the ninth heaven, appeared.

Tearing through the void!

Piercing through heaven and earth!

With an overbearing, unreasonable dominance, they slammed into Ye Canglan's massive palm print.

BOOM—!!!

That palm strike, powerful enough to split mountains, crumbled like paper before those ninety-nine moonlight sword beams.

Instantly shredded into fragments.

"What?!"

Ye Canglan's face drained of color.

He jerked his head up.

There, hovering in midair—when had she appeared?—was a figure of peerless elegance and heroic bearing.

She wore form-fitting silver-white armor that accentuated her flawless figure.

Long black hair danced in the wind.

A thin veil covered her face, obscuring her features.

But those eyes alone—cold as the moon, sharp as a blade—

Were enough to make heaven and earth pale in comparison.

She hovered there, still and silent.

Around her, ninety-nine streams of moonlit sword qi swirled and danced.

Like a war goddess of the ninth heaven, descending to execute divine judgment.

"Shangguan... Jinghong!"
