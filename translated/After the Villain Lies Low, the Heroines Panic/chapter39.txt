Over the next few days, Capital Martial Arts Academy fell into a peculiar atmosphere.

On one hand, with the National League concluded and Gu Ningxue claiming the championship, the academy basked in supreme glory, the whole place brimming with joy.

On the other hand.

Every student, no matter where they went, would unconsciously avoid the back corner of the teaching building and the lounge chair in the back garden.

Because there lurked an existence even more terrifying than the champion.

Lin Yuan.

He continued his unshakeable salted-fish lifestyle.

Class—sleep.

After class—find somewhere else in the back garden to keep sleeping.

As if the man who had suppressed the entire arena with a single thought and passed judgment on Ye Xuan at the Dragon's Nest days ago was someone else entirely.

【Ding! Host achieved "Consecutive Lying Flat for Three Days" accomplishment. Reward: one Nine-Aperture Heart-Clearing Fruit!】

【Ding! Host achieved "Sleeping in Class Over Eight Hours" accomplishment. Reward: minor enhancement to Divine Soul power!】

【Ding! Host achieved "Refusing Social Interaction Over One Hundred Times" accomplishment. Reward: Profound-Rank supreme movement technique—Shrink the Earth to Inches!】

Lin Yuan rolled over in his sleep, smacking his lips drowsily.

Mm...

Today's sunlight tastes pretty good.

Rewards? What rewards?

Oh, looks like more stuff came in.

Nine-Aperture Heart-Clearing Fruit—eating it would cleanse the body, purge impurities, make the body crystal-clear, double cultivation efficiency.

Not bad. He'd save it for a post-meal snack.

Divine Soul enhancement...

That was good—stronger divine soul meant sleeping more soundly.

As for Shrink the Earth to Inches...

Sounded like a hassle. Had to use feet to walk. Tiring.

Besides, only a Profound-Rank supreme technique? The system was getting stingy. He'd toss it to the family's scripture pavilion to collect dust!

These days, Lin Yuan had been thoroughly spoiled.

Anything below Heaven-Rank supreme wouldn't even get a glance.

Of course, not every system reward was top-tier.

This meant the family's scripture pavilion had unknowingly accumulated more and more techniques.

Just as he was about to continue his deep philosophical discussions with the Duke of Zhou—

A clear yet exasperated female voice sounded in his ear.

"Little Yuan, stop sleeping."

Lin Yuan's brow furrowed with annoyance.

Who was this?

So clueless, disturbing this young master's sleep?

He reluctantly cracked open one eye. Before him was an enchantingly beautiful face.

It was his sister, Lin Mengyao.

"Sis? Why are you here?" Lin Yuan mumbled, closing his eyes again.

"If I didn't come, were you planning to sleep until the end of time here at school?"

Lin Mengyao flicked his forehead with her jade finger, exasperated.

"Word came from home—in three days, the Su family is hosting the annual aristocratic exchange gathering at Cloud Summit Manor. You must attend."

"Not going! An aristocratic exchange? It's just a bunch of old men and women bringing their brats together to brag, and comparing whose spirit fruits are sweeter. What's the point? I'd rather spend that time sleeping!"

Lin Yuan's answer was crisp and decisive, without a hint of hesitation.

"You!"

Lin Mengyao laughed and cried at his righteously lazy logic.

She patiently coaxed: "This time is different. This gathering is bigger than usual—all the prominent families in Yan Jing City will be there. Our Lin family is riding high right now; as the family heir, if you don't show up, people will say we're arrogant and look down on everyone."

"Let them talk. Mouths are theirs—can I control their shit and farts?"

Lin Yuan rolled over, back facing her.

Lin Mengyao took a deep breath, knowing reasoning with her brother was pointless. She changed tactics.

"Come on, just think of it as keeping your big sis company for a stroll. You just need to show up, find a spot to sit and eat. I'll handle everything else, okay?"

Lin Yuan remained unmoved.

Just as Lin Mengyao was about to give up, a segment of the original novel's plot flashed through Lin Yuan's mind like a rapid-fire slideshow.

Su family...

Exchange gathering...

Oh, he remembered now.

At this very gathering, the old-guard Chen family of Yan Jing City, trying to curry favor with another top-tier powerhouse—the Liu family.

Had publicly announced they were tearing up their "verbal engagement" with the original host.

Not only that.

They'd mocked the original host mercilessly, belittling him as worthless.

In the end, the original host, unable to contain his rage, drew his sword—only to be easily suppressed by the Chen family's expert, vomiting blood on the spot.

He'd become the laughingstock of Yan Jing's elite circles.

And that so-called "fiancée," Chen Ruoxi...

Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly.

Her backstory in the novel was equally tragic.

She was the legitimate eldest daughter of Chen Tianhao, the Chen family patriarch, but her mother had died of illness when she was young.

Chen Tianhao's second wife was a textbook evil stepmother.

She despised Chen Ruoxi.

After bearing a son, this stepmother became even more insufferably arrogant, constantly whispering poison in her husband's ear.

Chen Ruoxi's living space within the family shrank smaller and smaller.

However...

Outwardly, she was the Chen family's overlooked legitimate daughter.

In truth, she was a deeply hidden artifact-refining prodigy!

In the original novel, she later escaped the family's control through a twist of fate, becoming the disciple of a reclusive master artificer.

Within just a few years, she'd become one of Dragon Xia Country's top artifact-refining grandmasters!

Even the protagonist Ye Xuan had begged her multiple times to help forge magical treasures.

The Chen family, trading away a future grandmaster like merchandise just to cozy up to the Liu family...

Truly, spectacularly stupid.

Thinking this, Lin Yuan's salted-fish heart finally stirred ever so slightly.

He slowly turned to face his sister's "please, I'm begging you" expression and yawned lazily.

"Ugh, I really can't say no to you."

"Fine, I'll go. But remember—I'm only showing up. Don't expect me to play nice with those people."

"Wonderful!" Lin Mengyao's face lit up with delight. "Don't worry, just being there is enough!"

Watching his sister's happy expression, Lin Yuan snorted inwardly.

Heh, women.

You think I'm doing this for you? For the family?

Naive!

Three days later, Cloud Summit Manor.

As one of Yan Jing City's most elite private estates, the Su family's territory had always been renowned for its opulence and elegance.

Now, the manor gates were crowded with luxury cars.

One after another, custom spiritual-energy flying vehicles worth tens of millions or even hundreds of millions in the outside world were parked casually along the roadside like cabbages.

Well-dressed men and women stepped out of vehicles.

Each exuded that unique confidence and nobility of high society.

Any one of them, taken outside, would be a figure capable of shaking an entire region.

And today, they had all gathered here.

Deep within the manor, a grand outdoor banquet was underway.

Elegant classical music flowed through the air. Uniformed servants carried trays of fine wine and delicacies, weaving through the crowd.

Lin Yuan and Lin Mengyao's arrival instantly drew the attention of the entire gathering.

Especially Lin Yuan.

Nearly everyone's gaze, openly or covertly, fell upon this languid young man trailing behind Lin Mengyao.

Curiosity, awe, and deep wariness filled those looks.

So this was Lin Yuan, the Lin family's unicorn? The one who suppressed Ye Xuan with a single word at the National League, whom even the Martial Alliance's head referee treated with deference?

He didn't seem to have three heads and six arms—if anything...

He looked kind of half-asleep?

But with Lin Yuan and Lin Mengyao's appearance.

The originally noisy chatter in the banquet hall strangely quieted.

One gaze after another, some open and some covert, converged like searchlights on the young man following Lin Mengyao—the one who looked half-asleep.

"That's Lin Yuan? The Lin family's unicorn?"

"He looks pretty ordinary—even kind of... lazy? Nothing like the dominating presence from the rumors."

"Shh! Keep your voice down! What do you know! That's called returning to simplicity! True masters are all like this! I heard at the league, he just sat there lazily and with one look made that Ye Xuan kneel!"

"Hiss—really? That terrifying?"

The second and third-tier family scions whispered among themselves, eyes full of curiosity and awe.

Meanwhile, the core figures from top-tier families simply raised their glasses, letting their gazes linger briefly on Lin Yuan before withdrawing—but deep in their eyes, none lacked gravity and wariness.

Lin Yuan seemed deaf to all of it.

His attention wasn't on this tedious socializing at all.

His gaze was searching.

Mm, that corner looks nice—dim lighting, far from the crowd, plus there's a plate of Purple Crystal Spirit Grapes that looks very sweet.

Simply a tailor-made paradise for lying flat.

But just as he prepared to slip away from the group and head to his "throne"—

A discordant figure blocked his path.

"Lin Yuan."

The newcomers were Chen Tianhao, the Chen family patriarch.

Behind him trailed his arrogant-faced son, Chen Yu.

Chen Tianhao's expression was far from pleasant—even somewhat gloomy. He looked at Lin Yuan with an unconcealed appraisal and contempt, as if examining a flawed piece of merchandise.

"Uncle Chen, what brings you here?"

Lin Mengyao stepped forward, subtly positioning Lin Yuan behind her, wearing a professional, polite smile.

"Niece Mengyao, this doesn't concern you." Chen Tianhao waved dismissively, his gaze still locked on Lin Yuan. "Today, in front of all of Yan Jing's noble families, I have some things I must say to your brother."

He deliberately emphasized "brother," the mockery unmistakable.

The surrounding guests seemed to smell gunpowder, stopping their conversations to watch with interest.

Lin Yuan finally raised an eyelid and yawned.

So annoying.

Why did there always have to be flies buzzing around, disturbing people's sleep?

"I know you've been in the spotlight lately at the National League."

Chen Tianhao's voice carried clearly in the quiet banquet hall. "Defeating some talented Ye Xuan—not bad. However..."

His tone shifted, contempt thickening.

"In the eyes of true aristocratic families, that kind of child's play isn't worth taking seriously!"

"My Chen family is a distinguished house of Yan Jing City! My daughter Ruoxi is the pride of heaven! Her husband must be a dragon among men, a pillar of the future!"

"And you, Lin Yuan..." Chen Tianhao's gaze swept up and down Lin Yuan like a knife. "Though you have some talent, you're ultimately just a spoiled playboy who only knows how to eat and drink! You're not worthy!"

He paused, his face showing a smug expression, as if announcing tremendous news.

"Moreover, Young Master Mingxuan of the Liu family has already set his sights on Ruoxi! Do I need to explain what the Liu family represents? Marrying into the Liu family is my Chen family's—and Ruoxi's—best future!"

These words crashed like thunder through the crowd!

Broken engagement!

This was a public broken engagement!

And in such a humiliating manner!

All eyes focused on Lin Yuan, curious to see how this legendary Lin family unicorn would react.

Yet contrary to everyone's expectations.

Lin Yuan's face remained languid, as if he might fall asleep any second.

He even chuckled lightly.

That smile held amusement, pity, and... thick disdain.

"Finished?"

He spoke lightly, his voice soft but reaching every ear clearly.

Chen Tianhao froze.

"Done talking? Now it's my turn."

Lin Yuan's eyelids finally lifted fully.

Those dark eyes were calm as still water, yet deep enough to swallow everything.

"The Chen family? The Liu family?"

He chuckled softly and spoke a few words.

The Liu family.

Like the Lin family.

One of Yan Jing City's top-tier great houses.

The Liu family's ancestor was also a renowned martial god of Dragon Xia Country, on par with the Lin family's power.

And Liu Mingxuan, the Liu family's eldest young master.

Had already broken through to Qi Sea Realm fifth level.

No wonder Chen Tianhao dared to strut so confidently before him—he'd found a backer!

Unfortunately...

Lin Yuan didn't care one bit!

"Just chickens and dogs."

"As for your son..."

Lin Yuan's gaze swept over Chen Yu like scanning a pile of garbage.

"Heh, a worthless waste daring to bark in my presence?"

"What did you say?!"

Chen Yu exploded instantly!

He'd always been arrogant, leveraging the Chen family and his future brother-in-law's Liu family to swagger through Yan Jing City!

When had he ever suffered such humiliation?!

"You trash relying on your family's shadow! How dare you insult me?!"

"Today, I'll show you what real strength means!"

Chen Yu roared, his full spiritual power erupting like a volcano!

The pressure of Marrow Cleansing sixth level swept out, forcing some weaker guests to retreat!

He bellowed, his figure blurring into an afterimage, a fist tearing through the air with a shriek, hammering toward Lin Yuan's face!

It's over!

This was the shared thought of everyone present.

Strong as Lin Yuan might be, his current lazy posture showed zero alertness!

Chen Yu's punch, launched in rage, was heavy and fierce. Even if Lin Yuan survived, he'd surely be humiliated in public!

Lin Mengyao's expression changed—she was about to intervene!

But Lin Yuan moved faster.

Or rather, he didn't move at all.

Still that languid posture, not even shifting in his seat.

Just, in the instant before Chen Yu's fist reached him.

He raised his hand, lightly, casually.

As if shooing away an annoying fly.

HUM—!

A pressure impossible to describe—like an ancient divine mountain bearing down—descended instantly!

No spiritual fluctuation!

No aura release!

Just pure, irresistible, all-crushing pressure!

Chen Yu's charging form, the savage grin on his face, froze solid!

He felt as if he'd slammed into an invisible wall forged of divine metal!

That wasn't a wall!

It was a hundred-million-ton primordial mountain toppling onto him!

Every bone in his body groaned under that terrifying pressure, cracking in protest!

His vaunted spiritual power, before that pressure, melted like snow in sunlight—he couldn't mobilize even a trace!

"THUD—!!!"

Under the horrified gazes of all present.

Chen Yu, who'd been charging aggressively just a second ago, went weak in the knees and slammed to the ground before Lin Yuan in full prostration!

The hard marble floor was dented by his knees, spider-web cracks spreading outward!

"Ugh... ahh..."

Chen Yu lay on the ground, body shaking violently, throat producing beast-like howls of agony, face filled with terror beyond death itself!

The entire venue—

Dead silence!
