*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one year of cultivation as a reward!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Thunder Burst Talisman!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Earth Fire Bomb (infuse with spiritual energy to trigger an explosion comparable to a Peak Golden Core cultivator's full-strength attack)!]*

Ye Chen's expression lit up with pleasant surprise!

He hadn't expected Zhang Miaoyin to have a Profound-Grade Spiritual Root, and her drop rate wasn't low either...

A succession of good items had appeared!

Among them were the Thunder Burst Talisman, the Earth Fire Bomb, and other attack-type treasures and talismans...

Two hours later...

Ye Chen's hands now held quite a few talismans and treasures, and his cultivation had advanced considerably.

By now, the courtyard outside had grown noisy.

The Zhang family members in the estate had awakened and were moving about.

Ye Chen could faintly hear some conversation...

*[Ding! Would you like to spend 10,000 spirit stones to increase the probability of offspring quality?]*

*[After enhancement, there is a 100% chance of Profound-Grade Spiritual Root]*

*[50% chance of Earth-Grade Spiritual Root]*

*[10% chance of Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root]*

*[1% chance of Divine-Grade Spiritual Root]*

*[0.01% chance of Ancient Supreme Spiritual Root!]*

A series of cold notification sounds rang out...

Ye Chen paused, realizing he had just hit the mark.

He certainly wasn't going to leave any offspring with the Zhang family—wouldn't that be doing them a favor?

"Decline!"

An offspring that would never exist had no need for spending spirit stones to enhance its quality...

"Ye Chen, you bastard!"

"My father and aunt won't let you off..."

"The Zhao family won't let you off either!"

"You're dead..."

"Wuwuwu..."

Zhang Miaoyin curled up under the blanket, glaring at him with venomous eyes, roaring in fury.

She never imagined she would be violated like this!

Her heart was filled with rage, and she wanted nothing more than to tear Ye Chen to pieces...

"When you slaughtered the Ye family back then, did you ever think this day would come?"

"This is the price you deserve to pay!"

Ye Chen looked at her coldly.

"Too bad you won't get to see how Zhang Shuyu and your father die..."

Zhang Miaoyin: ???

As his words fell, Ye Chen raised his sword and slashed mercilessly at Zhang Miaoyin on the bed!

*Splurt!*

Powerful sword qi instantly cut her into several pieces of corpse, dead beyond dead...

The room fell silent...

Ye Chen felt no attachment whatsoever. He turned and walked toward the door.

The moment he opened it, more than a dozen Zhang family members and guards living in the rear courtyard surrounded him.

They had all been drawn by the commotion. The moment they saw Ye Chen, they recognized his identity and immediately became alert...

"Ye Chen, he's that Ye family remnant!"

"Such audacity, daring to come back..."

"Ye Chen, you can't escape!"

The crowd stared at him with rebukes.

At this point, some Zhang family members sensed something was wrong...

Why had Ye Chen appeared here?

And he had come out of Zhang Miaoyin's boudoir...

What had happened between them?

"Ye Chen, what did you do to Miaoyin?"

"Did you defile her?"

Zhang family members demanded angrily.

"She's dead!"

Ye Chen looked up at them and spoke indifferently.

Hearing this, the Zhang family members present were instantly enraged, their killing intent rising...

"Ye Chen, I'll tear you to pieces!"

One Zhang family member charged forward in fury...

"Overestimating yourself!"

Ye Chen sneered contemptuously. He raised his hand and brought his sword down...

*Splurt!*

This Foundation Establishment stage Zhang family member was instantly cleaved in two, becoming a corpse...

*Hiss!*

Everyone present drew in a cold breath, retreating several steps in terror.

They looked at Ye Chen with disbelief, faces full of shock!

"This... how is this possible!"

"Wasn't Ye Chen at Qi Refinement? How did he become so strong?"

One Zhang family member exclaimed.

In their memory, the Ye Chen who had escaped was just a Qi Refinement waste.

No one had expected him to become so powerful...

"He killed Third Brother with one sword strike—he's at least at Golden Core! How is that possible? Only a few months have passed. How could Ye Chen go from Qi Refinement to Golden Core?"

Someone refused to believe it was real.

"You there, attack!"

An older Zhang family member looked at the guards present and commanded.

These guards were all at Foundation Establishment, and at this moment, their hearts were filled with fear.

But they didn't dare disobey orders and could only steel themselves to charge forward...

"Ye Chen, die..."

"It's you who'll die, Zhang family dogs!"

Ye Chen snorted coldly and swung his sword again.

He showed no mercy to these Zhang family guards—they had all participated in the slaughter of the Ye family. Not one was innocent...

*Splurt!*

*Splurt!*

*Splurt!*

A domineering wave of sword qi swept through...

Several guards died on the spot!

The remaining Zhang family members completely panicked, their expressions changing drastically as their legs went weak with fear...

"He... he really is Golden Core!"

"He killed Foundation Establishment cultivators so easily. His strength is too terrifying..."

"We're no match for him. Let's run!"

The Zhang family members present had been scared witless and didn't dare engage Ye Chen.

With the family's strong fighters away and most of the guards dead, staying would only mean death.

The Zhang family members who had been so arrogant a moment ago now scattered in panicked flight!

"Trying to run?"

"You think you can escape?"

Ye Chen waved his hand, producing a round iron ball—an Earth Fire Bomb!

After infusing it with a trace of spiritual energy, he hurled it without hesitation toward where most people had gathered...

"What is that thing?"

One Zhang family member wondered.

The next second, the Earth Fire Bomb detonated!

*BOOM—*

A thunderous explosion!

Terrifying shockwaves erupted...

Scorching flames instantly engulfed the Zhang family members present!

More than a dozen of them hadn't even made it out of the courtyard before being blasted away, screaming and wailing...

"Ahhh!"

"No..."

*Splurt...*

In the blink of an eye, these arrogant Zhang family members had all become corpses on the ground.

The Earth Fire Bomb had power comparable to a Golden Core cultivator's full-strength attack—more than enough to deal with these Foundation Establishment Zhang family members.

"This little gadget is quite useful!"

Ye Chen said with delight.

It had originally been a reward from violating Zhang Miaoyin, and now it had been used on the Zhang family members—keeping it all in the family...

At this moment, more Zhang family members and guards who had heard the commotion rushed over...

Ye Chen sneered and took out a Thunder Burst Talisman from his storage ring, his heart full of anticipation...

"The Thunder Burst Talisman should pack quite a punch..."
