Inside the grand hall...

Liu Ruyan lay languidly on her side atop the bed.

She wore nothing but a crimson silk robe, beneath which peeked an inner garment of deep purple.

Her alluring eyes were fixed on the distant hall doors, her heart oscillating between anticipation and anxiety...

"That little troublemaker... why isn't he here yet?"

Liu Ruyan murmured under her breath...

Just then, the faintest sound of footsteps drifted in from outside the hall.

Her eyes flickered. She immediately pricked up her ears, a smile blooming across her bewitching face...

*Creak!*

The hall doors slowly swung open...

A figure strode in from outside and shut the doors behind him.

Ye Chen surveyed the pitch-dark hall, a flicker of surprise crossing his mind.

This woman wasn't even pretending anymore?

Before, she'd at least find some excuse to discuss sect affairs first. Now she was just summoning him outright for dual cultivation?

His gaze drifted toward the side chamber, where candlelight flickered warmly, guiding the way through the darkness...

He walked straight toward it, a familiar scent filling his nostrils!

He knew that fragrance well—it was Liu Ruyan's.

The moment he stepped into the side chamber, an invisible pulse of spiritual energy rippled past, and the doors behind him snapped shut!

A barrier quietly expanded outward...

"What are you standing there for?"

"Come here..."

From behind the screen came Liu Ruyan's honeyed, sultry voice...

A fire ignited in Ye Chen's chest. He quickened his pace, rounded the screen, and looked up...

Liu Ruyan lay draped across the bed in her flame-red silk, her voluptuous figure on full display. Her gaze was locked onto Ye Chen, eyes smoldering with seduction as she shot him a coy look.

"Hiss!"

Ye Chen's breathing grew ragged, his eyes burning.

Dressed like that—was she trying to kill him tonight?

"Come on..."

Liu Ruyan extended a slender jade finger and beckoned him with a slow, teasing curl...

Her dulcet voice was practically enchanting, reverberating in his ears.

Ye Chen approached step by step, but sensed something was different.

"Sect Master, you..."

Liu Ruyan hadn't bothered concealing her aura, and Ye Chen quickly noticed it was far more powerful than the night before...

"Mid-stage Void Refining!"

Ye Chen couldn't help but exclaim.

Liu Ruyan's cultivation had broken through...

He hadn't expected that his offhand joke from last night would actually start coming true!

Though he'd said she'd break through to the Body Integration Stage, at this rate of improvement, it was genuinely possible she'd reach that goal in short order...

Ye Chen was taken aback. He'd never imagined Liu Ruyan's cultivation would advance this quickly. He'd just been running his mouth, trying to weasel some benefits...

"This is all thanks to you, kid. Without your help, I could never have broken through to mid-stage Void Refining this quickly!"

Liu Ruyan said, her face flushed.

She knew full well that her breakthrough was primarily due to dual cultivating with Ye Chen...

Otherwise, advancing from early-stage to mid-stage Void Refining would have taken decades of grueling cultivation at minimum!

Ye Chen's expression shifted as understanding dawned. The look he gave Liu Ruyan became tinged with suspicion...

"So..."

"You summoned me tonight because you want to push for peak Void Refining?"

Liu Ruyan didn't bother hiding it. Face crimson, she answered frankly:

"That's right!"

"I need you... to help me!"

Only by rapidly raising her cultivation to the Body Integration Stage could she lead the Blissful Union Sect to stand against the three great powers...

To grow stronger, Liu Ruyan was going all in.

Ye Chen finally understood.

He'd been wondering why Liu Ruyan had been summoning him so frequently in the middle of the night...

Now it made sense!

She'd gotten a taste of the benefits and that's why she'd become so eager...

Was she planning to ride the momentum straight to Body Integration?

"Ye Chen..."

"Make me stronger!"

Ye Chen shuddered, meeting Liu Ruyan's blazing gaze head-on. In a flash, he pulled a Strength Restoration Pill from his storage ring and swallowed it...

For the sect—all in!

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received five years of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one High-Grade Teleportation Talisman! (Inject spiritual energy to activate. Can simultaneously teleport two people to any location in the Host's memory!)*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Advanced Clone Talisman! (Inject spiritual energy to activate. Creates ten clones possessing 30% of the Host's cultivation!)*

Two high-grade talismans in a row—Ye Chen was grinning from ear to ear...

This haul was absolutely massive!

He couldn't help but marvel internally. It really had to be Liu Ruyan—that drop rate was just unbeatable...

If it were Lin Qingxue or the others, getting high-grade talismans would be virtually impossible.

A Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root made all the difference. For that drop rate, Ye Chen was giving it everything he had...

Six hours later...

It was deep into the night!

Ye Chen's storage ring had accumulated a nice collection of talismans—Thunder Burst Talismans, Teleportation Talismans, Clone Talismans...

The Strength Restoration Pill's effects gradually faded, and he had nothing left in the tank.

A wave of exhaustion washed over him, and he sank into a deep sleep.

In his dreams, a thread of his consciousness drifted to his clone...

Deep in a mountain forest at night, a figure hurtled tirelessly through the darkness.

The clone had been traveling for a full day and night. Being a construct, it felt no fatigue.

Day or night, it pressed onward toward Profound Heaven Holy Land per Ye Chen's orders...

At the foot of the mountains, the outline of a village appeared.

What should have been a dark and quiet settlement suddenly erupted into roaring flames...

At a glance, the entire village seemed engulfed in a sea of fire.

Countless villagers jolted awake from their sleep and began fleeing their homes in a panic.

But the very next second, the fleeing villagers collapsed to the ground as their souls were ripped from their bodies, floating upward into the sky...

A long-bearded old man dressed in Daoist robes hovered above the village, wielding a banner that radiated thick black fog—a Soul-Summoning Banner—sweeping it through the air...

Every drifting soul was sucked into the banner!

"A heretical cultivator!"

Ye Chen's clone witnessed the scene and furrowed his brow.

He hadn't expected to stumble upon a heretical cultivator harvesting innocent souls out here in the middle of nowhere...

Watching those helpless villagers die, a twinge of compassion stirred in Ye Chen's heart.

He'd originally planned to pretend he hadn't seen anything, but after gritting his teeth, he launched himself at the heretical cultivator hovering in the sky...

Consider it divine justice!

The Daoist-robed elder sensed Ye Chen's approach and eyed him with surprise, initially intending to sweep up his soul with the Soul-Summoning Banner as well.

But when he saw that Ye Chen could also fly through the air, his expression changed dramatically.

Only cultivators at the Golden Core Stage or above possessed the ability to fly...

"Fellow Daoist..."

"Wait, hold on a moment!"

The elder in Daoist robes was about to say something when Ye Chen attacked without preamble...

A palm strike hurtled toward him!

The elder had no choice but to stop harvesting souls and swing his Soul-Summoning Banner to block...

*BOOM!*

A violent clash erupted in the sky...

The Daoist elder was at Peak Golden Core, while Ye Chen's clone was at Early Nascent Soul.

But with the Soul-Summoning Banner—an Immortal-Grade artifact—in his hands, the elder fought Ye Chen's unarmed clone to a standstill...
