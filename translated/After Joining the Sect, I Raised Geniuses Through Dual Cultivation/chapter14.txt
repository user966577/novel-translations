"Senior Brother, I'll... I'll go get Sister Su and tell her to come back soon!"

Lin Qingxue said hastily.

Face flushed crimson, she rose and hurried toward the courtyard gate...

She really didn't dare continue the exertion—otherwise she'd die in bed.

She needed at least two days of rest before doing it again!

"This girl..."

"Started the fire, then ran away?"

Ye Chen watched Lin Qingxue's fleeing figure, muttering with a wry smile.

What was he supposed to do now?

Seeing that Lin Qingxue had escaped, Ye Chen could only turn his gaze to Lu Mengyao sitting on the other side...

"Mengyao, you seem to have had a day off yesterday..."

"Today, let Senior Brother take good care of you!"

Ye Chen said with a grin.

This was when he discovered the benefit of having multiple women around.

When one couldn't continue, there was always another to choose from...

"Senior Brother...!"

Lu Mengyao didn't refuse, nodding shyly.

She'd spent all of last night listening through the walls, burning with unsatisfied desire...

Now that Ye Chen had taken the initiative to invite her, she was naturally more than willing—even eager. She immediately stood up.

"Don't worry, Senior Brother will be gentle this time!"

Ye Chen promised readily, sweeping up the voluptuous Lu Mengyao in his arms and striding toward the nearby room...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one year of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Immortal-Grade weapon—Flying Feather Sword!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving an Immortal-Slaying Talisman (Inject spiritual energy to activate. Power comparable to the full-force strike of a Void Refining Stage expert!)]

Ye Chen's expression froze. He almost thought he was hearing things...

Immortal-Slaying Talisman?

What surprised Ye Chen wasn't the talisman's name—it was the power described in the annotation.

Comparable to a full-force strike from a Void Refining Stage cultivator!

That was enough to instantly kill any cultivator below Soul Transformation Stage...

Even Sect Master Liu Ruyan was only at Peak Soul Transformation cultivation.

If he'd had this Immortal-Slaying Talisman back then, the Ye family would never have suffered such a tragic massacre.

Some young sect master of the Profound Heaven Holy Land? Some Nascent Soul realm elders?

This talisman could have obliterated them all!

Coming back to his senses, Ye Chen laughed with delight, his emotions running even higher...

"This is truly a treasure!"

With this Immortal-Slaying Talisman, he undoubtedly had another trump card for saving his life.

If he ever encountered the Profound Heaven Holy Land's young sect master, Ye Chen was confident he could kill him and avenge his family!

He hadn't expected that dual cultivating with Lu Mengyao, who only had a Mystic-Grade Spiritual Root, could yield such bountiful rewards!

Ye Chen immediately realized there was a certain probability of receiving high-grade rewards each time, and the higher the talent of the dual cultivation partner, the greater the chance of triggering high-grade rewards...

With this thought, Ye Chen suddenly conceived an unrefined idea!

Trade quantity for quality!

"Senior Brother, what are you saying?"

"What treasure?"

Lu Mengyao heard Ye Chen muttering and asked curiously.

She looked up, confusion flashing in her eyes.

She didn't see Ye Chen holding anything in his hands. Had she misheard?

She hadn't been asleep just now...

Her thoughts were in disarray...

Ye Chen glanced down at her, a smile spreading across his face!

"No time to explain..."

Lu Mengyao: ???

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one year of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Invisibility Talisman (Duration: one shichen)!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Tracking Mother-Child Gu (Lock onto a target's aura, release the child gu, and track their location through the mother gu)!]

One shichen later...

The room fell into silence.

Ye Chen leaned against the headboard, reaching up to wipe away sweat, feeling parched and wanting to gulp down cold water.

Recalling the reward notifications that had flashed by earlier, he felt a twinge of disappointment, sighing that it was too bad...

He'd come so close!

Though he'd obtained more talismans and a gu insect, none compared to the Immortal-Slaying Talisman he'd received before!

Nor had he gotten any more offensive talismans like that one!

Lu Mengyao lay beside him, exhausted and asleep. Ye Chen was worn out too.

Even if he continued plowing now, it would be hard to get another prize like the Immortal-Slaying Talisman.

"Looks like I still need to dual cultivate with higher-grade Spiritual Root partners—that's the only way to improve the drop rate!"

Ye Chen murmured to himself, immediately thinking of Liu Ruyan...

Her drop rate should be quite high!

But as an ordinary disciple wanting to sleep with the Sect Master... it was a bit unrealistic.

Liu Ruyan was a Soul Transformation Stage powerhouse. Using force was definitely out of the question—she'd be more likely to force herself on him...

He could only settle for second best and try to have more in-depth exchanges with Su Nianwan, who had an Earth-Grade Spiritual Root.

Su Nianwan's drop rate was also decent. Each time he hit the mark, she brought double rewards.

Ye Chen firmly believed that as long as he worked the fields diligently, there would be a harvest!

"Senior Brother, this is bad!"

"Something happened to Sister Su..."

Lin Qingxue's urgent cry came from outside...

Her voice was full of anxiety!

Ye Chen's heart sank. He immediately sensed something was wrong and leapt up, throwing on clothes as he dashed out of the room.

He dressed as he walked, straightening his clothing.

Looking up at Lin Qingxue running toward him, he asked directly.

"What happened?"

"Where's Nianwan?"

"Sister Su is missing!"

Lin Qingxue stopped, looking at Ye Chen with a face full of anxiety, panting as she explained.

"Her roommates said Sister Su left several shichen ago."

"They heard sounds of fighting outside, but when they went to check, they didn't see anyone..."

"Sister Su might have been abducted by someone!"

Hearing this, Ye Chen's expression grew grave as he furrowed his brow.

He immediately recalled being followed earlier and realized they'd been targeted...

Who could have done this?

The sect's Grand Elder?

Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan?

Or... a powerhouse from the Profound Heaven Holy Land?

Ye Chen couldn't yet determine whether the sect's elders were friend or foe. The only one he could trust was Sect Master Liu Ruyan.

Su Nianwan had been sent by Liu Ruyan to dual cultivate with him, so she couldn't have abducted her.

If the sect's Supreme Elders wanted to see Su Nianwan, it would only take a single word—even Sect Master Liu Ruyan wouldn't dare refuse.

This was within the Blissful Union Sect's inner sect. No matter how powerful the Profound Heaven Holy Land was, they couldn't silently abduct a personal disciple.

Other disciples in the sect didn't have the ability to deal with Su Nianwan.

The only suspect was Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan...

"Could it be her doing?"

Ye Chen muttered.

She was Liu Ruyan's mortal enemy. Whether it was following him or abducting Su Nianwan to uncover the courtyard's secrets—it all made sense.

Jiang Yuyan was definitely a suspect!
