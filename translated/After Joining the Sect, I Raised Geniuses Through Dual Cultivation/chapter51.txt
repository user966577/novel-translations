As her words fell, Wang Yuxuan gripped her longsword tightly and launched herself at Ye Chen...

"Azure Water Sword Art!"

A delicate shout...

Countless water-blossom sword qi instantly condensed in the air, shooting toward Ye Chen.

"All flash, no substance..."

Ye Chen glanced at it dismissively.

He raised his hand and struck out with a palm...

What seemed like a casual palm strike erupted with power that instantly shattered the water-blossom sword qi in the air...

*BANG!*

Wang Yuxuan was also sent flying by the palm!

*CLANG!*

Her longsword fell from her grasp.

Wang Yuxuan's expression changed, her breathing becoming erratic.

Looking up at Ye Chen, her eyes completely changed...

"Nascent Soul!"

"How is this possible..."

"You clearly have only a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root. How could you cultivate to the Nascent Soul realm at such a young age?"

Wang Yuxuan exclaimed in disbelief, unable to help herself.

She had thought she was already one of the best among the younger generation. She never expected someone to be even more impressive...

"So what if I have a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root?"

"Who says a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root can't reach Nascent Soul?"

"Frog in a well, narrow-minded fool!"

Ye Chen looked at her coldly, unable to resist a few retorts...

Wang Yuxuan: ???

Hearing Ye Chen say this, Wang Yuxuan was stunned!

She, a sect prodigy, had been called a frog in a well?

This was looking down on her too much, wasn't it?

"Damn it!"

"Who exactly are you?"

Wang Yuxuan glared at Ye Chen with fury in her eyes, fire burning in her heart.

Just then, footsteps could be heard from the nearby forest...

Ye Chen glanced at the injured Wang Yuxuan and didn't answer her question. Instead, he turned and quickly departed.

"Hey, don't leave..."

Wang Yuxuan was stunned, watching Ye Chen's retreating figure with a puzzled frown.

"He's not a Blissful Union Sect disciple?"

"Wait, if he's not from the Blissful Union Sect, why did he attack me?"

Wang Yuxuan was thoroughly confused. Looking toward where Ye Chen had left, a hint of resentment crept into her eyes...

Just as she was about to get up and escape, several Blissful Union Sect disciples surrounded her and seized her.

"Don't move!"

"Come with us..."

With a sword at her throat, Wang Yuxuan had no choice but to give up resisting and obediently follow the Blissful Union Sect disciples.

She silently memorized Ye Chen's appearance in her heart, determined to find him for revenge!

That hateful guy!

Ye Chen had already run far away. At his speed, the Blissful Union Sect disciples couldn't catch up, couldn't even detect his presence...

At this moment, the clone was being controlled entirely by Ye Chen's will, heading straight for the Profound Heaven Holy Land!

Blissful Union Sect.

A small courtyard.

In a room...

Ye Chen slowly opened his eyes, a hint of worry in his brow.

Though the Heavenly Demon Sect elite squad hiding in the nearby forest had been eliminated, and they had even lost a Void Refining elder...

The Blissful Union Sect's crisis was far from resolved!

Three major sects joining forces against the Blissful Union Sect—this wasn't something the current Blissful Union Sect could withstand.

Now that the Heavenly Demon Sect had lost a Void Refining elder, they might not hold back. Instead, they might retaliate against the Blissful Union Sect even more frantically...

Their offensive against the Blissful Union Sect might even be accelerated!

He needed to make plans early...

Once the Blissful Union Sect was destroyed, he would definitely need to find a way to escape!

But before that, Ye Chen naturally hoped the Blissful Union Sect could hold. That way, he could continue to enjoy its protection...

After all, not every faction had a Sect Master who was a great beauty, and not every Sect Master would let a disciple successfully flirt with her!

If there was anything that made Ye Chen reluctant to leave the Blissful Union Sect, Liu Ruyan was definitely one of them...

"Why are my ears burning..."

Ye Chen snapped out of his thoughts, muttering in confusion.

Was someone thinking about him?

Before he could ponder further, a wave of exhaustion swept over him...

Perhaps from controlling his clone with his will for so long, Ye Chen felt extremely tired. He immediately lay down on the bed and fell into a deep sleep...

Evening approached...

When Ye Chen finally woke from his comfortable nap, the room was already pitch dark!

"What time is it?"

Ye Chen was startled and hurriedly got up from the bed.

He had slept for half a day. Last night's exertions had really drained him completely...

But now Ye Chen felt energized, like he could go again.

*Creak!*

Ye Chen opened the door and stepped out...

"Senior Brother, you're awake!"

In the courtyard, Lin Qingxue turned to look at him, a smile on her face.

Lu Mengyao and the others were also seated in the courtyard. Seeing Ye Chen awake, they all rose and gathered around.

"Senior Brother must be hungry, right?"

"The food is already prepared..."

"Eat something first, Senior Brother. Sister Su even made a nourishing soup!"

The four women approached Ye Chen with beaming smiles, pulling him toward a nearby room...

A fragrant aroma wafted over.

Ye Chen felt completely refreshed, his thoughts becoming active again...

His stomach had long been growling. With the four women attending to him, he immediately began devouring the food.

Just then, a disciple entered the courtyard...

"Senior Brother Ye!"

"The Sect Master wants you to come see her..."

Hearing this, Ye Chen paused, a hint of confusion crossing his face.

"The Sect Master?"

"Why does she want me to come over at this hour?"

As he spoke, he was met with knowing looks from Lin Qingxue and the others...

"Senior Brother didn't go see the Sect Master at all today. She must be missing you..."

Lu Mengyao looked at Ye Chen teasingly.

Lin Qingxue, Su Nianwan, and Zhao Ling'er were too thin-skinned, just looking at Ye Chen and giggling foolishly, seemingly having guessed what was going on...

Being summoned after dark, a woman and a man alone together—what else could it be about?

They weren't stupid. They had their guesses.

Though Zhao Ling'er had just arrived, after chatting with Lin Qingxue and the others all day and getting acquainted, she also learned about Ye Chen and Liu Ruyan's secret relationship...

They were all good sisters now, so nothing was kept from her.

Meeting the knowing gazes of the four women, Ye Chen shook his head with a wry smile.

"It's not what you think..."

He tried to explain...

He had already recalled the conflict outside the sect earlier. He immediately guessed Liu Ruyan was probably calling him over because of the Heavenly Demon Sect matter...

Though Ye Chen was just a disciple, his influence was considerable. He could be called the future of the Blissful Union Sect!

For such a matter concerning the sect's life and death, he was entitled to know.

"Senior Brother, you don't need to explain. We all understand..."

Lin Qingxue said, her face flushed.

"Senior Brother, you... take care of yourself, and come back early..."

Su Nianwan said shyly.

"Senior Brother, you should hurry. Don't keep the Sect Master waiting..."

Zhao Ling'er added, her cheeks rosy.

Ye Chen paused, looking at them with a changed expression...

Lin Qingxue and the others teasing him was one thing, but now even Zhao Ling'er was teasing him?

"Alright, alright, just you wait!"

"See how I punish you when I get back..."

Ye Chen said threateningly.

Hearing this, Lin Qingxue and the others all blushed instantly, shyly lowering their heads...
