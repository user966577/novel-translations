In the great hall...

The several Grand Elders and Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan were growing impatient.

They kept glancing toward the nearby side chamber, their hearts brimming with curiosity about the conversation between Liu Ruyan and the Grand Elder.

Jiang Yuyan felt increasingly uneasy, restless in a way she couldn't quite articulate.

Just then, the side chamber door opened, and everyone's eyes turned in that direction.

"Grand Elder..."

Jiang Yuyan hurriedly looked toward the approaching Grand Elder, hoping to extract some information from him.

The Grand Elder met her gaze, his attitude firm as he spoke.

"Tell the people from the Profound Heaven Holy Land that the Blissful Union Sect has no disciple named Ye Chen. They've come to the wrong place!"

"If they intend to use this as an excuse to make trouble for the Blissful Union Sect, we old bones aren't dead yet. We're ready to oblige them anytime!"

Jiang Yuyan was stunned!

She stared at the Grand Elder in disbelief, unable to understand how he'd changed his tune.

When they'd arrived, he had been adamant about forcing Liu Ruyan to hand over Ye Chen.

How could his attitude have shifted so quickly?

What had happened?

"Grand Elder, are we really going to make enemies of the Profound Heaven Holy Land?"

Jiang Yuyan pressed urgently.

"Just relay my words to them. Don't ask anything more!"

The Grand Elder replied coldly.

He looked up at the other Grand Elders present.

"Let's go!"

He turned and strode out without looking back.

The other Grand Elders followed without hesitation. Though they didn't understand why, they all deferred to the Grand Elder's judgment.

"Grand Elder..."

"Second Elder!"

"Don't leave..."

Jiang Yuyan was dumbfounded. She hadn't expected all the Grand Elders to switch sides.

As she watched them depart, only she and Liu Ruyan remained in the hall. The silence became oppressive.

"Liu Ruyan, what exactly did you say to the Grand Elder?"

"How could he make such a reckless decision!"

Jiang Yuyan whirled around to glare at Liu Ruyan accusingly, convinced she must have bewitched the Grand Elder somehow.

"Since when do you address me by name?"

"You're getting more and more out of line!"

"No matter what, I am still the Sect Master of the Blissful Union Sect. Who are you to point fingers at me?"

Liu Ruyan snorted coldly in retort, showing no indulgence whatsoever.

Without the Grand Elders present to back her up, Liu Ruyan wasn't afraid of her.

"You..."

Jiang Yuyan was furious, but given the difference in status and strength, she didn't dare challenge Liu Ruyan openly.

"Hmph! Just you wait!"

"Offending the Profound Heaven Holy Land—you'll regret it."

Jiang Yuyan threw down her threat and stormed off in a huff.

She was determined to get to the bottom of this.

Liu Ruyan's expression darkened. She watched Jiang Yuyan's departing figure, a cold glint flashing through her eyes!

Her junior sister's ambitions were growing by the day!

It seemed she needed to accelerate her plans...

In the courtyard wing...

*Crack!*

A crisp sound rang out!

Spiritual energy from all directions began flooding into Ye Chen's body.

Like a bottomless pit, he devoured the spiritual energy without restraint.

His entire aura was surging wildly!

"Early Foundation Establishment!"

"I broke through!"

Ye Chen opened his eyes and shouted with joy.

He'd been stuck at Qi Refining for so long, yet after just two nights of dual cultivation, he'd successfully reached Foundation Establishment!

This undoubtedly gave Ye Chen hope for revenge!

At this cultivation speed, it wouldn't be long before he could storm the Profound Heaven Holy Land and rescue his sister Ye Qing'er.

*Creak!*

The door swung open!

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao had heard the commotion and rushed in.

Seeing that Ye Chen was safe and sound, they finally relaxed, their tense expressions easing considerably.

Liu Ruyan had personally instructed them to take good care of Ye Chen—no mistakes allowed. If Ye Chen so much as lost a single hair, Liu Ruyan might take their lives!

"Huh? Senior Brother Ye, you... broke through to Foundation Establishment!"

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao both noticed Ye Chen's surging cultivation and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.

Breaking through from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment was no easy feat. They had both struggled tremendously to break through that barrier!

Ye Chen had only reached Qi Refining Level 12 yesterday, yet here he was at Foundation Establishment already. It was simply incredible.

"That's right!"

"Spiritual energy was churning inside me earlier, so I took the opportunity to establish my foundation."

Ye Chen smiled as he spoke, offering no further explanation.

Lin Qingxue seemed to realize something, a gleam appearing in her eyes!

Perhaps her speculation from last night was true—dual cultivating with Ye Chen really could boost one's cultivation...

Lu Mengyao beside her was the perfect example. She too had broken through to Mid Foundation Establishment this morning!

Could it be that the Sect Master's real intention in having them serve Ye Chen was to give them the opportunity to advance their cultivation?

"Senior Brother Ye, you must be hungry, right?"

"I'll go prepare some food!"

Lin Qingxue spoke considerately, beaming as she headed outside.

In her mind, she was thinking: *Got to eat well to have energy for work!*

"Senior Brother Ye, I... I'll go help."

Lu Mengyao had just experienced last night's intensity. Bold as her personality was, facing Ye Chen alone still made her blush. After speaking, she fled the room as if escaping.

Last night had been her first time, after all.

Moreover, many of the moves Ye Chen had used in bed were ones she'd never even heard of. Recalling those positions now made her feel deeply embarrassed.

She hadn't expected Senior Brother Ye to be *that* kind of person!

"Still shy?"

"That wasn't like you last night..."

Ye Chen watched Lu Mengyao's retreating figure and shook his head with a smile.

This girl had been plenty eager last night...

After he dressed and washed up, Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao returned with steaming dishes—a whole table full of delicacies.

This was also Liu Ruyan's arrangement, ensuring Ye Chen's meals and daily needs were taken care of, lest his body become depleted.

After the feast...

Ye Chen looked up and met Lin Qingxue's watery gaze, deep as a lake, gradually rippling with waves.

This little minx was feeling amorous!

Remembering how he'd spent the previous night with Lu Mengyao and neglected her, Ye Chen now wanted to make it up to her.

He couldn't favor one over the other!

"Qingxue, Mengyao—your senior brother has some new moves he'd like to discuss with you two..."

Ye Chen smiled at them both.

"What... moves?"

Lu Mengyao was momentarily confused. Then she glanced at the love-struck Lin Qingxue beside her and instantly understood what was happening!

Her face flushed crimson in an instant!

These weren't ordinary moves—she was still sore from yesterday!

"Senior Brother Ye, I... I think I'll pass for now."

"The moves from last night—let me digest those first..."

"You and Sister Lin go ahead. I'll take a walk outside."

Lu Mengyao hastily waved her hands, face burning as she rose and fled toward the door.

She couldn't take any more. Another round would be the death of her.

She also wanted to give Ye Chen and Lin Qingxue some alone time.

And let Lin Qingxue help draw some fire!
