When Ye Chen returned to his courtyard, he found the door to his room standing open.

Someone had been here?

He immediately grew alert, carefully stepping inside while scanning the interior.

At the first sign of trouble, he'd bolt. Staying alive came first!

"Hm?"

"What a lovely scent."

A wisp of fragrance drifted toward him...

It was a fragrance unique to women.

Then Ye Chen spotted a woman in a red silk dress sitting on the edge of his bed.

Her cold, beautiful face looked especially alluring in the candlelight. Her curvaceous figure strained against her dress, captivating with a single glance.

The room's layout had changed as well. Red curtains now hung everywhere, adding a festive atmosphere.

On the table sat two large red candles, a wine pot, and cups...

"This is... the female disciple Liu Ruyan arranged?"

"A wedding night..."

"That was fast?"

Ye Chen was somewhat surprised!

He'd just returned from Liu Ruyan's place, and she'd already arranged a dual cultivation partner for him. She'd even helped decorate the room.

They'd skipped the wedding ceremony and jumped straight to the wedding night!

Clearly, Liu Ruyan was just as eager!

Ye Chen relaxed. As long as no one was here to kill him, he could handle a single female disciple.

He stepped into the room, his gaze appraising the female disciple...

She matched his requirements almost perfectly. Beauty, figure—she had it all.

Long legs, slim waist, 36D...

Definitely a beauty selected through rigorous screening.

Liu Ruyan hadn't fooled him!

Not only that, this female disciple possessed a Profound-Grade Spiritual Root and was at the Early Foundation Establishment Stage—her cultivation was even higher than Ye Chen's.

In the Blissful Union Sect, this already qualified her as an Inner Sect Disciple!

When Lin Qingxue saw Ye Chen return, her heart immediately began racing. Her face flushed crimson as she shyly lowered her head, fingers clutching the bedsheets beneath her, her heartbeat thundering like a drum.

Though frightened, she showed no resistance and made no attempt to flee.

Liu Ruyan's people had promised her numerous benefits, and her family had received generous rewards as well. The requirement was simple: take good care of Ye Chen.

For herself and for her family, Lin Qingxue simply couldn't refuse such conditions!

Even if it meant offering her body, it was worth it!

When she saw Ye Chen's handsome, attractive face, she actually felt relieved. Suddenly, it didn't seem so hard to accept after all.

As a disciple of the Blissful Union Sect, she would eventually need to find a cultivation partner for dual cultivation when she hit a bottleneck. Better to offer herself now while she was still pure and get generous compensation in return.

Lin Qingxue's face flushed as she noticed Ye Chen's hesitation. Unable to help herself, she raised her head, her watery eyes meeting his gaze as she spoke in a soft, delicate voice.

"Senior Brother Ye, shall I help you undress?"

Ye Chen's mind went blank. His whole body heated up.

Without time to admire the scenery, he pounced in several quick strides...

The girl was being so proactive—what was there to hesitate about?

What toast to the bride? What getting to know each other first? Sleep first, talk later!!!

Only a fool would pass up a free meal!

"Senior Brother..."

"I... I still have sword practice tomorrow..."

Lin Qingxue closed her eyes, her face burning as she spoke.

Her sweet, tender voice echoed in Ye Chen's ears...

Ye Chen: !!!

Like a demon's whisper, it shattered his last shred of reason!

"Ahh!!!"

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one year of cultivation as a reward!]

One hour later...

Lin Qingxue's eyes glistened with dried tears as she curled up in the corner, fast asleep.

Ye Chen suddenly sat up, sensing something.

*Crack!*

A soft sound came from his dantian!

The next second, the aura around Ye Chen surged violently...

"Qi Refining Level 11!"

"I broke through!"

Before he could think further, the spiritual energy in his dantian continued to assault the barrier!

*Crack!*

His aura became even more powerful than before!

"Qi Refining Level 12!"

Ye Chen was overjoyed. The bottleneck that had troubled him for so long had been overcome as naturally as water flowing downstream!

And he'd broken through two minor realms in succession!

This undoubtedly gave him hope...

He hadn't even produced offspring yet, and various rewards were already being triggered. How generous would the rewards be once he actually had children?

[Ding! Detected that Host is about to produce offspring. Would you like to spend 10,000 Spirit Stones to improve offspring aptitude probability?]

[After improvement, 100% chance for Profound-Grade Spiritual Root]

[50% chance for Earth-Grade Spiritual Root]

[10% chance for Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root]

[1% chance for Divine-Grade Spiritual Root]

[0.01% chance for Ancient Supreme Spiritual Root!]

Spiritual Root grades from lowest to highest were: Yellow-Grade, Profound-Grade, Earth-Grade, Heaven-Grade, Divine-Grade, and Ancient Supreme Spiritual Root.

The higher a cultivator's Spiritual Root grade, the more sensitive they were to spiritual energy, the faster their cultivation speed, and the higher their future potential.

Ye Chen himself only had a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root. Given the same time and effort, others would already be at Foundation Establishment while he was still at Qi Refining—that was the difference!

Without spending Spirit Stones, offspring would have a 100% chance of Profound-Grade Spiritual Roots, with no probability of other grades.

Looking at the illusory panel before him, Ye Chen chose to spend the Spirit Stones without hesitation!

As long as one offspring had an Earth-Grade Spiritual Root, those 10,000 Spirit Stones would be worth it—not to mention the chance to aim for a legendary Ancient Supreme Spiritual Root.

[Ding! Successfully spent 10,000 Spirit Stones. Offspring aptitude probability improved!]

The next second, Ye Chen sensed the 10,000 Spirit Stones in his storage ring vanish into thin air.

He didn't feel the loss. After all, they were Spirit Stones he'd extracted from Liu Ruyan, specifically prepared for improving offspring aptitude.

As long as the child Lin Qingxue bore in ten months had an Earth-Grade Spiritual Root or higher, his status in the sect would rise accordingly.

By then, wouldn't he have whatever he wanted?

The sect would continuously supply him with Spirit Stones to nurture offspring...

However many female disciples he wanted, he could have...

Liu Ruyan might even force them on him whether he wanted them or not!

"Mm..."

Lin Qingxue stirred awake beside him, blearily glancing at Ye Chen before asking wearily.

"Senior Brother Ye, what are you doing?"

"Not sleeping?"

She turned toward him, her eyes hazy with sleep as she looked at Ye Chen. Her flushed, alluring face was full of confusion...

Beneath the blanket, her snow-white skin was on full display.

Ye Chen looked down, and the flames that had just died down began stirring once more.

A thought suddenly occurred to him...

What if they had twins?

"Senior Brother Ye, you..."

Before she could speak, she was silenced.

Until dawn...

Ye Chen drifted off to sleep, his dreams filled with bountiful harvests, a smile spreading across his face...

Mine, all mine!!!
