"Stepmother?"

"Zhang Shuyu, you think you're worthy of that title?"

"You cheated on your husband, conspired with outsiders to kill him, and even destroyed the entire Ye family..."

"You venomous woman, and you dare call yourself my stepmother?"

Ye Chen glared at her and cursed, his eyes blazing with fury.

He wished he could chop this slut's head off!

Looking at Zhang Shuyu before him, he couldn't help but think of his adoptive father Ye Haotian and all those Ye family members who had died tragically...

If not for Zhang Shuyu, how could the Ye family have been destroyed?

During the months of exile, Ye Chen had been haunted by the nightmare of the massacre. At last, the day of vengeance had arrived!

"Ye Chen, I know I was wrong. I apologize to you!"

"Don't kill me. I can return everything the Ye family had to you..."

"If... if that's not enough to satisfy you, I can offer myself to you..."

"Ye Chen, let me serve you, won't you?"

"Consider it my penance!"

Zhang Shuyu begged in panic, immediately kneeling before Ye Chen.

To survive, she even offered to give her body for Ye Chen's pleasure...

She was only a few years older than Ye Chen, with stunning beauty and an alluring figure—otherwise, she wouldn't have attracted the attention of the Young Sect Master of Profound Heaven Holy Land...

Now she actively seduced him, posing provocatively before Ye Chen in a most tempting manner!

Hard for anyone to resist!

"Zhang Shuyu!"

"You really are... shameless!"

Ye Chen looked at her with a dark expression, his eyes full of disgust.

No matter how beautiful Zhang Shuyu was, no matter how seductive her figure, in Ye Chen's eyes she was utterly revolting...

Facing this viper-hearted woman, Ye Chen had no interest whatsoever.

Ye Haotian must have been blind to ever fall for such a woman...

"Yes, I'm shameless, I'm cheap, I was wrong—isn't that enough..."

"Ye Chen, you can beat me, curse me, torture me however you want. Just please don't kill me, alright?"

"I don't want to die. I want to live..."

Zhang Shuyu didn't care about Ye Chen's disgust—she only wanted to survive.

She was willing to kneel and beg, utterly humbling herself before him...

"Spare you?"

"In your next life!"

Ye Chen gave a cold snort and immediately slashed down with his sword...

"No..."

Zhang Shuyu's heart lurched. Before she could finish her words, her head was separated from her body...

The head rolled some distance before stopping, eyes wide open in death!

Her headless corpse slowly collapsed to the ground!

*Hiss!*

A collective gasp of shock echoed through the courtyard...

The Zhang family members in the distance were nearly scared witless by this sight!

They hadn't expected Ye Chen to be so ruthless. Even when Zhang Shuyu had knelt and begged for mercy, she still couldn't escape death.

Their hearts were filled with dread, and their gazes toward Ye Chen were full of fear!

"Ye... Ye Chen, you've killed Zhang Shuyu. You can't kill us too..."

"You've already had your revenge. Surely you can spare us?"

"I'm just a retainer of the Zhang family. I was paid to do a job. I have no Ye family blood on my hands—this has nothing to do with me..."

"I'm just a distant relative of the Zhang family. I'm innocent!"

These Zhang family members and retainers began distancing themselves from what had happened...

Among them were several Golden Core experts, but they feared Ye Chen's power and didn't have the courage to attack.

Zhang Mobei, at Nascent Soul, had been killed with a single strike—what waves could they possibly make?

Having killed Zhang Shuyu with his own hand, Ye Chen felt immensely satisfied.

Months of pent-up frustration had been swept away...

He had finally avenged the Ye family personally!

Ye Chen looked up at the remaining Zhang family members, a cold glint in his eyes...

"Though you didn't participate directly, you took over the Ye family's properties and enjoyed the fruits of their blood..."

"Those of you who were paid to do the job—you're accomplices!"

"Since your Zhang family slaughtered my entire Ye family, today I'll slaughter your entire Zhang family in return. Not one will be left alive!"

He spoke coldly.

Gripping his spirit sword, he approached the Zhang family members step by step...

"No... that's not how it was. I'm not an accomplice!"

"Don't kill me. I don't want to die..."

"I know I was wrong. Ye Chen, spare me. I'll be your dog, alright?"

"Ye Chen, you're not being fair. That's too tyrannical!"

Some defended themselves, some begged, some resented...

The Zhang family members faced the threat of death with various expressions.

"Tyrannical?"

Ye Chen stopped and raised an eyebrow, snorting coldly.

"So what if I'm being tyrannical today?"

"What can any of you do about it?"

His gaze swept across the scene...

Every Zhang family member present went pale, trembling like quails with their necks drawn in, terror beyond measure...

"Die!"

Ye Chen waved his hand, sending out a Thunder Burst Talisman...

The next second, a terrifying bolt of lightning descended!

*BOOM—*

*BANG!*

*BANG!*

*BANG!*

The Zhang family members gathered together didn't even have time to scream before being blasted to pieces, reduced to piles of charred remains...

The courtyard fell silent once more!

Not a single living person remained in the estate. Whether Zhang family members, guards, or servants—all had been killed by Ye Chen...

Ye Chen surveyed the corpses scattered everywhere, feeling an unprecedented calm in his heart!

The nightmare that had haunted him for so long had finally been laid to rest!

The revenge for the entire Ye family had been achieved today...

Those who had died tragically could now rest in peace!

*Crack!*

A crisp sound came from within Ye Chen's body...

Perhaps due to the change in his mental state, his realm had also broken through its bottleneck!

His aura surged instantly!

"Mid Nascent Soul!"

A hint of joy crossed Ye Chen's face...

Just as he was about to head to the treasury to plunder the valuables, his peripheral vision caught a fallen storage ring...

This was the high-grade ring that had dropped when Ye Chen had killed Zhang Mobei earlier.

Ye Chen reached out, and the storage ring flew into his palm.

Using spiritual energy to forcibly break the seal...

When he saw what was stored inside the ring, Ye Chen was astonished, and his face immediately lit up with delight!

Inside were mountains of spirit stones, along with many pills and treasures...

Only then did he remember what Zhang Miaoyin had said earlier—the Zhang family's strong fighters had gone out to explore a cave dwelling. Everything in this storage ring must have been their haul from that expedition.

But now it all belonged to him!

Ye Chen happily pocketed the storage ring.

He also collected all the storage rings from Zhang Shuyu and the others.

He then made a trip to the estate's treasury. This had once been the Ye family's treasure pavilion, filled with mountains of spirit stones, pills, treasures, and talismans...

Ye Chen swept his gaze around and collected everything with a wave of his hand.

Having returned for revenge, he had no intention of staying. These valuables left behind would only benefit others—better to take everything with him!

When he was done, Ye Chen walked straight toward the estate's main gate...

He lifted his foot over the threshold, just as he had done countless times growing up—walking out the front door, knowing he would return home when night fell!

Ye Chen looked up at the "Zhang Estate" plaque and shattered it with a wave of his hand...

Turning around, he saw a crowd of onlookers gathered outside the gate.

Among them were strong cultivators from various families in the city, all come to investigate...

Ye Chen paid them no attention. As his gaze swept across the crowd, it suddenly stopped on a delicate, pretty face.

The young miss of the Xu family—Xu Qingqing!
