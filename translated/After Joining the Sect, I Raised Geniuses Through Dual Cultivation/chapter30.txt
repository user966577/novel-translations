"Shangguan Yanran, what are you so smug about?"

"Weren't you sent by the Sect Master to serve Senior Brother Ye?"

Su Nianwan glanced at her and shot back coolly.

Being called a cauldron over and over grated on her nerves.

She didn't think dual cultivating with Ye Chen was anything shameful—she was even proud of it!

If she hadn't come to the small courtyard to dual cultivate with Ye Chen, she wouldn't have grown from Peak Foundation Establishment all the way to Peak Golden Core!

She felt incredibly fortunate to have this opportunity!

Shangguan Yanran's expression darkened. A flash of anger appeared in her eyes as she looked at Su Nianwan!

"What is Ye Chen? Does he deserve to have me serve him?"

"I'm just treating him as my dual cultivation cauldron. Once I'm done using him, I can toss him aside anytime."

"From now on, I, Shangguan Yanran, am in charge of this courtyard!"

"All three of you must listen to me!"

She spoke with overwhelming arrogance.

She seemed to have forgotten what Liu Ruyan had sent her here to do.

"You dare insult Senior Brother Ye?"

"If the Sect Master finds out, she'll definitely punish you!"

Lin Qingxue spoke with a stern face, her impression of Shangguan Yanran worsening further.

"Hmph, so what if the Sect Master finds out?"

"When have I, Shangguan Yanran, ever served anyone?"

"Would I be afraid of her?"

Shangguan Yanran paid no heed to Lin Qingxue's warning.

*Crash!*

The room door opened...

Ye Chen walked out with a dark expression.

He had heard every word of the courtyard conversation from inside the room.

This Shangguan Yanran was ordering the three women around and acting arrogant and overbearing. Ye Chen had reached his limit.

What kind of person was this—bullying his women!

The last person to do that had already turned to ash.

"Get out!"

Ye Chen's face was cold as he stared at Shangguan Yanran, rebuking her harshly.

Shangguan Yanran's heart trembled. The color drained from her face as her gaze fell on Ye Chen, walking toward her. She felt somewhat annoyed.

"You... you dare snap at me?"

"You think I won't have you killed?"

She naturally wouldn't leave just because he told her to. That would make her look afraid of Ye Chen—how embarrassing.

She forced herself to threaten him through her fear.

In the Blissful Union Sect, no one had ever dared treat her like this!

She couldn't swallow this insult.

"I don't believe you!"

Ye Chen shook his head, expression blank.

"If you don't leave now, I'll kill you!"

His tone was ice-cold to the extreme. The way he looked at Shangguan Yanran was like looking at a dead person.

He'd even dared to kill Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan—what was one female disciple?

Right now, no matter how pretty she was, Ye Chen had no interest.

He had no shortage of women around him. He didn't care about having one more or one less dual cultivation partner.

Shangguan Yanran's overbearing attitude had thoroughly enraged Ye Chen.

Not only was she bullying Lin Qingxue and the others, but she also wanted to lord over him...

Was this some ancestor come to visit?

This kind of person would only be a disaster if kept around. All Ye Chen wanted right now was for her to disappear from his sight.

"You!"

Shangguan Yanran was furious. She wanted to continue making a scene, but meeting Ye Chen's murderous gaze, fear suddenly gripped her heart...

She could feel Ye Chen's killing intent. Her body felt as if it had plunged into an ice cellar, trembling involuntarily!

The arrogant girl who usually threw her weight around was now cowed in front of Ye Chen—instantly she despised him all the more.

"Do you know who I am?"

"I'm Shangguan Yanran. My great-great-grandfather is the head of the sect's Supreme Elders!"

"You dare treat me like this? I'll have my great-great-grandfather kill you!"

Shangguan Yanran didn't leave directly. Instead, she invoked her backing, continuing to bluster at Ye Chen.

Precisely because she was the Grand Elder's descendant, she could run rampant in the sect without anyone daring to say a word.

But today she'd run into Ye Chen, who refused to humor her in the slightest.

This infuriated Shangguan Yanran—she wanted blood!

"Supreme Elder?"

A flicker of surprise crossed Ye Chen's face. He hadn't expected her to have such a powerful backer.

But he didn't cower or soften because of it.

So what if she was a Supreme Elder's descendant?

Trying to walk all over him? No way!

Not even if the Heavenly Emperor himself showed up!

"So what?"

"Others might humor you, but I won't."

Ye Chen snorted coldly. His patience had reached its limit.

At that moment, he released powerful pressure from his body, instantly enveloping Shangguan Yanran before him...

"You..."

*Pfft!*

Before Shangguan Yanran could finish her sentence, she spat out a mouthful of fresh blood...

She was at Mid Foundation Establishment cultivation. Before Ye Chen at Nascent Soul, she was nothing but an insignificant ant.

The pressure Ye Chen released could even crush her to death!

"Nascent Soul Stage!"

Shock flashed through Shangguan Yanran's eyes.

She hadn't expected a disciple with a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root like Ye Chen to be a Nascent Soul Stage powerhouse.

She'd never heard of such a prodigy in the sect before!

Beyond her shock, Shangguan Yanran felt even more fury!

So what if he was Nascent Soul?

Her great-great-grandfather was a Void Refining Stage power!

"Ye Chen, you dare bully me?"

"You're dead!"

Shangguan Yanran roared furiously.

She immediately gathered spiritual energy, amplifying her voice infinitely...

"Great-great-grandfather, save me!"

She cried out loudly.

The sound pierced through the courtyard, carrying far into the distance...

The next second, a powerful aura suddenly appeared!

A white-haired old man materialized in the courtyard...

With a wave of his hand, the pressure Ye Chen had released vanished.

"Great-great-grandfather, you're finally here..."

"Ye Chen bullied me!"

"Help me kill him..."

Seeing the old man, Shangguan Yanran instantly became like a wronged child, rushing over tearfully to complain.

*Slap!*

A resounding slap landed on Shangguan Yanran's face.

The courtyard fell instantly silent!

Everyone was stunned...

Ye Chen looked at the suddenly appeared old man with surprise, a flicker of unusual emotion crossing his heart.

Shangguan Yanran stood frozen in place. Her fair cheek rapidly swelled, now bearing a five-finger print!

She stared in disbelief at the old man who had always doted on her. She hadn't expected him to strike her. Her mind went blank...

It felt like she was dreaming!

She even forgot the pain and tears.

"Great-great-grandfather, why!"

Shangguan Yanran asked, not understanding.

Wasn't Ye Chen supposed to be the one getting hit? How had it become her?

The newcomer was none other than the head of the Blissful Union Sect's Supreme Elders—Grand Elder Shangguan Tianhong!

Before his appearance, he had already observed everything happening in the courtyard.

His expression was extremely unpleasant, mixed with a trace of regret!

Shangguan Tianhong ignored the wronged Shangguan Yanran and instead looked at Ye Chen before him, his gaze carrying a hint of apology.

"Ye Chen, this matter was my oversight. Please don't take it to heart."

"Yanran was spoiled from childhood—willful and headstrong. I had originally intended to give her an opportunity, but I didn't expect her to act so arrogantly."

"I hope you can forgive her on my account. Let what happened between you two end here. I'll take her away."

He didn't use his status as Supreme Elder to pressure Ye Chen. Instead, he lowered his stance.

He knew full well how important Ye Chen was. He was no longer just a sect disciple—he was the Blissful Union Sect's future!

If he left, the Blissful Union Sect would have no hope of ever returning to its peak!

The Grand Elder's feelings for the sect surpassed personal honor. In his heart, Ye Chen was more important than Shangguan Yanran!
