Early the next morning...

Ye Chen came alone to the sect's back mountain, where few disciples ever ventured.

When Liu Ruyan had undergone her tribulation before, she had specifically come here to avoid the Lightning Tribulation harming fellow sect disciples.

He arrived at a clearing.

All around was silent stillness...

Seeing no one in the vicinity, Ye Chen immediately gathered his spiritual energy and pointed at an ancient century-old tree before him...

"Six Paths... Heaven-Destroying Finger!"

A soft shout...

Spiritual energy surged around his body!

In an instant, the heavens and earth changed color as fierce winds arose!

In the void, a golden finger materialized.

Like the finger of an immortal reaching down from the clouds, it carried an overwhelming, disdainful pressure as it suddenly descended!

*Boom—*

A direct hit on the century-old tree!

It shattered to dust in an instant.

The earth trembled!

The entire mountain peak was shaking...

Dust and smoke billowed across the clearing, obscuring everything in sight.

Ye Chen stared dumbfounded at the leveled clearing before him, his face full of shock!

Not just that century-old tree, but all the surrounding vegetation had turned to ash under that single finger strike...

The air still retained the lingering pressure of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger!

"This power... it's too strong!"

His face showed an excited expression!

"As expected of an Earth-Grade martial technique—it's truly formidable!"

"This is just intermediate comprehension, and it's already this powerful. If I achieve perfect mastery, how terrifying would that be?"

Ye Chen murmured to himself, his heart filled with anticipation...

He wanted so desperately to become stronger!

After a long while, the dust and smoke gradually dispersed.

The next second, a figure rapidly swept over from the distance, appearing at the clearing in the blink of an eye...

Liu Ruyan stared in shock at the leveled grove before her, then whipped her head around to look at Ye Chen, her expression bewildered...

"You..."

"You actually mastered it?"

Liu Ruyan's voice trembled slightly as she asked in disbelief.

She had felt the pressure of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger—it had undoubtedly been Ye Chen's doing.

Meeting Liu Ruyan's gaze, Ye Chen nodded frankly.

"Yes!"

"But I've only learned a bit of the basics. I haven't fully mastered it yet!"

Hearing Ye Chen say this, the way Liu Ruyan looked at him completely changed...

As if she were looking at a monster!

Fewer than five people in the entire sect had comprehended this martial technique, and most were still at the beginner level.

Liu Ruyan was among them. Back when she had exceptional talent, it had still taken her several months to grasp this finger technique.

And after decades of practice, she had only achieved minor success!

Ye Chen had taken just one night to comprehend the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger—and had even reached her level!

Liu Ruyan was deeply shaken!

This kid was too terrifying...

What other secrets was he hiding?

Could he be a natural-born cultivation prodigy?

Liu Ruyan stared intently at Ye Chen, as if trying to see through him completely.

"Sect Master, why are you looking at me like that?"

Ye Chen awkwardly touched his nose and asked hesitantly.

"Heh!"

Liu Ruyan rolled her eyes at him and pouted.

"Embarrassed about what?"

"Is there anything on you I haven't seen?"

This brat had bullied her thoroughly, and now he was acting shy?

He hadn't been this bashful when asking her if she submitted...

Ye Chen's expression froze for a moment, but then his gaze immediately became bolder, openly looking her over...

"Where are you looking, you brat!"

Liu Ruyan's face flushed as she gritted her teeth and snapped.

"It's not like I haven't seen it before..."

Ye Chen spread his hands innocently, muttering under his breath.

Liu Ruyan: ???

"What did you say!"

Liu Ruyan's face turned crimson, flustered with embarrassment.

This wasn't her private chambers—if someone overheard those words, how could she ever face the sect disciples again?

She was the Sect Master, after all. Didn't she deserve some dignity?

Meeting Liu Ruyan's murderous gaze, Ye Chen hastily waved his hands.

"Nothing!"

"Hmph!"

Liu Ruyan snorted coldly, deciding not to argue with him.

Looking back at the grove that had been flattened by a single finger, she was filled with curiosity about Ye Chen's comprehension abilities!

Was this kid's innate understanding really that high?

If given more time, could he fully master the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger?

Though this was an Earth-Grade martial technique, its power at minor success was already comparable to a lower Heaven-Grade technique.

If cultivated to great completion, it might even match mid or even upper Heaven-Grade martial techniques.

Liu Ruyan had always been working on her comprehension, but unfortunately had made no progress all these years.

Ye Chen achieving minor success in just one night had undoubtedly given Liu Ruyan hope!

If Ye Chen fully mastered the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger, he could share his experiential insights with her...

A technique comparable to Heaven-Grade would greatly enhance Liu Ruyan's strength.

At this thought, Liu Ruyan immediately had an idea. She turned her head toward Ye Chen, her eyes full of anticipation.

"Ye Chen, I want..."

"This doesn't seem like an appropriate place, does it?"

Ye Chen looked around, his expression hesitant.

"What... not appropriate?"

Liu Ruyan was puzzled.

"It's secluded and quiet here. How is it not appropriate?"

"Well..."

"Alright then!"

Seeing Liu Ruyan's insistence, Ye Chen reluctantly nodded in agreement.

"The atmosphere here isn't bad..."

"It's just easy to be seen..."

Ye Chen said as he began to move.

"What does being seen matter?"

Liu Ruyan was still confused when her gaze fell on Ye Chen. Her eyes suddenly went wide!

"Wait—we're comprehending a martial technique. Why are you taking off your clothes?"

"Put them on! Put them back on right now!"

"You scoundrel!"

Liu Ruyan shouted, her face flushed red.

She had almost thought Ye Chen had comprehended the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger through some unique method...

Recalling their earlier conversation, she finally realized she had misunderstood!

This bastard—was he trying to take advantage of her again?

But not here!

Liu Ruyan was terrified someone might see this scene, which would completely ruin her reputation.

"Tsk, and here I thought the Sect Master had come around..."

Ye Chen clicked his tongue in disappointment, putting the clothes he had just loosened back on.

"What's going on in that head of yours?"

Liu Ruyan glared at him huffily.

"I was thinking about comprehending the martial technique!"

"Wasn't that it?"

Ye Chen said with a completely straight face.

"Who comprehends martial techniques by taking off their clothes?"

"Taking off clothes helps with comprehension..."

"......"

Liu Ruyan rolled her eyes, not believing a single word Ye Chen said.

She was certain he just wanted to take advantage of her...

Did this kid even know how to blush when lying?

Ye Chen spread his hands innocently. He wasn't lying!

All his comprehension had been gained undressed in bed—didn't that count as comprehension?

"Come on, come back with me!"

With Ye Chen's interruption, Liu Ruyan had lost any desire to contemplate martial arts in the grove.

Better to avoid this kid doing something strange that might send her into qi deviation.

"Sect Master, are we going back to your place?"

Ye Chen raised an eyebrow, a glint of anticipation in his eyes.

"Get lost!!!"

Liu Ruyan stormed off furiously.
