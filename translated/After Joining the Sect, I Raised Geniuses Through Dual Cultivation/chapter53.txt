Liu Ruyan seemed surprised by how strong Ye Chen's reaction was. Her beautiful eyes shifted as she gave him a strange look.

"Don't act like you're suffering when you're actually benefiting!"

"The female disciples selected this time all have excellent talent, heavenly beauty, and alluring figures."

She paused, seeming to see through Ye Chen's concerns, and explained in a gentle tone.

"This concerns the sect's survival. The Grand Elder and I had no other choice but to resort to this!"

"I promise I won't force you to do these things in the future!"

Liu Ruyan's gaze was resolute as she made this promise to Ye Chen.

Hearing Liu Ruyan say this, Ye Chen's expression softened considerably. Knowing that improving the disciples' strength was urgent, he reluctantly nodded in agreement.

"Since the Sect Master says so, I'll help."

"However... I can't guarantee that one month will be enough to elevate all one hundred disciples to Golden Core."

"That still depends on each individual's talent!"

One month was already very tight, and with so many female disciples...

Even if Ye Chen worked three shifts a day, each female disciple would only get one chance to dual cultivate.

This was an enormous challenge for Ye Chen as well.

A smile appeared on Liu Ruyan's face. She seemed to have great confidence in Ye Chen.

"Don't worry. I believe in your abilities..."

"Unless... you're afraid you can't handle it?"

Liu Ruyan looked at Ye Chen playfully, raising an eyebrow...

As if deliberately teasing him!

Ye Chen: ???

Hearing this, Ye Chen was instantly displeased.

Saying who can't handle it?

Way too condescending!

"Of course I can handle it!"

Ye Chen declared confidently.

It was just one hundred female disciples. Who's afraid of who?

He'd go all out against them if he had to...

"Hehehe..."

Seeing this, Liu Ruyan couldn't help but cover her mouth and giggle, her smile like a blooming flower, utterly captivating...

Ye Chen looked up at her. His gaze couldn't help but linger, a fire igniting in his heart.

Thinking about what would happen to this peerless beauty if the Blissful Union Sect fell to the three major forces—she would surely meet a tragic fate, likely becoming some powerful cultivator's plaything...

A reluctance welled up in his heart!

The Blissful Union Sect had to hold!

"Sect Master, improving the disciples' strength is certainly one approach, but it's far from enough to contend with the three major forces..."

Ye Chen spoke up.

Liu Ruyan paused, her gaze falling on him. Her brow arched with curiosity.

"Do you have any better ideas?"

Meeting Liu Ruyan's gaze, Ye Chen spoke with complete seriousness.

"The biggest gap between the sect and the three major forces is the lack of top-tier combat power!"

"The sect has too few Void Refining experts and cannot contend with the combined experts of the three forces."

"I believe we should focus on quickly improving the sect's top-tier experts..."

The outcome of battles between sects wasn't determined by the most numerous disciples, but by the sects' top-tier experts.

In this kind of fight, having a few more Void Refining experts could decide victory or defeat!

Hearing Ye Chen say this, Liu Ruyan nodded in agreement, a hint of worry crossing her brow. She sighed helplessly.

"How could I not want that?"

"But the sect has very few disciples and elders at Golden Core or Nascent Soul, and even fewer at Soul Transformation."

"The higher the realm, the harder it is to break through."

"Gaining one more Void Refining expert isn't that easy..."

"Besides, even one more Void Refining expert wouldn't be enough to turn the tide..."

Liu Ruyan herself had been stuck at Peak Soul Transformation for many years, unable to break through until she met Ye Chen and finally took that step...

Having experienced it herself, she knew how difficult it was to break through from Soul Transformation to Void Refining. She didn't dare harbor such hopes.

Moreover, with the three major forces combined, they outnumbered the Blissful Union Sect by several Void Refining experts. One or two more wouldn't be enough to close the gap.

Ye Chen seemed to have anticipated this. He wasn't surprised. His gaze turned suggestive as he looked at Liu Ruyan and spoke earnestly.

"What I mean... isn't elevating Soul Transformation experts to Void Refining, but elevating Void Refining experts to Body Integration!"

Only by surpassing the Void Refining realm and being a full major realm above their opponents could they truly turn the tide!

Peak Void Refining and Body Integration might seem like just one minor realm apart, but the difference in power was immense.

A single Body Integration expert could match several Peak Void Refining cultivators. Against Early Void Refining opponents, they could handle over a dozen...

"Body Integration?"

Liu Ruyan's expression froze in surprise.

"How is that possible..."

"Body Integration isn't as easy as you think..."

She looked up, and inadvertently met Ye Chen's suggestive gaze. She suddenly froze...

"You little... don't tell me you're thinking..."

A blush crept across Liu Ruyan's face...

"Sect Master, for the sect, this disciple is willing to make sacrifices..."

Ye Chen said with utmost sincerity.

As if he were nobly devoting himself to the sect...

Liu Ruyan: ???

She instantly understood Ye Chen's meaning. Her face turned crimson, and she couldn't help shooting him a reproachful look.

"Get out of here!!!"

This brat was trying to take advantage of her again...

What sacrifice for the sect? He just wanted to sleep with her!

Liu Ruyan saw right through Ye Chen's little scheme.

But she couldn't help thinking—if she really broke through to Body Integration first, she could protect the Blissful Union Sect.

Even if the three major forces joined hands, she would have the confidence to handle them...

This brat's suggestion was actually quite good, but...

How many times would she need to sleep with him before she could break through to Body Integration?

"Sect Master is wise. I truly am thinking of the sect..."

"If the Sect Master is unwilling, just pretend I never said anything..."

"This disciple will take his leave..."

Ye Chen said with feigned indifference, turning to leave...

"Wait..."

Liu Ruyan hurriedly called out to him.

"I didn't say I was unwilling..."

"For the sect, I... can also make some sacrifices..."

Liu Ruyan bit her lip, her face flushed with embarrassment.

A triumphant smile flickered across Ye Chen's face, vanishing in an instant. The next moment he composed himself, turning back to face Liu Ruyan seriously.

"Sect Master, then let's... go inside!"

"It's late, and time is precious..."

Liu Ruyan's face grew even redder. She shot Ye Chen a shy, reproachful look and walked toward the side chamber with embarrassment...

The two entered the side chamber one after the other.

The door closed, and the candles inside flickered...
