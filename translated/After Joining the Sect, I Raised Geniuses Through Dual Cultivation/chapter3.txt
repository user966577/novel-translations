Rewards received while dreaming!

It was already past noon...

Ye Chen only woke when he heard someone calling his name.

"Senior Brother Ye..."

"The Sect Master sent someone. She wants you to go see her!"

Lin Qingxue sat at the bedside, her face flushed as she gently shook Ye Chen's arm.

"The Sect Master wants me?"

Ye Chen rubbed his bleary eyes, his head still foggy as he failed to process the situation.

Why did Liu Ruyan want him?

Could she be checking on his progress?

But they'd only had the wedding night last night. It would take ten months to produce an offspring—how could there be results so quickly?

She couldn't be doubting his abilities, could she?

As Ye Chen got out of bed, Lin Qingxue acted like a devoted wife, helping him get dressed.

The fragrance wafting to his nose made Ye Chen's heart burn with desire once more...

What a temptress!

He'd have to properly pamper her when he returned tonight...

Sensing Ye Chen's heated gaze, Lin Qingxue lowered her head shyly, not daring to speak.

After washing up and eating a quick meal, Ye Chen hurried off to find Liu Ruyan.

Just as he was about to leave the courtyard, he noticed two disciples standing guard outside the gate.

Upon inquiry, he learned they'd been assigned by Liu Ruyan the previous night to protect him!

"Protect" was the official reason, but in reality, it was also a form of confinement—mainly to prevent others in the sect from discovering the secret.

Although this would attract curiosity from various factions, it was still better than having Ye Chen kidnapped.

Ye Chen didn't mind. From the moment he'd decided to tell Liu Ruyan his secret, he'd prepared for this.

He was still too weak, and there were many enemies outside the sect who wanted him dead. Having the sect's "protection" was something he actually welcomed.

Soon, Ye Chen arrived at Liu Ruyan's great hall.

"This disciple greets the Sect Master!"

Ye Chen spoke respectfully.

"You worked hard last night, didn't you?"

"Sleeping until just now..."

Liu Ruyan walked over in a flowing white dress, her proud peaks bouncing slightly. Her gaze fell on Ye Chen as she spoke with a peculiar expression.

Toiling all night—this kid had some skills!

Ye Chen awkwardly rubbed his nose. "It was quite tiring..."

"All for the sect!"

Liu Ruyan rolled her eyes at him.

For the sect? He was the one who enjoyed it!

Was this brat taking advantage and then acting smug about it?

"Don't give me that nonsense."

"I want to know—how did things go?"

Liu Ruyan was more concerned about the offspring situation.

Since this was the kid's special talent, he should at least know whether it had worked or not, right?

Though she knew she was being impatient, Liu Ruyan couldn't help it.

This concerned whether she could maintain her position as Hehuan Sect's Sect Master and whether she could prevent the sect from being devoured by external enemies.

She couldn't allow any mistakes!

"Rest assured, Sect Master. Everything went smoothly!"

Ye Chen looked at Liu Ruyan, his expression serious.

He'd labored all night—of course he'd hit the target on the first try!

Hearing this, Liu Ruyan finally relaxed.

"I'll arrange more female disciples with good aptitude for you..."

"I hope you won't disappoint my expectations!"

Liu Ruyan said offhandedly.

Since she'd chosen to believe in Ye Chen's talent, she planned to try with more subjects.

After all, ten months for one pregnancy was too long. She naturally hoped for more output!

Of course, Liu Ruyan was also worried that Ye Chen might be deceiving her, so she didn't go all-in immediately to avoid having Ye Chen milk the entire sect's female disciples for nothing...

"Female disciples..."

Ye Chen's heart leaped with joy.

"Thank you, Sect Master!"

"Rest assured, Sect Master. This disciple definitely won't let your efforts be in vain!"

Though Liu Ruyan hadn't specified how many female disciples she'd arrange, at least he'd have several more offspring in ten months...

Without delay, Ye Chen extracted more Spirit Stones from Liu Ruyan as "operating expenses" before hurrying back to his courtyard.

Just as he entered the courtyard, he noticed the adjacent wing that had been vacant was now cleaned out and decorated festively.

Even Lin Qingxue, despite her physical discomfort, was helping out...

Ye Chen knew this was Liu Ruyan's arrangement and wasn't surprised. He walked straight into the wing.

A pure, lovely female disciple sat shyly on the edge of the bed.

She wore a red, sheer, off-shoulder dress. Her snow-white skin swayed before his eyes, adding an air of allure.

A fragrance permeated the room, making one feel weak all over.

"Senior Brother Ye..."

When Lin Qingxue saw Ye Chen return, she became flustered and immediately headed for the door.

"Qingxue!"

Ye Chen called out to her.

Lin Qingxue didn't respond. Face burning, she quickened her pace.

As she left the room, she considerately closed the door behind her.

Ye Chen shook his head with a smile at this.

Turning to look at the enchanting female disciple on the bed, he was about to ask if she wanted to eat something first.

He'd only had one meal all day.

"Senior Brother Ye, I... I'll take good care of you!"

Lu Mengyao looked at Ye Chen with a flushed face, her voice soft and sweet.

As she spoke, she began untying the silk sash on her dress...

Her forwardness was completely at odds with her innocent appearance.

The words died on Ye Chen's tongue.

Hungry?

Then eat!

Without another word, Ye Chen strode forward...

Lu Mengyao reached out to pull Ye Chen toward her, deftly drawing him onto the bed.

Just as he was about to proceed, Ye Chen paused.

"Senior Brother, what's wrong?"

Lu Mengyao asked, puzzled.

Was she not alluring enough?

She'd specifically worn this sheer red dress that left little to the imagination. There was no way Ye Chen could resist!

But Ye Chen stood up, looking at her with a grin.

"I like to parallel park..."

Lu Mengyao: ???

"Ahh!!!"

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one year of cultivation as a reward!]

Hearing the notification chime in his mind, Ye Chen understood!

Just as he'd suspected!

This gave him tremendous motivation...

In the adjacent wing...

Lin Qingxue listened to the sounds coming through the wall, her face burning. She sat on the bed, unable to settle down.

She wasn't required to serve Ye Chen tonight, yet somehow, she felt restless.

After last night's intimate encounter, Lin Qingxue had actually grown fond of being with Ye Chen.

The sensation was intoxicating, utterly addictive.

Lin Qingxue tried to use cultivation to distract herself from thoughts of Ye Chen.

The moment she circulated her technique, a crisp sound came from her dantian!

*Crack!*

The next second, spiritual energy surged through her body as her aura strengthened dramatically, like a sudden gale sweeping through!

"Mid Foundation Establishment!"

"I... I actually broke through!"

Lin Qingxue's jaw dropped, her mind going blank.

She'd only just succeeded at Foundation Establishment recently. With her talent, she would need years of arduous cultivation before she could possibly break through to Mid Foundation Establishment.

"What's going on?"

Lin Qingxue struggled to recall recent events, then suddenly froze!

"Could it be because of Senior Brother Ye?"

Remembering last night's wild passion, Lin Qingxue's face flushed crimson with embarrassment.

She suspected her breakthrough might be related to sleeping with Ye Chen!

But she hadn't even used the Hehuan Sect's dual cultivation secret art during their union. How could she have absorbed his cultivation?

Lin Qingxue couldn't figure it out. She raised her head to look at the wall separating her room from the adjacent wing, murmuring with rosy cheeks.

"I suppose the only way to find out is to ask Junior Sister Lu!"
