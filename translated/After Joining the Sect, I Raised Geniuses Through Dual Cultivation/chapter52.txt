In a great hall...

Liu Ruyan was dressed in formal attire for once, looking dignified and solemn, every bit the majestic Sect Master.

Outside, the sky was pitch black.

The candlelight in the hall flickered gently, illuminating the entire chamber.

A cold breeze blew in, making the flames dance.

The next moment, a figure strode into the great hall, casually closing the doors behind him...

Seeing that only he and Liu Ruyan were in the hall, Ye Chen immediately felt as if he were in his own home. He walked straight toward the side chamber...

Liu Ruyan was stunned for two seconds, her expression puzzled.

"Where are you going?"

Ye Chen stopped, glanced back at Liu Ruyan, and spoke while undoing his belt.

"Hurry up..."

"We're short on time and there's a lot to do."

"I still need to get back early tonight..."

Liu Ruyan: ???

"Hurry up with what?"

Hearing this, Liu Ruyan was completely baffled.

The moment she understood, the way she looked at Ye Chen completely changed...

"Stop right there!"

"I called you here to discuss business, not to go to bed!!!"

Liu Ruyan spoke through gritted teeth, her eyes nearly popping out of her head.

Her face flushed red with anger!

Had this brat gotten used to it?

Coming here just to dual cultivate—what did he take her for?

"Oh..."

Ye Chen nodded hesitantly.

"What business? Can't we discuss it in bed?"

"You little..."

Liu Ruyan fixed him with a look that could kill, a blush spreading across her cheeks.

"Get over here!"

"Otherwise..."

Ye Chen could tell Liu Ruyan's mood wasn't quite right. He obediently walked over.

"Sect Master, is there something urgent you need to discuss?"

He asked with a serious expression.

Though Ye Chen had already guessed what it was about, he still acted clueless.

After all, it was his clone that had left the sect. He, having stayed in the small courtyard behind closed doors, couldn't possibly know what had happened outside.

Liu Ruyan looked at Ye Chen before her, a hint of worry in her brow. After a moment's pause, she spoke.

"Ye Chen, the sect is in trouble this time!"

Hearing this, Ye Chen feigned surprise. "Sect Master, what happened?"

Liu Ruyan didn't hide anything and explained directly.

"The Heavenly Demon Sect, Thousand Feather Sect, and Spirit Water Sect—these three major factions are planning to jointly attack the Blissful Union Sect!"

"If it were one-on-one, our Blissful Union Sect wouldn't fear any of them."

"But if the three sects join forces, the Blissful Union Sect may not be able to hold..."

She had received the news from the Supreme Elders that afternoon. After lengthy discussions, their only option was to fight head-on.

Liu Ruyan was deeply worried about this and had called Ye Chen to discuss solutions.

Ye Chen immediately showed understanding, looking at Liu Ruyan before him with a serious expression.

"As long as the sect and the Sect Master need me, this disciple will go through fire and water without hesitation!"

His tone was resolute.

Though if the sect really couldn't hold, Ye Chen would definitely slip away...

He couldn't just wait in the sect to die, could he?

He hadn't lived enough yet!

Liu Ruyan's expression brightened, a smile appearing on her face.

"The sect does need your help, though it doesn't require going through fire and water..."

Ye Chen tensed, meeting Liu Ruyan's beaming gaze. He immediately sensed something was off...

This woman definitely wasn't planning anything good.

"Sect Master... just say whatever's on your mind!"

"With our relationship, there's no need to be coy..."

"What don't I already know about you?"

They had long been intimate. They could speak plainly.

Hearing this, a blush crept across Liu Ruyan's pretty face. She couldn't help but shoot Ye Chen a reproachful look.

"Is that how you speak to me?"

"I'm still the Sect Master, you know..."

This brat showed her no respect at all!

Ye Chen looked at the pouting Liu Ruyan before him and shook his head with a wry smile.

"Fine, fine, you're the Sect Master. You're the biggest. Happy now?"

He thought to himself that in the entire sect, Liu Ruyan was indeed the biggest...

"That's more like it!"

Liu Ruyan nodded with satisfaction. Only then did she compose herself, looking at Ye Chen seriously and examining him before speaking solemnly.

"To counter the three major forces, I've discussed matters with the Grand Elder. We've decided to select one hundred female disciples with exceptional talent from the inner disciples and assign them to you to... cultivate!"

"I hope you won't disappoint me and the Grand Elder. Try to elevate all one hundred disciples to the Golden Core realm within one month!"

Ye Chen: ???

"Me?"

Ye Chen was clearly stunned, looking at Liu Ruyan before him in bewilderment, pointing uncertainly at himself...

"Sect Master, you're not joking, are you?"

"Me, cultivate disciples?"

"I'm still a disciple myself..."

He wasn't some Void Refining powerhouse, nor did he have any teaching experience. Having him cultivate disciples was surely overestimating him.

Moreover, elevating one hundred Foundation Establishment disciples to Golden Core within a month—what kind of genius aptitude would that require?

This was simply an impossible task!

He was starting to suspect Liu Ruyan and the Grand Elder had gone mad from desperation, letting an inexperienced disciple like him cultivate the elite disciples.

Weren't they afraid he'd ruin everyone?

Liu Ruyan nodded at Ye Chen, speaking meaningfully.

"Of course I'm not joking!"

"This is something only you can accomplish."

"You need to have confidence in yourself."

Meeting Liu Ruyan's gaze, Ye Chen's expression froze. As if realizing something, his face changed dramatically!

"You... you don't mean..."

"For me to... dual cultivate with those one hundred female disciples?"

That was the only method he could think of.

Liu Ruyan and the Grand Elder had chosen him to cultivate female disciples surely because they valued his dual cultivation talent!

"Exactly!"

Liu Ruyan nodded with a smile.

"For the sect, push yourself a little, work a bit harder!"

"If you have any requests, feel free to ask. The sect will try to satisfy them!"

"Don't worry, the sect will be responsible for nourishing your body every day..."

Ye Chen: ???

"What the hell!"

"What do you take me for?"

"A donkey?"

Ye Chen was furious!!!

His worst fear had come to pass...

While he wanted to grow stronger, he preferred a gradual approach where he remained in control, not being confined and drained frantically.

Such unrestrained cultivation would easily deplete his body, or worse, leave him completely sucked dry.

Though only one hundred female disciples had been arranged for now, what if in the future it became three hundred, five hundred, or even a thousand? What would he do then?
