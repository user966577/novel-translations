The Blissful Union Sect.

In a small courtyard...

Inside an empty room, a black vortex suddenly appeared...

The next second, Ye Chen stepped out of the vortex.

Looking at the familiar surroundings, Ye Chen let out a long breath of relief, a faint smile on his face.

In just a few hours of coming and going, he had already avenged the Ye family's blood feud and settled a matter that had weighed on his heart.

"The Zhang family is dead. Next up is the Profound Heaven Holy Land!"

"I, Ye Chen, will personally collect this blood debt!"

Ye Chen murmured coldly to himself.

He hadn't forgotten that his sister Ye Qing'er was still in the Profound Heaven Holy Land, and he had no idea whether she was dead or alive.

But with his current strength, he had no way to contend with the Profound Heaven Holy Land.

"Qing'er, wait for your brother!"

"Brother will definitely come rescue you!"

Ye Chen steeled his resolve—he had to become stronger as quickly as possible!

Only with absolute strength could he possibly get his revenge and save his sister Ye Qing'er.

Just then, voices of conversation drifted in from the courtyard outside...

"Lin-mei, have you seen Senior Brother?"

Su Nianwan asked.

"No..."

"Didn't Senior Brother spend last night in Su-jiejie's room?"

Lin Qingxue replied, puzzled.

"Strange..."

Su Nianwan shook her head and explained with a confused expression.

"When I woke up this morning, Senior Brother was already gone."

"I don't know when he left."

"I thought Senior Brother had gone to find you or Mengyao-mei..."

Usually, Ye Chen slept until the sun was high in the sky. If Lin Qingxue and the others didn't wake him, he might even sleep until afternoon.

But this time was so unusual—waking up before dawn and vanishing without a trace.

At first, Su Nianwan thought Ye Chen had sneaked off to find Lin Qingxue or Lu Mengyao, wanting to spread his attention equally. But he wasn't with them either.

Su Nianwan couldn't help but worry. Could he have encountered some danger?

"Where could Senior Brother have gone?"

She anxiously prepared to go look for him.

"Su-jiejie, don't worry. Senior Brother will definitely be fine."

"Isn't it possible that Senior Brother went to find the Sect Master?"

Lu Mengyao raised an eyebrow suggestively.

They knew Ye Chen too well!

If he wasn't in one of their three rooms, then he must have gone to fool around with Liu Ruyan...

Su Nianwan's expression froze as she hesitated.

"To find the Sect Master?"

"Is Senior Brother... still not satisfied?"

She fell into thought...

Could Ye Chen's body really handle all this?

Wasn't he afraid of exhausting himself to death?

Su Nianwan relaxed a bit. If Ye Chen really was with Liu Ruyan, then she didn't need to worry.

Inside the room...

Ye Chen listened to the three women's conversation outside and couldn't help but laugh bitterly.

Was he really that beastly in their eyes?

Waking up just to go find another woman?

His body wasn't made of iron!

If not for his revenge, he wouldn't have gotten up so early...

*Creak...*

The door opened...

Ye Chen walked out of the room, looking at the three women in the courtyard. He deliberately put on a stern face.

"So, you three are talking about me behind my back?"

"Caught you!"

Lin Qingxue and the others turned toward Ye Chen. Their faces flushed, secretly relieved they hadn't said anything too suggestive—otherwise, how embarrassing it would be if Ye Chen heard!

At the same time, they were surprised.

"Senior Brother!"

"How... how are you in this room?"

All three looked curiously at the room behind Ye Chen, wondering why he had come out of an empty room.

Could he have hidden someone in there?

A new female disciple?

Wasn't sleeping with Su Nianwan enough?

Meeting the three women's puzzled gazes, Ye Chen touched his forehead and made an excuse.

"My cultivation happened to reach a bottleneck. I was afraid of disturbing Nianwan, so I came here to cultivate!"

He wasn't entirely lying—his cultivation had indeed reached a bottleneck, and he had broken through!

Hearing Ye Chen's explanation, Lin Qingxue and the others finally noticed the change in his cultivation...

*Hiss!*

"Senior Brother, you... you've broken through to Mid Nascent Soul?"

"Such fast cultivation speed!"

"Senior Brother, you're really amazing..."

The three women spoke with shock.

Back when Ye Chen's realm had been lower than theirs, now he had left them far behind...

If not for their pregnancies delaying them, perhaps all three of them would have already entered Nascent Soul by now.

At this moment, their hearts were filled with longing to become stronger...

"As long as you work a little harder, you'll all improve quickly too..."

Ye Chen looked at the three of them meaningfully and spoke with a grin.

The three women blushed instantly, becoming bashful...

They all understood the implication of Ye Chen's words.

Indeed, if they were proactive enough, they could quickly increase their cultivation...

*Yawn...*

Ye Chen yawned, suddenly feeling drowsy.

He hadn't slept much last night, and had woken before dawn to use the Teleportation Talisman to return to the Zhang family estate for his rampage...

After a busy morning, now that he was back in the courtyard and had relaxed, a wave of exhaustion washed over him.

"I'm a bit tired..."

"Does anyone want to take a nap?"

Ye Chen looked at the three women before him, raising an eyebrow suggestively...

"Senior Brother, I'll pass..."

Su Nianwan quickly waved her hands—she couldn't take any more.

Lin Qingxue's face reddened as she shook her head hesitantly. "Senior Brother, I... I'll go prepare some food."

It was broad daylight—she was a bit embarrassed...

Ye Chen's gaze fell on Lu Mengyao...

"Mengyao, what about you?"

Meeting Ye Chen's gaze, Lu Mengyao nodded with a blush.

"Senior Brother, I... I'm actually a bit tired too..."

"How about... we sleep a little more!"

She had seen Ye Chen break through to Mid Nascent Soul and immediately developed the desire to improve.

She also wanted to advance her cultivation so she wouldn't fall too far behind. Being too insignificant, she would only become a burden to Senior Brother in the future...

She wanted to stay by Ye Chen's side for the rest of her life, which meant she had to become strong!

"Let's go..."

Ye Chen and Lu Mengyao exchanged a glance, then walked hand in hand toward the room...

Their steps were light, their hearts full of joy.

Lin Qingxue and Su Nianwan's faces flushed as they hurried away, fleeing the courtyard...

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one year of cultivation as a reward!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Thunder Burst Talisman!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Clone Talisman! (Infuse with spiritual energy to activate, creating one clone of the Host with half the Host's cultivation, controlled by the Host's will!)]*

Two hours later...

Ye Chen looked at the Thunder Burst Talisman and Clone Talisman in his hands with delight...

The losses from his rampage at the Zhang family had been largely replenished.

Though he was short a few Teleportation Talismans, Ye Chen was already quite satisfied.

As long as he worked a bit harder, they would soon be replenished...

Lu Mengyao's drop rate was a bit low, but there was still hope!

If all else failed, he could always go find Liu Ruyan...
