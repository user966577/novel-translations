In a disciples' residence at the Blissful Union Sect...

Su Nianwan finished packing her belongings. With one last, lingering look at the room she'd lived in for so many years, she turned and walked out.

Several personal disciples who shared the residence had come to see her off...

"You were doing just fine here. Why the sudden move?" An older female disciple spoke reluctantly, hoping to convince her to stay.

"Nianwan, once you're gone, there'll be no one to practice sword forms with me..." Another beautiful female disciple said with reluctance.

"Sister Nianwan, I'll miss you!" A younger female disciple tugged at Su Nianwan's sleeve.

They were all reluctant to see Su Nianwan leave, but no one dared disobey Sect Master Liu Ruyan's orders.

At the same time, they couldn't understand why Liu Ruyan would do this!

Could she be secretly grooming Su Nianwan?

Given her cultivation talent, it was certainly possible...

"I may be moving, but I'll still be in the sect."

"Don't worry, I'll come back to visit often..."

Su Nianwan smiled at her close friends.

Though she was reluctant to leave everyone, she also looked forward to living with Ye Chen.

After last night's in-depth exchange, Su Nianwan's mind was now filled with Ye Chen's image—all she could think about was him.

She'd been completely conquered by Ye Chen!

Especially when she woke up early this morning and broke through to Golden Core, she felt an unprecedented joy...

This feeling was intoxicating!

So dual cultivation was such a happy thing.

Having packed her bags, Su Nianwan couldn't wait to return to the small courtyard, throw herself into Ye Chen's arms, and live a shameless life...

"Sister Nianwan, come back and visit us!"

Su Nianwan waved goodbye to the female disciples and turned to leave the residence.

She hadn't gone far when she sensed something was wrong...

Someone seemed to be following her!

A close friend who couldn't bear to see her go?

Su Nianwan turned back with a puzzled look...

"Vice Sect Master?"

"What are you... doing here?"

Su Nianwan looked at Jiang Yuyan, who had suddenly appeared behind her, a flash of surprise crossing her face.

Jiang Yuyan's residence wasn't anywhere near here—quite a long distance away, in fact.

Jiang Yuyan didn't bother concealing her purpose, walking straight up to Su Nianwan, her expression calm as she regarded her.

"This Seat came specifically to find you!"

"To find me?"

"What does the Vice Sect Master want with this disciple?"

Su Nianwan felt strange. She and Jiang Yuyan rarely had any contact—why would she suddenly come looking for her?

After all, she was Sect Master Liu Ruyan's personal disciple, and her faction had always been at odds with Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan's.

"I hear Liu... the Sect Master has had you live together with a disciple named Ye Chen?"

"Do you know why?"

Jiang Yuyan stared directly at Su Nianwan, hoping to get answers from her.

"This disciple doesn't know!"

Su Nianwan shook her head.

Even if she knew, she couldn't possibly tell Jiang Yuyan.

Before she'd gone to Ye Chen's courtyard, Liu Ruyan had already instructed her that this matter must not be mentioned to anyone—especially not Jiang Yuyan!

The person Liu Ruyan most wanted to guard against was Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan.

As a personal disciple, Su Nianwan naturally wouldn't be foolish enough to leak information.

"You truly don't know?"

Jiang Yuyan's expression darkened, her gaze turning cold as she stared at her.

"This disciple dares not deceive the Vice Sect Master."

Su Nianwan answered earnestly.

"Who else is in that small courtyard?"

"What has happened these past few days?"

Jiang Yuyan still wouldn't give up, pressing for answers.

"This... disciple cannot say."

Su Nianwan shook her head again.

This secret was one she absolutely could not reveal to Jiang Yuyan.

Seeing this, Jiang Yuyan's face turned ashen as she glared at Su Nianwan, looking as though she wanted to devour her whole!

She wasn't giving her, the Vice Sect Master, any face at all...

This infuriated Jiang Yuyan!

Suddenly, she noticed something amiss...

"Early Golden Core..."

"This Seat remembers you only broke through to Peak Foundation Establishment a few months ago!"

"You've already reached Golden Core?"

Jiang Yuyan examined Su Nianwan with surprise, finding it hard to believe.

This cultivation speed was considerably faster than her own breakthrough to Golden Core had been.

She possessed a Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root—her cultivation talent was even higher than Su Nianwan's Earth-Grade. Yet her cultivation had advanced more slowly than the other's.

This undoubtedly spoke volumes!

Jiang Yuyan connected this with Liu Ruyan's recent peculiar behavior, becoming even more certain that the small courtyard held some unspeakable secret!

Perhaps it was a method Liu Ruyan planned to use against her?

She had to uncover this secret...

"Very well, even you dare hide things from This Seat?"

"You truly think This Seat won't do anything to you?"

Jiang Yuyan snorted coldly and suddenly made her move, grabbing Su Nianwan by the throat before she could even resist...

The next second, Jiang Yuyan seized Su Nianwan and swiftly departed, their figures quickly vanishing from sight.

In the small courtyard...

Ye Chen waited and waited, but Su Nianwan never returned. Unease began to grow in his heart.

How could packing belongings possibly take this long?

But within the sect, surely she couldn't have encountered any danger?

"Why has Nianwan been gone so long without coming back?"

Ye Chen muttered restlessly.

"Senior Brother, don't worry."

"Sister Su is probably saying goodbye to the fellow disciples she lived with, which is taking a while..."

"She should be back soon."

Lin Qingxue spoke up to comfort him.

When she and Lu Mengyao had gone back to pack their things, they too had spent quite a while saying farewell to the close friends they'd lived with.

She assumed Su Nianwan was the same.

Hearing this, Ye Chen nodded thoughtfully, accepting the explanation.

"Perhaps that's it..."

Yet unease still lingered in his heart, though he couldn't pinpoint what felt wrong...

Lin Qingxue noticed Ye Chen's worry. She moved closer, taking his arm and shaking it gently to soothe him.

Getting too close, her body pressed against him—her 36Ds rubbing back and forth against Ye Chen's arm...

"Senior Brother, don't worry..."

"Sister Su will be back!"

Ye Chen felt the soft sensation. His mind went blank, his body growing hot...

His heart found a moment's peace!

He turned to look at Lin Qingxue, so close beside him, desire glinting in his eyes!

Like a fierce wolf about to devour this little lamb in one bite...

Meeting Ye Chen's burning gaze, Lin Qingxue's face flushed red. She instantly realized something was wrong and hastily stepped back...

"Sen... Senior Brother, it's still early in the day."

One look from him and she knew exactly what Ye Chen was thinking.

Yesterday he'd worn her out completely—she'd slept for half a day before waking.

Even now, walking still caused faint twinges of pain. She didn't dare entertain any wild thoughts again.

"You're the one who started it!"

Ye Chen stared straight at her.

Lin Qingxue's face reddened even more, as if blood might drip from it...

She hadn't meant to—she just couldn't help brushing against him when she got close because they were so big.

But Ye Chen wasn't listening to her explanations...
