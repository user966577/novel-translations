"I've comprehended the highest realm of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger. Why don't I demonstrate it for you?"

"Sect Master, if you watch from the side, perhaps it will help with your own comprehension?"

Ye Chen spoke with a completely serious expression.

Each cultivator's approach and method of comprehending a martial technique was different. Though the end results might be similar, the process couldn't be shared.

Ye Chen had learned it, but he couldn't directly teach Liu Ruyan—anything he said would be no different from what was written in the manual.

Only through personally experiencing the insights could one truly grasp the essence of a martial technique!

What Ye Chen could do for her was limited—he could only demonstrate the technique and let Liu Ruyan observe and comprehend it herself.

This was already a rare opportunity!

Hearing Ye Chen's words, Liu Ruyan gradually relaxed and nodded thoughtfully.

"That method is worth trying..."

As long as he wasn't asking her to sacrifice her body again, it was fine.

After all, her body couldn't take any more!

She couldn't very well risk her life just to comprehend a martial technique, could she?

"Let's go!"

"To the back mountain, right now!"

Liu Ruyan immediately rose to her feet.

"Right now?"

Ye Chen was momentarily stunned.

"Sect Master, shouldn't we eat something first?"

It was already past noon, and he hadn't had a drop of water since dawn.

"Eat what?"

"Aren't you full yet?"

Liu Ruyan shot him a glare, her cheeks puffed with annoyance.

"Well... I suppose I am full."

Ye Chen scratched his head and nodded thoughtfully.

Before long, the two arrived at the clearing on the back mountain from earlier...

"Sect Master, I'm going to strike now!"

Ye Chen announced.

He then circulated his spiritual energy, his intent stirring...

Raising his hand suddenly toward the front, he shouted deeply.

"Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger!"

In an instant, the spiritual energy around his body surged wildly, erupting at full power!

*Rumble rumble...*

The clear sky was instantly covered with dark clouds.

A massive finger broke through the void and came crashing down!

Carrying overwhelming pressure, its momentum was like a rainbow...

Like a domineering flood dragon appearing from the heavens.

*BOOM—*

The finger descended, producing an earth-shaking roar!

The entire mountain peak was shaking, as if it might be pierced through...

Terrifying pressure spread in all directions.

At this moment, the power of this single finger was comparable to a Peak Nascent Soul cultivator's full-strength attack...

Almost simultaneously, several figures flew out from various cave dwellings within the sect...

Still in mid-air, their gazes were already fixed on this mountain peak.

The Supreme Elders had initially thought enemy forces were attacking the sect.

Seeing Liu Ruyan and Ye Chen's figures, along with the pressure of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger, they seemed to understand what was happening and relaxed slightly.

They didn't go to disturb them, assuming Liu Ruyan was teaching Ye Chen the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger, and silently returned to their respective cave dwellings.

At the clearing...

Liu Ruyan watched from the side, completely dumbstruck, her heart in turmoil.

This finger brought an extremely oppressive pressure, leaving Liu Ruyan deeply shaken!

"So that's how it is..."

In an instant, she seemed to have an epiphany!

The moment she came back to her senses, she immediately sat cross-legged and entered a meditative state!

After completing the technique, Ye Chen's face was deathly pale, his body feeling as if it had been hollowed out.

When he had used this move at dawn, it had only consumed half his spiritual energy.

Now that he had comprehended the highest realm of the finger technique, the power had increased several fold, and the spiritual energy consumption had grown as well.

At his peak state, Ye Chen could only execute the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger twice at most!

"An Earth-Grade technique really is domineering!"

He muttered to himself, understanding that only upon reaching Soul Transformation could one truly wield this martial technique.

This was also why low-cultivation disciples couldn't learn high-grade martial techniques—even if they truly comprehended them, they wouldn't have the ability to execute them.

If done poorly, they might drain their spiritual energy completely and suffer backlash.

He looked back at Liu Ruyan, who was still meditating, and didn't disturb her. He also sat cross-legged.

Taking out a pill from his storage ring, he swallowed it to restore his spiritual energy!

Time passed minute by minute...

When Ye Chen's spiritual energy had recovered to its peak and he slowly opened his eyes, the sun in the distant sky was about to set.

He turned to look at Liu Ruyan beside him—she was still in meditation.

Knowing he couldn't interrupt at such a critical moment, Ye Chen quietly kept watch beside her.

From time to time, the sounds of wild beasts echoed from the surrounding forest, and birds circled in the sky waiting to return to their nests.

Though this was within the Blissful Union Sect, the back mountain still had spirit beasts roaming about.

While they were only low-level spirit beasts that posed no threat to Liu Ruyan's life, they could disturb her enlightenment.

Once interrupted, all her efforts might come to nothing...

Just as the forest was about to be swallowed by darkness, Liu Ruyan awakened, her eyes blazing with intensity!

She rose to her feet, spiritual energy surging around her body!

"Six Paths... Heaven-Destroying Finger!"

Liu Ruyan shouted deeply.

In an instant, heaven and earth changed color as winds and clouds churned wildly!

A domineering pressure descended from the sky, enveloping the entire mountain peak.

It was as if their life force had been locked onto!

Countless spirit beasts in the mountain forest prostrated on the ground in terror, their bodies trembling, fear reaching its peak!

A finger condensed from spiritual energy broke through the void and descended...

*BOOM—*

A tremendous roar!

Billowing smoke and dust swept toward them...

This finger was hundreds of times more powerful than what Ye Chen had demonstrated earlier!

The ground beneath their feet trembled continuously!

The originally prominent mountain peak had a section sheared clean off by a single finger...

*Gulp!*

Ye Chen stared at the scene before him in shock, his heart filled with envy and yearning for greater strength!

"Is this... the power of Void Refining?"

The same martial technique, executed at different realms, produced vastly different power!

At this moment, Ye Chen truly felt the terror of a Void Refining expert...

A single finger could shave off part of a mountain peak!

If he wanted to rescue someone from the Profound Heaven Holy Land, it wouldn't be easy.

Encountering a Void Refining expert, he might be instantly killed in a single exchange...

He was still too weak.

Yet Ye Chen wasn't discouraged by this. Instead, his determination to become stronger grew even more resolute!

After all, his current cultivation speed was hundreds or thousands of times faster than ordinary cultivators, wasn't it?

As long as he worked a little harder, he still had hope of reaching Void Refining!

"I've also mastered it!"

Liu Ruyan spoke with joy, her mood incredibly excited.

When she turned to look at Ye Chen beside her, her eyes were filled with gratitude...

If not for Ye Chen, she couldn't possibly have fully comprehended the highest realm of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger so quickly!

This was all thanks to Ye Chen!

"Ye Chen, thank you!"

Liu Ruyan looked at Ye Chen with sincere gratitude.

"No need for thanks..."

"Who told you to be my Sect Master?"

Ye Chen waved his hand dismissively.

"How about something more practical instead..."

"Something... practical?"

Liu Ruyan's expression froze, and she instantly understood, a flush of red crossing her cheeks.

This brat was trying to take advantage of her again!

How hateful!

Liu Ruyan glared fiercely at Ye Chen and snapped.

"Don't even think about it!!!"
