"Great-great-grandfather, you're the head of the sect's Supreme Elders. Why do you need to be so polite to a mere disciple like him?"

Shangguan Yanran spoke with agitation.

"Shut your mouth!"

The Grand Elder glared at her, his aged face carrying natural authority.

Shangguan Yanran was immediately cowed, standing frozen in place like a quail, not knowing what to do.

Her heart was filled with fear!

She didn't understand why her usually doting great-great-grandfather had not only struck her today, but also scolded her.

What had she done wrong?

At this moment she felt deeply wronged...

Ye Chen was somewhat surprised by the Grand Elder's actions, but quickly picked up on something unusual in his words.

An opportunity?

It seemed the other party already knew the secret he carried!

The Grand Elder's purpose in sending Shangguan Yanran to the small courtyard was actually selfish—he wanted her to improve her cultivation through dual cultivation...

Unfortunately, Shangguan Yanran had courted death, offending Ye Chen the moment she arrived at the courtyard.

Only Liu Ruyan and Lin Qingxue's group knew this secret.

The three women couldn't possibly have leaked it, so it had to be Liu Ruyan...

Ye Chen frowned slightly, but thinking about how the other party was a Supreme Elder of the sect, he felt relieved.

All his current resources depended on the sect's support. Even if Liu Ruyan was the Sect Master, making these secret arrangements would certainly be noticed by him.

It was better that he knew—this way Ye Chen could truly gain the entire sect's protection from now on!

"Grand Elder, you're too kind. This disciple won't hold it against her!"

Ye Chen looked at the old man before him and spoke respectfully.

Though Shangguan Yanran had been arrogant and rude, Ye Chen had already taught her a lesson just now.

Besides, the Grand Elder had even slapped Shangguan Yanran—this matter was now even.

He still needed to rely on the sect's protection; there was no need to dwell on this.

"What do you mean, won't hold it against me?"

"I haven't even settled accounts with you yet!"

Shangguan Yanran instantly exploded, glaring at Ye Chen and shouting.

She was clearly the injured party—how had it become Ye Chen's place to forgive her?

"If you don't shut up, you'll be expelled from the Blissful Union Sect! And don't bother returning to the Shangguan family either!"

The Grand Elder's face turned ashen as he rebuked her.

He was truly angry!

How could he have such a brainless descendant?

"Great-great-grandfather..."

Shangguan Yanran's entire body trembled as she looked at the Grand Elder in disbelief, too frightened to make another sound.

If she were expelled from the sect and family, she would lose everything!

At this point, the Grand Elder couldn't be bothered with her. He turned his gaze to Ye Chen and nodded at him.

"Ye Chen, you're quite impressive!"

"I've always been optimistic about you, and the sect will give you its fullest support!"

"No one in the Blissful Union Sect can harm you—not even the Profound Heaven Holy Land!"

His words carried a double meaning as he looked at Ye Chen with appreciation, filled with expectations for him from the bottom of his heart!

Ye Chen's expression froze as he looked at the Grand Elder in surprise.

How did he know about his feud with the Profound Heaven Holy Land?

Would the sect really offend the Profound Heaven Holy Land for his sake?

Or did he already know that Ye Chen had killed Jiang Yuyan?

For a moment, Ye Chen's mind was filled with questions.

Before Ye Chen could speak, the Grand Elder had already taken Shangguan Yanran and left the courtyard...

"Grand Elder..."

Ye Chen watched his departing figure, murmuring to himself.

Just how many secrets did he know?

The matter of the Profound Heaven Holy Land—from start to finish, he had only mentioned it to Liu Ruyan. Even Lin Qingxue and the others beside him didn't know.

Could it be that Liu Ruyan had told the Grand Elder as well?

No, he had to find Liu Ruyan and get some answers!

"Senior Brother, are you alright?"

Lin Qingxue and the others looked at Ye Chen with concern.

When the Grand Elder had appeared earlier, they had been extremely worried.

They were afraid the Grand Elder would attack Ye Chen to protect Shangguan Yanran.

The three of them had even prepared to intervene—even if they were no match for the Grand Elder, they would protect Ye Chen!

After all, Liu Ruyan had sent them to the courtyard not just to serve Ye Chen, but also to protect him.

"I'm fine..."

Ye Chen turned to look at the three women, shook his head with a smile, and spoke casually.

"Go rest first. I'm going to see the Sect Master..."

Hearing this, the looks Lin Qingxue and the others gave Ye Chen became somewhat strange...

"Senior Brother, can your body... handle it?"

Lin Qingxue asked hesitantly.

Ye Chen had slept for less than two hours, and now he was going to find Liu Ruyan again.

Did he have a death wish?

"Senior Brother, your health is important!"

Lu Mengyao urged him with concern.

Su Nianwan also nodded in agreement at Ye Chen...

After witnessing Liu Ruyan and Ye Chen break through simultaneously last night, the three of them had tacitly accepted that Ye Chen and Liu Ruyan had something going on...

It couldn't possibly be just a coincidence—they must have dual cultivated!

Now when Ye Chen said he was going to find Liu Ruyan, in Lin Qingxue and the others' view, he was going to fool around...

Ye Chen: ???

Meeting the suggestive gazes the three women cast his way, Ye Chen explained with an exasperated smile.

"What are you all thinking?"

"I'm going to discuss serious matters with the Sect Master!"

"What's all this about taking care of my health..."

His heart jolted—had his dual cultivation with Liu Ruyan been discovered?

"Is that so!"

"Go ahead and dual... err, handle your business, Senior Brother..."

"Come back soon!"

The three women nodded thoughtfully, looking at Ye Chen as they spoke.

Ye Chen smiled wryly—there was no explaining his way out of this!

In a great hall...

Liu Ruyan lay languidly on her bed, her entire body feeling as if it had fallen apart, completely drained of strength.

Last night, after dual cultivating, she had forced herself to endure several bolts of the Lightning Tribulation, successfully breaking through to Void Refining—but she had also suffered the pain of her body being tempered.

Upon waking, all these after-effects had made themselves apparent.

Just then, a disciple entered and stopped outside the side hall door, head lowered as she reported.

"Sect Master, Ye Chen requests an audience!"

"Ye Chen..."

Liu Ruyan's expression froze, a flash of resentment crossing her eyes!

"That little troublemaker—why is he here again?"

"Does he still want to bully me?"

"How hateful!"

She pouted coquettishly, yet ripples stirred in her heart.

"Let him in!"

"Yes!"

The disciple turned and left, followed by the sound of steady footsteps echoing from the corridor.

Liu Ruyan lay on her side on the bed, gazing expectantly toward the side hall doorway...

Though she complained with her words, her heart held different feelings entirely.

The relationship between her and Ye Chen was no longer simply that of Sect Master and disciple.

"Greetings, Sect Master!"

Ye Chen walked straight into the side hall without any restraint and bowed to Liu Ruyan on the bed.

His gaze snuck a glance at her alluring figure, his heart burning hot!

What a devastating beauty!

"So now you remember I'm the Sect Master?"

Liu Ruyan raised an eyebrow at Ye Chen, letting out an arrogant little snort.

This brat hadn't shown her any respect as Sect Master yesterday!

The look she now gave Ye Chen carried several shades of resentment!

Hearing this, Ye Chen awkwardly touched his nose. Looking up at Liu Ruyan, he spread his hands innocently.

"Sect Master, you can't blame me for that!"

"Weren't you the one who asked for it..."

"Besides, yesterday you were clearly the one who seduced me first..."

Liu Ruyan: !!!

"Ye Chen, what are you saying!"

"Don't say it!"

"You promised never to bring it up again..."

Liu Ruyan exploded like a cat whose tail had been stepped on!
