Several shichen later...

Su Nianwan was the first to wake. Her body felt feverish!

She glanced at Ye Chen sleeping beside her. Recalling last night's madness, she felt a wave of shyness.

"That scoundrel!"

Su Nianwan pouted coquettishly, then carefully rose from the bed, afraid of disturbing Ye Chen's sleep.

Draping clothes over herself to cover her beautiful curves, she hurried out of the room.

There were still many empty rooms in the small courtyard.

Su Nianwan entered a quiet room, sat cross-legged, and began attempting a breakthrough...

Last night's cultivation had caused her cultivation to surge dramatically. She felt as if her body might burst!

*Crack!*

A soft sound rang out...

Su Nianwan's aura suddenly skyrocketed. Surging spiritual energy rushed madly into her body.

The pressure she released instantly shattered the surrounding chairs and tables!

When her aura gradually stabilized, Su Nianwan slowly opened her eyes.

"Mid Golden Core!"

"I've broken through..."

Su Nianwan exclaimed with joy, her voice trembling slightly with disbelief...

In just two days, her realm had jumped from Peak Foundation Establishment to Mid Golden Core—one realm per day!

Something she'd never even dared to imagine before had now happened to her.

Su Nianwan's excitement was impossible to contain. A joyful smile spread across her face.

She got up and ran outside, returning to her room, eager to share this good news with Ye Chen...

It was because of Ye Chen's cultivation that she could have such gains. She was deeply grateful for his efforts.

Ye Chen was roused from sleep by the commotion. The moment he opened his eyes, he saw Su Nianwan running toward him, throwing herself into his embrace...

"Senior Brother, I've broken through again!"

"Mid Golden Core!"

"I never imagined that in just one day, I'd reach Mid Golden Core!"

Su Nianwan spoke excitedly.

By now, Ye Chen had become much more alert. Looking at the jubilant Su Nianwan before him, he understood what had happened.

It must have been last night's exceptional performance that had given Su Nianwan an even greater cultivation boost, allowing her to break through.

"Congratulations!"

Ye Chen said with a smile.

This was indeed something worth celebrating!

At this rate, Su Nianwan would soon step into the Nascent Soul Stage, or even Soul Transformation...

This would also be tremendously helpful for Ye Chen's future revenge—he'd have several more powerful allies!

"It's all thanks to Senior Brother's efforts!"

Su Nianwan looked at Ye Chen, speaking with complete sincerity.

Now she also knew that dual cultivating with Ye Chen could boost her cultivation. Her consecutive breakthroughs over two days were entirely because of Ye Chen...

Hearing Su Nianwan say this, Ye Chen raised an eyebrow at her and said teasingly.

"If you say that... how will you thank me?"

His gaze drifted toward her barely concealed neckline...

Meeting Ye Chen's burning gaze, Su Nianwan's face instantly flushed red...

She shyly lowered her head, not daring to look at him.

"Senior Brother, don't be like this..."

"I... I really can't anymore."

"Can we wait... until tonight?"

Su Nianwan hastily begged for mercy.

Last night's madness was still fresh in her memory—she truly couldn't handle any more right now...

Ye Chen smiled and reached out to ruffle Su Nianwan's hair, pulling her into the blankets. Their bodies pressed close together, sharing each other's warmth.

"You worked hard last night too. Sleep a little longer!"

"Don't worry, I won't touch you."

Ye Chen said softly.

He wasn't a beast—he would never force her.

"Mm..."

Su Nianwan curled up in Ye Chen's embrace, face flushed red as she let out a soft hum.

In a nearby courtyard...

The Grand Elder sensed the commotion of Su Nianwan's breakthrough. A look of shock crossed his face.

"This... how can this be possible!"

"Another breakthrough?"

"Mid Golden Core..."

He couldn't believe it was real!

After all, Su Nianwan had only just broken through to Golden Core yesterday, and in the blink of an eye, she'd advanced another minor realm.

The higher the realm, the greater the difficulty of breaking through.

Many cultivators got stuck at Golden Core, unable to advance a single step. Decades might pass without a breakthrough.

Even heaven-blessed geniuses would need at least several months of cultivation.

Su Nianwan had done it in just one day!

Coming back to himself, the Grand Elder grew agitated. He couldn't help but burst into wild laughter...

"Hahahaha!"

"Wonderful, wonderful!"

"Heaven blesses our Blissful Union Sect..."

"This Ye Chen is truly a gift from heaven to our sect!"

He knew that Su Nianwan's rapid cultivation advancement wasn't due to her own efforts, but because of her dual cultivation with Ye Chen.

All of this was Ye Chen's doing!

If other female disciples came to dual cultivate with Ye Chen, their cultivation would similarly improve.

The Grand Elder knew this, which was why he was so excited!

If only Su Nianwan, a single heaven-blessed genius, had appeared, the impact on the sect wouldn't actually be that great. Before she fully matured, she couldn't contribute much to the sect.

But Ye Chen was different. His dual cultivation talent could elevate the sect's overall strength.

Any female disciple who dual cultivated with him could rapidly advance their cultivation.

The Blissful Union Sect was predominantly composed of female disciples. With Ye Chen diligently cultivating them, it wouldn't take long for the entire younger generation to reach new heights!

The difference between one filling meal and consistent daily meals was enormous.

"For this kid's sake, what does offending the Profound Heaven Holy Land matter?"

"He must stay in the Blissful Union Sect!"

The Grand Elder muttered to himself with firm resolve, his mind already made up.

Before long, Sect Master Liu Ruyan also received the news...

"What!"

"Su Nianwan has broken through to Mid Golden Core?"

Liu Ruyan looked at the secret letter in her hand, unable to help exclaiming in shock.

Complete disbelief was written across her face...

Like the Grand Elder, she too was stunned by Su Nianwan's second breakthrough!

Though she had known beforehand that dual cultivating with Ye Chen could boost cultivation, she hadn't expected that even after entering Golden Core, Su Nianwan could still break through so quickly...

After all, Golden Core was completely different from Foundation Establishment. Each minor realm required ten or a hundred times more effort to break through.

*Hiss!*

"This kid... went at it all night?"

"Still this fierce even while injured? What a healthy body..."

"No wonder Su Nianwan broke through again..."

Liu Ruyan murmured to herself, a rosy blush crossing her exquisite features...

The secret letter had recorded exactly how many times Ye Chen had gone the previous night.

This made her realize that the more one dual cultivated with Ye Chen, the more one's cultivation would improve...

Marveling at Ye Chen's stamina, she couldn't help but develop thoughts of dual cultivating with him once again.

Whenever Liu Ruyan learned of a disciple's cultivation breakthrough, she couldn't resist wanting to try the dual cultivation method herself...

Her cultivation had been stuck at Peak Soul Transformation, unable to break through the bottleneck.

The responsibilities of being Sect Master and the suppression from external forces all made Liu Ruyan desperate to advance to the Void Refining Stage!

Yet despite prolonged effort, she had never been able to cross that threshold. Breaking through had almost become her inner demon.

If this continued, Liu Ruyan might truly go mad!

Now an opportunity had appeared before her. Who wouldn't be tempted?

Even if it meant offering her body, it was worth trying...
