Four hours later...

Refusing to give up, Ye Chen took out a Strength Restoration Pill from his storage ring and swallowed it!

The pill dissolved instantly, and his exhausted body began to gradually recover...

He had obtained a Strength Restoration Pill before. This was the second time, and he used it without hesitation.

Getting back what he put in—this round was already a huge win...

Now, for the sect's survival, Ye Chen was giving it his all. A little hardship was nothing.

No matter what, he had to help Liu Ruyan's cultivation advance.

At the same time, he was also preparing for his own breakthrough...

After all, besides pills, talismans, and treasures, what he gained most directly was cultivation rewards!

Though he had just broken through to Mid Nascent Soul, he could faintly sense the signs of another breakthrough approaching...

"Ye Chen, what are you doing?"

Liu Ruyan asked in surprise.

"Sect Master, don't worry. I'll make sure you break through as soon as possible!"

Ye Chen declared confidently.

Liu Ruyan: ???

A blush crept across her face as she sensed something ominous...

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving five years of cultivation as a reward!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one bottle of Cultivation Foundation Pills!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Thunder Burst Talisman!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Advanced Sword Spirit Talisman (infuse with spiritual energy to activate, releasing a Sword Spirit strike—ten thousand swords returning to origin—with power comparable to a Peak Body Integration expert's full-strength attack)!]*

The next second, Ye Chen was stunned!

Listening to the cold notification that flashed through his mind, he stood there in a daze...

Had he misheard?

He wondered if he was so tense that he was hallucinating?

Only when he felt the new Advanced Sword Spirit Talisman in his storage ring did he realize he hadn't misheard. It was real!

A Sword Spirit Talisman, comparable to a Body Integration expert's most powerful strike!

Ye Chen was instantly thrilled, unable to help laughing out loud...

"Hahahaha!"

With this Sword Spirit Talisman, what were Void Refining experts worth?

He had the confidence to instantly kill them with a single strike...

This was even more powerful than the Immortal-Slaying Talisman he had been longing for!

Ye Chen was overjoyed. He never imagined he would obtain such an offensive talisman. He was incredibly lucky!

Liu Ruyan really had the best drop rates!

If it were Lin Qingxue and the others, they couldn't possibly yield such a high-tier talisman. The Immortal-Slaying Talisman was already their limit...

This only strengthened Ye Chen's resolve to protect the Blissful Union Sect!

Protecting the Blissful Union Sect meant protecting Liu Ruyan...

That way, he could continue to enjoy high drop-rate rewards!

With his current identity and strength, if he left the Blissful Union Sect, it would be nearly impossible to bed a Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root woman...

It wasn't just that the Blissful Union Sect needed him—Ye Chen needed the Blissful Union Sect too!

Now they were grasshoppers tied to the same rope. When it came to the Blissful Union Sect's survival, Ye Chen would give his all...

Dawn approached...

A ray of sunlight filtered through the window, falling on the chamber floor...

The candles that had flickered all night finally went out at daybreak.

On the bed, Ye Chen was so exhausted he couldn't keep his eyes open. He had originally wanted to leave under cover of darkness, but in the end, he chose to stay...

Going back to the small courtyard now would be pointless anyway. After the Strength Restoration Pill's effects gradually wore off, Ye Chen simply closed his eyes and fell asleep.

He was truly exhausted...

Rustling sounds reached his ears.

Ye Chen vaguely heard them in his drowsiness but didn't bother investigating, lost in dreams he didn't want to wake from.

Liu Ruyan finished dressing and rose to leave. Glancing back at the sleeping Ye Chen, she pouted with flushed cheeks.

"Scoundrel!"

"Now you know you're tired?"

With that, she turned and left the side chamber.

As Sect Master, she had many things to attend to...

Before the three major forces could attack the Blissful Union Sect, they had to make thorough preparations!

The Blissful Union Sect did have friendly relations with some other sects, but facing three major forces, even the best relationships had to consider the costs...

Only sufficient benefits could bring allies!

It was well into the afternoon...

When Ye Chen finally woke from his slumber, his body still felt exhausted, as if completely drained.

He looked around. Liu Ruyan was long gone from the side chamber, having clearly left earlier...

"That little vixen..."

"She nearly took this old life of mine!"

Ye Chen shook his head, muttering to himself...

Thinking about the fierce battle awaiting him over the next month, his back already ached.

"No, I need to go back and make some tonic soup to nourish my body..."

He rose, dressed, and hurried out of the great hall.

Outside was quiet and empty—not a single disciple in sight. It seemed Liu Ruyan had arranged for everyone to leave beforehand.

Fortunately, no one had discovered him spending the night at Liu Ruyan's residence. Ye Chen breathed a long sigh of relief, then quickly departed...

In the small courtyard...

All the way back, Ye Chen had been thinking about how to face Lin Qingxue and the others.

Though they wouldn't be jealous and already knew about his relationship with Liu Ruyan...

He had promised them last night that he would come back and show them some affection, but he had broken that promise.

Had they waited up late for him?

Were they hurt and upset?

Lost in thought, Ye Chen had already stepped into the courtyard...

"Qingxue..."

Ye Chen was about to call out to Lin Qingxue and the others when he looked up and froze...

A large opening had been knocked through one of the courtyard walls, connecting it with the neighboring yard.

Numerous servant disciples were busy with repairs...

A hint of confusion crossed his mind.

He had only been gone one night, and such a big change had happened to his residence?

Why was the neighboring yard being connected?

"Senior Brother, you're back!"

Lin Qingxue heard the noise and emerged from her room.

Lu Mengyao, Su Nianwan, Zhao Ling'er, and the others also came out of their respective rooms, walking over to Ye Chen.

"Senior Brother, did you have fun last night?"

"Senior Brother must be tired? Want to go rest in your room for a while?"

"Senior Brother, let me make you some tonic soup..."

All of them wore smiles, looking at Ye Chen with knowing expressions...

They all knew Ye Chen had gone to see Liu Ruyan last night. Not coming back all night meant he must have stayed at her place...

As for what had happened between them, Lin Qingxue and the others naturally understood.

Especially seeing Ye Chen's exhausted appearance—they could pretty much guess.

"Ahem..."

Ye Chen awkwardly scratched his nose. Looking up at the opened wall nearby, he quickly changed the subject.

"What's going on over there?"

"Who knocked a hole in the wall?"

Hearing this, Lin Qingxue explained.

"Senior Brother, this is the Sect Master's order!"

"I heard... the sect is arranging for one hundred female disciples to move into the neighboring courtyard..."

Ye Chen: ???
