The gap in cultivation was clear, and the Daoist-robed elder was steadily losing ground.

He was utterly shocked.

How had he randomly stumbled upon a young man at the Nascent Soul Stage?

Talk about rotten luck!

"Fellow Daoist, let's talk this out..."

"Can we stop fighting?"

"If I've done something wrong, at least tell me first..."

"I'll even bow and apologize, alright?"

The Daoist-robed elder groaned inwardly and hurried to show submission.

If this kept going, he was done for...

The Soul-Summoning Banner he treasured above all else was losing its glow under Ye Chen's barrage.

His heart bled. Refining a Soul-Summoning Banner was no easy task. Even harvesting the souls of this entire village wouldn't compensate for the damage from this fight.

Ye Chen said nothing. He simply kept attacking.

Fist after fist, ripples of spiritual energy expanding outward.

*BANG!*

*CRACK!*

The spiritual barrier around the Daoist-robed elder shattered.

*SQUELCH!*

Another punch slammed into his body, sending him flying dozens of feet...

"Don't push me, kid!"

The Daoist-robed elder snarled furiously.

The very next instant, Ye Chen appeared before him and launched another devastating strike...

"Don't—"

The elder's pupils shrank, terror flashing through his eyes...

Before he could mount a defense, Ye Chen's fist crashed into his chest and blasted him from the sky...

*BOOM!*

The Daoist-robed elder cratered into a pit below, kicking up billowing dust.

Ye Chen glanced down, flickered, and landed at the edge of the pit, gazing at the battered elder.

*Cough...*

The elder vomited a mouthful of blood. He struggled but couldn't even stand. The Soul-Summoning Banner lay discarded beside him, its glow completely extinguished.

He stared up at Ye Chen in terror, his hands trembling as he removed his storage ring and held it out, his voice weak:

"I... everything I own is in here... take it..."

"Spare... my life!"

Ye Chen ignored his plea. He lifted his foot, planted it on the elder's chest, and drove a savage pulse of spiritual energy through him, shattering his body in an instant...

*SQUELCH!*

The elder's eyes went wide, staring at Ye Chen with dying defiance...

"Kill you, and it's all mine anyway..."

Ye Chen looked down at the lifeless corpse with a blank expression, his voice flat.

With a casual wave, he snatched the storage ring into his palm.

He turned his attention to the Soul-Summoning Banner lying nearby and beckoned it to his hand with a gesture.

Though it had been damaged in the fight, it was still an Immortal-Grade artifact with considerable power.

Ye Chen didn't care that the Soul-Summoning Banner was a heretical cultivator's weapon. If it benefited him, that was all that mattered.

As he stored the banner in his ring, the surviving villagers began gathering around him...

Their faces were etched with grief. Tears streamed down their cheeks.

In a single night, they'd lost their families and the homes they'd built their lives around.

Ye Chen pressed his lips together, assuming these villagers had come to thank him for saving them. He was about to wave goodbye and leave when—

"You're so powerful—why didn't you show up sooner?"

"If you'd acted earlier, my daddy wouldn't have died..."

"It's all your fault!"

A little girl pointed at Ye Chen, sobbing with accusation.

Ye Chen froze, completely blindsided.

He'd stepped in to save her, and she was blaming him for being too late?

But... what did that have to do with him?

Wasn't the heretical cultivator the one who killed the villagers?

Ye Chen's expression darkened, and the way he looked at the little girl changed entirely...

The rest of the surviving villagers turned their displaced fury on him as well...

"If you'd come earlier, my wife wouldn't be dead..."

"You did this on purpose. My daughter died because of you."

"Trying to play hero? We won't thank you..."

"You're just as horrible as that monster!"

"You killed everyone..."

The torrent of abuse echoed around Ye Chen...

The villagers showed no gratitude for his rescue. Instead, they blamed him relentlessly for arriving too late—for failing to save everyone.

Ye Chen narrowed his eyes, surveying the villagers before him, a faint smile curling at the corners of his mouth...

"Oh, so it's all my fault, is it?"

His expression snapped cold, and he barked:

"Vile heretics! You've possessed these innocent villagers!"

"Show yourselves!"

Ye Chen raised his palm and brought it down on the girl in front of him.

*BANG!*

Her mortal body was obliterated by the blast of spiritual energy, dissolving into a crimson mist...

*Hiss!*

The surrounding villagers witnessed this and went slack-jawed!

"What... possessed?"

"We're heretics?"

"No... I'm not a heretic..."

The villagers' faces drained of color as they tried desperately to explain...

Ye Chen said nothing. He raised a hand and pointed skyward!

"Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger!!!"

"Accursed heretics—die!"

In an instant, the heavens shifted...

An enormous finger descended from the void and slammed into the village!

*BOOOOM!*

The earth shook...

"AAHH!!!"

Every last villager was annihilated before they could flee!

The village itself crumbled to dust beneath that single strike, as though it had never existed at all!

Moments later, the rolling clouds of dust dispersed...

The girl, the villagers—all gone. Vanished without a trace.

The noise in his ears fell silent with them.

Ye Chen surveyed his surroundings and nodded with satisfaction.

"Heretical cultivators really are devious!"

"Good thing I saw through their tricks..."

He muttered to himself, then turned and strode away.

Silence blanketed the area.

Several breaths later, a faint sound came from the nearby underbrush...

A little boy came stumbling out, weeping, and dropped to his knees on the empty ground where the village had stood. His heart shattered with grief...

"Dad, Mom—your son will avenge you!"

As his words fell, crisp footsteps sounded behind him...

"Found you, kid!"

Ye Chen narrowed his eyes and smirked coldly.

The boy's body went rigid. He whipped around to face Ye Chen, eyes wide with terror...

"Don't—"

"I'm not a heretic!"

Ye Chen's expression hardened.

"Already learned how to lie, and still claiming you're not a heretic?"

"Die!"

He brought his palm down, and the boy was launched dozens of feet through the air, landing like a crumpled rag doll. Dead as dead could be.

"That's better!"

Ye Chen dusted off his hands and turned to leave once more.

A long time passed before soft footsteps emerged from the trees.

A young man walked out slowly, his face streaked with tears, fists clenched as he stared at the ruins and ground his teeth:

"Village Elder, Seventh Auntie, Eighth Auntie—I swear I'll avenge you all!"

As his words fell, a figure dropped from the sky...

"You heretics sure know how to hide..."

The young man's heart lurched. Seeing Ye Chen return yet again, his face went white.

"How... how are you back?"

He was terrified to his core, trembling all over.

Ye Chen looked at him and chuckled coldly...

"Don't worry. It won't hurt."

He threw a punch...

*BOOM!*

The young man burst into a crimson mist...
