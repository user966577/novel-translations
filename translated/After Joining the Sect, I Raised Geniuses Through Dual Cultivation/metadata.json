  "synopsis": "Ye Chen transmigrated into a cultivation world with nothing but a worthless Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root and a pile of enemies hunting him down.\n\nHis adoptive family was slaughtered. His sister was kidnapped by the Profound Heaven Holy Land. And his only hope of survival? Joining the Blissful Union Sect, a declining dual cultivation sect desperately clinging to relevance.\n\nBut Ye Chen has a secret weapon: the Many Blessings System, which rewards him generously for... producing offspring. The catch? His children are guaranteed to have Spiritual Roots, and he gains cultivation breakthroughs just from the act itself.\n\nWhen he reveals his unique talent to the beautiful Sect Master Liu Ruyan, she sees an opportunity to reverse the sect's decline. Soon, female disciples are being assigned to his courtyard, his cultivation is skyrocketing without any actual cultivation, and the Sect Master is seriously reconsidering whether she should test his abilities personally.\n\nMeanwhile, the Profound Heaven Holy Land wants him dead, the Vice Sect Master is plotting a coup, and Ye Chen just wants to know why working this hard still counts as 'lying flat.'",
