The Blissful Union Sect was surrounded by peaks, shrouded in ethereal mist.

In a cave dwelling deep in the rear mountains...

A white-bearded elder sat cross-legged in cultivation. Thick spiritual energy swirled around him, each breath separated by long intervals.

When still, not even the slightest movement could be detected—as if he were a corpse.

Just then, a crane formed from spiritual energy appeared in the cave.

The cultivating elder sensed something and opened his eyes. A faint gleam of lightning flickered in his pupils.

He raised his hand and snatched the hovering crane from the air.

The moment he crushed it, Liu Ruyan's voice reached his ears...

[Personal disciple Lin Qingxue—after dual cultivation, her cultivation broke through from Mid Foundation Establishment to Peak Foundation Establishment!]

[Inner disciple Su Nianwan—after one night of dual cultivation, broke through from Peak Foundation Establishment to Golden Core!]

The white-bearded elder's pupils contracted. Spiritual energy erupted uncontrollably from his body, causing the entire cave to tremble!

"This... this is real!"

He believed Liu Ruyan wouldn't joke about something like this.

Two more disciples had experienced cultivation surges after dual cultivating with Ye Chen!

Coming back to his senses, the elder couldn't help but burst into laughter...

"Hahahaha!"

"Heaven blesses the Blissful Union Sect! To have such a heaven-defying disciple."

"Wonderful, truly wonderful!"

His emotions ran high. He wished he could immediately meet this disciple named Ye Chen, who possessed such an extraordinary talent...

Yesterday, when Liu Ruyan had told him about it, he'd dismissed it as coincidence. Now it was clear everything was true!

For the Blissful Union Sect, this was undoubtedly a tremendous opportunity!

As long as Ye Chen worked diligently at his plowing, the sect's overall strength could rise to a new level in no time.

At this moment, the elder resolved that even if it meant clashing head-on with the Profound Heaven Holy Land, he had to protect this disciple. Ye Chen must not suffer even the slightest harm...

Ye Chen was the Blissful Union Sect's future!

In a refined, elegant great hall...

"Disciple Ye Chen greets the Sect Master!"

Ye Chen entered the hall and bowed respectfully toward Liu Ruyan.

His gaze flickered briefly to her stunning figure. *They really are impressive...*

"What brings you here with time to spare?"

"Out with it—what do you want!"

Liu Ruyan looked at Ye Chen with surprise.

The earlier report had detailed how Ye Chen had consecutively dual cultivated with Lin Qingxue and Su Nianwan yesterday, continuing late into the night without rest...

The battle hadn't ended until dawn!

That's why Lin Qingxue and Su Nianwan had both woken up late today, and their breakthroughs had been delayed...

After all that exertion, shouldn't he be resting?

Liu Ruyan couldn't help but appraise Ye Chen's physique.

Was this kid's body really that strong?

Not the slightest sign of exhaustion...

It was simply incredible.

Youth really was a wonderful thing!

"Reporting to the Sect Master, this disciple came to request... more Spirit Stones."

Ye Chen stated his purpose.

"Spirit Stones?"

Liu Ruyan's expression shifted. Coming back to herself, she frowned with displeasure, eyeing Ye Chen suspiciously.

"What exactly do you need so many Spirit Stones for?"

"I just gave you 50,000 Spirit Stones. How have you already used them all?"

"With your cultivation level, you couldn't possibly absorb that much spiritual energy..."

Over the past two days, she had given Ye Chen a total of 70,000 Spirit Stones.

An inner disciple's monthly allowance was merely a few dozen stones.

Ye Chen's consumption rate left even Liu Ruyan incredulous.

She was starting to suspect he was using the Spirit Stones to keep some mistress on the side.

"Sect Master, please understand—every Spirit Stone I use goes toward our plan. I haven't kept a single one for myself!"

"In ten months, the Sect Master will understand!"

Ye Chen spoke with solemn conviction.

He didn't explain the secrets he carried, but his words hinted that the Spirit Stones were being used for the dual cultivation and offspring production.

And that was indeed the truth!

He could advance his cultivation through dual cultivation alone. He had no need to cultivate with Spirit Stones.

Liu Ruyan nodded, still half-skeptical.

Though she hadn't yet seen results in terms of offspring, she had already witnessed the benefits of dual cultivation from the three female disciples.

Her trust in Ye Chen's talent had grown somewhat.

Otherwise, she wouldn't have entertained the idea of dual cultivating with Ye Chen to break through her own bottleneck.

"Very well. Take these Spirit Stones. Come find me if you need more."

Liu Ruyan didn't hold back, tossing over a storage pouch containing 100,000 Spirit Stones.

This was a considerable expense even for her, but for the sect's future, as long as the female disciples bore children with Spiritual Roots in ten months, every investment would be worthwhile.

"Thank you, Sect Master!"

Ye Chen accepted the Spirit Stone-filled pouch with a cheerful grin.

With Spirit Stones in hand, whenever he hit the mark with a female disciple, he could significantly increase the probability of offspring obtaining higher-grade Spiritual Roots!

Suddenly, surprise flashed across Liu Ruyan's face!

"Your cultivation..."

"Peak Foundation Establishment!!!"

Her voice rose several octaves!

In the quiet hall, it sounded particularly abrupt.

Even her proud peaks trembled!

Liu Ruyan hadn't noticed before, but now the way she looked at Ye Chen had completely changed...

Ye Chen had only just reached Foundation Establishment yesterday. In a single day, he'd broken through two minor realms to reach Peak Foundation Establishment!

This left Liu Ruyan stunned.

Ye Chen's advancement was even faster than the female disciples who dual cultivated with him!

And he was merely a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root disciple—the worst possible aptitude. Yet his cultivation speed rivaled that of supreme-grade cultivation geniuses!

Liu Ruyan immediately realized Ye Chen was also benefiting from dual cultivation.

Not only could the female disciples rapidly advance their cultivation, but Ye Chen could too—perhaps even more so.

This kid really did have secrets!

"Thank you for your concern, Sect Master!"

"This disciple simply happened to break through two realms."

Ye Chen replied calmly.

As if it were the result of hard work and gradual accumulation...

But Liu Ruyan knew exactly how easy his cultivation advancement was!

Get into bed, dual cultivate, cultivation increases. What was difficult about that?

The only challenge was whether his body could handle it...

Work hard, get rewarded!

The more you do, the more you gain!

Liu Ruyan studied Ye Chen, curiosity building.

How impressive was this kid in bed exactly?

According to the report, he could apparently go at it for an entire day...

He wouldn't work someone to death, would he?

One thing was certain—this kid didn't have the faintest idea of being gentle with women...

"If the Sect Master has no further instructions..."

"This disciple will take his leave!"

Ye Chen bowed.

A flicker of confusion crossed his mind.

He felt that Liu Ruyan's gaze toward him seemed somewhat off.

Like being eyed by a she-demon, it sent shivers down his spine and made his hair stand on end—as if he might be devoured at any moment.

"Go on!"

"Dual cultivation is important, but... do take care of your body."

Liu Ruyan spoke evenly.

She appeared to be expressing concern for Ye Chen's health, telling him not to exhaust himself. Yet internally, she was engaged in an intense inner battle...

Should she try dual cultivating with this kid?

How should she broach the subject?

She was the Sect Master, after all!!!
