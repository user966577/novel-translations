"Just one disciple?"

"In your eyes, are the lives of our sect's disciples so worthless?"

Liu Ruyan gave a cold snort.

"That's not what I meant..."

Jiang Yuyan's expression shifted dramatically as she hastily denied it.

If word of this got out, it would undoubtedly chill the disciples' hearts. Who would follow a Vice Sect Master like that?

Everyone would worry about becoming a disposable pawn.

She had originally wanted to watch Liu Ruyan flounder, maybe put her in a difficult spot. Instead, she'd been outmaneuvered.

The several Grand Elders had also calmed down by now, their gazes fixed on Liu Ruyan.

"From what we've heard, this Ye Chen is merely a disciple with a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root. Why does the Sect Master care so much about him?"

One of the Elders spoke up.

He felt that Liu Ruyan seemed to pay unusual attention to this disciple named Ye Chen.

Defending the sect's dignity was one thing, but antagonizing the powerful Profound Heaven Holy Land for this reason was clearly unwise.

If the sect were destroyed as a result, the losses would far outweigh the gains.

In the Elders' hearts, a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root disciple wasn't worth betting the sect's future on.

Liu Ruyan glanced at the Elders and spoke earnestly.

"The sect has declined, beset by enemies on all sides. We're already on the brink of collapse, liable to fall apart at any moment."

"If we let our disciples' hearts grow cold at a time like this, who would still be willing to fight for the sect?"

"Doing so would only push the Blissful Union Sect into an abyss from which there is no return."

The several Elders fell silent.

Liu Ruyan's words carried some weight.

One Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root disciple meant nothing, but what about a hundred? A thousand? If they all left, the sect would snowball into total collapse.

"But if we offend the Profound Heaven Holy Land, the Blissful Union Sect will be destroyed all the same."

"Why don't we just quietly hand him over and make sure word doesn't get out?"

Jiang Yuyan spoke with a sullen face.

She feared that this incident would offend the Profound Heaven Holy Land and bring catastrophe upon the sect.

When that happened, she as Vice Sect Master wouldn't survive either.

She didn't want to die!

The several Grand Elders looked troubled. Handing him over or not—both options were bad for the sect.

Liu Ruyan could see their internal struggle. After a moment's thought, her gaze fell on the senior, most composed elder.

"Grand Elder, might I have a private word with you?"

"Very well."

The old man looked at Liu Ruyan with puzzlement and nodded in agreement.

He was curious what she wanted to say.

"Grand Elder, this way please."

Liu Ruyan led him toward a side chamber.

Jiang Yuyan and the other Grand Elders remained where they stood.

"What's she up to now?"

Jiang Yuyan stared at Liu Ruyan and the Grand Elder walking into the side chamber, her expression dark with displeasure.

What could she possibly say that the Vice Sect Master couldn't hear?

At the same time, she worried that something unexpected might happen.

After all, she had hoped to use this opportunity to undermine Liu Ruyan's authority so she could replace her in the future!

Inside the side chamber...

Liu Ruyan cautiously erected a barrier to block all sound.

The Grand Elder frowned in confusion. "Sect Master, what do you wish to say?"

He sensed this was no trivial matter.

Otherwise, Liu Ruyan wouldn't have gone to the trouble of setting up a barrier!

Liu Ruyan met his gaze, her expression grave.

"Grand Elder, what I'm about to tell you concerns the Blissful Union Sect's future prosperity or decline."

"I must ask that you swear to keep this absolutely secret and tell no one!"

The Grand Elder hesitated, then nodded. "This old man gives you his word!"

His curiosity grew. What was Liu Ruyan going to tell him? Why all the secrecy?

And how was it connected to the sect's rise and fall?

Seeing his agreement, Liu Ruyan held nothing back. She revealed everything about Ye Chen's secret talent...

Originally, she hadn't wanted anyone to know this secret, but now, to withstand pressure from the Profound Heaven Holy Land, she could only confide in the leader of the Grand Elders to gain his support!

Only then could she protect this "asset" named Ye Chen!

But she would never let Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan or anyone else learn of it.

"What did you say!"

"Offspring with Spiritual Roots?"

The Grand Elder's excitement showed as his breathing quickened. His fervent eyes fixed on Liu Ruyan.

He understood exactly what this meant!

Even the most common Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root was one in a hundred among mortals. Higher grades were even rarer.

If there truly was a steady stream of "new disciples" with Spiritual Roots, it would be enough to ensure the Blissful Union Sect's eternal prosperity.

Should an exceptionally talented disciple emerge, it could completely transform the Blissful Union Sect—perhaps even restore them to their former glory as one of the Southern Wilderness Province's holy lands!

"Can we trust what this disciple named Ye Chen says?"

The Grand Elder gradually calmed down, still harboring doubts.

Such a talent sounded utterly fantastical—hard to believe.

"I believe him!"

Liu Ruyan spoke with firm conviction.

She had no retreat. She could only trust Ye Chen.

She also handed over the intelligence report...

The Grand Elder took it curiously. After reading it, his eyes widened in shock as he drew a sharp breath.

"This... is this real?"

"One night of dual cultivation, and they advanced a minor realm?"

"That's... that's simply unbelievable!"

He could hardly believe it was true, yet he also knew Liu Ruyan wouldn't deceive him about something like this.

On one side was the Profound Heaven Holy Land's pressure; on the other, the hope of restoring the sect to its former glory...

The Grand Elder's brow furrowed with hesitation, but soon he steeled his resolve.

"Though the Profound Heaven Holy Land is powerful, we old bones aren't dead yet. We can still hold the line!"

"If it comes to it, we'll fight to the death!"

He chose to believe in Ye Chen—just this once!

No one could resist the allure of restoring the sect to its peak. The Grand Elders, who had witnessed the sect's golden age firsthand, yearned for that revival even more desperately.

Although the Blissful Union Sect had declined, its middle ranks hollowed out, several top-tier fighters among the old guard were still alive.

As long as they made clear their willingness to fight to the death, even the Profound Heaven Holy Land would think twice.

The Profound Heaven Holy Land was certainly powerful, with experts aplenty, but no one would sacrifice several top-tier fighters just to avenge some Qi Refining disciple.

"Thank you, Grand Elder!"

Liu Ruyan breathed a sigh of relief.

With his support, even if Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan objected, it would be futile.

Through this incident, she could even pull all the Grand Elders to her side—killing two birds with one stone!

"Don't thank me!"

"Just make sure this disciple named Ye Chen isn't lying!"

"Otherwise, this old man will scatter his soul to the winds!"

The Grand Elder spoke gravely, a flash of cold light in his clouded eyes.

"Rest assured, Grand Elder!"

"I'll send another female disciple to test it immediately!"

"Then we'll know whether it's coincidence or whether dual cultivation with Ye Chen truly can break through bottlenecks."

Liu Ruyan answered at once.

She had already made up her mind.

One could be coincidence. Two could be coincidence. But if the third female disciple also broke through—that was definitely no coincidence.

"Very well!"

"This old man awaits your news!"

The Grand Elder nodded in agreement.

And so the two reached an understanding.
