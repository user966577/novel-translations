They had all witnessed Ye Chen slaughtering Zhang family members like a killing god, unstoppable...

If they had run just a little slower, they might already be corpses by now.

Hearing this, Zhang Mobei and Zhang Shuyu's expressions both grew more grave...

"Could this Ye Chen have obtained some kind of opportunity that dramatically increased his strength?"

Zhang Shuyu spoke with surprise.

Other than that, she couldn't imagine what could make someone at Qi Refinement become so powerful!

Even Golden Core wasn't a match for him?

"Where's Miaoyin?"

"Why hasn't she come out?"

Zhang Mobei scanned the escaped family members. Not seeing his daughter's figure, he grew anxious.

"I heard... that Ye Chen killed his way out from Miaoyin's courtyard!"

"Someone heard Miaoyin's screams. She may have already been killed by Ye Chen..."

One Zhang family member explained.

"What!"

"Miaoyin is dead?"

"Ye Chen, I'll kill you..."

Zhang Mobei erupted in furious roars upon hearing his daughter was dead.

"Save us, Patriarch!"

A group of Zhang family members came scrambling out, screaming in terror. Behind them followed a sword-wielding young man...

With every sword stroke, another Zhang family member fell in a pool of blood.

Screams rose one after another!

Everyone's attention instantly turned that way...

"It really is Ye Chen!"

"Good, good, good. This kid actually dares to return!"

Zhang Shuyu narrowed her eyes and spoke coldly.

Recognizing Ye Chen, killing intent stirred in her heart.

She leaped forward, striking first...

"Ye Chen, die!"

Zhang Shuyu had just broken through to Peak Golden Core and wanted to test her skills on Ye Chen.

She struck out with her palm!

Seeing this, Ye Chen immediately slashed with his sword...

A flash of sword light!

*BOOM—*

The spiritual palm print and sword light collided with a tremendous roar!

Zhang Shuyu was forced back several steps before steadying herself. Her expression changed slightly as she looked at Ye Chen with a hint of shock!

"How is this possible!"

"How did this kid also break through to Peak Golden Core?"

She found it inconceivable.

Ye Chen's current strength was even slightly superior to hers!

"Zhang Shuyu, you slut!"

"Conspiring with outsiders to destroy my Ye family—today I'll make your Zhang family pay blood for blood!"

Ye Chen glared at Zhang Shuyu with icy eyes and cursed.

The next second, he rushed forward with his sword, slashing out several waves of sword qi toward her...

"Brother, hurry and kill this kid!"

Zhang Shuyu realized she was no match for Ye Chen and immediately called for reinforcements.

"Brat, don't be so arrogant!"

"Give me back my daughter's life!"

After learning of his daughter Zhang Miaoyin's fate, Zhang Mobei hated Ye Chen to the bone.

Without any hesitation, he struck with a thunderous blow!

"Annihilation Palm!"

A terrifying palm print suddenly materialized in the void and slammed down onto Ye Chen...

*BOOM—*

A tremendous explosion!

Ye Chen was instantly reduced to flying ash!

Everyone froze...

"Ye Chen... is he dead?"

Zhang Shuyu wondered in surprise.

She hadn't expected Ye Chen to die just like that, without even a scream.

What struck her as odd was that there wasn't a trace of blood in the air...

Even if Zhang Mobei was strong, he shouldn't be able to completely erase someone's aura, should he?

Not just her—Zhang Mobei, who had been preparing to strike again, also froze...

He furrowed his brow slightly, wondering: was he really that powerful?

One palm had reduced a Peak Golden Core to dust?

The Zhang family members in the distance saw this and immediately relaxed...

"Wonderful, the patriarch killed Ye Chen!"

"That kid deserved it for daring to come back..."

"He killed so many of us. Even dying ten thousand times wouldn't be enough to satisfy our hatred!"

"Too bad there's no corpse left. Otherwise, we'd grind his bones to ash..."

The Zhang family members cursed viciously.

Having been hunted by Ye Chen earlier, they had been terrified. Their hearts were filled with hatred for him.

Just when everyone thought Ye Chen was dead, a figure walked out from the courtyard gates...

"Ye Chen!"

"You... how are you still alive?"

"Weren't you just killed?"

Zhang Shuyu looked up at the approaching figure, her face draining of color, her voice trembling!

She couldn't believe her eyes.

Just a second ago, Ye Chen had been killed by Zhang Mobei's palm, and the next second he emerged as if nothing had happened...

Zhang Shuyu even thought she was seeing things!

Was it an illusion?

"Zhang Shuyu, you slut!"

"Disappointed that I'm not dead?"

"Today, I'll use the blood of your Zhang family to honor the spirits of the Ye family!"

Ye Chen spoke coldly.

The one who had just died was merely a clone Ye Chen had created—it had no effect on his true body.

"Don't be so arrogant, brat!"

"I don't care what tricks you use. Today, you will die!"

Zhang Mobei's face was ashen as he spoke.

His words fell, and he struck again!

Another full-powered blow...

"Annihilation Palm!"

Ye Chen snorted coldly...

"Six Paths... Heaven-Destroying Finger!"

In an instant, heaven and earth changed color as fierce winds arose!

A palm print and a golden finger appeared in the void almost simultaneously...

An overwhelming pressure enveloped the heavens and earth.

*BOOM—*

An earth-shaking roar!

The golden finger shattered the palm on the spot and descended directly...

"No..."

Zhang Mobei's pupils contracted as his expression changed drastically, his heart filled with panic.

Watching the descending finger, a deep sense of powerlessness welled up within him...

The overwhelming momentum filled him with terror!

*BANG!*

The next second, Zhang Mobei was crushed by the single finger...

Transformed into a mist of blood, even his primordial spirit was obliterated!

The courtyard fell instantly silent—terrifyingly silent.

Everyone's eyes went wide. They stared in disbelief at the scene before them, their faces filled with horror...

"The patriarch... is dead?"

"How is this possible? Ye Chen actually killed the patriarch?"

*Gulp!* "What a terrifying technique. How did Ye Chen become so powerful?"

"It's over! Our Zhang family is completely finished this time..."

With Zhang Mobei dead, all the Zhang family members present panicked...

He was the Zhang family's greatest fighting force. If even he had been instantly killed by a single finger from Ye Chen, the rest of them stood no chance against him.

Everyone's hearts were filled with despair...

Zhang Shuyu stood frozen in place, her delicate body trembling with fear.

The smell of blood filled her nostrils, making her nauseous.

She stared blankly at Ye Chen before her, unable to believe that the ant who had been merely at Qi Refinement just months ago had now become so powerful...

Not only had he surpassed her, he had even killed Zhang Mobei with a single strike.

What kind of opportunity had this kid obtained?

"How... how did you become so powerful?"

Zhang Shuyu asked, her voice trembling.

"What, are you scared?"

Ye Chen looked at her coldly, raising an eyebrow as he approached step by step.

The spirit sword in his hand gleamed with cold light!

*Gulp!*

Zhang Shuyu's heart trembled, and she turned pale with fright.

"Ye... Ye Chen, don't do anything rash..."

"No matter what, I'm still your stepmother!"

Realizing she was no match for Ye Chen, she quickly played the emotional card.

Trying to get Ye Chen to spare her!
