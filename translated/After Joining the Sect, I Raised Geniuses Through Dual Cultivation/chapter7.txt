Inside the room...

Ye Chen looked at Lin Qingxue with a grin, her cheeks flushed red. "Then shall the two of us go to bed and discuss life?"

Meeting Ye Chen's heated gaze, Lin Qingxue shyly nodded and softly agreed, "Mm!"

She was still bashful, her face red as a ripe apple.

Lin Qingxue wasn't as bold as Lu Mengyao. Facing Ye Chen always made her blush and her heart race—yearning yet shy.

"Let's go..."

Ye Chen couldn't wait. He took Lin Qingxue's soft, delicate hand and led her toward the nearby bed...

He had so much "life" to discuss.

Starting from the origins of humanity...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one year of cultivation as a reward!]

Outside the courtyard...

Lu Mengyao had intended to cultivate, but she suddenly sensed something that made her cheeks flush. She became flustered.

Bold as she was, even she felt embarrassed now.

She quickly hurried out of the courtyard, afraid she wouldn't be able to resist.

Those familiar sounds were simply too alluring!

This was Ye Chen and Lin Qingxue's private time. She could only try her best to suppress her emotions.

Lu Mengyao murmured to herself, face red...

"Looks like Sister Lin didn't sleep last night either!"

Thinking about it made her feel a bit guilty. She must have kept her awake.

She had just stepped out the courtyard gate when she encountered an elegant female disciple approaching.

The newcomer wore a red silk dress embroidered with golden thread, standing tall and graceful with a lovely figure.

Her delicate features and otherworldly bearing made her seem like a celestial maiden.

Lu Mengyao looked at this female disciple—whose looks and figure rivaled her own—and a flash of amazement crossed her eyes.

She also recognized who this was!

"Su Nianwan!"

This was Sect Master Liu Ruyan's personal disciple. She possessed an Earth-Grade Spiritual Root with exceptional talent. Despite her young age, she had already reached Peak Foundation Establishment and was one of the sect's most promising geniuses!

Lu Mengyao, Lin Qingxue, and Su Nianwan were all disciples under Liu Ruyan, but Su Nianwan held a somewhat higher status than the other two.

"Senior Sister Su, what brings you here?"

Lu Mengyao greeted her curiously.

Su Nianwan stopped and glanced at Lu Mengyao, pursing her lips. "The Sect Master sent me..."

As she spoke, a blush crept across her fair cheeks.

"The Sect Master..."

Lu Mengyao instantly understood what was happening, surprise filling her heart!

The Sect Master had even sent her personal disciple to warm the bed?

It seemed Senior Brother Ye's status was anything but simple...

Otherwise, how could a disciple with a mere Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root possibly have an Earth-Grade personal disciple sent to dual cultivate with him?

This showed just how much Liu Ruyan valued Ye Chen!

"Is Senior Brother Ye... inside?"

Su Nianwan asked shyly, biting her lip, her face tinted pink.

Recalling Liu Ruyan's earlier instructions to her, she couldn't help but blush.

She had joined the Blissful Union Sect but had never dual cultivated with a man before. She was still a virgin.

Matters of passion between men and women naturally made her bashful!

"He is..."

Lu Mengyao glanced back, hesitating as she explained.

"Senior Brother Ye is in his room, but it's not really convenient right now..."

"Not convenient?"

"Why would..."

Su Nianwan was about to ask more when she suddenly froze.

Her gaze immediately turned toward the courtyard, as if understanding something...

Her face flushed instantly, embarrassed and at a loss, words dying on her lips.

She immediately understood what Lu Mengyao meant by "not convenient"...

It really wasn't convenient right now!

She couldn't exactly go in and watch, could she?

"Then... then I'll wait here for a bit!"

Su Nianwan said awkwardly.

She had been sent here to dual cultivate. She would have to face this sooner or later, but her composure was already shaken.

Lu Mengyao noticed Su Nianwan's discomfort and hesitantly offered a suggestion.

"Senior Sister Su, why don't you wait in the wing first?"

"You can use the time to set up the bridal chamber."

"Tonight you can... consummate your wedding night with Senior Brother Ye."

She had gone through the same arrangement yesterday and could now share her experience as someone who'd been through it...

"Bridal chamber..."

Su Nianwan's face reddened even more, looking enchanting and delicate.

After a moment's hesitation, she nodded.

"Then I'll trouble you, Junior Sister Lu!"

With Lu Mengyao leading the way, the two walked into the courtyard one after the other.

As they walked, Su Nianwan's cheeks grew increasingly flushed, the color spreading all the way to her ears.

She silently cursed her luck!

She stole a glance at Lu Mengyao ahead, who seemed perfectly composed, and said nothing.

But inside, she felt so embarrassed!

*Maybe these walls should be reinforced?*

Soon they entered an empty room and began setting it up...

In the adjacent room...

Gradually, silence fell.

"Senior Brother, it seems... someone's arrived in the courtyard!"

Lin Qingxue lay curled up in the corner, exhausted, her voice weak and feeble.

Her hearing was quite keen. Perhaps because her nerves were so heightened, even the faintest footsteps were noticeable to her.

Thinking of how wanton she'd just been, Lin Qingxue felt a wave of shame...

*That was way too embarrassing!*

*How was she supposed to face anyone after this!*

"Probably a disciple the Sect Master arranged."

Ye Chen had sensed the "outsider's" presence earlier but hadn't paid it any mind.

The only people who could come and go from this courtyard were the female disciples Liu Ruyan had assigned to him. Others couldn't enter at all.

They were all going to be his women eventually. What was there to worry about?

"The Sect Master?"

Hearing this, Lin Qingxue immediately understood what was happening.

Liu Ruyan had arranged another woman for Ye Chen!

One a day—wasn't that a bit too frequent?

Lin Qingxue felt a twinge of jealousy. At this rate, more and more sisters would be sharing Ye Chen with her, and private time would become increasingly rare.

With this thought, Lin Qingxue instinctively held Ye Chen tighter, nestling against his chest, feeling his heartbeat.

The warmth of their contact stirred ripples in both their hearts...

Ye Chen's desire, which had just cooled, began to stir once more. Like a dying flame doused in fuel, it roared back to life.

"Hm?"

"Senior Brother, you should... watch your health!"

Lin Qingxue sensed something amiss. Her face flushed as she warned him.

Her sweet, tender voice lingered in Ye Chen's ear like a cat's paw scratching at his heart, stirring his restless soul!

"Relax, my body's in great shape..."

Ye Chen spoke with complete confidence.

The next second, his reason was utterly consumed by the surging flames...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving the Immortal-Grade artifact Bright Moon Mirror (Inject a wisp of spiritual energy to activate. Can block one full-power strike from a Soul Transformation Stage expert!)]

Artifact grades were: Mortal, Treasure, Spirit, Immortal, Divine, and Imperial...

Among these, Immortal-Grade artifacts were already the limit of what most cultivators could possess.

Divine and Imperial-grade divine weapons existed only in legend. Even Liu Ruyan and the Blissful Union Sect's Grand Elders didn't own a single one!

An Immortal-Grade artifact was enough to drive countless experts in the Southern Wilderness Province mad with desire!
