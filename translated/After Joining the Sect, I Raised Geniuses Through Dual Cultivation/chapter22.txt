Three months later...

In a small courtyard of the Blissful Union Sect.

Lin Qingxue, Lu Mengyao, and Su Nianwan sat around a tea table in the courtyard, chatting amid peals of laughter.

All three had slightly rounded bellies—the first signs of pregnancy.

From time to time, they caressed their growing stomachs, faces beaming with happiness...

When they looked at Ye Chen, their eyes were filled with love, practically drawing out into threads.

Ye Chen sat off to the side brewing tea and cracking sunflower seeds, occasionally joining in the idle chatter.

Whenever his gaze happened to drift toward certain curves, he helplessly turned his head away, afraid he might lose control.

All three women had started showing at almost the same time, leaving Ye Chen idle for several months. Countless rounds of ammunition had nowhere to be released—he was about to burst.

When it rained, it poured; when it was dry, drought reigned.

Though the women could resume intimate activities once their pregnancies stabilized, Ye Chen worried his vigorous movements might harm the babies.

He was counting on the births to bring bountiful rewards—nothing could go wrong.

So these past days he'd been holding back. Even when Lin Qingxue and the others offered themselves, he hadn't acted rashly.

Just then, a disciple hurried into the courtyard and respectfully addressed Ye Chen.

"Senior Brother!"

"The Sect Master wishes to see you..."

"The Sect Master?"

Ye Chen was momentarily stunned.

What did Liu Ruyan want with him?

Could it be... she was going to assign him another wife?

Ye Chen's spirits immediately lifted. He told Lin Qingxue and the others to take good care of themselves during their pregnancies, then rose and headed out, his steps quick and eager.

Inside a great hall...

Liu Ruyan wore a plain white off-shoulder dress, the purple undergarment beneath barely visible through the fabric.

She reclined alone on a long couch, her alluring figure on full display.

She twirled a lock of hair around her finger, thoughts swirling through her mind...

Was she really going to make a move on a disciple?

If other disciples in the sect found out, how would she ever face anyone again?

Liu Ruyan's heart was caught in a fierce struggle!

Ever since Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao had frequently dual cultivated with Ye Chen and subsequently stepped into the Golden Core realm, it had undeniably proven Ye Chen's dual cultivation talent—that it truly helped boost cultivation...

Upon learning this news, Liu Ruyan had been waging an internal battle every day...

On one side, propriety and shame. On the other, the allure of the Void Refining Stage!

Every time she failed to break through to Void Refining, her heart yearned even more intensely to dual cultivate with Ye Chen...

Three months had passed. This desire had taken root in her heart and sprouted—she could no longer suppress her longing!

This time, Liu Ruyan had failed her breakthrough attempt yet again. She finally abandoned the notion of relying solely on hard cultivation and chose to have a passionate dual cultivation session to help her break through to Void Refining!

She was the Sect Master of the Blissful Union Sect—they weren't exactly some righteous orthodox sect. What need was there for propriety and shame?

In the eyes of many on the righteous path, the Blissful Union Sect was already considered demonic heresy.

At that moment, the sound of heavy footsteps came from outside the hall...

Ye Chen strode in and bowed toward Liu Ruyan ahead.

"This disciple greets the Sect Master!"

He snuck a glance at Liu Ruyan and quickly lowered his head, silently marveling at what a fine figure she had—an absolute little temptress.

He wondered who would be fortunate enough to bed such an exquisite beauty as Liu Ruyan.

"Do you know why I called you here?"

Liu Ruyan raised an eyebrow, her gaze falling on Ye Chen as she appraised him and asked.

She was quite curious whether the records of Ye Chen's previous performances were true—could he really go ten rounds in one night?

Could this frame of his really handle it?

Could it be fake...

"Is the Sect Master planning to arrange another female disciple for me?"

Ye Chen looked at Liu Ruyan with great interest, asking tentatively.

His heart was already filled with anticipation.

On his way over, he'd already figured out how many rounds of cultivation he'd put in tonight...

Ever since Lin Qingxue and the others had gotten pregnant, Ye Chen had lost his opportunities for dual cultivation.

Not only was his body unsatisfied, but he hadn't received any rewards either.

"You've guessed half right..."

Liu Ruyan narrowed her eyes and looked at Ye Chen with a smile.

"This Seat does indeed have such plans, but it isn't to arrange a female disciple for you..."

Hearing Liu Ruyan say this, Ye Chen was momentarily taken aback. A flicker of confusion crossed his mind.

"If not a female disciple, then who?"

Surely she couldn't be arranging a man for him?

He couldn't produce offspring that way...

"What do you think... of This Seat?"

Liu Ruyan asked with a smile, her eyes fixed directly on Ye Chen as she licked her moist lips.

"The Sect Master is naturally the number one beauty in the world..."

Ye Chen praised without reservation.

But the moment the words left his mouth, he suddenly froze...

What did Liu Ruyan mean by that?

Not arranging a female disciple—was she arranging herself instead?

How could that be possible!

Liu Ruyan was the Sect Master...

While Ye Chen was still pondering, Liu Ruyan had already risen to her feet and was walking toward him step by step.

As she drew close, an enchanting fragrance washed over him.

Just inhaling it made his whole body flush with heat.

Liu Ruyan moved closer to Ye Chen. She extended a slender finger and hooked it under his chin, looking at him with alluring eyes as she teased.

"Then... do you want to sleep with This Seat?"

*Gulp!*

Faced with such naked seduction, Ye Chen felt his mouth go dry and his whole body burn with unbearable heat. He wanted nothing more than to transform into a ravenous wolf and pounce.

A casual glance revealed tantalizing glimpses beneath her clothes.

Ye Chen's thoughts were in complete disarray—he could barely restrain himself.

"Sect Master, calm down..."

"This... isn't appropriate, is it?"

He looked at the bewitching Liu Ruyan before him, his heart full of questions.

What had gotten into Liu Ruyan?

Usually she presented herself as aloof and dignified in front of him. Why was she acting so completely out of character today?

Could she be deliberately teasing him?

Something in his gut told him there was a trap here...

This wasn't the Liu Ruyan he knew!

It was like a normally poised and demure female teacher suddenly transforming into a wanton seductress.

The contrast was somewhat difficult to adjust to.

Liu Ruyan drew even closer, practically pressing against Ye Chen's body. A pair of lively eyes fixed on him as she breathed softly.

"Calm down about what?"

"Could it be you don't want to sleep with This Seat?"

"No... that's not it..."

Ye Chen hastily shook his head.

A stunning beauty like Liu Ruyan—who wouldn't want to sleep with her?

In terms of both looks and figure, she was the epitome of perfection—an absolutely alluring little temptress. Just a few more glances were enough to leave one craving more.

"But..."

"But what?"

Liu Ruyan cut him off.

"Don't think of me as the Sect Master, and I won't think of you as a disciple."

"Here, there's only you and me!"

"Now—I want you to sleep with me!"

She looked at Ye Chen, speaking in a commanding tone.

Her silky hands slid onto Ye Chen's shoulders, wrapping around his neck...

Her coquettish voice echoed in Ye Chen's ears, making his heart itch as if a cat were scratching at it.

Ye Chen's mind seemed to explode. He stared in disbelief at Liu Ruyan, who was posing seductively and constantly tempting him before his eyes. Was he hallucinating?

Was this really the Liu Ruyan he knew?
