The Blissful Union Sect had been weak for a long time and had always yearned to grow stronger.

Every additional Void Refining Stage powerhouse held extraordinary significance for the sect.

Their mortal enemies, the Heavenly Demon Sect, had five Void Refining Stage powerhouses in residence. The Blissful Union Sect had previously matched them with five as well—the two sides were evenly balanced.

But now, as long as Liu Ruyan took this step and broke through to Void Refining, the Blissful Union Sect would be able to shake off the Heavenly Demon Sect's suppression and hold their heads high!

The commotion caused by the rolling heavenly thunder could be felt throughout the entire sect.

At this moment, many disciples within the sect were curiously gazing at the mountain peak where Liu Ruyan was undergoing tribulation, watching this Lightning Tribulation unfold.

In a small courtyard...

Ye Chen and the others were also drawn by the rumbling thunder. Without time to eat, they hurried out to the courtyard.

Their gazes were fixed on the Lightning Tribulation in the void, hearts filled with fear!

The tremendous power of those heavenly thunderbolts was beyond what they could withstand.

"Is that... the Sect Master undergoing tribulation?"

Lin Qingxue asked in surprise.

Apart from Liu Ruyan, there was no other Soul Transformation Stage powerhouse in the sect.

"That direction does seem to be where the Sect Master is..."

Lu Mengyao nodded.

"The Sect Master is at Peak Soul Transformation. Is she finally about to break through this bottleneck?"

Su Nianwan spoke with anticipation.

She was about to witness the emergence of a Void Refining Stage powerhouse with her own eyes!

"Rumor has it the Sect Master has been stuck at Peak Soul Transformation for many years. How did she suddenly trigger a Lightning Tribulation?"

Lu Mengyao said hesitantly, finding it somewhat sudden.

All three women paused, then turned in unison to look at Ye Chen...

They suddenly remembered that Ye Chen had apparently spent half the day at Liu Ruyan's place!

Could the timing really be that coincidental?

Earlier, they hadn't thought too much about it—after all, how could the Sect Master possibly dual cultivate with a disciple?

But now, seeing Liu Ruyan about to break through, a hint of suspicion crept into their hearts!

Others might not know about Ye Chen's dual cultivation talent, but the three of them had experienced it firsthand. They knew exactly how significant the effects of dual cultivating with Ye Chen were!

After every session, their cultivation would improve dramatically!

They had gone from Foundation Establishment all the way to Golden Core—this feeling was all too familiar!

"Senior Brother, you didn't... actually sleep with the Sect Master, did you?"

Lu Mengyao was direct and said whatever was on her mind, asking outright.

Lin Qingxue and Su Nianwan stared wide-eyed at Ye Chen with disbelief...

Though the two of them hadn't spoken, their gazes said everything!

"This..."

Meeting the three women's stares, Ye Chen hesitated for a moment. Deciding not to hide it, he nodded in admission!

"Yes!"

"The Sect Master and I... dual cultivated!"

Lin Qingxue and the others weren't outsiders—they were the people closest to him, and they could trust each other.

The three women's interests were bound together with Ye Chen's. If anything happened to him, the three of them would inevitably suffer as well. They would never betray him.

*Hiss!*

"Senior Brother, you're really something!"

"Even the Sect Master, you..."

Hearing this answer, Lin Qingxue and the others looked at Ye Chen in shock, giving him a thumbs up...

Their admiration came from the bottom of their hearts!

This was something they wouldn't have dared to imagine—a disciple actually sleeping with the Sect Master...

If Ye Chen hadn't said it himself, the three of them wouldn't have believed it was true.

Yet thinking about it, everything made sense.

Ye Chen's dual cultivation abilities were too heaven-defying. Any woman who wanted to improve would be unable to resist wanting to dual cultivate with him...

Just lying down and improving cultivation—this was tempting for any cultivator!

Ye Chen smiled wryly as he explained, "This matter absolutely cannot be spoken of to anyone!"

"Don't worry, Senior Brother. We know what's at stake!"

"My lips are sealed..."

"I swear!"

The three women immediately promised.

They all knew how significant this matter was. It not only concerned Liu Ruyan's dignity as Sect Master but would also expose Ye Chen's dual cultivation talent.

Once this secret spread, it would bring endless trouble to Ye Chen.

Even they themselves would be in mortal danger!

Hearing the three of them say this, Ye Chen nodded with relief.

Suddenly, the spiritual energy within his body began to surge wildly...

"This is..."

Ye Chen's expression shifted. He immediately sat down cross-legged.

He was about to break through as well!

Though his cultivation had already advanced by leaps and bounds over the past three months, reaching Peak Golden Core, he had cultivated with Liu Ruyan for half a day. Besides earning pill and talisman rewards, he had also accumulated several decades of cultivation!

This massive amount of cultivation was enough to push him toward the Nascent Soul realm!

From Golden Core to Nascent Soul was an extremely difficult barrier for cultivators to cross—the slightest mistake could result in soul destruction!

Ye Chen recalled a pill he had obtained while dual cultivating with Liu Ruyan. He immediately retrieved the Core Formation Pill from his storage ring!

The pill was pure white throughout, crystalline and translucent, emitting a rich fragrance and containing a force of divine soul power!

Without any hesitation, he placed the pill in his mouth and swallowed it!

Then he closed his eyes, circulating his cultivation method to guide the spiritual energy within his body to assault the realm barrier...

"Senior Brother..."

Lin Qingxue and the others were stunned by Ye Chen's sudden actions.

But they quickly realized Ye Chen was about to break through to Nascent Soul!

"Quick—protect Senior Brother while he cultivates!"

Su Nianwan was the first to react, speaking in a low, urgent voice.

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao nodded, spreading out to surround Ye Chen protectively.

They knew this was a critical moment for Ye Chen's breakthrough. No one could be allowed to disturb him!

In an instant, the courtyard fell into deathly silence!

Only the rumbling from the distant void continued...

Liu Ruyan, who was also breaking through at the same time, was currently enduring the baptism of the Lightning Tribulation!

"The fifth heavenly thunder!"

Liu Ruyan gritted her teeth and endured.

By now, she had lost all her earlier elegance.

The Nine-Treasure Glazed Lamp before her was dim, her clothes scorched, a trace of blood at the corner of her mouth—she looked utterly bedraggled...

The power of the heavenly thunder exceeded her expectations. Now there was no retreat—she could only continue to endure!

"I'm going all in!"

"I must break through to Void Refining!"

"For the sect!"

Liu Ruyan steeled herself.

She gave it everything she had, unleashing all her potential.

Spiritual energy surged wildly around her, resisting the heavenly thunder's bombardment!

*Boom—*

The sixth heavenly thunder descended in response...

*Crack!*

A crisp sound came from within Liu Ruyan's body...

The cultivation bottleneck that had troubled her for decades shattered in an instant!

In a flash, spiritual energy from all around rushed madly into her body...

Liu Ruyan's aura surged continuously, growing stronger and stronger!

The sect elders watching from a distance were overjoyed at the sight!

"She did it!"

"Wonderful—Ruyan has also broken through to Void Refining!"

"Our Blissful Union Sect gains another Void Refining Stage powerhouse..."

"We no longer need to fear the Heavenly Demon Sect—at worst, we'll just wipe them out!"

Several Supreme Elders were so moved they had tears in their eyes, their emotions running high.

Liu Ruyan's breakthrough brought new life to the declining Blissful Union Sect!

It also gave them the courage to stand tall against their enemies...
