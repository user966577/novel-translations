Outside the great hall...

On his way back to the small courtyard, Ye Chen felt deeply puzzled.

His mind was filled with the way Liu Ruyan had been staring at him...

It felt like he was about to be devoured!

Could it be that the Sect Master had... certain thoughts about him?

Was she planning to steal his talent or something?

Just then, Ye Chen suddenly shivered, goosebumps rising across his skin, a chill running down his spine...

It felt as though a wolf had locked onto him!

This feeling was intense—even colder than the sensation of Liu Ruyan watching him earlier.

Ye Chen continued walking without any visible reaction, though his mind had gone on high alert.

He was certain someone was watching him, but he couldn't yet identify them...

One of Liu Ruyan's people?

Impossible. He already lived in a monitored courtyard—Liu Ruyan had no need to send someone to secretly tail him.

Besides, they were inside the sect.

Apart from Liu Ruyan, that only left other factions within the sect...

Ye Chen remembered Liu Ruyan mentioning that he should watch out for Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan!

That woman had always coveted the Sect Master's position, building factions within the sect to rival Liu Ruyan.

This had to be one of her people!

With this realization, Ye Chen actually relaxed, no longer so tense.

As long as it wasn't someone from the Profound Heaven Holy Land or the Zhang family, he didn't need to worry about his life being in danger.

As for the open and covert struggles within the sect, the ultimate goal was merely to obtain Ye Chen—no one would let any harm come to him.

Ye Chen walked all the way back to his courtyard. The person who'd been watching him never appeared.

The courtyard gate closed!

Not far away, around a corner, Jiang Yuyan withdrew her gaze, a flicker of curiosity crossing her face.

"What secret does this kid have?"

"Why else would Liu Ruyan and the Grand Elder prefer to offend the Profound Heaven Holy Land rather than hand him over?"

Jiang Yuyan muttered to herself, heart full of questions.

Liu Ruyan's earlier insistence on protecting Ye Chen had already aroused her suspicions.

She couldn't understand why a disciple with a mere Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root could make Liu Ruyan, the Sect Master herself, care so much.

After all, the Blissful Union Sect had thousands of inner and outer disciples combined—Liu Ruyan couldn't possibly show such concern for every single one.

Let alone arrange a special courtyard, with trusted disciples guarding the gate!

And even send three female disciples as companions!

There had to be a secret here!

Jiang Yuyan's mind began working, determined to figure out what was going on...

Perhaps she could use whatever secret Ye Chen held to make a big move, toppling Liu Ruyan and becoming Sect Master of the Blissful Union Sect herself!

She had yearned for the Sect Master's position for many years!

In the courtyard...

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao were both cultivating in the yard. Seeing Ye Chen return, they immediately rushed over enthusiastically.

"Senior Brother, you're back!"

"You must be tired. Come sit and rest for a bit."

"Do you want something to eat?"

Both were attentive and considerate, greatly concerned about Ye Chen's health, afraid he'd overexert himself.

After several sessions, Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao had both confirmed one thing—dual cultivating with Ye Chen could rapidly increase their cultivation!

This undoubtedly showed them a path to becoming stronger...

Under these circumstances, they naturally paid extra attention to Ye Chen's body—so he could last longer in bed for more dual cultivation sessions!

Just lie down and break through realms!

"No need, I'm not hungry..."

Ye Chen waved his hand. He'd eaten breakfast before heading out.

His gaze swept around the courtyard, a flicker of confusion crossing his face.

"Where's Nianwan?"

"Is she resting in her room?"

Ye Chen asked.

He remembered that before he'd left, Su Nianwan had woken up first and was cultivating in the courtyard. Her cultivation had broken through to Golden Core!

Could it be that last night's exertions had worn her out, and after her breakthrough, she'd gone back to rest?

That was certainly possible.

Under the enticement of two years of cultivation rewards, Ye Chen had gone ten rounds through the night until dawn!

By the end, Su Nianwan had barely made a sound...

"She's not in her room..."

"Sister Su went back to pack her things. She'll move in later!"

Lin Qingxue shook her head and explained.

The three of them had been arranged by Liu Ruyan to serve Ye Chen, so from now on they were all his women and would naturally live together.

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao had already moved their belongings from their original disciples' quarters to this small courtyard.

Su Nianwan had arrived in a hurry yesterday. After dual cultivating with Ye Chen all night, she too had begun the moving process.

"I see!"

Ye Chen nodded in understanding, not giving it much thought.

He didn't need to worry about Su Nianwan running away—she'd already given him her first night. There was no reason to flee afterward.

"Both of your cultivations... have improved quite fast!"

Ye Chen looked at Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao before him, his face showing surprise.

Only now did he notice that both had broken through...

When they'd first met, Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao had only been at Early Foundation Establishment. Now one was at Mid Foundation Establishment, and the other had even reached Peak Foundation Establishment.

The change was dramatic!

Earlier in bed, he'd been so focused on plowing away that he hadn't noticed their realm changes at all.

It was only now, after his own breakthrough to Peak Foundation Establishment, that he could tell at a glance.

"This is all thanks to Senior Brother's efforts!"

"Otherwise, we wouldn't have improved so quickly..."

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao blushed, gazing shyly at Ye Chen as they spoke.

Without Ye Chen's diligent cultivation, there was no way they could have broken through so rapidly...

They were deeply grateful to Ye Chen, though some things were too embarrassing to say aloud.

"My efforts?"

Ye Chen was momentarily stunned. Looking at the two blushing women, he immediately understood what was going on...

He hadn't expected that during dual cultivation, not only could he receive system rewards, but the female disciples he cultivated with could also gain cultivation boosts.

This was killing two birds with one stone!

Ye Chen suddenly recalled the ambiguous look Liu Ruyan had given him earlier, immediately guessing what she'd been thinking!

So that's how it was—Liu Ruyan wanted to sleep with him...

She must have learned that dual cultivation could increase cultivation and developed the idea of dual cultivating with him!

On his way back, Ye Chen had sensed Liu Ruyan was plotting something.

Now that he knew her purpose, he actually felt relieved...

If she was just after his body, dual cultivation wasn't out of the question.

What was sleeping with one more woman?

His body could absolutely handle it...

Right now, Ye Chen welcomed all comers—this way he could also obtain rewards.

The Earth-Grade Spiritual Root Su Nianwan had brought Ye Chen double rewards. He was quite curious about Liu Ruyan's talent—what rewards would he get from one dual cultivation session with her?

Perhaps going at it for one night could directly let him break through several realms!

Next time he went to see Liu Ruyan, he could ask what she thought...

Mutual benefit—why not?
