After lunch, Ye Chen looked at Lin Qingxue and the others seated before him, raising an eyebrow.

"Does anyone want to take a nap with me?"

At these words, the four women instantly blushed and quickly shook their heads in refusal.

"Senior Brother, I'm not tired..."

Lin Qingxue was too embarrassed to nap with Ye Chen during the day, afraid the noise would be heard.

"Senior Brother, I don't need to either."

Lu Mengyao waved her hand—she was a little scared.

"I'm actually quite energetic. I'd like to bask in the sun a bit longer..."

Su Nianwan's eyes darted away. She wanted to rest for a few days, otherwise she really couldn't handle it.

Ye Chen could only turn to Zhao Ling'er...

"Ling'er, what about you?"

He asked.

Meeting Ye Chen's gaze, Zhao Ling'er's face flushed bright red. She shyly lowered her head and spoke in a muffled voice.

"Senior Brother, please let me rest a while..."

Her voice carried a hint of pleading...

Zhao Ling'er didn't want to die on her first day in this small courtyard...

"Well..."

Ye Chen looked at the embarrassed women refusing him and sighed helplessly.

"Alright, since none of you are tired, I'll go sleep by myself..."

"Let's meet... tonight!"

Ye Chen said meaningfully.

This made the four women blush again, shooting Ye Chen coy, reproachful glances...

Ye Chen rose and left alone, returning to the empty room where he was the only one.

Yet Ye Chen had no intention of getting into bed to rest. Instead, he took out a Clone Talisman from his storage ring!

He now had several Clone Talismans, and even one Advanced Clone Talisman.

He immediately infused spiritual energy, activating the talisman in his hand...

The next second, an identical clone of himself truly appeared beside Ye Chen, possessing half of his cultivation.

The clone was lifelike, indistinguishable from Ye Chen's real body, but carried none of his aura, making it difficult to lock onto with spiritual sense.

Ye Chen knew he was certainly under close surveillance by the sect's powerful cultivators. Though it was for protection, it also prevented him from leaving the sect.

Once he left this small courtyard, he would be closely watched wherever he went. Leaving wouldn't be easy.

If he wanted to investigate the location of the Profound Heaven Holy Land, he could only send his clone. That was safer—even if he encountered Profound Heaven Holy Land's experts, only a clone would die.

As long as he could determine the Profound Heaven Holy Land's location and find an opportunity to infiltrate and locate his sister Ye Qing'er, he would have a way to rescue her.

Ye Chen immediately used his will to control the clone, having it quietly climb out the window to avoid being spotted by Lin Qingxue and the others in the courtyard, then circle around to the back gate of the small courtyard...

Along the way, he avoided many sect disciples and left through the sect's back mountain without incident.

Several months ago, after the Blissful Union Sect's two Supreme Elders had attacked and killed the Profound Heaven Holy Land's experts, the sect had activated its protective grand array to guard against retaliation. Getting out was easy, but getting back in was difficult—any external force that approached would be attacked by the array.

Yet in the months that had passed, the Blissful Union Sect hadn't faced any retaliatory strike from the Profound Heaven Holy Land, leaving the sect's leadership puzzled.

They had killed a Void Refining elder from the Profound Heaven Holy Land, yet there was no response?

That was rather strange!

The sect leadership had prepared for a fight to the death—if they couldn't win, they would protect Ye Chen and some female disciples and flee, waiting for a chance to rise again.

The situation allowed the leadership to breathe easier, though they still didn't deactivate the protective array.

Even though maintaining the array daily consumed considerable spirit stones, it provided an extra layer of security for the sect.

The clone passed through the barrier of the protective array and swiftly moved through the mountain forest.

He still didn't dare fly through the air, to avoid exposing himself.

This area was still too close to the Blissful Union Sect. Being spotted by accident would be troublesome.

The clone moved quickly. While passing through a grove, it suddenly stopped...

He looked up sharply, a hint of surprise crossing his face.

In the forest...

Five disciples wearing black sect robes were heading toward the Blissful Union Sect, moving carefully, stopping periodically to observe their surroundings with extreme caution.

"Senior Brother, that's not far ahead—the barrier of the Blissful Union Sect's array. Are we really going to keep going forward?"

"How could we possibly find a flaw in their protective array? This is clearly sending us to our deaths..."

"If the Blissful Union Sect's array locks onto our auras, we're done for."

A female disciple spoke to the lead male disciple, her voice tinged with nervousness.

The lead male disciple glanced back at her and smiled reassuringly.

"Don't worry, Junior Sister. As long as we don't force our way into the Blissful Union Sect, their array won't attack us randomly."

"Let's go a bit further and observe the Blissful Union Sect's formation up close, see if we can find a way to sneak in."

"If we could capture a Blissful Union Sect disciple, that would be perfect. Then we might be able to disguise ourselves and enter, saving us the risk... and we could have some fun too..."

The other male disciples also wore lecherous grins.

The Blissful Union Sect was mostly female disciples, and they were all quite beautiful. Due to practicing the Blissful Union secret techniques, they all had a unique, alluring quality.

Many hostile sects would abduct Blissful Union Sect disciples as playthings.

The female disciple hesitated but nodded, saying nothing more.

At this point she couldn't back out alone, or returning empty-handed would mean punishment from the sect.

The group continued forward but quickly halted, instantly on alert.

"Who's there? Come out!"

"I can see you!"

The lead male disciple stared at the foliage ahead, shouting warily.

The others also drew their weapons, spiritual energy gathering around them, ready to strike at any moment.

Just then, a young man walked out of the undergrowth, his expression calm without a trace of nervousness, striding directly toward the five disciples.

"Who are you?"

The lead male disciple demanded loudly.

Ye Chen ignored him, continuing forward...

"A Blissful Union Sect disciple?"

"You're courting death!"

Seeing that the other party ignored him and was getting closer, the lead male disciple immediately attacked...

"Myriad Demon Palm!"

He thrust his palm toward Ye Chen, demonic energy surging...

*BANG!*

A spiritual energy barrier appeared around Ye Chen, effortlessly blocking what appeared to be a powerful palm strike.

"You..."

The male disciple's expression turned to shock—he hadn't expected his opponent to be this strong.

Before he could react, Ye Chen had already grabbed him by the throat.

"Senior Brother..."

"Let go of Senior Brother..."

"Attack together!"

Seeing this, the other disciples immediately joined forces to attack Ye Chen...

Ye Chen merely glanced at them, his other hand striking out...

*BANG!*

*Splurt!*

*Splurt!*

The four disciples instantly coughed up blood and were sent flying. The next moment, they were dead.

They were only at Foundation Establishment. Ye Chen's casual strike was enough to kill them.
