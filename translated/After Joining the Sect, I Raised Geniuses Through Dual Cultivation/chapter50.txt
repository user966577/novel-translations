Moments later...

"You're saying..."

"Your Heavenly Demon Sect has allied with the Thousand Feather Sect and Spirit Water Sect, planning to carve up our Blissful Union Sect together?"

"Is this true?"

The Grand Elder stared at the white-bearded elder before him with an expression of disbelief and shock, a hint of panic rising in his heart.

The Thousand Feather Sect and Spirit Water Sect were both sects from the Southern Wasteland. Their strength was somewhat weaker, but they still had several Void Refining experts.

If the three major sects joined forces against the Blissful Union Sect, there was no way they could hold...

The other Supreme Elders present also changed their expressions, their composure cracking.

For the Blissful Union Sect, this was nothing short of catastrophe...

"Hehe..."

"Would this old man need to lie to you?"

"Before long, the three great sects will flatten your Blissful Union Sect!"

"When that happens, from the Sect Master down to the disciples, everyone will become our Heavenly Demon Sect's playthings..."

"Hahahaha!"

The white-bearded elder laughed smugly, his mood quite elated. It was as if he had forgotten his pain.

Especially seeing the nervous expressions on the Supreme Elders' faces—it felt wonderful...

Seeing this, the Second Elder's expression darkened. His saber fell swiftly.

The blade flashed!

*Splurt!*

An arm was severed and sent flying...

"AHHH!!!"

The white-bearded elder's pupils dilated as he screamed in agony, his face turning even paler.

The pain nearly made him pass out...

"Kill me! Hurry up and kill me!"

"I've told you everything I should. Stop torturing me..."

The white-bearded elder pleaded.

Having fallen into the hands of the Blissful Union Sect's experts, he knew death was certain. There was no way he would leave alive. He only hoped for a quick death without further suffering.

If not for the Supreme Elders forcibly suppressing his cultivation, he would have considered self-destructing to take them with him.

The Grand Elder glanced at him, said nothing, and merely gave the Second Elder another look!

The next second, the blade fell...

*Splurt!*

The white-bearded elder's head flew off, and his life force vanished instantly...

The primordial spirit that emerged from his body was also obliterated by the rampaging blade aura.

The Second Elder reached out and grabbed the white-bearded elder's storage ring.

A Void Refining expert's storage ring contained quite a few valuables...

"Let's go, back to find the Sect Master!"

"This concerns the survival of the Blissful Union Sect. We can't delay..."

The Grand Elder spoke gravely.

The other Supreme Elders nodded in agreement, tension evident in their expressions.

The group flew away, ignoring the wounded Heavenly Demon Sect disciples in the forest...

These ants weren't worth their attention. The sect's ordinary disciples would come to capture them!

The protective array had been attacked, and the Supreme Elders had mobilized together. At the same time, the sect's elite disciples had been deployed...

By now, Blissful Union Sect disciples had surrounded the entire forest, capturing Heavenly Demon Sect disciples everywhere. Small skirmishes broke out throughout, but the Heavenly Demon Sect disciples were quickly subdued...

The Heavenly Demon Sect disciples were no weaklings—these were all sect elites. But they had been caught in the aftermath of the Void Refining experts' battle and were all significantly injured. Being alive was already lucky enough. Now they had no ability to resist whatsoever...

In one section of the forest...

Several female Heavenly Demon Sect disciples were fleeing, with Blissful Union Sect disciples in pursuit!

"Senior Sister, you go first!"

"I'll stay behind to buy time..."

"Let's save whoever we can!"

One female disciple stopped, resolutely turning to charge at the Blissful Union Sect disciples...

"Junior Sister Zhou!"

The graceful woman at the front called out worriedly, wanting to pull her along. But another female disciple grabbed her and dragged her away.

"Senior Sister Wang, let's go!"

"Otherwise none of us will escape."

"Don't let Junior Sister Zhou's sacrifice be in vain..."

Hearing this, the graceful woman knew their situation was dire. Without time to think more, she quickened her pace.

But after only a few steps, more Blissful Union Sect disciples surrounded them.

"Senior Sister Wang, you go!"

"We'll hold them off..."

The remaining female disciples didn't hesitate to stay behind and buy time.

Even if it meant sacrificing themselves, they would ensure the graceful woman escaped.

"All of you, come with me!"

Wang Yuxuan urged anxiously.

Watching her junior sisters charge toward the Blissful Union Sect disciples without looking back, her heart ached with reluctance.

She bit her lip helplessly and turned to continue fleeing.

If she was also captured by the Blissful Union Sect disciples, all those female disciples would have died for nothing.

Wang Yuxuan pushed herself to the limit, weaving swiftly through the forest...

The noise around her gradually faded. It seemed the Blissful Union Sect pursuers were falling behind.

But she didn't dare relax at all. This was still Blissful Union Sect territory—she hadn't escaped danger yet.

Suddenly, a figure appeared in her path, blocking the way...

"So many disciples willing to sacrifice themselves to protect you..."

"Your status in the Heavenly Demon Sect must be quite high?"

Hearing this, Wang Yuxuan's heart sank. Her expression changed as she quickly stopped.

Maintaining her distance, she warily sized up the young man before her, catching her breath.

"Are you also... a Blissful Union Sect disciple?"

The young man wasn't wearing Blissful Union Sect robes, so Wang Yuxuan couldn't immediately identify him.

He seemed unfamiliar—not someone she knew—yet he was in Blissful Union Sect territory. Her first thought was that he was an enemy.

The newcomer was Ye Chen!

After using his attack to alert the Blissful Union Sect's Supreme Elders and exposing the Heavenly Demon Sect squad's position with the Thunder Burst Talisman, he had been watching the battle from within the forest.

Seeing the Heavenly Demon Sect's Void Refining elder defeated, Ye Chen prepared to leave to avoid being discovered by the Blissful Union Sect disciples.

After all, he was a clone who had snuck out.

But halfway there, he encountered Wang Yuxuan, who was also fleeing, and witnessed the many Heavenly Demon Sect disciples sacrificing themselves to cover her escape. He couldn't help but speculate...

She definitely wasn't just some senior sister. Her position in the Heavenly Demon Sect must be quite high—otherwise, so many disciples wouldn't be protecting her!

If it wasn't her remarkable strength, then it had to be her remarkable status!

Such a person couldn't be allowed to escape easily.

Capturing her would give the Blissful Union Sect leverage against the Heavenly Demon Sect...

"You can't escape. Stop running!"

Ye Chen looked at her and spoke calmly.

Hearing this, Wang Yuxuan's heart sank. Realizing that Ye Chen before her was foe rather than friend, her expression turned grim...

"Without trying, how would I know?"

She had no intention of surrendering.

As one of the Heavenly Demon Sect's brightest young talents, Wang Yuxuan was already at Early Golden Core, her strength far surpassing her peers.

Looking at Ye Chen, who appeared to be around her age, she couldn't see through his cultivation. But she guessed he couldn't be that powerful—probably just some Foundation Establishment disciple.

The Blissful Union Sect's younger generation was in decline, with very few disciples at Golden Core or Nascent Soul. This was common knowledge.

This gave Wang Yuxuan the courage to fight!

He was alone. Maybe she could break through...
