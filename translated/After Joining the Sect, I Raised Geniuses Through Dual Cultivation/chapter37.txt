Night gradually deepened...

Ye Chen closed the hall doors and turned to walk toward the small courtyard.

His steps were slow and somewhat weak, his body growing increasingly feeble...

"That little vixen!"

"She's going to be the death of me..."

Ye Chen muttered, shaking his head as he departed.

Although Liu Ruyan hadn't urged him to leave like last time—she had even asked him to stay—Ye Chen still didn't remain.

He was worried that if the Supreme Elders found out he had slept with Liu Ruyan, they would chop him to pieces.

Had there ever been a disciple who bedded his own Sect Master?

He was also quite anxious. It wouldn't even take ten months—before long, Liu Ruyan's belly might start to show.

How would he explain that?

A belly doesn't grow on its own, does it?

How would the sect disciples view him after that?

Ye Chen's thoughts churned. When he looked up, he had already returned to the small courtyard.

Just as he stepped into the courtyard, Lin Qingxue and the others came to greet him...

"Senior Brother, you're back!"

"You must be hungry, right? The food is ready..."

"Come inside, Senior Brother. It's cold outside."

"You must be exhausted, Senior Brother?"

The three women hurried to Ye Chen's side, showing concern and care as they pulled him toward the house.

They were like gentle, virtuous wives waiting for their husband to come home, thoughtful and attentive.

Ye Chen felt warmth in his heart, smiling as he shook his head.

"Not tired..."

Though all his work was physical labor, he could still handle just one Liu Ruyan.

But making the three women wait for him all day did make him feel guilty.

He had left at dawn for the back mountain to practice martial techniques, and hadn't returned until dark...

He hadn't expected to be out so late. He had originally planned to find a secluded spot to test a technique and come right back, but then he ran into Liu Ruyan...

And that had taken up the entire day.

"Why don't you ask where I've been all day?"

Ye Chen looked at the three of them curiously.

When he had returned late at night before, they had been worried sick. This time they didn't even ask, as if they were used to it.

Hearing this, Lin Qingxue glanced at Ye Chen, her face flushing slightly as she spoke in a soft voice.

"Didn't Senior Brother go to see the Sect Master?"

"How did you know?"

Ye Chen was surprised.

He hadn't told the three of them where he was going before he left!

"Where else would Senior Brother go besides to fool around with the Sect Master?"

Lu Mengyao pouted, her voice tinged with jealousy.

She didn't mind Ye Chen being with other women; she was just a little moody from being neglected all day.

Ye Chen was stunned. Was this really how they saw him?

They didn't think every time he went out, it was to dual cultivate with Liu Ruyan, did they?

Not doing anything serious at all?

Was he really that improper?

Ye Chen took a deep breath and looked at the three of them with a serious expression.

"If I said I was practicing martial techniques with the Sect Master, would you believe me?"

The three women didn't even hesitate before shaking their heads in unison.

Ye Chen: ???

Fine, so he really was that lecherous in their eyes?

How vexing!

At this moment, he also realized he had been rather blatant lately.

He kept spending entire days at Liu Ruyan's residence!

It was only natural that Lin Qingxue and the others would think this way.

But what if other disciples or elders had also noticed?

He had only fooled around with Liu Ruyan a few times, and Lin Qingxue and the others already assumed he dual cultivated with the Sect Master every time.

If he fooled around a few more times, wouldn't the entire sect be able to guess?

This wouldn't do!

Ye Chen gritted his teeth and made a difficult decision!

From now on, when he went to see Liu Ruyan, he would have to be quick and careful, making sure no one saw him!

"Senior Brother, don't worry. We won't be jealous!"

"As long as you have us in your heart, that's enough..."

Lin Qingxue said softly, her face reddening.

She seemed afraid Ye Chen would worry about this and specifically explained.

Lu Mengyao and Su Nianwan also gazed at Ye Chen with deep affection, nodding earnestly.

"Being able to stay by Senior Brother's side and serve you is already more than enough for me."

"We would never ask Senior Brother to restrain himself!"

Hearing the three of them say this, Ye Chen was deeply moved.

Where else could he find such wonderful women?

And he had found three of them at once...

"Let's eat!"

Ye Chen spoke.

He silently noted to himself that no matter how much he fooled around outside, he would never neglect the three of them when he came home...

"Mm-hmm!"

The three women nodded and sat down, thoughtfully serving Ye Chen food.

Having been busy all day, Ye Chen devoured the table full of delicious dishes, cleaning everything up in no time.

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao quietly rose to clear the bowls and dishes, heading outside...

"Senior Brother, are you full?"

Su Nianwan looked at Ye Chen and asked.

"I'm full..."

Ye Chen nodded. He had eaten until he was stuffed.

After all, he hadn't eaten anything all day. Between practicing martial techniques on the back mountain and expending so much physical energy, half the food on the table had gone into his stomach.

"Senior Brother, are you really... full?"

"Full..."

Ye Chen's expression froze. He didn't understand why Su Nianwan was asking twice. When he turned and met those watery eyes, it suddenly clicked...

"Actually... I'm not that full!"

A mischievous smile appeared on Ye Chen's face.

He wasn't the kind of man who played favorites!

Well-fed and satisfied, Ye Chen was once again full of energy...

The door closed, and the candle flickered out.

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving two years of cultivation as a reward!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Thunder Burst Talisman!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Endless Vitality Pill!]*

Ye Chen looked at the Thunder Burst Talisman in his hand, a hint of joy crossing his face!

Though it wasn't as powerful as the Immortal-Slaying Talisman, it was still a high-grade talisman.

If an ordinary family possessed a single Thunder Burst Talisman, it would be enough to deter troublemakers and protect the family's glory for centuries.

Besides that, he had also obtained an Endless Vitality Pill. Though it couldn't increase cultivation or heal injuries, it was extremely helpful for Ye Chen!

It was essentially an extra round of opportunity!

Considering that Su Nianwan was already pregnant, Ye Chen didn't use the Endless Vitality Pill, instead exercising restraint.

A night of pleasant dreams...

When the sky was just beginning to lighten, Ye Chen suddenly opened his eyes and sat up silently.

He glanced back at Su Nianwan, who was still sleeping soundly. Rather than disturbing her, Ye Chen put on his clothes and left the room.

He gently closed the door. The courtyard was quiet and still.

The moments before dawn were when people slept most deeply; most were still in their dreams.

If not for Ye Chen's subconscious desire to wake early, he might still be sound asleep too.

He walked straight into an empty room, and after closing the door, took out a Teleportation Talisman from his storage ring!

This Teleportation Talisman could take him to any location in his memory!

Without hesitation, Ye Chen infused it with spiritual energy and activated the talisman...

He had been waiting for this day for a long time!

Zhang Shuyu, the Zhang family—I, Ye Chen, have returned!
