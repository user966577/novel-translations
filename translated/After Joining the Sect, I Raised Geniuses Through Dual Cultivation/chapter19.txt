"Senior Brother..."

"You... your injuries..."

Su Nianwan murmured shyly.

She buried her head down, not daring to look at Ye Chen...

A hint of worry still lingered in her heart.

"I told you, this little wound is nothing..."

"Don't worry!"

Ye Chen looked at her with a playful gleam in his eyes, moving closer...

Su Nianwan's face grew even redder, her thoughts growing increasingly scattered...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving two years of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one bottle of Cultivation Enhancement Pills!]

In the courtyard...

Lin Qingxue's and Lu Mengyao's faces suddenly flushed red.

They exchanged glances, words dying on their lips, cheeks red as ripe apples...

"Senior Brother... is this?"

"This... Senior Brother's injuries..."

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao hesitated, worried about Ye Chen's wounds.

A certain suspicion had formed in their minds.

They quickly stopped in their tracks, cheeks burning hot.

They were thin-skinned and feeling rather embarrassed at the moment.

Thinking about it, Ye Chen's injuries probably weren't that serious after all. Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao gradually put their worries to rest.

"Mengyao, should we... perhaps leave first?"

Lin Qingxue suggested in a small voice, face red with embarrassment.

"O-okay!"

Lu Mengyao nodded in agreement.

They couldn't very well go in and disturb them at a time like this.

"Looks like we won't need to call them for dinner..."

Lu Mengyao murmured softly.

They knew Ye Chen well—this dinner would probably turn into a midnight snack, or maybe even breakfast.

Lin Qingxue tiptoed to the door and thoughtfully closed it.

Then the two of them picked up the food boxes and quietly left.

Silent as mice, leaving Ye Chen and Su Nianwan their private time.

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving two years of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Endless Vitality Pill!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Thunder Burst Talisman (Inject spiritual energy to activate. Power comparable to a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator's full-power strike!)]

Ye Chen listened to the stream of reward notifications in his mind. The appearance of the Thunder Burst Talisman lifted his spirits considerably...

As a fellow offensive talisman, though its power wasn't as strong as the Immortal-Slaying Talisman, it undoubtedly gave Ye Chen hope!

He seemed to be getting closer and closer to obtaining another Immortal-Slaying Talisman.

As if the next moment, he might receive one...

Ye Chen retrieved an Endless Vitality Pill from his storage ring and swallowed it without hesitation!

Three seconds later, he felt all the fatigue in his body dissipate completely. His energy was restored to peak condition in an instant...

With the Endless Vitality Pill's boost, Ye Chen felt he could do it again!

He refused to believe he couldn't get an Immortal-Slaying Talisman!

"Sen... Senior Brother..."

"You... what pill... did you take?"

Su Nianwan looked at Ye Chen. She seemed to catch a whiff of medicinal fragrance and asked in shock.

Not only that, but Ye Chen now seemed like a completely different person!

This made her even more worried about his body—after all, he was still injured.

"Relax!"

"What, is this your first day knowing Senior Brother?!"

Ye Chen spoke with absolute confidence.

He had complete faith in the pills rewarded by the system. At the very least, they had no side effects whatsoever—nothing to worry about.

The only consideration was their effectiveness!

Su Nianwan: ???

Night fell over the small courtyard...

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao stayed in their respective rooms with doors and windows shut tight.

Both tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. Faces flushed, hearts restless, an indescribable heat coursing through them.

Thoughts drifting, growing more and more chaotic...

"Why is Senior Brother like this..."

"Has he lost his mind?"

They each muttered quietly to themselves, hearts unsettled.

Closing their eyes yet unable to fall asleep, the long hours seemed unbelievable to them.

Seeing that dawn was nearly breaking, tonight was destined to be a sleepless night...

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao both fell into deep thought.

Without realizing it, they suddenly missed Ye Chen terribly!

At the same time, they worried about Ye Chen's body. He was still injured—wasn't he going to exhaust himself?

They even worried whether Su Nianwan's body could hold out...

She wouldn't be played to death by Ye Chen, would she?

In a nearby courtyard...

The Grand Elder, who had been meditating in a side chamber, suddenly opened his eyes. He glanced in the direction of the neighboring courtyard, an odd expression crossing his face as he furrowed his brow.

His mood at this moment was rather complicated...

"Isn't this kid tired after all this time?"

"Wasn't he injured?"

"Doesn't seem too serious though..."

"Ah, youth is wonderful..."

He sighed softly, eyes full of envy.

Forget about now—even in his youth, he'd never been like this...

The Grand Elder shook his head and closed his eyes to continue cultivating.

As long as Ye Chen wasn't in danger, he wouldn't reveal himself.

At the same time, he was quite curious about what Liu Ruyan had told him before—might there be any surprises in store?

He was rather looking forward to it!

At dawn, when the sky had just begun to brighten...

Ye Chen leaned tiredly against the headboard, holding a talisman and a pill in his hands, his mood excellent...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving two years of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Purifying Healing Pill (Consuming it will heal all injuries to the body)!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Thunder Burst Talisman (Inject spiritual energy to activate. Power comparable to a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator's full-power strike!)]

What he'd obtained was once again a Thunder Burst Talisman, with power equivalent only to the Nascent Soul Stage.

Ye Chen wasn't too disappointed. At least it was an offensive talisman two major realms above his own—it could still serve as a life-saving measure in dangerous situations.

His only regret was not obtaining an Immortal-Slaying Talisman!

Only now did Ye Chen understand just how lucky he'd been before, receiving an Immortal-Slaying Talisman while dual cultivating with Lu Mengyao.

Whether such good fortune would appear again, he didn't know!

Ye Chen had fought and plowed through the entire night, even consuming an Endless Vitality Pill partway through. Now his energy was completely depleted—he was exhausted and couldn't continue.

Though he desperately wanted an Immortal-Slaying Talisman, he had no strength left to keep going.

Besides, Su Nianwan beside him also couldn't take any more. She was sleeping soundly now.

Earlier, Su Nianwan had actually cried—Ye Chen couldn't very well keep tormenting her.

His own woman needed his care...

He also realized the Immortal-Slaying Talisman wasn't so easily obtained—it wasn't a goal that could be achieved overnight.

Perhaps it would take prolonged cultivation before he could reap such a harvest.

"If I dual cultivated with Liu Ruyan, I wonder if I'd get an Immortal-Slaying Talisman?"

"With her drop rate, it really might be possible..."

"The question is whether Liu Ruyan would be willing."

"Her figure is quite impressive..."

Ye Chen muttered to himself as exhaustion washed over him. He slowly closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.
