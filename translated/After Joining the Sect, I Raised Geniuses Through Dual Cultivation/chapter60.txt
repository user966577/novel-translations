*CRACK!*

A crisp sound rang out from within his body...

The next second, Ye Chen's aura skyrocketed!

Like a pillar of energy shooting toward the heavens!

*BOOM!*

"Peak Nascent Soul!"

Ye Chen opened his eyes, excitement written across his face...

He'd broken through!

From mid-stage Nascent Soul all the way to Peak Nascent Soul—just one step away from the Soul Transformation Stage...

This was even faster than he'd anticipated.

He'd thought it would take several more months, yet here he was—mere days later...

If he'd been cultivating with Lin Qingxue and the others, the pace would've been nowhere near this fast.

But Liu Ruyan was different. Not only did she have the highest drop rate, each cultivation reward was several times larger...

The efficiency was leagues beyond what Lin Qingxue and the others could offer!

At this rate, it wouldn't be long before he could step into the Soul Transformation Stage...

He'd received a Corpse-Slaying Pill last time, which gave him the confidence to attempt the breakthrough.

Once his spiritual energy replenished, he could challenge the Soul Transformation barrier.

The only downside was that he couldn't sleep with Liu Ruyan every night. Otherwise, his cultivation would be advancing at breakneck speed...

Then again, his body might break down first.

"You brat... did you just break through?"

"Peak Nascent Soul?"

Liu Ruyan stirred awake nearby. Sensing the shift in Ye Chen's aura, she blurted out in surprise.

She hadn't expected his cultivation to rise so quickly.

At this rate, he might surpass her before long!

Just a few months ago, Ye Chen had still been at the Qi Condensation Stage. Now he'd reached Peak Nascent Soul...

That kind of cultivation speed was unheard of in the entire Southern Wilderness Province.

"This kid really is far more than he seems..."

"Choosing to trust him back then was truly the smartest decision I ever made!"

Liu Ruyan studied Ye Chen through narrowed eyes, her beautiful gaze filled with admiration.

Before long, the sect might gain yet another powerhouse!

"Sect Master, your cultivation hasn't improved yet?"

Ye Chen turned to Liu Ruyan, looking her up and down with an expression of surprise.

He'd been going at it day and night, yet Liu Ruyan's cultivation was still stuck at mid-stage Void Refining...

Liu Ruyan couldn't help but shoot him a glare.

"How could it be that fast..."

"You think Void Refining is easy?"

"The progress from the last two days... is already very fast..."

Her face grew redder with every word.

At the Void Refining Stage, even a single minor breakthrough could take decades of grueling cultivation.

Some cultivators spent their entire lives trapped at early-stage Void Refining, never advancing another step!

Liu Ruyan was already quite satisfied with the past two days' gains. A single session of dual cultivation with Ye Chen matched what years of solo practice would produce...

That was already fast. What more could she ask for?

"I see..."

"Looks like we need to step up our game!"

Ye Chen nodded thoughtfully.

The three major powers, led by the Heavenly Demon Sect, could attack the Blissful Union Sect at any time. They didn't have much time to prepare...

He needed to push Liu Ruyan's cultivation up as quickly as possible. Only then would the sect have a real safeguard!

Otherwise, he'd spend every day on edge, worrying about the sect being annihilated...

Hearing this, Liu Ruyan's face turned crimson in an instant.

This brat—what did he mean by "step up"?

Wasn't this already his limit?

Still trying to take advantage of her?

Did he even care whether she could handle it?

Liu Ruyan glared at Ye Chen with a mixture of embarrassment and indignation...

"Get out!!!"

Her whole body felt like it was coming apart.

If this kept up, she might die from exhaustion before her cultivation ever broke through...

Ye Chen blinked, meeting Liu Ruyan's aggrieved gaze. He couldn't help but chuckle sheepishly, spreading his hands in a gesture of innocence.

"Sect Master, this is all for your own good..."

"It doesn't matter if I'm a little tired, as long as you can break through to Body Integration sooner!"

He struck a noble, self-sacrificing pose—as if he were the one making the great sacrifice for Liu Ruyan's sake...

"Scram!!!"

Liu Ruyan spat the word through gritted teeth.

For her own good?

Who was really enjoying themselves here—did he think she was blind?

The smooth-talking brat. All the advantages went to him, and he never admitted a thing...

Though she wanted to reach Body Integration too, she had to pace herself. Otherwise her body would give out first.

Ye Chen averted his gaze guiltily, snatched up his scattered clothes from the floor, got dressed, and prepared to leave.

"Sect Master, then this disciple shall take his leave..."

Liu Ruyan huffed in acknowledgment.

As Ye Chen reached the doorway, her voice drifted from behind...

"Don't forget about the hundred female disciples I assigned you. Make sure every last one gets her fair share!"

"In one month, I and the Grand Elder will be conducting inspections!"

Ye Chen: ???

The words hit him like a truck, and he felt his body weaken on the spot...

That was a hundred female disciples!!!

He turned back to look at Liu Ruyan on the bed and said with a pained smile:

"At least let me rest for a bit..."

Liu Ruyan's eyes danced with mirth as she arched a brow at him:

"Oh? Already spent?"

"Weren't you just saying a little fatigue didn't matter?"

Ye Chen paused, and the look he gave Liu Ruyan shifted entirely...

So that's how it was. She'd been setting him up!

This woman had done it on purpose!

Ye Chen narrowed his eyes, a teasing grin spreading across his face:

"Sect Master, when you were begging for mercy earlier... that's not what you were saying."

Liu Ruyan: !!!

Her face flushed scarlet in an instant...

Like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, she couldn't bring herself to meet Ye Chen's eyes.

This was mortifying!

"SCRAM!!!"

Liu Ruyan screamed.

That infuriating man!

She was seething inside, yet utterly powerless to retaliate. Every time, she was the one begging for mercy...

Seeing Liu Ruyan's flustered face, Ye Chen's mood soared. He turned with a wide grin and strolled out.

Stepping outside the grand hall, the sunset was sinking toward the distant horizon.

Ye Chen shook his head with a wry laugh.

"Didn't expect to waste another full day with Liu Ruyan..."

He'd originally planned to be in and out quickly last night—he didn't want to neglect Lin Qingxue and the others.

Instead, he'd spent not just the night but an extra half-day in overtime at Liu Ruyan's.

"Qingxue and the girls must be getting impatient..."

Ye Chen muttered, picking up his pace.

His stomach was empty, his body drained—as though he'd been wrung out completely...

The thought of a hundred more female disciples waiting for him in the newly connected compound filled him with the weariness of adulthood...

This was what it meant to have no say in the matter.

"I'd better work hard and stockpile more Endless Vitality Pills..."

"If the output doesn't match the output, I really won't survive this!"

Ye Chen pondered seriously.

He planned to test the waters with one of the compound's female disciples tonight...

Knowing Liu Ruyan's taste, the ones she'd personally selected shouldn't disappoint.

There might even be pleasant surprises.

For the sect—he'd grit his teeth and persevere!
