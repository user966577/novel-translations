A strange look flickered across Liu Ruyan's face. She glanced suspiciously at Ye Chen, feeling something was off.

Such a coincidence—the Profound Heaven Holy Land again?

Could this kid be lying?

Deliberately fanning the flames between the Blissful Union Sect and the Profound Heaven Holy Land?

Trying to borrow a knife to kill his enemies?

Yet Jiang Yuyan's corpse lay right before her—someone had definitely killed her. Apart from a powerhouse from the Profound Heaven Holy Land, she couldn't think of who else would have done it...

If that was truly the case, then the Profound Heaven Holy Land was being far too domineering!

Liu Ruyan's expression darkened. She silently vowed that the sect had to grow stronger to have any chance of standing against the Profound Heaven Holy Land!

After this incident, the sect treated it as a major crisis and activated the Sect Protection Grand Formation!

At the same time, they recalled all disciples on outside training back to the sect to guard against potential attacks from the Profound Heaven Holy Land.

Every disciple worked hard to improve, determined to demand justice from the Profound Heaven Holy Land!

Liu Ruyan issued order after order, keeping herself incredibly busy, yet her mood was quite pleasant.

Though a Vice Sect Master had died, for Liu Ruyan this was actually a good thing.

Finally, no one was opposing her anymore. She no longer had to constantly worry about losing her position as Sect Master.

She could better control the Blissful Union Sect and lead it to greater strength!

The Grand Elder, perhaps because he knew of Ye Chen's special talent, harbored no suspicions toward him. He even stopped other elders when they wanted to ask more questions.

This allowed Ye Chen to slip away smoothly, taking Su Nianwan and the hastily arriving Lin Qingxue back to the small courtyard.

Outside the courtyard, several additional Nascent Soul Stage sect guardians had been stationed—all arranged by Liu Ruyan to protect Ye Chen's safety.

Still, if a Void Refining Stage expert from the Profound Heaven Holy Land truly came to kill, these guardians wouldn't be able to stop them at all.

For this reason, the sect's Grand Elder had moved from his cave dwelling deep in the rear mountains to a residence adjacent to the small courtyard.

Ostensibly to oversee the Sect Protection Grand Formation—in reality, to protect Ye Chen from close range...

Because he knew that once Ye Chen's seeding succeeded and disciples with Spiritual Roots were born, the Blissful Union Sect would undergo earth-shaking changes!

The Grand Elder had come to view Ye Chen as the sect's future, placing great hopes in him!

Inside the small courtyard...

Lu Mengyao waited in the courtyard after waking. The earlier commotion from the sword formation had truly startled her, and she feared something had happened to Ye Chen and the others.

Seeing them return, she immediately rushed over...

"Senior Brother, Sister Su, Sister Lin—you're back!"

Lu Mengyao was relieved to see Ye Chen and Su Nianwan return safe and sound.

Then she noticed the bloodstains at the corner of Ye Chen's mouth and immediately asked with concern.

"Senior Brother, you're injured?"

"Relax, this little wound is nothing..."

Ye Chen waved his hand casually, speaking with a smile.

His pale complexion clearly showed his injuries weren't light.

After all, Jiang Yuyan was a Soul Transformation Stage powerhouse. Even a casual strike from her could seriously wound him.

"Really?"

Lu Mengyao was skeptical. Seeing Su Nianwan's grave expression, she knew Ye Chen's injuries weren't minor.

"Senior Brother, please go rest in your room..."

By now, Lin Qingxue and Su Nianwan were supporting Ye Chen on either side. Lu Mengyao couldn't even get close to help—she could only fret anxiously.

They helped Ye Chen into Su Nianwan's room, laid him on the bed, then fumbled about searching for various healing pills...

Seeing this, Ye Chen felt warmth in his heart. He smiled and waved his hand. "No need to search—I have pills!"

"The Sect Master already gave me a bottle of healing medicine."

"Don't worry, a few days of rest and I'll be fine..."

When they'd left Jiang Yuyan's courtyard, Liu Ruyan had seemed to notice Ye Chen's injuries and specially given him a bottle of pills. The quality was quite high—far more effective than the healing medicines Lu Mengyao and the others had produced.

After taking it, the injuries in his body had basically been suppressed.

Hearing Ye Chen say this, Lu Mengyao and the others finally relaxed, though their gazes remained full of concern.

Over these past few days together, their hearts and eyes were filled with nothing but Ye Chen. If he died, the three women truly didn't know how they would go on living...

"Senior Brother, you must be hungry, right?"

"Let me go prepare some food..."

Lu Mengyao spoke considerately.

By now, the sky outside had darkened. Ye Chen had worked hard all day—he must be starving.

"I'll go with you..."

Lin Qingxue said.

The two left together, leaving Su Nianwan in the room to keep Ye Chen company.

The room suddenly fell quiet...

From the moment they'd started back, Su Nianwan had remained silent, not saying a word.

Ye Chen looked up at her. As if reading her thoughts, he spoke first.

"You must have a lot of questions, right?"

"Like how I found you..."

"And that talisman from before..."

Others might not know the details, but Su Nianwan had witnessed everything. A Foundation Establishment disciple holding a single talisman had slain a Soul Transformation Stage powerhouse—anyone would be shocked!

Meeting Ye Chen's gaze, Su Nianwan immediately said.

"If Senior Brother doesn't want to talk about it, I won't pry."

"These things—I will never breathe a word to anyone!"

She made a solemn promise!

Su Nianwan understood clearly that these methods were Ye Chen's secrets. If word got out, it could bring mortal danger upon him.

She would keep these secrets absolutely sealed.

Hearing Su Nianwan say this, Ye Chen smiled with appreciation. He did like dealing with smart people.

This also saved him from having to make up lies.

His only regret was using up the Immortal-Slaying Talisman. A treasure like that was gone once used—whether he could get another depended entirely on luck...

With good fortune and diligent cultivation, he might obtain one. With bad luck, he might never get another in his lifetime.

But Ye Chen had no regrets. Given the circumstances, Su Nianwan had to be saved, and he had to survive—killing Jiang Yuyan was the only option!

"Thank you, Senior Brother, for saving me. From now on, Nianwan will work like an ox or horse to repay you!"

Su Nianwan promised with firm resolve.

"No need to work like an ox or horse..."

"Why such formalities between us!"

Ye Chen waved her off, speaking with a serious expression.

"It's just..."

"Just what?"

Su Nianwan blinked in confusion.

Meeting Ye Chen's playful gaze, she followed his line of sight downward...

She couldn't see her own feet past her chest. Her face flushed red instantly.

"Senior Brother, you're so bad!"

"You're still injured..."

Su Nianwan reminded him with a crimson face, not expecting Ye Chen to start being improper again.

But Ye Chen ignored her. He reached out, grabbed Su Nianwan's arm, and pulled her into his embrace...

"Mm..."

"Senior Brother..."

"Don't..."

Su Nianwan went soft all over, nestling in Ye Chen's arms. Face flushed red, she tried to dissuade him.

She was worried his injuries would worsen.

"Relax, I'm fine..."

"This little wound is nothing."

"Didn't you just say you wanted to repay me? Now's your chance to repay me..."

Ye Chen whispered against Su Nianwan's ear.

He wanted to practice with Su Nianwan, to see if he could harvest another Immortal-Slaying Talisman!
