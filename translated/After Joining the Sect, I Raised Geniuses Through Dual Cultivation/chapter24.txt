Inside the great hall, pitch darkness...

The sky outside had long since grown dark!

Liu Ruyan had completely run out of strength. She lay curled up in the corner of the bed, all her earlier bravado gone.

She lifted a finger and flicked out a wisp of flame, igniting a candle on a nearby table.

The hall instantly brightened...

"You brat..."

"Are you trying to kill me?"

Liu Ruyan tilted her head up to look at Ye Chen beside her, her breath warm as she pouted coquettishly.

She shot him an exasperated glare, face flushed!

Silently, she admitted that everything in those secret reports had been true—this kid's bedroom skills were indeed formidable...

She could barely take any more!

Not only that, Liu Ruyan could also feel her cultivation had improved dramatically. The barrier that had troubled her for so many years showed signs of loosening...

This gave her hope of breaking through to the Void Refining Stage!

"Know what you're dealing with now?"

"Ready to admit defeat?"

"I told you not to get cocky..."

Ye Chen spoke while panting slightly, his forehead covered in sweat, though his heart was filled with satisfaction!

Who told Liu Ruyan to be so smug earlier?

She'd even dared to doubt his abilities!

"I guess it was okay—nothing that impressive..."

"Just average..."

Liu Ruyan turned her head away, speaking stubbornly despite her flushed face.

Being the Sect Master, how could she possibly bow her head and admit defeat to a disciple?

She had her dignity to maintain!

"Average?"

Ye Chen was immediately displeased. The way he looked at Liu Ruyan changed!

His entire being snapped to attention in an instant!

This was an absolute insult!

"Fine, fine, fine—Liu Ruyan, I'm going all out!"

"I'm not leaving tonight!"

"I'm going to make you kneel and sing in submission!"

Ye Chen immediately retrieved an Endless Vitality Pill from his storage ring and popped it into his mouth.

Three seconds later, every aspect of his body had returned to peak condition...

He looked down at Liu Ruyan, silently vowing!

He was going to make her pay...

"You... you took a pill?"

"Wait, I was just saying that—you're actually going through with it?"

"Ye Chen, don't... don't do this!"

Liu Ruyan sensed something was wrong. Her face paled with fright, and she immediately panicked.

She was already at the absolute limit of what she could endure—her body simply couldn't take any more.

She'd just been talking tough to tease Ye Chen a bit. Who knew he'd pop a pill the moment she said something wrong...

Seeing Ye Chen's aura change, Liu Ruyan realized things were about to go badly.

If this continued, she'd be done for!

Liu Ruyan struggled to prop herself up and tried to escape, cutting a rather sorry figure.

Before she could even get off the bed, Ye Chen grabbed her and pulled her right back...

"Trying to run? No way!"

"Tonight, we're settling who's the winner..."

Ye Chen stared directly at Liu Ruyan.

"Don't..."

"Ye Chen, I'm the Sect Master!"

"You can't do this to me..."

Liu Ruyan was terrified. She hastily pulled rank, trying to scare him off.

Hoping Ye Chen would show mercy and let her go.

"What Sect Master?"

"Tonight there's only a man and a woman!"

"Those were your words..."

Ye Chen snorted coldly, ignoring Liu Ruyan's pleas entirely.

He absolutely had to show her what he was made of!

His gaze caught a glimpse of alluring curves, and Ye Chen instantly lost all rationality...

"You..."

"Ahh!!!"

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving five years of cultivation as a reward!]

With rewards at several times the normal rate, there was no way Ye Chen would let Liu Ruyan off easily.

He desperately wanted to improve!

The sooner he advanced his cultivation, the sooner he could avenge his fallen clansmen!

His sister Ye Qing'er was still in the Profound Heaven Holy Land, her fate unknown. Ye Chen had never forgotten about rescuing her.

Several shichen later...

After the storm passed, the great hall fell silent once more.

Liu Ruyan lay pitifully curled in the corner, tear tracks running down her cheeks.

She had cried quite a few times earlier, even desperately begging Ye Chen for mercy.

The Sect Master's dignity had been completely lost in bed!

"Ye Chen... you've gone too far!"

"Wuwuwu, how could you do this..."

"I'm your Sect Master..."

"You... you're too much!"

Liu Ruyan spoke with an aggrieved pout.

Ye Chen had never seen her like this.

Completely different from the lofty Sect Master of ordinary days.

At this moment, Liu Ruyan displayed a vulnerability she had never shown before—like a bullied little girl...

"Sect Master, you can't just say things like that..."

"Who bullied you?"

"You asked for this yourself—I didn't force you!"

"If anything, you're the one who forced me!"

Ye Chen spoke with complete seriousness, even turning the accusation around...

Liu Ruyan had been the one to actively seduce him first. She'd even provoked him during—could he really be blamed for teaching her a thorough lesson?

He was showing her that you can't just casually doubt a man's abilities!

"Hmph! You scoundrel..."

Liu Ruyan couldn't talk her way past him. She pouted and complained petulantly.

She felt like she'd completely lost face in front of Ye Chen. She couldn't put on airs or maintain any dignity anymore.

She had been utterly conquered by Ye Chen, deep in her heart!

Right now she was like an obedient little cat, curled up in Ye Chen's embrace, enjoying the warmth while voicing her grievances...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving five years of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Immortal-Slaying Talisman (Inject spiritual energy to activate. Power comparable to a Void Refining Stage expert's full-power strike!)]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Teleportation Talisman (Inject spiritual energy to activate. Allows the Host to traverse ten thousand li and instantly arrive at any location in their thoughts)!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving five years of cultivation as a reward!]

At the same time, system rewards came pouring in...

The moment Ye Chen saw the Immortal-Slaying Talisman, his eyes went wide. His mood instantly soared!

After all that cultivation, he had finally obtained another Immortal-Slaying Talisman!

Ye Chen treasured it like a precious gem.

He knew full well the power of the Immortal-Slaying Talisman—it had instantly killed Jiang Yuyan at Soul Transformation...

With an Immortal-Slaying Talisman in hand, Ye Chen had one more life-saving trump card, giving him some peace of mind.

In his excitement, a bold idea suddenly sprouted in Ye Chen's mind!

He turned to look at Liu Ruyan's enchanting body, then sighed helplessly...

What a shame he had no strength left either—otherwise he'd have to take advantage and farm a few more rounds!

But Liu Ruyan couldn't take any more. If he continued, she might actually kill him...

Ye Chen had no choice but to abandon the thought.

"It's getting late. I should head back!"

Ye Chen rose wearily, dressing as he looked at Liu Ruyan lying bare on the bed.

He silently marveled—what an alluring little temptress!

If not for the Vigorous Man Physique and the Endless Vitality Pill, Ye Chen might well have died in bed...

"Done playing and now you're leaving?"

"Heartless wretch!"

Liu Ruyan glanced up at Ye Chen, pouting with resentment.

"Hmm?"

"You don't want me to leave?"

Ye Chen paused, staring straight at Liu Ruyan with an amused expression.

"In that case, let's... continue!"

With that, Ye Chen made as if to take off his clothes again...

"No!!!"

"Go—just go..."

"I really... can't anymore!"

"Ye Chen, I'm begging you—please spare me!"

Liu Ruyan hastily spoke up, pleading pitifully.

How would she dare tease Ye Chen now? She was terrified of being done in...

This kid was truly too frightening!
