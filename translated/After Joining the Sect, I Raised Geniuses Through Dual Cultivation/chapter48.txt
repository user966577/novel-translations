*Hiss!*

The male disciple being choked by Ye Chen went pale with fear, nearly wetting himself.

"S-spare me, Senior!"

He begged frantically, his earlier arrogance completely gone.

He had thought Ye Chen was young and assumed he was just an ordinary disciple. Who knew he could instantly kill his junior brothers and sisters with one strike?

So young yet already at Nascent Soul cultivation—this had to be some elder of the Blissful Union Sect.

Terror filled his heart.

"You're a Heavenly Demon Sect disciple?"

Ye Chen turned to look at him, his expression blank.

The sect robes the other wore clearly weren't from the Blissful Union Sect.

Given the hostile forces against the Blissful Union Sect and the technique the man had just used, Ye Chen already had his suspicions.

"Yes..."

"We're all Heavenly Demon Sect disciples..."

The male disciple nodded in admission.

His life was literally in Ye Chen's hands—he didn't dare lie.

"What's your purpose in coming here?"

Ye Chen continued to question.

The male disciple hesitated briefly but answered honestly.

"Elder Wang sent us to scout the way, to find weaknesses in the Blissful Union Sect's protective array and find a way to sneak in and sabotage it..."

Months ago, the Blissful Union Sect had suddenly activated their protective array, quickly drawing attention from various factions who all wanted to know what crisis had befallen them and seize the opportunity...

Ye Chen frowned, sensing something was wrong. The Blissful Union Sect had been targeted!

Before the Profound Heaven Holy Land could even retaliate, other hostile forces had set their sights on them.

After all, no sect would activate their protective array without good reason—the daily spirit stone consumption was immense.

It would only happen when the sect faced a major crisis, like the death of the Sect Master or Supreme Elders.

"Where is Elder Wang?"

Ye Chen asked him.

The male disciple glanced at the distant forest, his expression fearful.

"In the forest back there."

"What's his cultivation level?"

"Void Refining."

"How many people came?"

"Three hundred..."

Ye Chen paused, looking at him strangely.

"Three hundred people and you dare to attack the Blissful Union Sect?"

"You're underestimating the Blissful Union Sect, aren't you?"

Even if they didn't know Liu Ruyan had broken through to Void Refining, they should at least know the Blissful Union Sect had several Void Refining Supreme Elders guarding it, right?

Sending just one Void Refining elder to lead the assault—did they think all the Blissful Union Sect's Supreme Elders were dead?

Moreover, just three hundred disciples, even if they were all sect elites, couldn't possibly destroy the Blissful Union Sect, which had thousands of disciples!

"No, no."

"Senior misunderstands..."

"We're not here to attack the Blissful Union Sect directly."

"Elder Wang personally led us here only to gather intelligence and sabotage the Blissful Union Sect's protective array."

"The forces from the Thousand Feather Sect and Spirit Water Sect haven't assembled yet. Once they arrive, then we'll attack the Blissful Union Sect..."

The male disciple quickly explained.

He didn't hide anything now, revealing all of the Heavenly Demon Sect's plans...

"What!"

"The Heavenly Demon Sect, Thousand Feather Sect, and Spirit Water Sect—three major sects joining forces against the Blissful Union Sect?"

Ye Chen's expression turned to shock.

He had thought he'd only encountered Heavenly Demon Sect scouts, but had actually uncovered the secret of three major factions preparing to siege the Blissful Union Sect.

If this plan was real, the Blissful Union Sect was in danger.

The Blissful Union Sect's strength was already evenly matched with their nemesis, the Heavenly Demon Sect. Now with two more sects adding their experts, the Blissful Union Sect stood no chance.

Even with Liu Ruyan's breakthrough to Void Refining, she couldn't turn the tide against three combined sects.

If the Blissful Union Sect fell, wouldn't he die along with it?

No! He had to find a way to save the Blissful Union Sect!

He hadn't had his fill of the female disciples yet. It would be such a waste if they all died!

Liu Ruyan was also his woman now. He couldn't just watch her come to harm, could he?

Ye Chen's expression darkened as he quickly formed a plan!

His gaze fixed on the male disciple before him as he spoke gravely.

"Where exactly is the Heavenly Demon Sect's group positioned?"

The forest behind was too vast—he couldn't strike precisely.

"On that small hill over there, in the woods with a big tree."

"Elder Wang and the other disciples are all there..."

The male disciple pointed earnestly at a protruding hillock in the distance.

To save his own skin, he had no choice but to sell out his comrades.

Ye Chen looked in the direction he indicated. It was quite far, but for experts who could fly, it was mere moments away.

"Good. I hope you're telling the truth!"

Ye Chen nodded with satisfaction.

*CRACK!*

The next second, with a slight squeeze, he snapped the male disciple's neck...

His eyes widened, staring at Ye Chen with unwillingness—he hadn't expected to be killed anyway.

*THUD!*

Ye Chen tossed the corpse aside, then took out a flying sword and a Thunder Burst Talisman.

He infused the flying sword with spiritual energy, then shot it toward the Blissful Union Sect in the distance...

The flying sword was incredibly fast. Just as it was about to pierce into the sect's territory, golden patterns suddenly appeared in the air—the protective array manifested, blocking the sword!

*BANG!*

In an instant, the flying sword shattered like a moth flying into flame!

Simultaneously, a powerful figure rose into the air within the Blissful Union Sect...

"Who dares attack my Blissful Union Sect?"

The Second Elder hovered in the void, his face full of fury.

Today was his turn to guard the protective array, and someone had attacked. He was livid...

In the forest, Ye Chen saw that he'd drawn out a sect elder and immediately hurled the Thunder Burst Talisman toward the distant hillock without a word!

Empowered by spiritual energy, the Thunder Burst Talisman flew at incredible speed...

Beneath a large tree...

Disciples in Heavenly Demon Sect robes were resting in the forest. A white-bearded elder at the front was meditating.

Hearing faint sounds, he suddenly opened his eyes and looked toward the Blissful Union Sect...

Surprise flashed across his face!

"Someone attacked the Blissful Union Sect's protective array?"

"Could it be those disciples I sent out earlier?"

While puzzling over this, he suddenly sensed something was wrong...

Danger!

The white-bearded elder's expression changed. He wanted to act but hesitated, worried about revealing their position...

In the blink of an eye, the Thunder Burst Talisman had turned to smoke...

The next second, a purple thunderbolt descended from the sky!

*BOOM—*

"Damn it!"

He hurriedly tried to block.

*BANG—*

*Splurt!*

*Splurt!*

Though he deflected most of the lightning's power, quite a few disciples around him were struck dead on the spot.

The white-bearded elder's expression turned grim. Something was very wrong...

Someone was setting them up!

Meanwhile, the Blissful Union Sect's Second Elder, who had been searching for enemies in the distance, was drawn to the thunderbolt and immediately spotted the group!

"The Heavenly Demon Sect!"

"So it's you..."

"You're seeking death!"

The Second Elder charged toward the hillock without hesitation!

He also sent a mental message to the other Supreme Elders within the sect...

In an instant, several Supreme Elders of the Blissful Union Sect all rose into the air!
