"One hundred female disciples?"

Ye Chen's expression froze. As if remembering something, his heart lurched!

Was Liu Ruyan planning to set up a "little harem" for him directly?

He had originally thought the female disciples would come to the small courtyard in three rotating shifts. He never expected Liu Ruyan's approach to be so simple and direct—just expanding the courtyard.

With the wall knocked through, it was like gaining an extra "back garden," convenient for Ye Chen to visit anytime for cultivation.

Ye Chen fell into thought...

Should he arrange them in order, or should he use a tile-flipping system?

"Senior Brother, what's wrong?"

Su Nianwan noticed Ye Chen's strange expression and asked with concern.

"No... nothing!"

Ye Chen snapped back to attention, glancing at her and waving his hand.

"I just feel the Sect Master is so thoughtful..."

"Thoughtful?"

Lin Qingxue and the others froze, a hint of suspicion crossing their faces. As if guessing something, their expressions toward Ye Chen suddenly changed...

"These one hundred female disciples... they wouldn't all be women assigned to Senior Brother, would they?"

Lu Mengyao asked probingly.

Meeting the suspicious gazes of the women, Ye Chen guiltily scratched his nose and explained with complete seriousness.

"What women? Don't let your imaginations run wild!"

"The sect is currently facing a life-or-death crisis. As a member of the sect, your Senior Brother should naturally take on the responsibility of protecting it!"

"For the sect, your Senior Brother is just doing what little he can."

He spoke righteously, as if selflessly dedicating himself to the sect...

Lin Qingxue and the others nodded thoughtfully in understanding.

They all knew about Ye Chen's talent.

The sect arranging one hundred female disciples for Ye Chen now had obvious implications—they wanted him to dual cultivate and improve the sect disciples' strength.

"The 'little things' Senior Brother mentioned—that's dual cultivating with those female disciples, right?"

Zhao Ling'er blinked her bright eyes, looking at Ye Chen innocently.

After their wedding night, her cultivation had noticeably improved. Through conversations with Lin Qingxue and the others, she naturally learned about Ye Chen's dual cultivation talent.

Ye Chen: ???

His face flushed red. He coughed twice, looking at the innocent Zhao Ling'er and suddenly finding himself unable to make up any excuses.

The words were crude but the reasoning was sound. Saying it so plainly out loud was just a bit embarrassing.

Made him seem like some old lecher...

"Pfft!"

Lin Qingxue and the others couldn't help covering their mouths and giggling at seeing Ye Chen flustered.

Seeing this, Ye Chen pretended to glare at them sternly. "Ha! Laughing at your Senior Brother now?"

"Just wait and see how I punish you all!"

"You escaped last night, but don't think you'll get away today!"

Hearing this, Lin Qingxue and the others all blushed instantly, waving their hands frantically in embarrassment.

"Senior Brother, I... I can't!"

"My body's not up to it either..."

"Let Ling'er keep Senior Brother company. I've still got soup simmering in the kitchen!"

The three women quickly made excuses and fled with red faces.

Their bellies were growing bigger by the day. Worried about affecting the babies, they didn't dare be as wild as before...

Zhao Ling'er stood frozen in place, watching Lin Qingxue and the others flee in panic. She hadn't processed what was happening.

"Sister Lin, Sister Su, Sister Lu—why did they all leave?"

"Senior Brother, I also..."

Zhao Ling'er tried to find an excuse to slip away, but Ye Chen had already grabbed her...

"Where do you think you're going?"

"You're not even pregnant yet. What are you running for?"

"I let you rest all day yesterday..."

"Weren't you just curious about your Senior Brother's 'dedication'?"

"Let your Senior Brother give you a good lesson..."

Ye Chen looked at Zhao Ling'er before him with a playful expression.

Taking her hand, he walked toward a nearby room...

"Senior Brother..."

"You haven't eaten yet!"

Zhao Ling'er's cheeks instantly turned crimson. With feigned reluctance, she took small steps following Ye Chen into the room.

In the kitchen...

Lin Qingxue and the others heard the door slam shut. Their gazes all involuntarily turned to the clay pot on the stove.

"Looks like we need to add some stronger ingredients..."

Su Nianwan murmured to herself.

"The Sect Master arranged another hundred female disciples. Who knows if Senior Brother's body can handle it!"

Lin Qingxue muttered worriedly.

"I heard this time it's the Heavenly Demon Sect allied with the Thousand Feather Sect and Spirit Water Sect, all coming to attack our Blissful Union Sect!"

"Three major sects joining forces—the sect is really in danger this time!"

"For the sect to survive, if Senior Brother has to work hard, then so be it..."

Lu Mengyao explained with a grave expression.

News that the three major forces would attack the Blissful Union Sect was no longer a secret. Within a day, it had spread throughout the entire sect.

The disciples were naturally filled with worry, everyone driven as if by a whip to cultivate even more diligently.

No one fled the sect out of fear.

Though the Blissful Union Sect wasn't some prestigious orthodox sect, it treated its disciples well. Many disciples had grown up in the Blissful Union Sect since childhood, treating it as their home with deep emotional ties.

Even if they couldn't match the three major forces, they would fight to the death to protect the sect!

Lin Qingxue and the others also considered the sect their second home. They could understand Ye Chen's dedication...

Now they were all concerned about Ye Chen's health, personally cooking meals using various nourishing ingredients...

Meanwhile...

After Liu Ruyan had carefully selected one hundred exceptionally talented female disciples, she returned to the great hall. Looking at the empty side chamber, a sudden loneliness welled up in her heart.

"That brat left..."

"It would be nice if he could just stay here all the time..."

She had gradually grown accustomed to having Ye Chen around. It wasn't so lonely anymore.

Liu Ruyan sighed with disappointment. Just as she sat down cross-legged and began circulating her cultivation technique, the spiritual energy within her body suddenly began to surge...

"This is..."

A flash of unusual light passed through her eyes!

This feeling was all too familiar...

Without time to think further, Liu Ruyan skillfully guided the spiritual energy within her body, pushing against the barrier of her realm...

If successful, her strength would advance another step, giving her more confidence to contend with the three major forces!

"That brat really came through last night!"

"It seems there really is a chance to break through to Body Integration..."

Liu Ruyan murmured with closed eyes,

a flush of embarrassment coloring her cheeks...

The aura around her grew increasingly wild, distinctly unusual!

Liu Ruyan had only been testing the waters at first, but now she saw a glimmer of hope. A bold idea gradually formed in her mind.

Why not let that brat try?

After all, she wasn't losing out...

If she really broke through to Body Integration, even with the three major forces combined, she wouldn't give them a second thought!

This crisis facing the Blissful Union Sect could be resolved...

For the sect, what was a little sacrifice?

Besides, she quite enjoyed it...
