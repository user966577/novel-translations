In a great hall...

On the pink bed in the side chamber.

Liu Ruyan gazed at Ye Chen before her with enchanting eyes, pouting weakly.

"You little troublemaker..."

"Always bullying me!"

Ye Chen looked down at her and teased.

"You made the first move just now..."

"You can't blame me for this!"

Liu Ruyan shot him a glare, her gaze carrying a hint of resentment...

"I'm your Sect Master, after all!"

"Can't you go easy on me?"

"No!"

Ye Chen refused without mercy.

"Hmph!"

"You scoundrel..."

Liu Ruyan said with a pout.

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving five years of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Thunderclap Talisman!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving great completion comprehension of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger!]

Ye Chen's expression froze as his heartbeat quickened...

Listening to the cold notifications flashing through his mind...

He stared with disbelief, a smile spreading across his face!

"This... it actually worked!"

He had thought that with Liu Ruyan's high drop rate, there would be a chance to obtain the ultimate comprehension of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger.

He just hadn't expected it would happen so quickly!

Ye Chen had even prepared himself for a prolonged battle.

The sudden pleasant surprise left him dazed for a long while before he came to his senses, then burst into delighted laughter!

"I've done it!"

Having fully mastered the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger, Ye Chen was confident that even facing a Peak Nascent Soul opponent, he would have the power to fight!

This technique, once mastered, was comparable to a Heaven-Grade martial art and gave him the foundation to fight above his level!

Zhang Shuyu! The Zhang family!

Just you wait—I'll make you pay in blood!

He could hardly wait to kill someone...

The reason Ye Chen had been working so hard to improve himself was all for revenge!

Hatred was the driving force behind his efforts!

And now, he had finally seen hope...

"What? It worked?"

Liu Ruyan looked at Ye Chen curiously.

Seeing his excited state, a suspicion gradually formed in her heart, though she still couldn't be certain.

Deep down, she didn't think it was possible.

Meeting Liu Ruyan's questioning gaze, Ye Chen didn't hide it and answered with a frank smile.

"The Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger—I've mastered it!"

"Completely comprehended!"

"I feel like if I use it now, the power would be several times stronger than before!"

Liu Ruyan: !!!

Hearing this, Liu Ruyan's eyes went wide with shock as she stared at Ye Chen in disbelief.

What she had thought impossible had actually happened!

"This... how can this be!"

"You... you've mastered the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger just like that?"

"It hasn't even been a full day!"

Liu Ruyan gasped in shock, her voice trembling.

From when she had placed the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger manual in Ye Chen's hands until now, less than a full day had passed.

In such a short time, Ye Chen had not only grasped the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger but had even reached great completion!

Could this kid be a genius?

She had spent decades trying to reach this level and still hadn't made it...

Liu Ruyan's gaze toward Ye Chen changed completely, her eyes gradually growing heated!

This kid must have some secret...

Could his unique comprehension method actually be real?

She had to learn this method!

"Ye Chen, tell me quickly—how did you comprehend it?"

"You definitely have a method, don't you?"

Liu Ruyan stared intently at Ye Chen, her face full of anticipation.

"There is a method..."

Ye Chen raised an eyebrow, his expression strange as he looked at Liu Ruyan...

"What method?"

"Tell me quickly..."

Liu Ruyan was nearly dying of impatience.

Her hand grabbed Ye Chen's arm and shook it repeatedly...

"Just like... what we did just now..."

"Like what?"

"You mean..."

Liu Ruyan paused, her face instantly flushing red.

She looked up at Ye Chen, her gaze changing...

"Are you messing with me?"

Liu Ruyan eyed Ye Chen suspiciously.

She suspected he was trying to take advantage of her in some roundabout way.

"I'm telling the truth!"

"As for whether you can comprehend it, I don't know..."

Ye Chen spread his hands innocently, indicating he wasn't lying.

Liu Ruyan recalled how Ye Chen had been at minor success when he demonstrated the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger at the back mountain earlier.

From returning from the grove until now, the two of them had been inseparable. She knew Ye Chen's every move—he truly hadn't done anything special...

And yet Ye Chen had comprehended the ultimate level of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger!

Could what he said really be true?

Liu Ruyan's heart stirred. She looked hesitantly at Ye Chen before her, her face gradually reddening...

"You're getting off easy, you brat..."

She desperately wanted to comprehend the ultimate level of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger and enhance her strength!

With such an opportunity before her, Liu Ruyan didn't want to miss it.

Besides, trying couldn't hurt...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving five years of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Advanced Clone Talisman (inject spiritual energy to activate, creates ten clones with thirty percent of Host's cultivation, controlled by Host's will)!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Strength Enhancement Pill (restores Host's vitality continuously after consumption, effects last five hours)!]

Ye Chen looked at the Strength Enhancement Pill that flashed by and his eyes immediately lit up!

This was good stuff—its effects were actually better than the Endless Vitality Pill!

And the Advanced Clone Talisman could create ten clones at once, each with thirty percent of Ye Chen's cultivation. That was essentially having ten Golden Core fighters at his command...

If Ye Chen's cultivation continued to rise, his clones could even match Nascent Soul cultivators!

Ten Nascent Soul powerhouses would be enough to annihilate a mid-sized clan!

Liu Ruyan's drop rate really was high—the rewards were all high-grade pills and talismans...

Ye Chen's mood soared.

An hour later...

Liu Ruyan stared at Ye Chen with a resentful expression, brimming with grievance!

"Why haven't I been able to comprehend the ultimate level of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger?"

"You'd better give me a reasonable explanation..."

Her gaze looked ready to devour someone...

"Well..."

"Sect Master, is it possible your innate understanding just isn't high enough?"

Ye Chen suggested tentatively.

"What did you say!"

Liu Ruyan's expression darkened as she snapped.

She raised her small pink fists, ready to pummel him!

This brat had tricked her again...

She felt like she'd been taken for a fool!

He'd just taken advantage of her for nothing...

"Wait, wait, wait—let me explain..."

Ye Chen hastily changed his tune.

"Maybe this method isn't suited for you. Want to try a different approach?"

Liu Ruyan frowned slightly, eyeing Ye Chen with deep suspicion and wariness.

"What approach?"

If Ye Chen was trying to take advantage of her in some new way, she would absolutely chop this kid up...

In her mind, Ye Chen now had the image of a big bad wolf.
