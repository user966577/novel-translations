The dark clouds in the void gradually dispersed and vanished without a trace.

Liu Ruyan's aura settled as she slowly opened her eyes. A gleam of light flashed through her pupils!

"Early Void Refining!"

"I've finally broken through..."

She had waited many years for this day!

The first person Liu Ruyan thought of was Ye Chen...

If not for dual cultivating with Ye Chen and improving her cultivation, she wouldn't have taken this step so quickly!

Though she'd been worn out half to death, Liu Ruyan was still deeply grateful to Ye Chen.

At the same time, she was glad she'd made the choice to seek out Ye Chen for dual cultivation!

Otherwise, if she'd continued cultivating on her own, she would still be stuck at Peak Soul Transformation.

She rose to her feet and glanced down at her tattered clothes. Taking a new set from her storage ring, she put them on...

Just as she was about to leave, several Supreme Elders arrived at the mountain peak.

"Ruyan, congratulations on taking this step!"

The Grand Elder looked at Liu Ruyan with a gratified expression and offered his congratulations.

He had always been optimistic about Liu Ruyan's talent. Now seeing her step into the Void Refining Stage at such a young age, he was filled with expectations for her future achievements!

"For Ruyan to go from entering Soul Transformation to breaking through to Void Refining in just a few decades—that's shorter than the time it took us old folks back in the day..."

Another Supreme Elder spoke up in praise, then suddenly changed the subject...

"Does Ruyan have any cultivation secrets?"

All the Supreme Elders fixed their gazes on her.

This experience could be of tremendous help to future disciples' cultivation.

"Secrets?"

Liu Ruyan was momentarily stunned.

Images of dual cultivating with Ye Chen immediately surfaced in her mind...

Her face flushed red in an instant.

She couldn't very well say it was because she'd dual cultivated with Ye Chen that she'd broken through, could she?

In front of all these elders, she couldn't bring herself to say such words.

"Perhaps I resolved some doubts in my heart. With my mental state at ease, the breakthrough came naturally..."

Liu Ruyan offered a vague explanation.

"Mental state at ease?"

The Supreme Elders murmured to themselves, nodding thoughtfully.

They seemed to accept Liu Ruyan's explanation.

Cultivation was also cultivation of the heart. Sometimes what blocked one's realm wasn't just accumulated cultivation—it was also spiritual clarity.

They said no more and each returned to their cave dwellings.

Liu Ruyan returned to the great hall where she resided.

Looking at the disheveled bed, her thoughts kept drifting to Ye Chen without her realizing it...

Having someone by her side seemed rather nice!

Some things, once experienced, became addictive pleasures that could never be forgotten.

Liu Ruyan, who had grown accustomed to being alone, now felt an unprecedented loneliness after dual cultivating with Ye Chen!

It was just that night had fallen, and Ye Chen had only just left not long ago. Liu Ruyan didn't feel right summoning him back again.

"That brat got off easy..."

Liu Ruyan murmured to herself.

In the small courtyard...

After taking the Core Formation Pill, a small figure with eight or nine parts resemblance to him successfully condensed within Ye Chen's dantian...

Now he was guiding the spiritual energy within his body to frantically assault the realm barrier!

The condensed Nascent Soul made everything flow smoothly, breaking through the barrier.

*Boom—*

The aura around Ye Chen began to surge wildly!

"Early Nascent Soul!"

He opened his eyes, gradually restraining his aura...

"Senior Brother broke through!"

"Wonderful—Nascent Soul realm..."

"I never imagined Senior Brother would reach Nascent Soul before us!"

Lin Qingxue and the others, who had been standing guard, exclaimed with delight the moment they saw Ye Chen break through. The hearts they'd been holding finally relaxed completely.

No one had expected Ye Chen's breakthrough to be so effortless.

Back when they first met, Ye Chen was only at Qi Refinement while they were already at Foundation Establishment.

Now the three of them were still at Golden Core, yet Ye Chen had condensed his Nascent Soul first!

Ye Chen stood up, and the three women immediately crowded around him, overjoyed, celebrating his breakthrough to Nascent Soul!

"Senior Brother is so impressive!"

Hearing this, Ye Chen smiled and raised his head to gaze toward the distant mountain peak. The Lightning Tribulation there had long since disappeared.

It seemed Liu Ruyan had also successfully broken through to Void Refining!

This was good news for both the sect and Ye Chen.

At least his safety within the Blissful Union Sect was now better guaranteed!

"Come on, let's eat first!"

Ye Chen put his arms around Lin Qingxue and the others, heading toward the house...

In a nearby courtyard...

The Grand Elder also sensed a trace of breakthrough aura!

"This is... Nascent Soul Stage?"

A flicker of surprise crossed his aged face!

"Ruyan broke through to Void Refining, and this kid broke through to Nascent Soul..."

"Truly a double blessing!"

The Grand Elder laughed happily.

He seemed to see the future of the Blissful Union Sect—thriving and prosperous!

But soon, as if thinking of something, he suddenly froze...

"This kid and Ruyan broke through almost simultaneously?"

"He went to see Ruyan this afternoon and didn't return until late at night..."

"Could the two of them have...?"

The Grand Elder's smile instantly froze...

As one of those in the know, he was aware of Ye Chen's dual cultivation talent. Any female disciple who dual cultivated with him would see rapid improvement in their cultivation...

The Grand Elder had always been very supportive of this.

But the thought of Liu Ruyan dual cultivating with Ye Chen made him unable to laugh anymore.

What Sect Master fooled around with a disciple?

Though the Blissful Union Sect wasn't an orthodox sect, they couldn't throw all propriety out the window!

Once word got out, wouldn't the entire sect descend into chaos?

He had originally planned to go talk with Liu Ruyan, but just as he was about to rise, he sat back down. Thinking about how Liu Ruyan had used this opportunity to break through to Void Refining—the benefits to the sect outweighed the drawbacks...

For the sect's development, the Grand Elder chose to remain silent.

This matter wasn't something an old man like him should meddle in.

"I just hope Ruyan and this kid can maintain some propriety..."

In the small courtyard...

Ye Chen and the others had eaten their fill, and drowsiness washed over them.

Lu Mengyao and Su Nianwan both returned to their respective rooms to rest.

Lin Qingxue stayed behind to accompany Ye Chen to sleep tonight...

Though she was pregnant, it had only been three months and wasn't too obvious yet.

Besides, her figure was naturally good—even pregnant, she still looked quite alluring.

"Senior Brother..."

"I want to..."

Lin Qingxue's face was flushed as she curled up under the blankets, speaking coquettishly.

"No!"

"You need to take care of your health..."

Ye Chen gently stroked Lin Qingxue's hair, refusing righteously.

While intimacy was possible at this stage, being too vigorous wouldn't be good for the baby.

Ye Chen was keeping things in moderation, not daring to be reckless.

"Senior Brother..."

"But... I really want to!"

Lin Qingxue bit her lip, pleading bashfully.

Usually, after being refused by Ye Chen, Lin Qingxue would drop the matter.

But tonight she didn't give up.

This made Ye Chen hear the longing and persistence in her heart...

Perhaps knowing about Ye Chen and Liu Ruyan had awakened Lin Qingxue's desires.

She had kept herself calm for three months, and now she was struggling to contain herself...

Sharing a bed with Ye Chen, her heart was restless!

"Senior Brother..."

Seeing Ye Chen wasn't responding, Lin Qingxue kept pleading...

Her voice grew softer and softer, filled with seduction.
