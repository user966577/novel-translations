In the room...

Red silk curtains, festive and joyous.

The flickering candlelight on the table cast a rosy glow across everything.

A woman in a bright red wedding dress sat on the bed, veiled in red, her alluring figure especially captivating in the candlelight...

Ye Chen walked into the room, his gaze falling directly on the "bride" as he looked her up and down.

Her 36D assets were prominently displayed!

A pair of stunning legs demanded attention...

"Liu Ruyan really is generous..."

Ye Chen couldn't help but sigh, an excited smile spreading across his face.

Liu Ruyan hadn't forgotten his preferences. He was very satisfied with this arrangement...

Though the red veil obscured her face, her figure alone told him she was a delicate beauty...

The Blissful Union Sect had no shortage of female disciples, but beauties with both looks and figure like this were rare.

Clearly, Liu Ruyan had taken good care of Ye Chen!

Through their interactions, they had gradually built trust, and Liu Ruyan was no longer stingy or reserved.

This female disciple was only at Peak Foundation Establishment, but like Su Nianwan, she possessed a rare Earth-Grade Spiritual Root.

Such talent was extremely rare among the younger generation of sect disciples.

Ye Chen approached step by step, looking at the female disciple within arm's reach, and spoke first.

"What's your name?"

"Replying to Senior Brother, my name is Zhao Ling'er!"

The female disciple answered timidly.

Her voice was soft and gentle, like a reserved, innocent girl.

Ye Chen raised an eyebrow. These seemingly innocent, shy girls were completely different in bed—the contrast was striking.

He could barely wait now.

He had already taken an Endless Vitality Pill beforehand, and his energy was at its peak. At his youthful, vigorous age, he couldn't hold back.

Ye Chen didn't care about ceremony and directly reached out to lift the red veil...

A face beautiful as a heavenly maiden appeared before him—pure, lovely, and utterly captivating.

One glance was enough to make his heart race faster and faster...

*Hiss!*

A flash of heat passed through Ye Chen's eyes.

This female disciple's looks and figure were on par with Lin Qingxue and the others, and she was no less beautiful than Liu Ruyan herself.

She only lacked that seductive, flirtatious air...

But that kind of alluring quality was something cultivated over time anyway!

Ye Chen reached out and pinched her chin, tilting it upward slightly, his eyes narrowing.

"Do you know why the Sect Master sent you here?"

Hearing this, a flush of red crossed Zhao Ling'er's cheeks, and she softly murmured "Mm"...

"The Sect Master sent this disciple... to have children with Senior Brother!"

As she finished speaking, her innocent face instantly turned crimson.

Zhao Ling'er shyly tried to lower her head, but Ye Chen's grip on her chin held her in place. Her face was so red it looked like blood might drip from it.

Ye Chen couldn't help but chuckle.

Was Liu Ruyan being this direct now?

Just sending disciples over to have children?

Well, well, well. This woman really knew how to play her cards...

When he lowered his head and gazed at her pure, lovely face, his mind went blank...

Then... let's both get what we want!

Didn't Ye Chen want rewards from this too?

An Earth-Grade Spiritual Root's drop rate shouldn't be too low. He wondered if Zhao Ling'er would have beginner's luck...

Ye Chen grew more and more excited.

Meeting Ye Chen's heated gaze, Zhao Ling'er blushed, instantly understanding. Shyly, she began to untie the ribbons on her dress...

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving two years of cultivation as a reward!]*

Ye Chen consoled himself that this was just the beginning. Surely better rewards would follow...

He had confidence in himself!

Time to give it his all...

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Clone Talisman (infuse with spiritual energy to trigger, creating a clone of the Host with half the Host's cultivation, controlled by the Host's will)!]*

Another ordinary Clone Talisman!

But for Ye Chen, this was still quite good—at least it was a talisman!

As his cultivation continued to rise, the clones he created would become stronger and stronger...

Ye Chen couldn't help but imagine—if one day he possessed thousands upon thousands of clones, wouldn't attacking the Profound Heaven Holy Land be a piece of cake?

He could even flatten the Profound Heaven Holy Land!

The thought excited him, driving him to work even harder for this great dream...

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Endless Vitality Pill!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Clone Talisman!]*

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Fire Thunder Bomb!]*

Six hours later...

Just as Ye Chen was about to pass out, a series of cold notifications echoed in his mind...

*[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for a direct hit! Would you like to spend 50,000 spirit stones to increase the probability of offspring quality?]*

*[After enhancement, there is a 100% chance of Earth-Grade Spiritual Root]*

*[20% chance of Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root.]*

*[4% chance of Divine-Grade Spiritual Root.]*

*[0.02% chance of Ancient Supreme Spiritual Root!]*

Another direct hit!

Ye Chen didn't hesitate to choose to spend the spirit stones to enhance the offspring's quality!

*[Ding! Successfully deducted 50,000 spirit stones!]*

*[Congratulations, Host, for successfully enhancing offspring quality!]*

After looting the Zhang family, his storage ring was piled high with spirit stones—he didn't need to worry about this at all.

50,000 spirit stones was nothing to Ye Chen now!

In comparison, the quality of his offspring was naturally more important...

That wasn't something spirit stones could compare to!

By now he couldn't hold on any longer. After enhancing the offspring's quality, he fell asleep clutching several talismans and pills.

He wanted to push on further, but his body had reached its limit...

These gains satisfied him completely. It seemed he had one more sliver of hope for storming the Profound Heaven Holy Land.

This time in his dreams, Ye Chen wasn't awakened by nightmares of the Ye family's bloody vendetta. The dark cloud that had haunted him seemed to have vanished with the Zhang family's annihilation.

He slept exceptionally soundly that night...

Dawn broke...

Ye Chen groggily awoke, reaching out to touch the bed beside him—no warmth.

He turned to look. Zhao Ling'er, who had slept so well, was nowhere to be found.

She must have woken before him...

"This girl has pretty good stamina..."

"After being tossed around all night, she can still get up this early!"

Ye Chen muttered, struggling to get up.

After dressing, he walked straight outside.

His stomach was growling with hunger, and he wanted to quickly replenish his energy...

*Creak!*

The door opened...

Ye Chen emerged, supporting himself against the wall, feeling like his body had been completely drained.

Looking up, he saw Lin Qingxue and the others along with the newly arrived Zhao Ling'er all in the courtyard, chatting away, already familiar with each other.

Hearing the noise, they all looked over. Their gazes landed on Ye Chen, a hint of complaint in their eyes...

"Why... why are you all looking at me like that?"

Ye Chen awkwardly scratched his nose, sensing something was off.

"How come you three have such dark circles under your eyes?"

"Didn't you sleep well last night?"

He was naturally referring to Lin Qingxue, Lu Mengyao, and Su Nianwan...

"Heh!"

"You'd have to ask yourself about that, Senior Brother..."

The three women stared at Ye Chen with aggrieved expressions, their resentment heavier than the noonday sun!
