In the adjacent courtyard...

Lin Qingxue and the others had risen early and were basking in the morning sun, sipping tea and chatting.

A disciple walked in.

"Is Senior Brother Ye here?"

"The Sect Master is requesting his presence..."

At this, Lin Qingxue and the others exchanged a look, then glanced toward the connected compound with awkward expressions.

They all knew exactly what Ye Chen was doing in there. Interrupting him at a time like this hardly seemed appropriate...

They turned back to the messenger.

"Senior Brother is probably... still busy."

"He won't be able to see the Sect Master for a while..."

"We'll pass along the message once he's back from the compound."

The disciple hesitated, eyeing the connected compound with a puzzled look before nodding slowly.

"Alright..."

He didn't know what Ye Chen could possibly be doing over there that was more important than a summons from the Sect Master.

But he didn't ask.

As one of Liu Ruyan's trusted aides, he knew that anything involving the compound and Ye Chen was classified. The less he knew, the better.

Inside a grand hall...

Liu Ruyan sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, brow knotted, sweat beading her forehead. Her aura churned violently around her.

She was attempting to breach her cultivation barrier, but even after days of accumulation, she still fell short.

After only moments, her aura collapsed...

"Damn it!"

"Still not enough..."

"Peak Void Refining... it's not as easy as I'd hoped."

"Even with that brat's help, this isn't happening overnight!"

Liu Ruyan opened her eyes and muttered, her face pale.

Her smooth breakthrough to mid-stage Void Refining after dual cultivating with Ye Chen had given her a surge of confidence, leading her to attempt peak Void Refining after just a few sessions.

This failure was a splash of cold water.

What took other cultivators over a century to break through—how could she possibly manage it in days?

Even shortcuts needed to be walked more than once.

Liu Ruyan's eyes narrowed, a rosy tint coloring her cheeks...

"If that's what it takes... I'll just have to dual cultivate with him more!"

"If we go day and night, half a month should be enough for another attempt at peak Void Refining, right?"

"Lucky brat..."

She murmured to herself, her heart already racing with anticipation.

It wasn't just the cultivation gains she craved—she was looking forward to the intimacy itself...

The messenger returned.

"Sect Master..."

"Senior Brother Ye seems to be occupied. He said he'll come by later."

Liu Ruyan's brow twitched with a hint of confusion.

"Busy?"

"What could that brat possibly be busy with..."

Before she finished the sentence, realization struck. Her face flushed as a pang of jealousy flared in her chest.

Other women were more important than her?

That brat—forgetting her the moment he saw something new?

Infuriating!!!

Now she had to queue up just to dual cultivate with him?

The disciple elaborated hesitantly:

"Sect Master, Senior Brother Ye appears to be in the new compound..."

Liu Ruyan's expression froze, then shifted as understanding dawned. She waved dismissively.

"I see!"

"You're dismissed."

Once the disciple left, Liu Ruyan let out a long, melancholic sigh...

"I knew I shouldn't have given him so many female disciples..."

"Now he'll have even less time for me."

"That little troublemaker..."

Her mood sank.

Though she always claimed she didn't care—that she was just letting Ye Chen take advantage of her—deep down, she craved the dual cultivation sessions more than he did...

Now that Ye Chen was busy servicing the compound's hundred disciples, he had even less time and energy to spare.

Even though Ye Chen was doing this to strengthen the sect's disciples—fulfilling her own orders, in fact—Liu Ruyan couldn't muster an ounce of happiness...

Somewhere along the way, she'd started caring more than she wanted to admit.

Looking around the empty, cavernous hall with no one but herself in it, the loneliness cut deeper.

What she truly craved wasn't the cultivation boost. It was Ye Chen's company...

In the compound...

Inside the room marked with a "Two" plaque.

Ye Chen was lost in bliss.

Suddenly his ears started burning...

"Strange..."

"Who's thinking about me?"

He muttered in puzzlement, then refocused on farming rewards...

Riding the wave of an Endless Vitality Pill, Ye Chen was at full power—energetic and sharp!

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one year of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Endless Vitality Pill!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Earth Fire Bomb!*

The instant "Endless Vitality Pill" appeared, Ye Chen knew this session had already paid for itself...

All he wanted now was a few more!

Yuan Xiang was being wonderfully cooperative!

She looked like a demure, reserved flower, but her enthusiasm left Ye Chen genuinely surprised!

Wilder than Li Xinyue—a complete contrast to her appearance!

Totally beyond Ye Chen's expectations!

He silently thanked himself for taking an Endless Vitality Pill beforehand. Without it, his body might not have survived...

Before long, another cold notification chimed in his mind...

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! Perfect shot! Would you like to spend 10,000 spirit stones to enhance offspring aptitude?*

*After enhancement: 100% chance of Profound-Grade Spiritual Root*

*50% chance of Earth-Grade Spiritual Root*

*10% chance of Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root*

*1% chance of Divine-Grade Spiritual Root*

*0.01% chance of Ancient Supreme Spiritual Root!*

Like Li Xinyue, Yuan Xiang also possessed a Profound-Grade Spiritual Root, which meant the offspring aptitude brackets were identical.

Ye Chen chose to spend the spirit stones without hesitation...

*Ding! 10,000 spirit stones deducted successfully!*

*Congratulations, Host! Offspring aptitude enhancement successful!*

Ten thousand spirit stones was nothing to Ye Chen now. If he could, he'd gladly spend even more to improve the odds.

Higher-grade Spiritual Root children would bring rewards that far exceeded anything he could imagine...

And when these children grew up, they'd become invaluable allies.

Raising them for the sect's legacy was also building his own power base.

Four hours later...

Ye Chen bid Yuan Xiang a wan farewell and shuffled out of the room, bracing himself against the wall.

If he didn't leave now, his life might actually end here...

His storage ring held a few more Endless Vitality Pills than before, which made all the suffering feel worthwhile...

So what if he was drained? Worth it!

He looked toward the wall connecting to Lin Qingxue's courtyard, already yearning for Su Nianwan's tonic soup.

Soup was the answer. He needed more soup!

He'd taken barely two steps when several dolled-up female disciples appeared from the compound, sauntering toward him with bright smiles...

"Senior Brother, don't leave..."

"Come keep me company too!"

"Come play, handsome!"

Ye Chen froze, his face draining of color!

Crap. He really had fallen into the Spider Demon's Lair!!!
