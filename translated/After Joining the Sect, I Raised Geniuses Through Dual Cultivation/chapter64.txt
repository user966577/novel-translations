Blissful Union Sect.

A small courtyard.

On a bed draped with crimson curtains...

Ye Chen was still deep in slumber when he felt something tickling his chest...

His eyes snapped open to find a beautiful face inches from his own, the scent of her hair filling his nostrils.

Every breath was intoxicating!

Li Xinyue was curled up beside him, tracing lazy circles on his chest with a slender jade finger.

So the phantom itch in his dream had been her doing!

"You little temptress—you're up this early?"

Ye Chen rubbed her head with a soft chuckle.

"Senior Brother..."

"I can't sleep!"

Li Xinyue gazed up at him with bedroom eyes, her voice sweet and sultry.

It was seductive to the bone!

Ye Chen raised a brow. "Not tired? Then what do you want?"

"I want you!"

Li Xinyue shifted closer, her eyes locked on his, breath warm against his skin.

"You..."

Ye Chen blinked. His body immediately responded to the warmth of her proximity.

What an insatiable little temptress!

After an entire night, she still wasn't satisfied?

It was barely dawn and she was already raring for more?

Ye Chen sighed inwardly. Liu Ruyan sure knew how to pick them!

He was starting to suspect Li Xinyue had received personal training from the Sect Master herself.

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one year of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Endless Vitality Pill!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Earth Fire Bomb!*

The instant he saw "Endless Vitality Pill," Ye Chen's weary eyes blazed with light!

Finally—an Endless Vitality Pill!

Without it, he honestly couldn't keep this up...

Right now, the Endless Vitality Pill and Strength Restoration Pill mattered more to him than any Immortal-Slaying Talisman or Soul Essence Pill!

Taking care of his body was the foundation for farming even greater rewards.

Brimming with excitement, Ye Chen immediately popped the fresh pill into his mouth...

Three seconds later...

Every ounce of fatigue vanished. His body surged back to peak condition, as though he'd been reborn!

The weakness was completely gone!

Confidence flooded back...

Not tired?

Then nobody's sleeping tonight.

He reignited his fighting spirit, determined to use this window to stockpile more Endless Vitality Pills!

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one year of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one year of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one year of cultivation as a reward!*

Listening to the cold notification chimes in his head, Ye Chen was on the verge of snapping.

At this rate, the Endless Vitality Pill would be wasted!

"Give me drops!"

Ye Chen was going all in now, holding absolutely nothing back!

This was a battle of both performance and survival.

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Endless Vitality Pill!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one year of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Endless Vitality Pill!*

Four hours later...

Ye Chen stumbled out of the room, one hand braced against the wall, his complexion a shade paler.

He felt like his entire body had been wrung out like a towel...

But looking at the handful of Endless Vitality Pills in his palm, a grin spread across his face!

Not only had he broken even—he'd come out ahead!

One pill invested, multiple returned...

If Li Xinyue hadn't given out first, he would've popped another pill and really gone to town!

That should keep her sleeping soundly for a while.

He stashed the pills in his storage ring and was heading back to Lin Qingxue's compound for some food and a nap.

Then he ran right into another disciple coming out of the next room...

A woman of fresh, delicate beauty. Her fragrance arrived before she did!

It was a light, clean scent—refreshing yet captivating...

She'd apparently just stepped out of the room next door. Spotting Ye Chen, she showed no surprise—just a blush creeping across her cheeks...

She'd clearly known he was in the compound.

"Senior Brother Ye!"

"My name is Yuan Xiang. The... the Sect Master sent me."

Yuan Xiang looked at Ye Chen shyly.

"Hm?"

"You know who I am?"

Ye Chen asked in surprise.

He hadn't even introduced himself. How did she know?

"This compound has no other male disciples besides Senior Brother Ye..."

"Before we came, the Sect Master briefed all of us."

Yuan Xiang explained, her face crimson.

"Ah, I see..."

Ye Chen understood immediately.

He hadn't realized Liu Ruyan's arrangements had been this thorough—not just numbering rooms and categorizing disciples, but even barring all other men from entry.

She'd truly turned this compound into his personal "harem"...

While he was still processing this, the seemingly demure Yuan Xiang made her move!

She grabbed his arm and started dragging him toward her room...

"Hey..."

"Hold on!"

Ye Chen blinked, a strange expression on his face as he felt the warm contact of her grip.

First meeting and already getting handsy?

One look and she was hauling him into her bedroom?

She looked so innocent, but this forward?

Ye Chen studied Yuan Xiang more closely...

Delicate features. Pure, refined beauty. A petite, classic beauty.

Maybe not a 36D, but her slender, shapely figure was alluring in its own right...

A completely different type from Li Xinyue—petite and dainty, yet equally captivating.

The only thing they had in common was the grab-and-drag approach. Equally forward!

Like they were terrified he'd escape...

"Senior Brother, I've been waiting for you for days..."

"Please don't leave, okay?"

"Just stay in my room for a few hours!"

"I promise I'll take good care of you..."

Yuan Xiang pleaded with him, her eyes already misting over.

She looked like she was about to cry...

"Don't cry..."

Ye Chen reached out and gently cupped her face in reassurance.

A delicate beauty on the verge of tears—it tugged at anyone's heartstrings.

She'd practically begged at this point. How could he just walk away?

He couldn't play favorites, could he?

Last night he'd spent the whole time in Li Xinyue's room. Now Yuan Xiang was pleading with him. Could he really bring himself to leave?

That wasn't how Ye Chen operated!

When a disciple had a request, he'd create the conditions to deliver—even if conditions didn't exist!

"Alright, alright. Your Senior Brother will stay and keep you company..."

"No more tears. Come on, let's go inside and talk..."

Ye Chen took Yuan Xiang's hand and walked into her room.

"Mm-hmm!"

"Thank you for staying, Senior Brother..."

Yuan Xiang's face lit up instantly.

*Click!*

The moment the door closed, Ye Chen surreptitiously slipped an Endless Vitality Pill from his storage ring and swallowed it...

Three seconds later, every trace of weakness vanished!

Ye Chen silently thanked the heavens he'd stockpiled those pills this morning. Without them, he'd be in serious trouble right now...

They really were lifesavers!

At this point, he felt like he'd wandered straight into the Spider Demon's Lair—and there was no getting out...
