"Sect Master, don't do this..."

Ye Chen was exercising every ounce of self-control. The fire in his lower abdomen was about to explode!

Liu Ruyan, taking the initiative to seduce him, was even more tempting than Lin Qingxue and the others...

"Ye Chen..."

"Don't tell me... you can't do it?"

Her coquettish teasing voice drifted into Ye Chen's ears...

Accompanied by a warm breath brushing against his earlobe!

*Boom—*

Ye Chen's thoughts completely shattered...

"Who are you calling impotent?"

"I'll show you what I'm capable of right now..."

Ye Chen spoke in a low voice, sweeping Liu Ruyan up into his arms and striding toward a side chamber not far away.

At this moment, all thoughts of Sect Master and respecting one's teachers had been cast to the back of his mind.

She was throwing herself at him for dual cultivation—how could he possibly refuse?

If word got out, people might actually think he couldn't perform!

Looking down on him, was she?

Right now, Ye Chen had only one thought in his mind—he had to teach this little temptress a lesson...

Let her know what he was capable of!

"Hee hee hee hee hee!"

Liu Ruyan giggled coquettishly, the sound echoing through the empty hall.

"Fine!"

"Then let me see just how capable you are..."

"Don't disappoint me!"

Liu Ruyan spoke with anticipation, throwing Ye Chen a flirtatious glance...

Every word continued to stimulate Ye Chen's nerves. His thoughts were completely consumed by desire...

Ye Chen tossed Liu Ruyan onto the pink bed. One glance at her bewitching figure, and his mind was left with nothing but primal urges. Without another word, he pounced...

"Ahh!!!"

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving five years of cultivation as a reward!]

Ye Chen listened to the reward notification flash through his mind, and his eyes immediately lit up...

Just as he'd suspected—dual cultivating with Liu Ruyan yielded far more generous rewards!

This instantly ignited his motivation!

Liu Ruyan's enchanting body also captivated him.

Outside the great hall...

The disciples standing guard faintly heard wanton cries coming from within. Confusion filled their hearts.

Why did those sounds seem so strange?

Could the Sect Master and Ye Chen be fighting?

The disciples glanced back at the tightly closed hall doors, not thinking much of it.

With Ye Chen's cultivation, there was no way he could bully Liu Ruyan. They weren't worried anything would happen.

At the same time, Liu Ruyan also sensed something was wrong!

Before completely losing her senses, she waved a hand and set up a barrier, isolating the great hall from the outside world. Not a single sound would escape.

Only then could she feel at ease screaming at the top of her lungs...

Ye Chen's prowess exceeded her imagination!

Half a shichen later...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for a successful conception. Would you like to spend 100,000 Spirit Stones to increase the offspring's aptitude probability?]

[After enhancement, there is a 100% chance of Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root.]

[A 20% chance of Divine-Grade Spiritual Root.]

[A one-in-a-thousand chance of Ancient Supreme Spiritual Root!]

A string of cold notification tones sounded...

Ye Chen was instantly stunned!

He hadn't expected that the offspring conceived through dual cultivation with Liu Ruyan...

Would have Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root as the guaranteed minimum?

This was the kind of thing he wouldn't dare dream of!

Even the probabilities for Divine-Grade and Ancient Supreme Spiritual Roots had increased dramatically!

Such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—Ye Chen naturally wouldn't be stingy with Spirit Stones.

Without hesitation, he selected "Yes!"

The next second, the Spirit Stones in his storage ring vanished completely...

[Ding! Successfully deducted 100,000 Spirit Stones!]

[Congratulations, Host, for successfully increasing offspring aptitude probability!]

Ye Chen looked down at Liu Ruyan in his arms. Her bashful appearance was full of allure.

At this moment, it all felt unreal—like he was in a dream!

He had actually slept with Liu Ruyan...

This kind of thing had only ever appeared in his dreams. He never imagined it would actually happen in bed!

And Liu Ruyan had initiated it herself!

What exactly was going on?

Could Liu Ruyan have been drugged?

"Ye Chen..."

"Is this... all you've got?"

Liu Ruyan's enchanting voice came again...

She lifted her head, looking at Ye Chen with desire-filled eyes, a hungry gleam flickering in them!

Ye Chen: !!!

"Of course not!"

"Don't get too cocky!"

"I'll show you what I'm capable of!"

Ye Chen was immediately displeased.

This was clearly an insult!

He had to teach her a thorough lesson...

"Hee hee hee hee hee!"

Liu Ruyan covered her mouth and laughed...

The sound kept provoking Ye Chen's emotions!

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving five years of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Teleportation Talisman (Inject spiritual energy to activate. Allows the Host to traverse ten thousand li and instantly arrive at any location in their thoughts)!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Core Formation Pill (Consuming it will help the Host condense a Nascent Soul and break through to prove the Dao)!]

Ye Chen watched the stream of rewards flash through his mind...

Not only was he receiving physical and spiritual pleasure, but his cultivation was also improving dramatically. Plus there were various rare pills and talismans.

All of this gave Ye Chen tremendous motivation!

With such a rare opportunity to dual cultivate with Liu Ruyan, he naturally had to cherish it.

Strive for even more rewards!

Liu Ruyan possessed the exceedingly rare Divine-Grade Spiritual Root. Dual cultivating with her gave Ye Chen several times the drop rate compared to Lin Qingxue and the others.

Plus there was a very high probability of obtaining rare talismans and pills!

In a small courtyard...

Lin Qingxue, Lu Mengyao, and Su Nianwan were all still sitting in the courtyard. From time to time, they glanced toward the courtyard gate, worry gradually creeping into their eyes.

"Why has Senior Brother been gone so long without coming back?"

"Nothing... dangerous could have happened, right?"

Lin Qingxue spoke with concern.

By now, evening had fallen. Ye Chen had been gone for several shichen already.

Logically speaking, the distance from Liu Ruyan's hall to this small courtyard was less than a quarter hour's walk.

At such a short distance, Ye Chen should have been back long ago.

Not seeing any sign of Ye Chen, they couldn't help but worry.

"We're inside the sect. No one should dare make a move against Senior Brother..."

Su Nianwan shook her head and spoke hesitantly.

Though she herself had been abducted by Jiang Yuyan inside the sect last time, Jiang Yuyan was now dead. With no one opposing Liu Ruyan, there shouldn't be anyone targeting Ye Chen.

Besides, Ye Chen was already at Golden Core cultivation. Even among the personal disciples, hardly anyone was his match.

"Perhaps... Senior Brother got held up by something?"

"The Sect Master specifically summoned him—it must be something important!"

Lu Mengyao thought it over and guessed.

"That's possible..."

Lin Qingxue and Su Nianwan both nodded in agreement, gradually feeling relieved.

If Ye Chen was with Liu Ruyan, they had nothing to worry about...

With Liu Ruyan there, no one could harm Ye Chen.

The Sect Master shouldn't do anything to Senior Brother... right?
