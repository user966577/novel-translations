Ye Chen looked at the reward notification that flashed by, his spirits soaring!

Skills were good! Skills must be learned!

That was how to earn more rewards...

With the Immortal-Grade artifact Bright Moon Mirror, Ye Chen now had another life-saving trump card.

Before, he'd only received cultivation rewards. Finally getting an Immortal-Grade artifact was a welcome change.

Though the probability was low, Ye Chen firmly believed in the principle that hard work pays off.

When quantity went up, probability naturally followed.

This undoubtedly fired up Ye Chen's fighting spirit...

In the courtyard wing...

After Lu Mengyao and several servant girls bustled about, another bridal chamber was ready.

Yet the battle in the adjacent room still raged on!

Lu Mengyao and Su Nianwan exchanged glances.

Both their faces were crimson, too embarrassed to know what to do with themselves.

The room fell into a brief silence.

Su Nianwan hesitated before speaking first.

"Tonight's bridal chamber... might not be needed after all."

Ye Chen had expended all his energy on Lin Qingxue. By tonight, he'd probably be too exhausted. How could he possibly consummate their marriage?

She felt she'd come at the wrong time. She should have waited another day.

"Probably... not?"

"Senior Brother Ye's body is pretty impressive."

Lu Mengyao explained, face flushed.

Hearing this, Su Nianwan's face reddened even more.

Her mind began to wander...

An hour later...

Dusk was falling, and the commotion in the courtyard finally subsided.

Lin Qingxue fell into a deep sleep, tear tracks still visible at the corners of her eyes.

The door opened. Ye Chen emerged, bracing himself against the wall, his face slightly pale, his entire body drenched in sweat...

"What a little vixen!"

Ye Chen sighed.

Fortunately, the Vigorous Man Physique supported his body, or he'd have collapsed long ago.

Though exhausted, Ye Chen had thoroughly enjoyed himself.

This wasn't just pleasure of body and soul—it also brought him considerable benefits...

Besides the Immortal-Grade defensive artifact he'd received earlier, he'd also accumulated several years' worth of cultivation rewards!

He could vaguely sense his realm approaching another bottleneck, a breakthrough imminent...

He'd never cultivated this fast before.

"Li Shaoyang, Zhang Shuyu—you pair of dogs, just wait!"

"The blood debt owed to the Ye family—I'll make you repay it in blood!"

Ye Chen muttered through gritted teeth, a cold glint flashing in his eyes!

Li Shaoyang was the Young Master of the Profound Heaven Holy Land—a wastrel who did as he pleased, relying on his sect master father.

While traveling through Jiangye City, he'd taken a fancy to Ye Haotian's beautiful wife, Zhang Shuyu.

Zhang Shuyu was a fickle woman to begin with. Once she learned Li Shaoyang's identity, she threw herself at him willingly.

Not only did the two become entangled, they also murdered Ye Haotian and the Ye clan members, seizing the family's entire estate.

Li Shaoyang couldn't have cared less about the Ye family's assets. He simply treated them as a gift for his little mistress Zhang Shuyu and let his subordinate elders carry out the massacre!

Ye Chen would never forget that night of blood and carnage, the Ye clan members slaughtered mercilessly.

Whenever he recalled his kin's gruesome deaths and his sister Ye Qing'er's capture, rage consumed him, killing intent radiating from his being!

He wanted nothing more than to tear that pair of dogs limb from limb...

Before, he had no talent and weak cultivation. Anger was useless.

But now he had the Many Blessings System. Having offspring would earn him generous rewards, and every seeding session boosted his cultivation...

This undoubtedly gave Ye Chen hope for revenge!

As long as he worked the fields diligently, it wouldn't be long before he had the strength to personally slay his enemies...

"Li Shaoyang—Early Golden Core cultivation!"

"The elders following him are all at Nascent Soul!"

"Once I break through to Nascent Soul, I can go seek revenge and rescue Qing'er!"

Ye Chen had long since formulated his plan...

Just then, Lu Mengyao emerged from the adjacent room. Seeing Ye Chen leaning against the wall as he walked, she quickly approached.

She looked him up and down, her expression concerned.

"Senior Brother, are you alright?"

Ye Chen waved his hand. "I'm fine. Just need a moment to recover."

He'd merely been drained. A bit of rest and he'd be back to full energy.

The Vigorous Man Physique allowed Ye Chen to recover quickly...

"Really?"

Lu Mengyao was skeptical.

Ye Chen had just emerged from the room. He needed to brace himself against the wall just to walk. How could he recover in "a moment"?

"Of course!"

Ye Chen's voice rose several notches!

Who are you doubting?

A man can never admit he can't perform!

Seeing Ye Chen's earnest expression, Lu Mengyao nodded hesitantly.

Remembering how frequently Ye Chen "practiced new moves," she decided to believe him.

*Senior Brother Ye really does have great stamina!*

"Senior Brother, the Sect Master sent another female disciple..."

"Her name is Su Nianwan. She's in the room next door!"

"Senior Brother, you'll be sleeping in Senior Sister Su's room tonight..."

Lu Mengyao looked up at Ye Chen as she spoke.

Though she too had thoughts of dual cultivation, tonight was Su Nianwan's wedding night. Lu Mengyao wouldn't intrude.

"Su Nianwan?"

Ye Chen raised an eyebrow and glanced at the neighboring room, then nodded. "Got it!"

Inwardly, he marveled at how generous Liu Ruyan really was...

A Sect Master like her was hard to find even with a lantern.

He also felt grateful for having previously obtained the Vigorous Man Physique. Otherwise, his body would have been hollowed out by now.

"Senior Brother, you must be hungry, right?"

"Let me go prepare some food..."

Lu Mengyao spoke considerately.

Given how tired and weak Ye Chen looked, he must be famished.

"Good!"

Ye Chen felt warmth in his heart.

After Lu Mengyao left, he glanced back at Lin Qingxue sleeping soundly on the bed and considerately closed the door.

She probably wouldn't wake up tonight. She'd sleep straight through till tomorrow.

Best let her rest well!

Ye Chen recovered a bit of strength, then turned and headed for the room next door...

He trusted that Liu Ruyan's carefully selected female disciples would all have first-rate figures and looks!

She wouldn't be careless about something like this, and the Blissful Union Sect was never short of female disciples...

Ye Chen found himself curious about this female disciple named Su Nianwan.

What kind of personality would the one sent this time have?

Passionate and bold? Pure and shy?

Or perhaps some kind of tempting uniform?

A few steps later...

Ye Chen stood at the doorway. Through the open door, he immediately spotted Su Nianwan sitting on the bed in her red wedding attire...

Her alluring figure paired with the red silk dress embroidered with golden thread radiated temptation from head to toe!

The loose, high-waisted dress and fair, white skin were especially captivating.

That exquisite face was flushed pink, so tender it seemed water might drip from it.

Her pure, elegant aura was tinged with a hint of seduction—innocent yet sensual at once, every smile seemingly designed to steal one's soul!

Her beauty was different from Lin Qingxue's or Lu Mengyao's, yet her figure and looks were no less impressive.

Ye Chen couldn't help taking several extra glances before finding himself drawn into the room as if by magic...
