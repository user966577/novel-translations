A thread of consciousness once again took hold of the clone, now thousands of miles away...

Ye Chen's clone darted through a forest in the dead of night.

Though he'd already destroyed the Zhang family, Profound Heaven Holy Land still had him on their wanted list.

Even in clone form, Ye Chen didn't dare draw attention. If he flew openly and was spotted, things could get ugly...

He didn't know enough about the methods Profound Heaven Holy Land's experts had at their disposal. Caution was the only option.

"Help!"

A cry for help echoed from the trees ahead...

Ye Chen's first instinct was to ignore it. After his last rescue attempt—where the grateful villagers had turned on him—he wasn't keen on playing hero again.

But the voice was heading straight toward him, getting closer by the second...

The commotion in the forest was growing louder.

Ye Chen's brow furrowed as he sensed something wrong.

"Is that..."

"A beast stampede?"

The forest floor was trembling, as if the earth itself might split apart!

This level of disturbance was far beyond what one or two cultivators could produce. That left only one possibility—demonic beasts!

Between the tremors, Ye Chen caught the roars of beasts. Birds and animals fled in every direction...

Ye Chen stopped atop a tall tree trunk, scanning the dense forest ahead!

A female cultivator was running for her life. Her robes were torn in several places, exposing pale skin beneath...

Behind her, hundreds—no, thousands—of silver-white snow wolves gave chase. Each one's eyes glowed an eerie green, deeply unsettling in the dark!

"Help..."

"I'm a disciple of the Spirit Stream Sect! Someone, please save me!"

The woman ran and screamed, her voice cracking with tears.

Being chased by an entire wolf pack, even a Foundation Establishment cultivator could only run.

One wrong move and she'd be devoured, bones and all!

Each snow wolf was roughly equivalent to a Qi Condensation cultivator, but their sheer numbers were overwhelming. In a prolonged fight, she'd be drained of spiritual energy in no time.

"Damn it!"

"Why'd she have to run this way..."

Ye Chen eyed the surging wolf pack from his tree branch and cursed under his breath...

He didn't want to get involved, but this woman had unwittingly led the entire horde straight at him. Now he had no choice but to act.

Either that, or turn tail and run!

Ye Chen flicked his wrist, and a white longsword appeared in his hand.

He'd found it in the Daoist elder's storage ring.

In a flash, he materialized in the snow wolves' path...

The fleeing woman spotted him and erupted with joy, screaming as she barreled toward him:

"Fellow Daoist, save me!"

She charged straight for Ye Chen without a thought for the danger she might be leading his way.

In that moment, all she wanted was to be saved!

Ye Chen glanced at her—the torn robes, the pale skin peeking through. Somewhat enticing...

He looked for just a moment, then turned his attention forward.

As she blew past him, Ye Chen's sword swept down in a devastating arc...

A wave of frigid sword energy exploded outward, carving into the wolf pack!

*BOOM!*

*SQUELCH! SQUELCH! SQUELCH!*

Dozens of snow wolves were shredded by the sword energy in an instant, their carcasses scattered across the ground, the air thick with the stench of blood!

*HOWL!*

The remaining wolves skidded to a halt, snarling at Ye Chen in fear.

They sensed danger from him, but they didn't retreat.

The pack was regrouping for another charge...

*RUMBLE!*

The ground shook beneath his feet...

Ye Chen's expression hardened. This was bad.

"More beasts are heading this way..."

"We need to leave—now!"

He turned to the woman sheltering behind him.

Individual snow wolves weren't a threat, but if more beasts swarmed in, they'd be in real danger.

This was only a clone. If the fighting dragged on and his spiritual energy ran out, the clone would dissipate.

He had far more important things to do. Wasting a clone on beast combat was out of the question.

"No!"

"We can't go..."

"My Senior Brother is still out there—the wolves have him trapped too."

"You have to go save him!"

The woman pointed toward the forest ahead.

She planted her feet, clearly refusing to leave without her fellow disciple.

Ye Chen stared at her, his expression turning incredulous...

He wasn't sure he'd heard correctly!

"Your Senior Brother's life or death is none of my business!"

"Why the hell would I go save him?"

Ye Chen snapped.

The beast horde was surging toward them. Sending him to rescue someone was basically asking him to die.

"If you won't save my Senior Brother... then I'm not leaving either..."

The woman glared, biting her lip stubbornly.

An expression of absolute defiance!

Ye Chen paused. He regarded her with an odd look, then couldn't help but laugh.

"Not leaving? Then stay here and die..."

"Idiot."

He'd never seen someone this stupid.

Complete strangers, and she was trying to blackmail him with her own life?

Who couldn't handle that kind of bluff?

She could die as far away from him as she pleased. He couldn't care less...

He still needed to conserve his clone's energy to reach Profound Heaven Holy Land. Once he had the location marked, his real body could sneak in via Teleportation Talisman and rescue his sister Ye Qing'er.

Why would he waste a clone on some random woman?

With that, Ye Chen vanished in a blur...

"Hey, why are you leaving..."

"Come back!"

"Don't go..."

The woman stood frozen, watching his departing figure as her mind went blank.

This wasn't how things were supposed to go...

Wasn't he supposed to risk his life rescuing her beloved Senior Brother?

How could he just... leave?

What about her?

*HOWL!*

While she stood there stunned, the wolves lunged, a tide of fur and fangs crashing toward her...

"No!"

"Save me..."

The woman screamed in terror, regret consuming her...

She wanted Ye Chen to come back, but he was already long gone.

"AAHHH!!!"

Her screams tore through the forest...

A massive snow wolf pounced, clamping its jaws around her throat. She went limp.

Moments later, nothing remained on the ground but a pool of blood—not even bones...

Ye Chen caught the distant screams behind him but didn't look back. He skirted the forest and kept moving.

The woman's fate meant nothing to him.

Respect others' choices. She'd chosen to stay—nothing he could do about that.

He pressed on, covering ground as fast as he could...

Night gave way to dawn, and the sky brightened once more.

Suddenly, Ye Chen felt an itch on his chest. He scratched at it, but it wouldn't go away...

"Strange..."

"What's going on?"

"Could it be..."

A thought struck him, and his consciousness snapped fully awake...
