The Xu family was one of the noble houses of Jiangye City, their power comparable to what the Ye family had once been.

The two families were old friends with deep ties.

Before the Ye family's destruction, the Ye and Xu families had arranged a betrothal—the Ye family's young master Ye Chen would wed the Xu family's daughter Xu Qingqing.

Months ago, both families had been preparing for this wedding. Unfortunately, the Ye family was destroyed overnight, and with Ye Chen's whereabouts unknown and his fate uncertain, the engagement was called off...

Though the Xu family held considerable power in Jiangye City, they were mere ants before a colossus like the Profound Heaven Holy Land.

Even if they had wanted to avenge the Ye family, they lacked the strength.

Any attempt to speak up for the Ye family could result in the Xu family meeting the same fate.

No one had expected Ye Chen to not only survive but return for revenge—single-handedly destroying the entire Zhang family!

At this moment, the various powers gathered outside the gate were stunned when they saw Ye Chen!

"He's... Young Master Ye Chen of the Ye family!"

"He's actually still alive, and he's wiped out the entire Zhang family!"

*Hiss!* "How is this possible? I remember this Ye family young master was only at Qi Refinement. How is he now a Nascent Soul expert?"

"The Zhang family has been completely destroyed just like that? This is unbelievable!"

"Ye Chen really did come back for revenge. Isn't he afraid of the Profound Heaven Holy Land backing the Zhang family?"

"Once the Young Sect Master of Profound Heaven Holy Land learns that Ye Chen killed that slut Zhang Shuyu, he'll definitely want Ye Chen dead!"

The crowd discussed animatedly, filled with amazement.

No one had anticipated Ye Chen would return for revenge.

Xu Qingqing also spotted Ye Chen standing at the gates, her heart full of mixed emotions.

They had been childhood sweethearts, growing up together, and were bound by engagement.

In Xu Qingqing's heart, Ye Chen was her betrothed, and she was Ye Chen's bride-to-be.

When the Ye family was destroyed months ago, Xu Qingqing had been worried about Ye Chen's safety and had even left the city to search for him.

But as a woman with only Qi Refinement cultivation, even if she wanted to avenge the Ye family, she was powerless.

With the Profound Heaven Holy Land backing the Zhang family, none of the noble houses in Jiangye City dared offend them—never mind Xu Qingqing alone; even the entire Xu family was no match.

Seeing that Ye Chen was still alive, Xu Qingqing was so moved that tears welled in her eyes. Months of worry and longing rushed to the surface...

She wanted to rush forward and embrace Ye Chen, to tell him how much she had missed him, and to fulfill their engagement before any more regrets piled up.

Just as Xu Qingqing was about to step forward, Ye Chen merely glanced at her once, then looked away. The next instant, he stepped forward and vanished from the spot...

He had left!

"Ye Chen!"

"It's me, Xu Qingqing!"

Xu Qingqing called out desperately into the empty air.

She wanted to stop Ye Chen, but there was no response.

She didn't understand why Ye Chen hadn't come to find her, why he was so cold toward her.

Their feelings used to be so good...

"Could it be... he's angry at me, angry that the Xu family didn't avenge the Ye family?"

Xu Qingqing murmured to herself, her heart full of reluctance to part.

She had finally seen Ye Chen, only to have a brief encounter before he left again.

The next meeting might be who knows when—or perhaps the two of them would never cross paths again.

Reluctance and regret welled up in her heart. Xu Qingqing stood there crying her eyes out...

"Miss, please don't be too sad. It's not good for your health."

"At least... Young Master Ye is still alive!"

Her maidservant hurried to comfort her.

"No, I have to find him!"

"I, Xu Qingqing, am his in life, and his fiancée in death!"

Xu Qingqing's eyes filled with determination as she resolved to search for Ye Chen.

On a mountain peak outside Jiangye City...

Ye Chen looked back at this familiar city, his heart also full of reluctance.

What he was most reluctant to leave behind was that tender figure he had dreamed of day and night...

He missed Xu Qingqing too, but he couldn't acknowledge her, couldn't have any connection with her—otherwise, it would harm her and the entire Xu family.

Ye Chen had slaughtered the entire Zhang family for revenge. After killing, he could simply leave—it wouldn't be easy for the Young Sect Master of Profound Heaven Holy Land to come after him.

But the Xu family was different. The entire family lived in Jiangye City. If they were connected to Ye Chen and the Profound Heaven Holy Land retaliated, the whole Xu family would be finished.

To protect Xu Qingqing, Ye Chen could only pretend not to know her, coldly departing to completely sever ties with the Xu family.

Now that the Zhang family was destroyed and his great vengeance achieved, Ye Chen had no more attachments to Jiangye City. He immediately took out a Teleportation Talisman from his storage ring, infused it with spiritual energy, and stepped into the black vortex...

The Blissful Union Sect wasn't far from Jiangye City. With Ye Chen's cultivation, he could arrive before dark.

He just didn't want anyone in the sect to know he had gone out—including Liu Ruyan.

Although the sect was fully supporting him and cared deeply about his safety, they were ultimately in a "cooperative" relationship.

Ye Chen was more like a "tool" the sect's upper echelon used to increase their power!

While receiving the sect's protection, he would also lose his original freedom.

If the Grand Elder or Liu Ruyan found out he had left the sect on his own, they might restrict his movements under the pretext of protection, or even monitor him more closely.

After all, the secrets Ye Chen carried were enough to drive countless sects and powers mad.

Beyond that, the Profound Heaven Holy Land was also sending people to hunt him. If he had bad luck and encountered them on the road, it would all be over.

Though Teleportation Talismans were precious, they could help him avoid many troubles, which made them worth it.

Besides, Ye Chen had accumulated several Teleportation Talismans through his diligent efforts. Once back at the sect, he would have opportunities to obtain more—no need to be stingy.

Shortly after the black vortex vanished, several figures appeared where Ye Chen had been standing...

"Strange, I clearly sensed that kid's aura was right around here. Where did he go?"

A ferocious-looking middle-aged man frowned and spoke in a deep voice.

"I can't sense his aura anymore either. It's like he vanished into thin air!"

Another person spoke up.

"How is that possible? He's also at Nascent Soul. How could he leave so quickly?"

A rat-faced man said with an ugly expression.

"What a shame. If we had acted when we left the city, we might have been able to keep him. Then we could have handed him over to the Young Sect Master of Profound Heaven Holy Land and exchanged him for quite a few good things..."

Another cultivator spoke with regret.

They were strong cultivators from several powers in Jiangye City. Upon learning that Ye Chen had destroyed the Zhang family, they had wanted to join forces to capture him and hand him over to the Profound Heaven Holy Land in exchange for cultivation resources or treasures.

Their relationship with the Ye family had been ordinary, with no real friendship. Seeing profit to be made, they had acted on their greed—only to lose track of him.

Having searched in vain, they could only give up in frustration.
