In a neighboring courtyard...

The haggard-looking Grand Elder slowly opened his eyes, his brow furrowing deeper and deeper.

"Wait—has this kid lost his mind?"

"Not sleeping in the middle of the night?"

"Didn't he just get back from Liu Ruyan's place? What's going on!"

"Does he want to die?"

He was somewhat baffled.

Even in his youth, he'd never carried on like this!

If this continued, wouldn't his body become depleted?

The Grand Elder fell into contemplation, debating whether he should go advise Ye Chen to exercise some restraint.

After all, Ye Chen was crucial to the Blissful Union Sect's prosperity!

After thinking it over, he gave up.

These old folks didn't know how much longer they could hold on. Only when the younger generation of disciples grew up quickly could he truly be at ease.

The faster Su Nianwan and the others grew, the sooner they could fill the void in the sect's core strength.

"I just hope this kid's body can hold up!"

"For the sect's sake..."

"I should arrange a few more female disciples to be sent to the small courtyard..."

The Grand Elder muttered to himself, gradually forming an idea.

He desperately wanted the sect to prosper—he dreamed of it!

In the small courtyard...

Dawn was breaking!

Ye Chen listened to the reward notifications flashing through his mind, grinning with delight.

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving two years of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Thunder Burst Talisman!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Invisibility Talisman!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one year of cultivation as a reward!]

He was already at Early Nascent Soul cultivation. Even after an entire night of battle and earning considerable cultivation rewards, breaking through again was still difficult.

After stepping into Nascent Soul, advancing realms became increasingly harder.

Many cultivators stagnated at Nascent Soul, never able to climb higher in their entire lives.

Not to mention Ye Chen had a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root—the effort he needed to put in was far greater than those with exceptional talent.

Still, the talisman rewards had already delighted Ye Chen!

He'd obtained another offensive talisman, plus the Invisibility Talisman he'd used before.

Once invisible, unless he attacked and revealed an opening, even Soul Transformation cultivators couldn't detect his presence.

This was also excellent for Ye Chen!

If not for his exhaustion, Ye Chen would have wanted to earn a few more talismans. They would serve him greatly!

He had never forgotten the Ye family's vendetta, constantly thinking of revenge!

Every talisman, every magical artifact, would become leverage for his vengeance!

In a drowsy haze, Ye Chen closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.

Before long, he once again witnessed the bloody scene of the Ye family's massacre...

"Big brother, save me!" A girl in blue clothes reached out her hand, crying loudly.

"Chen'er, run!" The blood-soaked man spoke through gritted teeth.

"Young Master, hurry and go. Leave this to us!"

"Live on!"

"You must live on!"

Voice after voice echoed in Ye Chen's mind, circling endlessly.

He struggled desperately, wanting to reach out and save them, yet was powerless. His hands and feet felt as if they were bound.

Ye Chen jolted awake from the nightmare, drenched in cold sweat!

This dream had become his inner demon!

After experiencing that tragedy, he often had nightmares.

Every time he dreamed of the Ye family being slaughtered, the hatred in his heart deepened.

Before, he hadn't had the strength to take revenge. He could only suppress the hatred in his heart.

Now that he'd broken through to Nascent Soul, the desire for vengeance burned ever more intensely...

He could no longer control the fury within!

"Qing'er, big brother will come save you soon!"

"Father, I will avenge you and the Ye family..."

If he couldn't touch the Profound Heaven Holy Land, surely he could deal with the Zhang family?

Zhang Shuyu, just you wait!!!

Ye Chen's killing intent surged. Thinking of that femme fatale, murderous qi radiated from him. He wanted nothing more than to tear her to pieces!

If not for her venomous heart and loose morals, seducing the Profound Heaven Holy Land's young sect master, the Ye family would never have suffered annihilation...

The Zhang family backing Zhang Shuyu had also participated in the slaughter targeting the Ye family!

After Ye Chen calmed down, he turned to look beside him. Lin Qingxue and the others were already gone.

They had all woken up and left the room.

He wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, dressed, and headed outside.

At the same time, an elegant woman walked in from outside the courtyard, accompanied by two servant girls.

Lin Qingxue and the others, who had been chatting in the courtyard, heard footsteps and looked up. Surprise flashed in their eyes!

Over the past three months, no new female disciples had set foot in this courtyard.

This small courtyard wasn't somewhere just anyone could enter—one needed Sect Master Liu Ruyan's permission.

Any female disciple who came to this courtyard had been arranged by Liu Ruyan to serve Ye Chen, without exception.

"Looks like we're getting another sister..."

Lu Mengyao spoke up.

Lin Qingxue and Su Nianwan were already thinking about how to arrange the new room...

The three of them weren't jealous. After all, they had originally been arranged to come here the same way, and it was Liu Ruyan's order.

Besides, all three of them were now pregnant, their bellies growing bigger by the day. They couldn't properly serve Ye Chen anymore.

Having a new female disciple arrive was good for both Ye Chen and them.

"Let's go take a look!" Lin Qingxue said.

The three women rose, preparing to get acquainted with their new sister.

"I feel like she looks somewhat familiar..."

Su Nianwan raised an eyebrow and said hesitantly.

She couldn't recall the name for the moment, just felt she recognized her.

But any female disciple arranged to serve Ye Chen in this courtyard would certainly be an inner or personal disciple—feeling familiar was normal.

The three women approached, sizing up this female disciple.

In terms of figure and looks, she was no less impressive than the three of them, and she carried an innate air of arrogance!

"Su Nianwan—I didn't expect to find you here!"

This female disciple was the first to call out Su Nianwan's name, surprised with a hint of amusement.

Her gaze toward Su Nianwan held a trace of contempt!

"Shangguan Yanran!"

Su Nianwan now remembered her name, surprised yet with an unpleasant expression.

She hadn't expected this person to appear here.

Though familiar, their relationship wasn't good.

"So she's Shangguan Yanran?"

Lu Mengyao was equally shocked.

This name was quite famous among inner disciples!

Many disciples steered clear of Shangguan Yanran, fearing that offending her would invite retaliation.

Lin Qingxue's brow furrowed with worry at this moment as well.

Though they weren't familiar with Shangguan Yanran, they had all heard of her deeds. Her reputation in the sect wasn't good.

And she was an extremely difficult person to get along with...

If they were to share the same courtyard from now on, life would become quite interesting.

"What a small world, running into you here!"

"I thought you were such a pure and innocent girl, Su Nianwan. Turns out you've also come to serve as someone's cauldron!"

Shangguan Yanran looked at Su Nianwan before her and mocked her without reservation...

She had always been jealous of Su Nianwan's talent—possessing an Earth-Grade Spiritual Root, receiving the sect leadership's focused cultivation and affection.

She'd always wanted to surpass Su Nianwan.

Now seeing her apparently reduced to a cultivation cauldron, her mood improved immensely. She wanted to thoroughly humiliate her...
