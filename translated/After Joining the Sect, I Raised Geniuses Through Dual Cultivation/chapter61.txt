In the courtyard...

Lin Qingxue and the others were sitting in the yard, sipping tea and chatting.

The moment they spotted Ye Chen returning from outside, they sprang to their feet and hurried over...

Their smiles were warm with concern.

"Senior Brother, you're back!"

"Senior Brother, you've worked so hard..."

"Senior Brother, are you tired?"

Ye Chen looked at the four women gathered around him and felt a wave of warmth—like coming home. All his fatigue melted away. He waved them off with a smile.

"Not tired..."

Lu Mengyao arched a brow. "Looks like the Sect Master hasn't satisfied Senior Brother yet?"

"Ahem..."

Ye Chen nearly choked, his face reddening.

Meeting Lu Mengyao's teasing gaze, he immediately straightened up and said sternly:

"Oh? Getting bolder by the day, aren't we?"

"Tonight, your Senior Brother is going to teach you a proper lesson..."

Lu Mengyao's delicate face flushed with embarrassment, and she shrank back, quickly begging for mercy:

"Please, Senior Brother, I didn't mean it..."

"Have mercy!"

She was carrying a child right now. The last thing she could handle was Ye Chen's... intensity.

"Senior Brother, dinner's ready. Let's eat first!"

Lin Qingxue stifled a giggle and gently tugged Ye Chen toward the dining room.

"Sure!"

"Let's all eat together..."

Ye Chen was genuinely starving.

At Liu Ruyan's, it had been all output and no input. His body was sated, but his stomach had been growling for hours.

The aroma of food wafted over...

Ye Chen's steps quickened.

After a satisfying meal, he felt human again.

Lin Qingxue and the others had retired to their rooms early—perhaps because pregnancy made them drowsy, or perhaps because they feared being caught in Ye Chen's crosshairs...

Ye Chen's gaze landed on Zhao Ling'er, who was about to slip away. A heated glint flashed in his eyes.

"Ling'er, don't rush off..."

"Let your Senior Brother keep you company for a chat!"

Zhao Ling'er's face turned red. She stole a glance at Ye Chen, her expression painfully shy.

"Senior Brother... tonight's not a good time for me..."

"Could we maybe... in a few days?"

Her face was so red it looked ready to drip blood.

"What do you mean not a good—"

Ye Chen blinked, then seemed to realize something. He rubbed his nose awkwardly and said with utmost sincerity:

"That's fine. Your Senior Brother can just chat with you, nothing else..."

He wasn't some animal. He couldn't just pounce on her every single night...

Zhao Ling'er didn't accept, seemingly unconvinced of Ye Chen's self-control. Face still burning, she shook her head.

"No... no thank you."

"If Senior Brother can't help himself... you could try the compound next door..."

"Didn't the Sect Master assign you a hundred female disciples?"

She figured that sharing a bed with Ye Chen would inevitably lead to... things.

She didn't trust him—and she didn't trust herself either.

"Ling'er, you..."

"Whatever happened to trust between people?"

Ye Chen said helplessly.

Was he really that unreliable?

Zhao Ling'er watched him anxiously, worried she'd upset him. She quickly whispered:

"Senior Brother, once... once I'm feeling better, I'll take good care of you!"

A twinge of guilt colored her voice.

Seeing this, Ye Chen stepped forward and drew her into his arms, gently patting her back.

"Don't worry. How could your Senior Brother be angry with you?"

"You're my woman. We have all the time in the world—there's no rush..."

"Rest well these next few days. If you need anything at all, just tell me!"

Looking at Zhao Ling'er being so considerate, Ye Chen felt a pang of tenderness.

With a wave of his hand, he produced several bottles of high-grade pills from his storage ring and handed them to her.

"Ling'er, these pills all have body-strengthening effects. Take them!"

Zhao Ling'er hesitated. "Senior Brother, these pills are too valuable. You should keep them for yourself..."

Every month, the sect's disciples received a certain allotment of spirit stones and pills—but they were just low-grade Spirit Replenishing Pills. Even personal disciples got the same.

Those basic pills couldn't compare to the high-grade ones Ye Chen was offering.

As a personal disciple, Zhao Ling'er rarely had access to high-grade pills, which made them all the more precious to her.

"Just take them. Your Senior Brother has more than enough of these!"

"When you run out, come get more!"

Ye Chen said casually, as if it were nothing.

After wiping out the Zhang family and looting their stores, he'd become quite wealthy.

His storage ring was bursting with spirit stones and pills, including no small number of high-grade ones.

Hearing this, Zhao Ling'er beamed and happily accepted the pills.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"

She said sweetly.

"Get some sleep early!"

Ye Chen ruffled her hair affectionately.

After Zhao Ling'er left, Ye Chen wandered the courtyard alone, feeling strangely empty...

Before, he'd been so busy in the courtyard that he could barely keep up. But now that Lin Qingxue and the others' bellies were growing, their activities had naturally declined.

Having grown accustomed to being busy, the sudden lull left him oddly restless.

His gaze drifted to the newly opened wall connecting to the adjacent compound. That's when he remembered Liu Ruyan's instructions to look after the hundred new female disciples...

They represented the sect's future!

Liu Ruyan and the Grand Elder had selected these hundred disciples not just to address the current crisis, but to preserve the Blissful Union Sect's legacy...

If the sect couldn't withstand the assault of the three great powers, senior cultivators would evacuate these disciples and rebuild the sect elsewhere.

Ye Chen had been entrusted with the responsibility of training them all!

"Liu Ruyan's taste shouldn't be bad..."

"Maybe... they'll all be 36Ds?"

Ye Chen muttered to himself and headed for the compound.

The courtyard was quiet in the night air...

Despite housing a hundred female disciples, the place was peaceful.

The moment Ye Chen stepped through, a wave of sweet fragrance washed over him, refreshing and intoxicating.

He looked up, and surprise flickered across his face!

"One, two, three, four..."

Every door in the compound had a numbered plaque hanging from it, arranged from one to a hundred.

A peculiar thought crossed Ye Chen's mind.

Had Liu Ruyan numbered them so he could keep track of which disciples he'd cultivated with?

After all, with this many disciples, he probably couldn't remember each one.

Who'd been cultivated and who hadn't—it would be impossible to tell.

Time was short and the task was monumental. Each disciple might only get one or two sessions, and a missed opportunity might be gone forever...

Liu Ruyan's system ensured equitable distribution!

Ye Chen had originally planned to flip tiles like an emperor choosing a consort. But now it seemed he'd need to go through them assembly-line style first...

His gaze fell on the first room, still lit from within. He walked straight over.

His heart was actually a little nervous...

It was like opening a blind box.

What would this disciple look like?

What kind of figure would she have?

Would she be sweet and innocent, or bold and fiery?
