In the past, Liu Ruyan had always been the one teasing others. Never before had she been teased like this.

At this moment, the look she gave Ye Chen was filled with resentment!

If Ye Chen weren't so formidable, she definitely wouldn't have submitted.

This scoundrel!

Ye Chen was just about to leave when his gaze inadvertently swept across the bed. He suddenly froze in place...

"This..."

"Sect Master, you're..."

Ye Chen's smile vanished. He stared at Liu Ruyan on the bed in disbelief, eyes wide!

His mind seemed to explode!

As if he'd discovered some earth-shattering secret...

According to rumors, Blissful Union Sect Master Liu Ruyan was wanton and loose. What he now saw completely contradicted those rumors!

Ye Chen was shocked!

This was the Blissful Union Sect!

Apart from the younger generation of disciples, virtually every disciple who had practiced dual cultivation techniques had found a cauldron to try them out...

Dual cultivation was common practice in the Blissful Union Sect.

Yet Liu Ruyan, as the Sect Master of the Blissful Union Sect, had never taken a cauldron—this was simply unbelievable.

It was as shocking as discovering the madam of a pleasure house was still a maiden!

"Don't you dare breathe a word of this!"

"Or I'll kill you!"

Liu Ruyan's eyes flashed with panic. She glared at Ye Chen with feigned ferocity, warning him.

The last thing she wanted was for anyone to know she had dual cultivated with a disciple...

And had been completely conquered by him!

It was too embarrassing!

She was the Sect Master, after all!

"Rest assured, Sect Master—I won't say a word!"

Ye Chen promised earnestly.

"Now hurry up and go..."

"Don't let anyone see you!"

Liu Ruyan urged hastily.

Her cheeks burned. She couldn't even bring herself to look at Ye Chen.

She was the dignified Sect Master, yet she'd been bullied by a disciple!

"Alright!"

Ye Chen nodded.

"Sect Master, you... get some rest."

"Get out!!!"

Liu Ruyan's face flushed crimson with embarrassment.

*Creak!*

Ye Chen walked out of the great hall, pulling the doors shut behind him.

Outside, the night was deep and dark.

The disciples who had been on guard had long since left—hardly a soul was in sight.

Ye Chen headed back toward the small courtyard at ease, his stomach growling with hunger.

He hadn't expected to go at it this late—from afternoon all the way to deep into the night.

Thinking about Liu Ruyan's virginal status, guilt welled up in Ye Chen's heart.

Had he known, he would certainly have been more gentle—he wouldn't have been so rough.

After all, he had taken an Endless Vitality Pill earlier just to prove himself to her...

But what worried Ye Chen most right now wasn't even that.

The successful conception earlier!

In ten months, when Liu Ruyan gave birth, there would be no hiding it.

What was he supposed to do about this?

He had to take responsibility, right?

Step forward and admit he was the child's father?

Ye Chen fell into deep thought...

His mind was in a daze. He hadn't imagined he'd actually sleep with the Sect Master—and gotten her pregnant at that.

He felt rather embarrassed.

Lost in thought, he had already walked back to the small courtyard.

"Senior Brother, you're back!"

"What happened? Why so late?"

"Senior Brother, are you alright?"

Lin Qingxue, Lu Mengyao, and Su Nianwan rushed over the moment they saw Ye Chen return.

They had been waiting in the courtyard all this time, worried for half the day, afraid he'd encountered danger.

At some point they'd learned Ye Chen was still with Liu Ruyan, which had eased their minds somewhat.

Now seeing Ye Chen safe and sound, the hearts they'd been holding finally settled.

Ye Chen looked at the three women crowding around him with concern, smiled, and waved his hand.

"Nothing's wrong. Sorry to have worried you three!"

"I was just... discussing some matters with the Sect Master, and lost track of time."

Even as he said this, he felt somewhat guilty.

They'd been worrying about him in the courtyard while he was out enjoying a woman?

"Senior Brother, you must be hungry, right?"

"Let me go heat up the food..."

Lin Qingxue spoke thoughtfully.

"I'll help..."

Lu Mengyao followed along.

Ye Chen smiled, glanced at Su Nianwan beside him, and waved. "Let's go inside too!"

He was truly starving!

In a great hall...

After Ye Chen left, Liu Ruyan had planned to rest for a while, but she quickly sensed something was wrong...

She snapped awake, as if suddenly realizing something. She moved swiftly, throwing on clothes and vanishing from the hall in a flash.

At the same time, dark clouds had gathered in the sky above the hall...

Purple lightning flickered within the cloud mass, looking quite eerie!

As Liu Ruyan departed, the dark cloud mass also moved rapidly, as if it had locked onto her.

At that same moment, in several cave dwellings throughout the sect, the Supreme Elders who had been cultivating in seclusion all opened their eyes simultaneously. Expressions of surprise crossed their faces.

"That aura... is a Lightning Tribulation!"

"Who is breaking through?"

They immediately left their caves to investigate.

Whoever it was, as long as they were from the Blissful Union Sect, a breakthrough was good news for the entire sect.

By now, Liu Ruyan had already arrived at an uninhabited mountain peak...

She swiftly summoned her natal treasure—a Nine-Treasure Glazed Lamp radiating fluorescent light throughout!

In an instant, the surroundings were enveloped by the barrier released from the Nine-Treasure Glazed Lamp.

This was a defensive treasure!

Liu Ruyan raised her head to look at the dark clouds above, tension flickering in her eyes, mixed with a trace of excitement.

She had worked toward this for so many years—breakthrough had finally arrived!

She had long awaited this moment and had prepared thoroughly.

Facing the Lightning Tribulation in the void, Liu Ruyan showed no fear.

She was desperate to break through to Void Refining. This bottleneck had plagued her for decades—right now, it felt more like a pleasant surprise.

"So dual cultivating with that kid really can improve cultivation..."

Liu Ruyan murmured to herself, a blush crossing her face.

Unbidden, her mind replayed scenes of her earlier passion with Ye Chen...

That unprecedented sensation was actually rather... memorable!

*Boom—*

At that moment, the clouds in the void had fully gathered. A thunderclap erupted in an instant!

A terrifying bolt of purple lightning came crashing down...

Liu Ruyan had no time for further thought. She hastily gathered spiritual energy to protect her body and resist the tribulation.

Only by enduring the Lightning Tribulation's baptism could she break through to the Void Refining Stage!

*Bang!*

The first heavenly thunder was neutralized by the Nine-Treasure Glazed Lamp, dissipating without a trace.

But immediately after came the second and third bolts, their power growing ever more terrifying...

The entire mountain peak shook continuously!

Each falling bolt of heavenly thunder carried rolling celestial might—the pressure was immense.

Several figures appeared in the void, their gazes falling on Liu Ruyan as she underwent her tribulation on the mountain peak.

"It's Ruyan undergoing tribulation!" one of the Supreme Elders exclaimed in surprise.

"Is she... about to break through to Void Refining?"

Expressions of joy appeared on everyone's faces!

"Good, good, good! As long as she withstands the tribulation, our Blissful Union Sect will gain another Void Refining Stage powerhouse!"

All the Supreme Elders' hearts were filled with anticipation...
