Qingyang Town.

A small town situated at the foot of the Blissful Union Sect's mountain.

Many cultivators visiting the Blissful Union Sect, or merchants passing through for trade, would stop here to rest.

This added considerable liveliness to an otherwise ordinary little town.

Night fell...

In a lavishly decorated inn.

Two figures appeared from thin air before a room...

*Crash!*

One of them pushed the door open without hesitation.

"Are the two of you from the Blissful Union Sect?"

Inside the room, an elegant middle-aged man sat at a table drinking tea. He raised his head to look at the two elderly figures who had barged into his room, asking with complete composure.

He seemed to have expected them to come looking for him—he just hadn't anticipated a late-night visit.

"Indeed!"

The two elders didn't deny it. They swept their gazes around the room—only the elegant man was present. Their eyes settled on him.

"You're from the Profound Heaven Holy Land?"

They were also confirming identities.

The elegant man nodded arrogantly. His gaze passed over the two elders to look behind them, but found nothing there. He frowned...

"Where is he?"

His expression turned displeased as he demanded an answer.

"Where is who?"

One of the elders asked, puzzled.

"The disciple named Ye Chen, of course!"

"Didn't we order your Blissful Union Sect to hand him over?"

"He offended our Profound Heaven Holy Land's young sect master—he must die!"

"You come here in the middle of the night without even bringing him?"

The elegant man spoke with clear displeasure.

He was an outer sect elder of the Profound Heaven Holy Land. Relying on the Holy Land's status, he didn't take the Blissful Union Sect seriously at all.

Several days ago, he'd already sent word to the Blissful Union Sect, demanding they hand over the person.

He had assumed these two elders had come to deliver Ye Chen. Who knew they hadn't? This infuriated him!

Were they treating the Profound Heaven Holy Land's words as nothing but hot air?

"So that's how it is..."

The two elders nodded thoughtfully, but their expressions toward the elegant man grew several degrees colder.

A hint of killing intent flickered in their eyes!

The elegant man was still fuming and didn't notice the change. Seeing that they really hadn't brought Ye Chen, his anger flared. He glared at the two elders before him, speaking irritably.

"If you haven't brought Ye Chen, what are you two here for?"

"To kill you, of course!"

One of the elders answered.

The next second, he struck directly, spiritual energy surging around him.

Violent spiritual power blasted forward!

"How dare you—"

*Boom—*

The elegant man's pupils contracted, his expression changing drastically.

Before he could finish speaking, he hastily condensed spiritual energy to defend...

Caught off guard, he was still sent flying by a single palm strike!

*Crash...*

His body smashed through the wall and landed on the street outside the inn.

The two elders had no intention of letting him go. They swiftly pursued, and the instant they locked onto his aura, another fist came crashing down...

"You—"

The elegant man was injured. Just as he tried to speak, he was cut off again.

*Boom—*

*Boom—*

His body was sent flying once more.

*Pfft!*

A mouthful of fresh blood sprayed from his lips...

"Ten-Thousand Spirits Shield!"

"Block!"

The elegant man hastily summoned his natal treasure. A massive silver shield appeared out of thin air, radiating waves of spiritual light as it formed a barrier before him.

Like a towering mountain, it gave him a powerful sense of security.

The two elders appeared in an instant...

One wielded a blood-red giant axe, like a surging sea of blood.

The other held a skull-adorned longsword, like a mountain of corpses and a purgatory of the dead.

"Cleave!"

"Split..."

The two spoke in low voices.

Their weapons descended, hacking viciously against the silver shield...

*Boom—*

*Boom—*

In an instant, the earth shook!

Terrifying gales swept up all around...

The shops along the street were reduced to powder in moments.

*Crack!*

Fine cracks appeared across the mountain-like silver shield...

The elegant man's expression changed drastically. He sensed the aura of death—all his earlier composure and condescension had vanished.

"I am an outer sect elder of the Profound Heaven Holy Land. Why are you attacking me?"

He spoke urgently.

He couldn't even understand why they were striking.

If they simply didn't want to hand over a sect disciple, surely there was no need to kill him?

He was an elder of the Profound Heaven Holy Land—killing him would certainly invite endless retaliation from the Holy Land.

This was a losing proposition.

"Hmph! You still dare ask why?"

"Pressuring us to hand over Ye Chen was one thing, but you even dared to kill Jiang Yuyan..."

"You truly don't take our Blissful Union Sect seriously!"

"Today we take your life, to let the world know the Blissful Union Sect is not to be trifled with!"

The two elders shouted harshly.

As their words fell, they struck again...

*Boom—*

*Boom—*

Axe and sword descended once more, producing earth-shaking roars!

*Crack!*

The silver shield's spiritual light weakened further. The cracks multiplied—it could shatter at any moment.

The elegant man was completely dumbfounded.

"What Jiang Yuyan?"

The name sounded familiar, but in his panic he couldn't recall who it was.

He'd killed quite a few people—there was no way he could remember every name.

But he was certain he had absolutely never killed anyone from the Blissful Union Sect!

"Jiang Yuyan was our Blissful Union Sect's Vice Sect Master!"

"Didn't you secretly kill her just yesterday?"

"Still trying to weasel out of it?"

"Today you die—your blood will be our offering to her..."

These two elders were Supreme Elders of the Blissful Union Sect, both at the Void Refining Stage.

They had believed Ye Chen's story, convinced that the killer of Jiang Yuyan was from the Profound Heaven Holy Land.

The only person the Profound Heaven Holy Land had sent to Qingyang Town was this elegant man before them. If not him, who else could it be?

At the same time, they had received orders from the Grand Elder—otherwise they wouldn't have specifically come down the mountain to avenge Jiang Yuyan.

From the very start, they had struck with killing intent, showing no mercy whatsoever.

"I killed your Vice Sect Master yesterday?"

The elegant man looked bewildered, his head buzzing.

When had he ever done such a thing?

He had no idea!

Clearly someone had dumped this blame right on his head...

He'd been saddled with a murder charge out of nowhere!

"So you admit it?"

"Even if you're from the Profound Heaven Holy Land, today you pay with your life..."

The two elders heard the elegant man's "confession" and flew into a rage, their attacks growing even more ferocious!

"Die!"

*Boom—*

*Boom—*

The powerful assault caused the earth to quake. The entire town was shaking violently!

*Crack!*

*Crack!*

The silver shield's spiritual light faded. Countless fractures appeared—it had reached its limit!

*Pfft!*

As his natal treasure was damaged, the elegant man suffered backlash and spat out another mouthful of blood.

He was completely stupefied!

He hadn't admitted anything—he'd been asking a question!

Seeing them strike with lethal intent, he hastily denied.

"I didn't kill her!"

"I've never even seen this Jiang Yuyan..."

The elegant man felt utterly wronged—beaten for no reason at all.

"Whether you admit it or not, you're the killer!"

One of the elders snorted coldly.

Convinced the elegant man was the true culprit, he refused to listen to any explanations.

As his words fell, he struck again!

The elegant man was completely dazed.

Was he really going to be forced to take this blame?

"If you kill me, the Profound Heaven Holy Land won't let you off!"

He shouted urgently.

Trying to intimidate them with the Profound Heaven Holy Land's name...

*Boom—*

*Crack!*

*Crash!*

The two elders didn't hold back.

One axe shattered the silver shield. One sword slashed across the elegant man's body.

Cleaving his physical form in two on the spot!

A flash of sword light swept past, destroying his primordial spirit in the same motion...

A Void Refining Stage powerhouse had fallen, just like that.
