"Senior Brother, who are you talking about?"

"Who would abduct Sister Su?"

"This is inside the sect, and she's the Sect Master's personal disciple. Who would dare do such a thing?"

Lin Qingxue looked at Ye Chen with confusion, asking him directly.

With Su Nianwan's Golden Core cultivation, hardly any disciples in the inner sect could match her...

She was one of the outstanding talents of the younger generation!

Ye Chen glanced at Lin Qingxue and said evenly.

"Jiang Yuyan!"

"Jiang..."

"The Vice Sect Master?"

Lin Qingxue found the name familiar, then suddenly remembered who she was and couldn't help but exclaim in shock.

She stared at Ye Chen in disbelief.

"That's impossible, isn't it?"

"Why would the Vice Sect Master abduct Sister Su?"

"Sister Su never offended her..."

Lin Qingxue couldn't believe it was true.

For inner disciples like them, whether it was the Sect Master or Vice Sect Master, both were lofty figures beyond their ability to criticize or offend.

With those powerhouses' methods, they could take their lives with a snap of the fingers!

Seeing that Lin Qingxue still didn't understand the connection, Ye Chen patiently explained.

"Jiang Yuyan did this because she wants to learn the secrets of this small courtyard from Nianwan..."

"In other words, she wants to know the purpose behind everything the Sect Master has been doing!"

"This..."

Lin Qingxue suddenly understood what was going on.

This was clearly a struggle between the Sect Master and Vice Sect Master, and innocent Su Nianwan had been caught in the middle.

She grew even more anxious.

"Senior Brother, what should we do?"

"Tell the Sect Master about this?"

"Have the Sect Master confront the Vice Sect Master and get Sister Su back?"

Ye Chen shook his head. "We can tell the Sect Master, but we need to find Jiang Yuyan ourselves!"

"Even if the Sect Master intervenes, Jiang Yuyan can deny doing it, and no one can do anything about her!"

Though Liu Ruyan and Jiang Yuyan's relationship was like fire and water, with them fighting secretly, at least on the surface both sides maintained a "cordial" appearance.

Ye Chen wasn't sure if Liu Ruyan would be willing to completely tear off the facade with Jiang Yuyan for Su Nianwan's sake—she might choose to sacrifice Su Nianwan for the sect's interests.

But Ye Chen absolutely couldn't stand by and do nothing—that was his woman, after all.

Still, these were all just Ye Chen's conjectures. He was simply preparing for the worst-case scenario...

He strode toward Su Nianwan's room.

"Senior Brother, what are you going to do?"

Under Lin Qingxue's puzzled gaze, Ye Chen retrieved the Tracking Mother-Child Gu from his storage ring. He released the child gu to identify Su Nianwan's scent clinging to her clothes...

Once the aura was locked, the child gu quickly flew toward the outside of the building.

At the same time, the box containing the mother gu in Ye Chen's hand began to tremble slightly.

"Come on, let's follow it and find out who took Nianwan!"

Ye Chen said.

The two hurried after it.

Lin Qingxue still felt uneasy.

"Senior Brother, what if it really is the Vice Sect Master?"

She was a Soul Transformation Stage powerhouse!

Hearing this, Ye Chen didn't even turn his head. "So what if it's the Vice Sect Master?"

"Touch my woman? Even Heaven won't show mercy!"

Lin Qingxue's heart trembled. She looked at Ye Chen with several degrees more adoration in her eyes, warmth flooding through her.

Being Senior Brother's woman was truly wonderful!

Soon, the two arrived outside a residence.

From some distance away, Ye Chen could see the released child gu had already flown into the courtyard.

He could confirm that Su Nianwan was currently inside.

"That's the Vice Sect Master's residence up ahead!"

"It really was her who took Sister Su..."

Lin Qingxue was shocked once she recognized where they were.

She had thought Ye Chen's guess was too bold, but it turned out to be true.

"Go inform the Sect Master!"

Ye Chen told Lin Qingxue.

"Alright."

"Wait, Senior Brother—what about you?"

Lin Qingxue was about to leave but suddenly stopped, looking at Ye Chen with concern, afraid he would put himself in danger alone.

That was the Vice Sect Master, a Soul Transformation Stage powerhouse!

No matter how formidable Ye Chen was now, he was only at Peak Foundation Establishment. He could be killed in the snap of a finger...

She didn't want Ye Chen to take such a risk.

Ye Chen could see Lin Qingxue's worry. He smiled and shook his head.

"Don't worry, I'm not going to throw my life away!"

"I'll just keep watch from here!"

"Hurry and go..."

Hearing Ye Chen say this, Lin Qingxue finally relaxed.

"Senior Brother, wait for me..."

With that, she turned and left.

Once Lin Qingxue was far away, Ye Chen's smile faded. He took a talisman from his storage ring...

Injecting spiritual energy, the talisman immediately transformed into a gleam of light, enveloping him and erasing his aura. His body began to "disappear" bit by bit!

"Invisibility Talisman!"

"What a useful item!"

Ye Chen knew clearly that even if Liu Ruyan came personally, Jiang Yuyan would definitely not admit to abducting Su Nianwan.

Even tearing off all pretenses would be useless—she might even turn the tables and accuse them of framing her.

Ye Chen had to find Su Nianwan first. Only then could he coordinate with Liu Ruyan to hold Jiang Yuyan accountable.

Besides, Su Nianwan had already been in Jiang Yuyan's hands for several shichen. If she couldn't extract the secrets she wanted during that time, she might very well kill Su Nianwan to silence her.

Su Nianwan's life hung by a thread. Ye Chen didn't have much time to save her.

No one knew what Jiang Yuyan might do.

But one thing was certain—she would never meekly hand Su Nianwan over.

Ye Chen immediately headed toward the nearby residence, easily scaling the wall into the courtyard...

Right now, no one could see him. He could come and go freely!

Following the mother gu's guidance, Ye Chen easily found a side chamber.

Only after confirming there was no movement inside did he push the door open...

*Creak!*

The door swung open...

Su Nianwan sat bound in the corner with her cultivation sealed. Seeing the door open on its own, a flash of terror crossed her eyes.

There was no one outside—how had the door just opened?

It couldn't be haunted in broad daylight, could it?

The next second, a hand settled on her shoulder...

"Ahh!"

Su Nianwan's whole body trembled. Her face went pale with fright as she struggled desperately...

"Don't be afraid, it's me!"

Ye Chen's voice echoed in her ear...

One moment struggling, Su Nianwan froze. She turned to look at the "empty air" beside her, not believing her ears.

Was she imagining things?

"Senior Brother Ye, is that you?"

"It's me!"

"I've come to rescue you..."

Receiving confirmation, Su Nianwan finally relaxed, her heart filled with emotion.

She hadn't expected Ye Chen would risk his life infiltrating the Vice Sect Master's residence to save her!

*Clink!*

Ye Chen untied the ropes binding Su Nianwan and took her hand as they headed outside...

Though Su Nianwan couldn't see Ye Chen, she could feel him right beside her. The warm touch of his hand gave her a sense of security.

They had just stepped outside when a figure descended from the sky, blocking their path...

"Did This Seat say you could leave?"
