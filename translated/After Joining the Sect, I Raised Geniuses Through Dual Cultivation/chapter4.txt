Early morning. A ray of sunlight filtered through the window, falling on the bedside...

Ye Chen woke from his pleasant dreams to find Lu Mengyao already gone.

Recalling last night's passion, a smile tugged at the corner of his lips.

Fortunately, Ye Chen had previously obtained the Vigorous Man Physique with its Imperishable Kidney Spirit, which had greatly improved his physical constitution.

Otherwise, he might have worked himself to death from all that plowing.

Yet Lu Mengyao had still been able to leave bouncing with energy this morning.

This girl had quite the constitution herself!

The moment Ye Chen sat up, he felt a surging, turbulent wave of spiritual energy erupt from his dantian!

"Not good!"

He remembered the system rewards from last night's frenzy...

Combined, they amounted to seven or eight years of cultivation!

He was already at Qi Refining Level 12, just one barrier away from Foundation Establishment!

Ye Chen immediately retrieved the Supreme Foundation Establishment Pill he'd received earlier from his storage ring and swallowed it.

With the medicine's power as support, he began to establish his foundation, refining spiritual energy...

In a great hall elsewhere in the sect...

Liu Ruyan looked at the intelligence report her confidant had delivered, surprise flashing across her exquisite face!

This kid... had he gone mad?

Working that hard?

Wasn't he afraid of breaking Lu Mengyao?

Not an ounce of tenderness for the fairer sex.

Liu Ruyan couldn't help wondering if assigning only one female disciple per night was too few for Ye Chen.

When her gaze fell on the remaining contents of the note, her expression shifted dramatically!

[Lin Qingxue, Inner Sect Disciple, Profound-Grade Spiritual Root, Early Foundation Establishment cultivation, broke through to Mid Foundation Establishment today!]

[Lu Mengyao, Inner Sect Disciple, Profound-Grade Spiritual Root, Early Foundation Establishment cultivation, broke through to Mid Foundation Establishment today!]

Two seemingly ordinary pieces of information, yet they left Liu Ruyan stunned!

If only one female disciple had broken through after sleeping with Ye Chen, it might have been coincidence.

But two female disciples breaking through in succession after sharing his bed? That indicated a definite connection!

"Could it be... that sleeping with this kid leads to cultivation surges?"

Liu Ruyan furrowed her delicate brows, muttering softly.

A thought flashed through her mind!

She'd been stuck at the peak of Soul Transformation for many years, unable to advance further...

But what if it was just a coincidence? Wouldn't she be giving that kid a free meal?

Liu Ruyan's heart wavered, but she didn't act rashly on impulse.

"This kid certainly has no shortage of secrets!"

Previously, Ye Chen had only mentioned his ability to guarantee offspring with Spiritual Roots. He'd said nothing about other benefits.

Liu Ruyan decided to test a few more female disciples before making any decisions...

Just then, a female disciple rushed in.

"Sect Master!"

"The Vice Sect Master has brought several Elders. They say they have urgent business!"

Before she'd finished speaking, crisp footsteps echoed from outside the hall...

Liu Ruyan's face darkened as she looked toward the entrance.

A woman in a teal off-shoulder dress sauntered in, swaying her snake-like hips. She had a seductive, foxy appearance.

Behind her followed five white-bearded elders, each radiating an oppressive aura.

At this sight, Liu Ruyan's expression turned grim.

These people were getting more and more presumptuous!

She hadn't even said she would see them, yet they'd barged right in.

They had no respect for her as Sect Master whatsoever...

But this wasn't the first time such things had happened. Liu Ruyan chose to endure.

She didn't have enough leverage to turn on them yet and didn't dare rashly make enemies.

"Senior Sister, this matter really couldn't wait. Please don't blame us for our rudeness..."

Vice Sect Master Jiang Yuyan spoke with a calm face.

Her words sounded apologetic, but she clearly didn't mean a word of it.

When looking at Liu Ruyan, she showed not a shred of the respect due to a Sect Master. Her only thoughts were of one day replacing her!

"What is it?"

Liu Ruyan had long seen through Jiang Yuyan's petty schemes. She couldn't be bothered to argue, merely frowning as she asked.

These Grand Elders normally spent their time in seclusion and rarely showed themselves.

Something major must have happened!

"Senior Sister, the Young Master of the Xuantian Holy Land has sent someone demanding we hand over a disciple named Ye Chen!"

"If I remember correctly, this Ye Chen should be the disciple Senior Sister recently took in, right?"

Jiang Yuyan looked at Liu Ruyan with amusement, as if waiting to enjoy a good show.

She held out a jade slip bearing the Xuantian Holy Land's seal.

"The Xuantian Holy Land?"

"Ye Chen!"

Liu Ruyan's expression shifted, her brows knitting together.

The Xuantian Holy Land was one of the Southern Wilderness Province's five great powers, teeming with experts.

The Hehuan Sect had once been their equal, but now that the sect had declined, they couldn't afford to offend the Xuantian Holy Land.

She took the jade slip and infused it with a wisp of spiritual energy.

Moments later, Liu Ruyan understood the full situation...

Ye Chen had actually offended the Young Master of the Xuantian Holy Land and was being hunted by them!

For a time, Liu Ruyan found herself in a difficult position!

If Ye Chen were just an ordinary disciple, she could hand him over without a second thought to avoid offending the Xuantian Holy Land.

But now that Ye Chen had revealed his secret talent to her, once the seeding succeeded, it would completely transform the Hehuan Sect's situation—perhaps even restore them to glory!

If she handed Ye Chen over, the Hehuan Sect's future would be utterly hopeless.

But if she didn't, offending the Xuantian Holy Land might spell doom for the Hehuan Sect very soon...

Why did this kid have to offend the Xuantian Holy Land of all people!

Though Ye Chen might be deceiving her, Liu Ruyan still wanted to take the gamble!

Even at the cost of offending the Xuantian Holy Land!

Besides, if she handed Ye Chen over to his death, it would undoubtedly chill the hearts of all the disciples. Who would support her as Sect Master then?

When that happened, Jiang Yuyan would certainly seize the opportunity to replace her, and no one would stand with her anymore!

Liu Ruyan made her decision. Her cool gaze fixed on Jiang Yuyan as she spoke firmly.

"The Xuantian Holy Land is far too overbearing!"

"Ye Chen is already a disciple of my Hehuan Sect. They think they can just take him with a single word?"

"They're not taking our Hehuan Sect seriously at all!"

"Even though the Hehuan Sect has fallen from its former glory, we're not some soft persimmon anyone can squeeze..."

She deliberately reframed the conflict as one between the Hehuan Sect and the Xuantian Holy Land!

Hearing this, the several Grand Elders' expressions changed. Their clouded eyes gleamed with sharp light as their auras surged, radiating fury!

Being pushed around by the Hehuan Sect—wasn't that the same as slapping these Elders in the face?

They were old, not dead. How could they accept such humiliation?

Jiang Yuyan's face fell.

She had originally intended to use this matter to undermine Liu Ruyan. She hadn't expected her to stand up for a mere disciple against the Xuantian Holy Land!

"Senior Sister, have you lost your mind?"

"If we anger the Xuantian Holy Land, our Hehuan Sect is finished!"

"He's just one disciple. What does it matter if we hand him over?"

Jiang Yuyan tried to persuade her.

She had no desire to make an enemy of the Xuantian Holy Land—that was clearly suicidal!

Her only thought was to hand Ye Chen over and curry favor with the Xuantian Holy Land.
