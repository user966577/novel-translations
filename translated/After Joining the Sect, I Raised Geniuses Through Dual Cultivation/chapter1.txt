Spirit Domain, Southern Wilderness Province.

Inside a great hall of the Hehuan Sect.

"You're saying you have the innate talent to father children with Profound-Grade Spiritual Roots?"

Liu Ruyan stood with her arms crossed beneath her chest, her impressive peaks standing proud. A flicker of surprise crossed her exquisite features as she regarded the newly admitted disciple before her.

She'd never heard of such a talent before.

When the other party had approached her with all that secrecy, Liu Ruyan had assumed the boy had stumbled upon some incredible opportunity. She certainly hadn't expected it to be about making babies...

If not for those words "Profound-Grade Spiritual Root offspring," she would have suspected he was here to mock her.

"Sect Master, everything I've said is the truth. Please believe me!"

Ye Chen spoke with utmost sincerity.

He had prepared his explanation in advance and delivered it as reasonably as possible.

After hearing Ye Chen's explanation, the way Liu Ruyan looked at him grew increasingly strange...

"So you're saying your seed can guarantee every child will possess a Profound-Grade Spiritual Root—fine, I can accept that..."

"But why do you require that the female disciples you... copulate with... must be beautiful as flowers, with slim waists, long legs, and curves in all the right places?"

"And what's this about '36D'?"

"You'd better explain yourself. Otherwise..."

A cold glint flashed through Liu Ruyan's chilly gaze!

If she discovered Ye Chen was playing her for a fool, she would absolutely make his death miserable.

The Hehuan Sect was particularly skilled at tormenting men!

"Ahem!"

Ye Chen rubbed his nose and hastily explained.

"Sect Master, think about it—a child's talents are determined by their parents..."

"Wouldn't children born from female disciples who excel in every aspect be even more perfect?"

"I'm only thinking of the sect's future. I hope the Sect Master can see my sincerity!"

That's what his mouth said, but in his heart, Ye Chen simply couldn't bring himself to touch ugly female disciples.

If Liu Ruyan assigned him some hideous creature, it would definitely affect his performance.

Producing offspring was important, but so was enjoying the process.

Beautiful female disciples would undoubtedly provide more motivation to charge into battle.

"When you put it that way... it does make some sense!"

Liu Ruyan calmed down, nodding thoughtfully as her expression softened somewhat.

Yet she still harbored doubts about Ye Chen's claims.

Could someone really guarantee that all their offspring would possess Spiritual Roots? Wouldn't that mean mass-producing cultivators?

Liu Ruyan found herself tempted!

The Hehuan Sect had once been one of the Southern Wilderness Province's top powers. Over thousands of years, the sect's experts had gradually died off, the younger generation of disciples had failed to rise to prominence, and not a single exceptional genius had emerged.

The sect had declined into a third-rate power.

Now they were even being suppressed by their sworn enemies, the Heavenly Demon Sect, with conflicts erupting every few days.

Before long, the Hehuan Sect might even be razed to the ground by the Heavenly Demon Sect. She, the gorgeous Sect Master, would become someone else's plaything...

Liu Ruyan certainly didn't want that to happen.

If everything Ye Chen said was true, he could undoubtedly help the sect cultivate more disciples with Spiritual Roots, thereby reversing the sect's decline!

The Hehuan Sect currently lacked everything except female disciples...

What harm was there in trying?

Liu Ruyan raised her delicate eyebrows, her cool gaze falling on Ye Chen as she spoke indifferently.

"I can give you one chance!"

"Hm?"

Ye Chen's eyes lit up.

Liu Ruyan was extraordinarily beautiful with a seductive, alluring figure. Her proud peaks were particularly eye-catching, looking both pure and tempting at once. Every smile seemed designed to steal one's soul.

Moreover, she was the Sect Master with high cultivation. Any child she bore would surely have excellent talent—perhaps even an Earth-Grade or Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root...

"I meant I'll arrange a female disciple for you..."

Liu Ruyan's face darkened as she ground her teeth.

"Keep staring and I'll gouge out your eyes!"

This brat actually dared to have designs on her?

"Thank you for your trust, Sect Master!"

"Rest assured, in ten months, this disciple will give you a satisfactory answer!"

Ye Chen quickly averted his gaze, speaking with solemn conviction.

"Ten months?"

Liu Ruyan froze, her expression shifting as she looked at Ye Chen...

This kid could guarantee success on the first try?

"This secret stays between you and me. You're forbidden from telling anyone else in the sect!"

"Even if the Vice Sect Master asks, you cannot reveal a single word!"

Liu Ruyan's face was stern as she gave Ye Chen his instructions.

Once the seeding succeeded, Ye Chen would undoubtedly become a hot commodity coveted by various powers!

Even within the sect, those who wanted to replace her would certainly target Ye Chen!

Her junior sister, the current Vice Sect Master, had always been plotting with several Elders to overthrow her.

Liu Ruyan had to keep this information secret and keep Ye Chen under her control, so he could produce more disciples with Spiritual Roots in the future.

These would become her personal power base, allowing her to firmly control the entire sect!

"Rest assured, Sect Master. This disciple understands!"

Ye Chen replied.

He naturally understood the principle of how possessing treasures invites disaster.

The fewer people who knew the secret, the safer he would be.

"Go!"

Liu Ruyan waved her hand in satisfaction, a hint of anticipation rising in her heart.

She regarded Ye Chen's secret as her trump card for controlling power and suppressing external enemies!

Outside the great hall...

Ye Chen looked up at the gradually darkening sky, his heart racing with excitement.

Ever since activating the Many Blessings System, he hadn't yet found a woman to test it with.

He really had to perform well this time!

This wasn't just about the sect's future—it was also about his own survival.

Ye Chen had transmigrated to this world as an infant. Fortunately, he was adopted by the head of the Ye family in Jiangye City, raised as their own son, and lived in luxury until adulthood.

Sadly, good times don't last forever. Ye Haotian's wife had an affair with the Young Master of the Xuantian Holy Land. Together, they secretly murdered Ye Haotian.

Not only did they seize the Ye family's assets, they even tried to eliminate the entire Ye clan.

Ye Chen had only escaped thanks to a loyal servant who sacrificed their life to protect him.

His younger sister Ye Qing'er had been captured by people from the Xuantian Holy Land.

Nearly all the other Ye clan members were dead.

Ye Chen wanted to rescue his sister Ye Qing'er, but his cultivation was too weak—he couldn't even protect himself.

Moreover, the Xuantian Holy Land was one of the five great powers in the Southern Wilderness Province, with Body Integration Stage experts presiding over the sect. It wasn't something an ant like him could easily shake.

Seeking protection, he could only join the Hehuan Sect.

Ye Chen had originally planned to cultivate diligently so he could one day storm the Xuantian Holy Land for revenge and rescue his sister.

Unfortunately, he only had a Yellow-Grade Spiritual Root with abysmal talent. After painstaking cultivation, he was still only at the Qi Refining Stage.

The Spirit Domain's cultivation realms were: Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Soul Transformation, Void Refining, Body Integration, Mahayana, Tribulation Transcendence, and Great Emperor!

With the sect's declining strength, forget about revenge and rescue—in a few years, they'd struggle to even protect him.

To grow stronger, Ye Chen had chosen to reveal his secret talent to Sect Master Liu Ruyan in exchange for partners and cultivation resources.

If he relied solely on his own charm to seduce partners, it would be far too slow. That's why he'd thought of offering himself to the sect and having them assign female disciples to him...

As long as he kept producing offspring, he would receive generous system rewards.

This way, Ye Chen could increase his strength without relying on cultivation!
