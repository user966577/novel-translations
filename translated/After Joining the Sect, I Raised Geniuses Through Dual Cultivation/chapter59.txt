*Rustle...*

A faint sound of crushed leaves came from the nearby underbrush!

Ye Chen's brow twitched. He flickered to the bushes and bent down, thrusting his face close.

"Little heretic... found you."

Inside the bushes, a small boy's face went ghost-white, his body frozen stiff.

But his defiance held:

"Fortune's wheel turns for thirty years! Don't bully the young just because they're poor!"

"When I grow up, I'll come back for revenge!"

"If you've got any guts, let me go. I'll avenge the villagers..."

Ye Chen studied him with a look of mild surprise, then narrowed his eyes.

"Oh? Is that so?"

"Then you won't be growing up..."

"Ambition like that—this one absolutely cannot be spared!"

With that, his palm came down!

*BANG!*

The boy's life was snuffed out.

Ye Chen straightened up. From the corner of his eye, he spotted another small boy crouching in the bushes right beside him.

Their eyes met...

This second boy stared at Ye Chen in dumb shock, unable to utter a word.

A brief silence hung in the air.

"This one says nothing—a deep schemer. Absolutely cannot be spared!"

Ye Chen muttered, and his fist came down.

*BANG!*

The boy died on the spot.

Silence descended once more!

Ye Chen didn't linger. He vanished in a flash...

A good while passed...

Ye Chen doubled back again. Finding no one else, he finally departed with satisfaction, resuming his journey.

---

Blissful Union Sect.

Inside a grand hall...

Ye Chen jolted awake from his sleep, his forehead beaded with sweat, his energy drained.

He looked up at the window—daylight was flooding in.

Liu Ruyan was nowhere to be seen.

Ye Chen wiped the sweat from his brow. His entire body felt exhausted.

Though he'd been up all night, he'd fallen asleep before dawn. Yet waking up, he felt no better—worse, even. As if he'd never slept at all. His mental state was worse than before he'd closed his eyes...

"Could it be from controlling the clone?"

Ye Chen murmured with a frown.

His body had rested, but his consciousness had been steering the clone toward Profound Heaven Holy Land the entire time.

Every encounter the clone had along the way felt as real as if his main body had experienced it.

This was massively draining his spiritual power!

"This won't do. If controlling just one clone is this exhausting, what happens when I have even more?"

"I need to figure something out..."

Ye Chen sank into thought, brow furrowed...

He'd previously fantasized about using Clone Talismans to create thousands of copies and storm Profound Heaven Holy Land for revenge!

Now it was clear that even if he had that many talismans, he didn't have nearly enough spiritual power to control them all.

*Creak!*

The side chamber's door opened...

Liu Ruyan swept in wearing a flowing red-and-pink dress.

"You brat—finally awake!"

"The sun's practically burning your backside..."

Liu Ruyan rolled her eyes at Ye Chen on the bed.

She'd already finished the morning's sect business and returned, only to find Ye Chen still in the side chamber. She hadn't expected him to linger—and secretly, she was pleased...

For once, she wouldn't have to face an empty room. Two was better than one.

"Sect Master..."

Ye Chen looked up at Liu Ruyan as she approached, rubbing his eyes with a bleary yawn.

A flicker of concern crossed her face.

"You went to bed at a reasonable hour last night. Why do you look this terrible?"

"Are you already spent?"

She was counting on Ye Chen to boost the hundred female disciples' strength...

If one night with her had broken him, what about all the disciples she'd so carefully selected?

Were they going to sit around twiddling their thumbs?

Ye Chen: ???

"Who said that?"

"I just... didn't sleep well mentally."

Ye Chen squared his shoulders and huffed defensively.

Who was she calling spent?

If he hadn't been operating a clone all night, his energy would be fine. By this hour, he'd have been fresh as a daisy.

"Oh really?"

Liu Ruyan arched an eyebrow, clearly skeptical, her gaze appraising him with amusement...

"Woman, you're playing with fire!"

Ye Chen's expression darkened. His eyes locked onto Liu Ruyan as she drew near, and he grabbed her in one swift motion...

"Don't you dare beg me later..."

He was determined to teach her a lesson!

Liu Ruyan's face flushed red as she scolded him:

"Ye Chen, what do you think you're doing?"

"It's broad daylight..."

"There are disciples outside..."

Her voice grew smaller and smaller...

With a wave of her hand, a barrier sealed the entire hall!

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received five years of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Advanced Clone Talisman!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Soul Essence Pill! (Upon consumption, permanently enhances spiritual power!)*

Ye Chen's lack of energy was purely mental—his body was far from weak...

The instant he heard the system's rewards, every ounce of lethargy vanished!

"A Soul Essence Pill!!!"

A pill that could enhance spiritual power...

Ye Chen was over the moon. He'd just been agonizing over his weak spiritual power, trying to find a solution!

Relying on cultivation breakthroughs to gradually strengthen his spiritual power was far too slow. To simultaneously control hundreds or thousands of clones, he'd need at least Void Refining cultivation...

He was still at the Nascent Soul Stage. No matter how fast his cultivation advanced, reaching Void Refining in the short term was impossible.

"If only I could get a few more Soul Essence Pills..."

Ye Chen muttered, a feverish gleam in his eyes!

"Sect Master, I'm sorry..."

As things stood, only Liu Ruyan's drop rate could produce such high-tier pills...

Opportunities like this didn't come around every time. Ye Chen seized the moment and pressed on!

Four hours later...

Ye Chen slumped against the headboard, eyes vacant with exhaustion...

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received five years of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received five years of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received five years of cultivation as a reward!*

He seemed to have burned through all his luck. Even with Liu Ruyan's premium drop rate, no more high-tier rewards came...

Not a single additional Soul Essence Pill—no talismans, no artifacts.

Nothing but cultivation rewards!

It left Ye Chen thoroughly sulking!

At least he'd gotten that one Soul Essence Pill earlier. Small comfort...

Suddenly, Ye Chen's expression shifted. He bolted upright.

Spiritual energy surged through his body, threatening to overflow!

His internal energy had become a raging torrent...

"This is..."

Ye Chen realized that the accumulated cultivation rewards had pushed his body to its absolute limit.

Either he broke through now, or the overwhelming spiritual energy would backlash against him...

He immediately focused his mind, closed his eyes, and began directing the torrent of energy toward his realm barrier...

Compared to crossing a major realm, breaking through a minor stage was relatively simple.

Under the onslaught of spiritual power, Ye Chen's aura gradually began to transform!
