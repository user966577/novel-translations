"Who has the audacity to kill members of my Zhang family?"

An elder roared in fury.

"That person, it seems to be... Ye Chen!"

Someone recognized Ye Chen's identity and shouted urgently.

"Ye Chen has returned—is he here for revenge?"

"That bastard killed so many Zhang family members..."

"Third Brother, and Ninth Brother too—they were all killed by Ye Chen!"

The Zhang family members' expressions shifted as they stared at Ye Chen with fire in their eyes, yet there was also fear in their hearts...

At this moment, they only dared to shout from outside the courtyard gate, not daring to take a single step inside!

The courtyard was littered with corpses, proof enough that Ye Chen was no weakling...

The earlier explosion had shaken the earth, and the air still carried the lingering scent of flames.

Among those dead guards were several at Peak Foundation Establishment.

The Zhang family disciples who had come were mostly at Qi Refinement or Foundation Establishment—they didn't dare act rashly.

"So it is him!"

"That Ye family remnant is still alive!"

"Since he dares to return, then die..."

The eldest Zhang family member present stepped forward, his face dark as he entered the courtyard.

He was at Early Golden Core—he intended to kill Ye Chen and avenge the fallen Zhang family members.

"Third Uncle is making his move!"

A Zhang family disciple shouted excitedly.

"Third Uncle's cultivation is second only to Aunt. He'll definitely be able to slay Ye Chen."

"Ye Chen is dead for sure this time!"

Everyone's eyes were filled with anticipation, wanting to see their clan elder take down Ye Chen and avenge the dead.

Ye Chen glanced at him disdainfully. "All the Zhang family's capable fighters are away, and you're the only old thing here to throw your life away?"

The Zhang family elder's face darkened. Through gritted teeth, he said:

"To kill you, this old man alone is enough!"

The Zhang family's strong fighters had all gone out, leaving him to guard the estate.

With so many Zhang family disciples dead, if he couldn't kill Ye Chen personally, he'd have no way to explain himself!

"Brat, die!"

"Blazing Palm!"

He struck out with his palm toward Ye Chen...

Flames ignited in his palm, the power formidable!

"Hmph!"

"Overconfident old fool!"

Ye Chen snorted with contempt, raising his hand and tossing out a Thunder Burst Talisman...

The instant the talisman turned to ash, a purple thunderbolt suddenly descended from the void!

*BOOM—*

Lightning struck the Zhang family elder in the courtyard!

"No!"

*BANG—*

The attack was comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator's full-strength strike. The Zhang family elder didn't even have time to resist before being reduced to dust by the thunderbolt, not even residue remaining...

The courtyard fell instantly silent!

*Hiss!*

The Zhang family members gathered outside the gate drew in sharp breaths, their expressions changing drastically!

"What... what just happened?"

"Where did Third Uncle go?"

"Such powerful lightning—did it strike Third Uncle dead?"

*Gulp!* "This kid's methods are rather strange..."

Everyone panicked instantly!

A Golden Core elder had been instantly killed. They were merely at Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment—what waves could they make?

At this moment, a single thought rose in their minds!

"Run for your lives!"

"Ye Chen the killing god has gone mad—everyone run!"

These Zhang family disciples fled in desperate panic...

"Hehe!"

"Think you can escape?"

"The Thunder Burst Talisman's power is quite impressive..."

Ye Chen raised an eyebrow. With a wave of his hand, several more Thunder Burst Talismans appeared in his palm...

All his diligent cultivation had been for this very day!

Without any hesitation, he infused them with spiritual energy and hurled them at the Zhang family disciples outside the courtyard...

*BOOM—*

In an instant, terrifying thunderbolts descended!

*BANG!*

*BANG!*

*BANG!*

Several Zhang family disciples didn't even have time to scream before being blasted to powder...

The rest were scared witless by this scene—some went weak in the legs and couldn't move, others fainted outright.

Ye Chen flash-stepped in pursuit, his spirit sword slashing out waves of sword qi, cutting down several Zhang family disciples in succession.

Guards from the front courtyard who came to investigate were also killed the moment they encountered him...

More and more Zhang family members awakened from their sleep. Walking out of their rooms, they saw Ye Chen on his killing spree. Without even time to dress properly, they began to flee...

Quite a few women were running around the courtyard wearing only red undergarments, quite eye-catching!

Ye Chen killed one person with each sword stroke, his expression emotionless as he muttered.

"Still too slow!"

He immediately took out a Clone Talisman from his storage ring!

Infusing it with spiritual energy, the talisman turned to ash, and an identical "Ye Chen" appeared out of thin air!

This was the first Clone Talisman Ye Chen had ever received. Though it could only produce one clone, that clone possessed half of his cultivation!

More than enough to deal with these Zhang family members!

Ye Chen even thoughtfully took out a Spirit-Grade longsword from his storage ring and handed it over, so the clone could also wield a sword to kill...

He delayed no further, continuing his hunt of the Zhang family members.

With the clone helping, the efficiency of the slaughter doubled...

Whenever he encountered Zhang family members gathered together, Ye Chen would casually toss out a Thunder Burst Talisman for an instant team wipe!

Outside the estate gates...

A mighty procession was returning.

At the front of the group, the seductively dressed Zhang Shuyu looked up slightly at the thunderbolts above the estate, a strange look crossing her face.

"That lightning is odd. Why is it only striking our Zhang family's compound?"

Beside her, the Zhang family patriarch froze, his expression changing dramatically.

"Not good, something's happened!"

By now, the others had also sensed something was wrong.

These thunderbolts seemed more like techniques used by cultivators!

The Zhang family's strong fighters immediately rushed into the estate.

They were met head-on by more than a dozen panicked family members—men and women, all disheveled and in sorry states.

"What's going on?"

"Coming out dressed like that—how disgraceful!"

Patriarch Zhang Mobei's face darkened as he rebuked them.

"Patriarch, save us!"

"Ye Chen... Ye Chen has come back for revenge..."

"That kid is slaughtering everyone in the rear courtyard. Third Uncle and the others are all dead!"

The fleeing family members seemed to have found their savior and rushed forward to pour out their grievances.

"Ye Chen? He dared to come back?"

Zhang Shuyu's face turned cold, a glint of murderous intent flashing in her eyes.

She wanted Ye Chen dead more than anyone.

To eliminate future troubles, she wouldn't rest easy until Ye Chen was dead.

She had even persuaded her lover, the Young Sect Master of Profound Heaven Holy Land, to send people to hunt Ye Chen down.

"Impossible!"

"That Ye family remnant is nothing but Qi Refinement trash. How could he possibly kill Third Brother?"

"He's a Golden Core cultivator!"

"The guards in the estate could kill that kid!"

Zhang Mobei said in disbelief.

He knew Ye Chen's strength well. When Ye Chen had fled the Ye family a few months ago, he was only at Qi Refinement.

Never mind killing a Golden Core family elder—he couldn't even beat Foundation Establishment guards!

"Patriarch, it's absolutely true!"

"Ye Chen isn't at Qi Refinement anymore. He's now more powerful than Golden Core!"

"The guards in the estate can't even last one move against him. He's cutting them down like vegetables..."

"He'll be heading this way soon!"

The escaping family members described the situation, still shaken with fear.
