Three hours later...

Ye Chen left Liu Ruyan's residence with a big smile on his face.

In his hands were an Earth-Grade martial technique, several bottles of pills, and several talismans.

The Earth-Grade martial technique was from Liu Ruyan.

As for the pills and talismans, those were rewards Ye Chen had earned through his hard work...

This time the drop rate wasn't bad either—the rewards were all quality items.

Among them was a High-Grade Teleportation Talisman!

Though it didn't have the tremendous offensive power of the Immortal-Slaying Talisman, it could allow Ye Chen to escape safely at a critical moment.

During this period, Ye Chen's cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds—equivalent to over a hundred years of bitter cultivation by an ordinary practitioner...

But while his realm had risen, he didn't have martial arts to match his cultivation.

In a fight against someone of the same realm, he would definitely be at a disadvantage.

So he had sought out Liu Ruyan to request a high-level martial technique to learn, increasing his strength so he would have hope of taking revenge!

Ye Chen's heart was set on killing his way back to Jiangye City, slaughtering every last member of the Zhang family who had seized the Ye family's holdings, avenging his deceased clansmen!

This hatred had been suppressed in his heart all along, and his patience had nearly reached its limit!

He wished he could kill his way back right now!

He didn't want to have nightmares anymore!

"Just hold on a little longer!"

"Once I've mastered this martial technique, I'll make the Zhang family pay in blood!"

"Zhang Shuyu, you treacherous whore—just you wait..."

Ye Chen's expression turned vicious.

Whenever he thought of that wanton stepmother, a nameless fire rose in his heart!

If not for her, how could the Ye family have suffered such a calamity?

Night had fallen...

Ye Chen walked back to the courtyard by moonlight.

As soon as he stepped into the courtyard, the fragrant aroma of food wafted toward him...

Perhaps hearing the footsteps, Lin Qingxue and the others quickly emerged from the brightly lit room.

"Senior Brother, you're back!"

"Why were you gone so long!"

"Senior Brother, are you... alright?"

The three women's gazes at Ye Chen were all strange, carrying hints of amusement and suggestiveness.

Though Ye Chen had sworn before leaving that he was going to discuss serious matters with Liu Ruyan, night had already fallen. They could all guess what had happened.

What serious matters could possibly take several hours to discuss?

Rather than jealousy, what the three of them felt was admiration!

Senior Brother was truly impressive—he'd even won over the Sect Master...

Meeting the suggestive gazes of the three women, Ye Chen awkwardly touched his nose. Knowing he'd been seen through, he quickly changed the subject.

"It's so late—haven't you had dinner yet?"

"Not yet..." Lin Qingxue shook her head.

"We were waiting for Senior Brother to come back so we could eat together!" Su Nianwan said with a smile.

Hearing this, Ye Chen felt a wave of warmth in his heart.

He stepped forward and took their hands, leading them toward the house...

"It's cold outside—let's go in!"

"Time to eat!"

The food on the table was still steaming, wafting an enticing fragrance.

Ye Chen was already famished. He immediately gathered the three women together, and they ate heartily and merrily.

After eating their fill, Ye Chen sat down by the bed and took out the Earth-Grade martial technique from his robes, carefully studying it...

"Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger!"

"What a domineering name..."

Ye Chen exclaimed in amazement.

As if blessed with perfect memory, after reading through it once, Ye Chen had already committed the technique's formulas and execution methods to memory.

He couldn't wait to go out to the courtyard, circulate the spiritual energy within his body, and attempt to use it.

But at the final step of execution, nothing happened!

Only then did Ye Chen realize that merely memorizing the formulas was useless—he still had to actually know how to use them. He couldn't help but smile wryly at himself.

He had oversimplified martial techniques...

The higher the grade of a martial technique, the more difficult it was to comprehend.

This Earth-Grade martial technique was already in the high-grade category. When Liu Ruyan had given him the technique, she had also reminded him to practice diligently and not rush things.

Truly mastering a martial technique could take months, or even years—it all depended on the practitioner's innate understanding.

Ye Chen didn't want to wait that long. His desire for revenge was growing restless!

Besides, his sister Ye Qing'er was still in the Profound Heaven Holy Land, suffering who knew what kind of torment.

He desperately wanted to rescue her!

But with his current strength, forget about storming the Profound Heaven Holy Land—even sneaking in would likely get him killed by the holy land's experts.

The Profound Heaven Holy Land had quite a few Void Refining powerhouses, and even Integration Stage great powers overseeing it. It wasn't as relaxed as the Blissful Union Sect.

Though Ye Chen was anxious to save his sister, he also knew he couldn't be reckless. Otherwise, if he failed to rescue her and got himself killed, all hope for Ye family vengeance would be completely extinguished.

"I must master the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger as soon as possible!"

Ye Chen spoke with a solemn expression.

Meanwhile, Lin Qingxue and Su Nianwan both got up and returned to their respective rooms.

Only Lu Mengyao stayed behind...

"Senior Brother, it's late. Time for bed!"

Lu Mengyao moved close to Ye Chen's side, gently reminding him. Two rosy patches appeared on her cheeks...

She looked at Ye Chen before her with eyes full of anticipation.

"Alright!"

Ye Chen glanced back at her, nodded, and put away the martial technique into his storage ring.

No matter how urgent, it wasn't urgent enough to sacrifice this moment.

Ye Chen took Lu Mengyao's small hand and turned to walk into the room...

The door closed, and the candles were soon extinguished!

The room was plunged into darkness...

An hour later...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving beginner comprehension of the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger!]

In the darkness, Ye Chen's eyes suddenly flew wide open, his face filled with disbelief!

"This... how is this possible!"

He thought he was hallucinating.

Was it because he wanted to become stronger so badly that he was imagining having comprehended the technique?

The next second, Ye Chen clearly perceived a subtle change in his body—as if he had gained some ineffable experiential insight.

The technique he had been completely lost about how to execute suddenly had direction!

It was as if a dead end had suddenly revealed a path forward—everything became clear!

Now he was certain he could execute the Six Paths Heaven-Destroying Finger!

Even if it was just beginner comprehension, at least he could attack now...

Ye Chen snapped out of his shock and was immediately overjoyed.

He had never imagined the system would reward not just cultivation, talismans, pills, and artifacts, but even martial technique comprehension...

This meant that any martial technique Ye Chen had seen, no matter how difficult, could be comprehended through this method.

Almost effortlessly!

A technique that might take others years to master, he could learn in just a few days and nights of battle...

This had undoubtedly opened the door to a new world for Ye Chen!

If he could get martial techniques for free, why would he bother putting in effort?

Ye Chen looked joyfully at Lu Mengyao sleeping soundly beside him, and an idea gradually formed in his mind...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one year of cultivation as a reward!]
