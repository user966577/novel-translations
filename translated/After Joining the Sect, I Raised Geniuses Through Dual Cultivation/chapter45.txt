Ye Chen slept until sunset before slowly waking...

He looked back—the space beside him was empty.

Lu Mengyao had gotten up and left at some point...

It seemed the girl hadn't really been tired; she had just wanted to nap with Ye Chen...

Ye Chen still felt drowsy.

Partly from lack of sleep, partly from lack of energy...

Right now, Ye Chen felt his body was somewhat drained.

Even with his Vigorous Man Physique, he couldn't withstand this kind of consumption—his recovery couldn't keep up.

Ye Chen pondered to himself...

"I should have them make some medicinal cuisine to nourish me..."

"Otherwise, I'm going to be sucked dry!"

It would be ironic if he wasn't killed by someone from the Profound Heaven Holy Land but instead died on a woman's belly...

His great vengeance remained unavenged, and his sister Ye Qing'er was still waiting for him to rescue her!

"I can't go on like this..."

"Must pull myself together!"

Ye Chen silently resolved, muttering with a serious expression.

He got up from the bed, dressed, and headed outside...

The sound of bustling footsteps and chatter came from outside.

It seemed like something was going on.

Ye Chen felt puzzled.

The small courtyard had only ever housed him and Lin Qingxue's group. Even when servants came in, they were always quiet.

Why was it so noisy outside now?

"What are Qingxue and the others busy with?"

"Could they be preparing dinner?"

"But it wouldn't be this lively..."

Ye Chen heard Lin Qingxue's voice and curiously opened the door to step outside...

In the room across the way, several maidservants were bustling in and out.

Lin Qingxue and the others stood nearby, directing them.

Large red lanterns hung from the door frame, wedding characters decorated the windows, and the room was filled with a festive, celebratory atmosphere...

Ye Chen paused, a strange look crossing his face!

This scene was all too familiar...

In just a few months, he had experienced three wedding nights!

Wasn't this setup clearly for another wedding night?

He even thought he had gotten up too fast and was still dreaming!

"Senior Brother, you're awake!"

"The food is ready. Do you want to eat something first to fill your stomach?"

"Earlier, the Sect Master sent someone with a junior sister, saying she's here to serve you..."

Lin Qingxue and the others saw Ye Chen and quickly walked over.

They also explained the situation...

While he was sleeping, Liu Ruyan had thoughtfully arranged for a female disciple to come serve Ye Chen, as compensation for Shangguan Yanran's departure...

Previously, Shangguan Yanran had been assigned to the courtyard but had clashed with Ye Chen and the others, and Ye Chen had driven her away on the spot.

The matter had been dropped after that...

Though Ye Chen had mentioned wanting a replacement female disciple when he was fooling around with Liu Ruyan, it had only been a joke—he hadn't actually insisted on it...

Who knew Liu Ruyan would be so efficient, actually arranging a female disciple to serve Ye Chen so quickly.

Was she really that effective?

Wasn't she worried he wouldn't be able to handle it?

Ye Chen sighed helplessly, feeling a hint of pressure...

If he was satisfied here, wouldn't Liu Ruyan go hungry?

And this woman wasn't the least bit worried?

"I... I should eat something first!"

"I'm hungry..."

Ye Chen rubbed his growling stomach and spoke with a wry smile.

Only with a full belly would he have the strength to work!

Though he had just firmly resolved to pull himself together, why would he refuse a female disciple delivered to his door?

She was waiting for the wedding night!

To turn her away now would be awkward, and wouldn't that be slapping Liu Ruyan in the face?

If word got out, people might think he wasn't up to the task...

Ye Chen quickly walked to the adjacent room and began devouring the table full of food.

Lin Qingxue and the others watched his retreating figure and giggled quietly...

"Hahahaha..."

"Senior Brother has never looked this flustered before..."

Lin Qingxue whispered with a suppressed laugh.

"He must be exhausted from yesterday until now..."

Lu Mengyao said with a satisfied smile, her eyebrows raised.

"The Sect Master's kind gesture really came at an awkward time!"

"I wonder if Senior Brother can hold up..."

Su Nianwan couldn't help but sigh, her heart even worrying about Ye Chen's body...

Afraid he wouldn't be able to handle it...

"Don't worry. Senior Brother will definitely find a way..."

Lin Qingxue seemed to recall something, her face flushing as she spoke.

Lu Mengyao and Su Nianwan's expressions froze. They turned to look at Lin Qingxue, a strange glint in their eyes as they probed.

"Has junior sister also seen... Senior Brother take that miraculous pill?"

This was an embarrassing topic they rarely discussed among themselves.

But Lin Qingxue's words had reminded Lu Mengyao and Su Nianwan of certain little episodes...

"Have you two also...?"

Lin Qingxue looked at them with surprise.

The three women exchanged glances, their faces flushing in unison...

Their earlier worry instantly evaporated.

In the room...

Ye Chen was wolfing down his food, unaware of what was happening outside.

Right now, he just wanted to fill his stomach quickly so he wouldn't disappoint later...

With the food's nourishment, the hollow feeling in his body wasn't as intense anymore.

The moment he was full, Ye Chen leaned back comfortably in his chair.

With a wave of his hand, a black pill emitting a medicinal fragrance appeared in his palm...

Ye Chen immediately swallowed this Endless Vitality Pill!

He secretly thanked himself for having this in reserve—otherwise, things might have gotten dicey...

Three seconds later...

Ye Chen seemed like a completely different person—energized, with all his stamina restored to peak condition!

"This really is amazing stuff!"

He sighed with appreciation, wishing he had more of them...

That way, he could instantly recover no matter what situation arose.

Unfortunately, this Endless Vitality Pill was his last one in stock!

"I hope this new female disciple doesn't disappoint..."

"It would be great if she could drop some good items..."

"If nothing else, at least a few more Endless Vitality Pills would be nice—at least I wouldn't lose out!"

Ye Chen muttered quietly, his heart full of anticipation...

Surely Liu Ruyan wouldn't shortchange him. The female disciple she sent must be quite good!

He walked out of the room...

Lin Qingxue and the others had already disappeared from the courtyard.

They had all returned to their own rooms, tactfully making themselves scarce.

Even the maidservants who had been bustling about earlier had left.

The courtyard was quiet and still, peaceful and serene...

Ye Chen looked at the newly decorated bridal chamber next door and walked straight toward it...

A moment like this is worth a thousand gold!
