Jiang Yuyan looked coldly at Su Nianwan, who had escaped from the room.

A flicker of confusion crossed her mind.

She'd sealed the girl's cultivation and bound her with rope—how had she managed to get out?

"Vice Sect Master..."

Su Nianwan saw who had arrived and froze in place, her face going pale with fright.

It was over!

With her and Ye Chen's strength, there was no way they could escape from Jiang Yuyan's grasp...

The pressure from a Soul Transformation Stage cultivator was overwhelming!

"Vice Sect Master, I've already told you everything I know."

"Please, let me go!"

"I really am just moving to a new residence. There's no secret."

Su Nianwan hastily explained, pleading for mercy.

What worried her most right now was that the "invisible" Ye Chen beside her might be discovered—then they would both certainly die.

Jiang Yuyan looked at her with a cold smile.

"If you don't want to talk, This Seat won't force you."

"But if you think you can leave, that's absolutely impossible!"

"If word gets out that the Vice Sect Master abducted a personal disciple, how would This Seat ever show my face in the sect again?"

From the moment she'd taken Su Nianwan, she'd already planned to kill her to silence her. She would never let this matter become known.

It would be a devastating blow to Jiang Yuyan's reputation!

If other disciples learned of this, she would undoubtedly face the sect's punishment—she might even be expelled.

Jiang Yuyan naturally wouldn't show mercy. Regardless of whether Su Nianwan talked or not, she intended to kill her!

Hearing this, Su Nianwan's heart trembled. Realizing Jiang Yuyan had murderous intent, she retreated two steps in terror, as if only now seeing the Vice Sect Master's true face.

But it was too late—she couldn't escape even if she tried.

"I... I'm the Sect Master's personal disciple. If you kill me, the Sect Master won't let you off!"

Su Nianwan tried to struggle.

"Heh!"

Jiang Yuyan sneered.

"As long as This Seat doesn't admit it, who would know This Seat killed you?"

She was confident no one had seen her abduct Su Nianwan earlier.

The way she looked at Su Nianwan now was as if she were looking at a dead person!

Su Nianwan felt ice run through her veins. The instant her qi was locked onto, her heart filled with despair.

There were still so many people she cared about, and she hadn't had time to say proper goodbyes...

Was she really going to die like this?

At this moment, she didn't even dare cry for help, afraid that the "invisible" Ye Chen would intervene and throw his life away for nothing.

Being able to "see" Ye Chen one last time in her final moments, knowing his feelings for her—Su Nianwan was content.

Though she and Ye Chen had only spent one night together, their feelings had already grown as deep as those of a couple married for years.

Su Nianwan gently closed her eyes, prepared to meet death!

She did this hoping Ye Chen wouldn't try to save her and would hurry and leave.

"Since you'd rather die than reveal this secret, This Seat will send you on your way!"

"What a waste of your talent..."

Jiang Yuyan spoke coldly, her eyes devoid of any emotion.

An Earth-Grade Spiritual Root disciple was truly rare—killing her would be a significant loss for the sect.

But she had to do it!

Jiang Yuyan raised her hand and sent a blast of spiritual energy shooting through the air...

Suddenly, a sword qi slashed through the air!

*Boom!*

An explosive sound rang out!

The spiritual energy was cleaved apart by a single sword strike, dissipating completely!

"Who's there?"

Jiang Yuyan's expression darkened as she warily looked at the "empty air" beside Su Nianwan.

Though that had only been a casual attack, the sword strike just now had been no weakling either...

Most importantly, she hadn't even sensed anyone else present...

The next second, a flash of sword light appeared before her eyes.

"Seeking death..."

Jiang Yuyan gave a light tap, and ripples spread through the air before her.

Ye Chen's figure was sent flying backward, crashing to the ground not far away. The Immortal-Grade spirit sword in his hand clattered to the side.

The Invisibility Talisman's effect was instantly shattered!

"So it was you..."

Jiang Yuyan's gaze fell on Ye Chen, a flash of surprise in her eyes!

She hadn't expected the intruder to be Ye Chen.

Though this was their first official meeting, Jiang Yuyan had already tailed Ye Chen before and knew he was the source of the secret!

"Senior Brother, are you alright?"

"Don't worry about me—run!"

Su Nianwan rushed over, her voice carrying a hint of tears.

She hadn't expected Ye Chen to risk his life to save her. Alongside her gratitude, she felt even more worry.

The gap in strength was too vast—Ye Chen couldn't possibly be Jiang Yuyan's match.

Revealing himself now was essentially suicide.

*Cough, cough...*

Ye Chen reached up to wipe the fresh blood from the corner of his mouth. He'd taken a serious injury. A self-deprecating smile crossed his face.

"I'm still too weak..."

He'd originally planned to use the Invisibility Talisman for a sneak attack on Jiang Yuyan, but he'd nearly been killed by her in a single move.

In that instant, Ye Chen had felt death approaching.

Fortunately, Jiang Yuyan hadn't used her full strength, giving him a chance to catch his breath.

Now he realized just how vast the gap between himself and Jiang Yuyan was—even a sneak attack couldn't defeat her.

Ye Chen looked at Su Nianwan before him and waved his hand.

"Relax, I'm fine!"

"How could I leave you behind and run away alone?"

Hearing Ye Chen say this, Su Nianwan cried even harder, her heart overflowing with emotion.

"Wuwuwu, Senior Brother..."

Su Nianwan silently vowed that if they survived this, she would spend the rest of her life repaying Ye Chen's feelings.

"I was planning to come find you, but here you are, delivering yourself to me?"

"Tell me—what secret do you and Liu Ruyan share?"

"If you tell the truth, perhaps I'll consider letting you both go..."

Jiang Yuyan looked at Ye Chen with interest, in no hurry to strike, her curiosity getting the better of her.

Her purpose in capturing Su Nianwan was to extract the "secret" from her!

Now that Ye Chen, the source himself, was right before her, Jiang Yuyan was pleasantly surprised and wanted to get answers directly from him.

Ye Chen forced himself to stand despite his injuries. He looked at Jiang Yuyan with contempt and spat out a mouthful of bloody saliva.

"You think you're worthy?"

He despised Jiang Yuyan from the bottom of his heart.

A Vice Sect Master, yet she stooped to such underhanded tactics.

Jiang Yuyan's expression instantly turned dark. Killing intent radiated from her body as she fixed her eyes on Ye Chen, looking as though she wanted to tear him apart...

She was the sect's Vice Sect Master, yet one disciple after another showed her no respect.

Was she really that beneath them?

"Brat, you're asking for death!"

Jiang Yuyan spoke through gritted teeth, murderous intent toward Ye Chen rising.

"The one seeking death is you..."

Ye Chen looked at her without fear.

Then he retrieved the Immortal-Slaying Talisman from his storage ring!

This was his trump card—capable of unleashing a strike comparable to a Void Refining Stage cultivator's full power...

He'd originally planned to save it for when he stormed the Profound Heaven Holy Land to take revenge, but now he had no choice but to use it to save his life...

Without a moment's hesitation, he channeled a wisp of spiritual energy to activate the Immortal-Slaying Talisman!
