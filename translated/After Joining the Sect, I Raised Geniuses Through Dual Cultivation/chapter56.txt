In a small courtyard.

Inside a room...

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received two years of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Earth Fire Bomb!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received a Corpse-Slaying Pill! (Upon consumption, strengthens the true self to slay the Three Corpses and enter Soul Transformation!)*

Ye Chen's heart lurched, a flash of astonishment crossing his eyes!

A Corpse-Slaying Pill!

He thought he was hearing things...

The next second, an archaic-looking pill materialized in his hand, radiating an ancient aura!

Recalling the system notification that had flickered past moments ago, Ye Chen's gaze grew increasingly fervent...

This was essentially the same as a Foundation Establishment Pill—a supplementary pill for breaking through realm barriers.

But the Corpse-Slaying Pill was clearly far more precious!

Slaying the Three Corpses was no easy feat, and it had become the nightmare of countless cultivators.

Reaching the Nascent Soul Stage alone was already incredibly difficult. If one lost their mind during the process of slaying the Three Corpses, the best-case scenario was backlash and cultivation regression. The worst case? Death.

The barrier between Nascent Soul and Soul Transformation alone had blocked the advancement of countless cultivators.

Without a Corpse-Slaying Pill, attempting to break through was essentially walking through death's door.

With this pill in hand, Ye Chen's breakthrough to Soul Transformation suddenly became a trivial matter...

A single Corpse-Slaying Pill was even more valuable than an Immortal-Slaying Talisman!

Ye Chen was overjoyed. He hadn't expected Zhao Ling'er's drop rate to produce such a high-tier pill!

That afternoon nap had been an absolute goldmine...

He stored the Corpse-Slaying Pill in his storage ring, his mind already brimming with ideas!

Looking down at Zhao Ling'er, who was draped lazily across his chest, a heated gleam flashed through his eyes...

If he could squeeze out a few more good drops, that would be perfect...

Two hours later...

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received two years of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received two years of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received two years of cultivation as a reward!*

Ye Chen didn't receive a single pill, talisman, or artifact after that. Everything was just cultivation rewards...

He couldn't help but feel disappointed.

He'd been hoping to push harder and get something good, but his luck seemed to have run dry...

As dusk approached, a trace of fatigue crept over Ye Chen.

He'd wanted to sleep, but his stomach was growling so loudly he couldn't ignore it. Glancing at Zhao Ling'er, already fast asleep beside him, he tiptoed out of bed, got dressed, and shuffled out of the room, one hand braced against the wall.

*Creak!*

The courtyard was quiet and still...

But from the adjacent compound came the faint murmur of feminine voices.

The hundred female disciples that Liu Ruyan had handpicked must have already moved in...

"I wonder what those disciples look like?"

A spark of excitement ignited in Ye Chen's chest, but his weakened body quickly snuffed it out.

If he went over there now, they'd devour him whole—bones and all.

Ye Chen shook his head with a wry smile. "Better rest up first before heading over!"

His spirit was willing, but his flesh was... spent.

Just then, the aroma of cooked food drifted to his nose...

He followed the scent and ran straight into Lin Qingxue and the others.

"Senior Brother, you're... feeling better?"

Lin Qingxue looked at Ye Chen with surprise, a faint blush dusting her cheeks.

"Senior Brother must be hungry, right?"

"The food's all ready..."

"Su-jiejie even made a special tonic soup!"

Lu Mengyao eyed Ye Chen with amusement, a smile dancing in her gaze.

Ye Chen's face reddened. He straightened his posture with feigned confidence, his voice slightly hoarse.

"You all haven't eaten either, right?"

"Then... let's eat together!"

He was genuinely starving—weak and hollow.

"Senior Brother, where's Ling'er?"

"How come... she didn't come?"

Su Nianwan glanced behind Ye Chen and asked curiously.

"She's asleep..."

Ye Chen waved it off.

"Let's eat first. If she wakes up later, she can eat then."

Su Nianwan then recalled that several hours had passed and Zhao Ling'er must be utterly exhausted. Her face flushed, and she didn't press further.

Plates of food were carried from the kitchen and arranged on the table, wisps of fragrant steam rising into the air...

Before Su Nianwan could even finish ladling the soup, Ye Chen was already wolfing down his food.

"Senior Brother, slow down..."

Su Nianwan said with concern, her heart aching for him.

Senior Brother really has it tough, working so hard for the sect...

As the hot food settled into his stomach, Ye Chen instantly felt like a new man.

But his depleted energy was still recovering slowly. Without pills, it would take some time.

Just then, a disciple entered the courtyard...

"Senior Brother Ye, the Sect Master requests your presence."

Ye Chen's heart skipped a beat, a flicker of unease crossing his face!

He'd only just returned from Liu Ruyan's place at noon. Now, barely after nightfall, she was summoning him again?

Was she trying to work him to death?

Since when had Liu Ruyan become this insatiable?

Did she even stop to consider whether his body could handle it?

"Got it. I'll head over once I've finished eating..."

Ye Chen called back to the disciple outside.

After dismissing the messenger, Ye Chen continued eating. His stomach was still empty...

Lin Qingxue and the others watched him with worried expressions.

"The Sect Master is being... a bit too frequent, isn't she?"

"Senior Brother's body... can it hold up?"

Lin Qingxue said, her face full of concern.

She was afraid Ye Chen would overexert himself and simply... not come back.

Lu Mengyao and Su Nianwan wanted to speak up but couldn't find the right words.

After all, the other party was the Sect Master. As a disciple, Ye Chen couldn't easily refuse...

Seeing their worry, Ye Chen couldn't help but chuckle. He waved them off and said confidently:

"Relax. You all know your Senior Brother's capabilities."

"One little Sect Master? Completely manageable..."

"Don't worry about it."

He might look spent right now, but he still had plenty of pills—Strength Restoration Pills, Endless Vitality Pills...

This sort of thing was well within his wheelhouse.

Hearing this, Lin Qingxue and the others recalled Ye Chen's previous... performances. A crimson blush swept across their faces as they gradually relaxed...

"Senior Brother... come back soon!"

"And try to pace yourself a little. Your health matters..."

Lin Qingxue stared at Ye Chen, her face burning as she spoke.

Su Nianwan and Lu Mengyao were attentively ladling soup and placing dishes on his plate.

A short while later...

Ye Chen finished his meal and rose from his seat, leaving the courtyard.

Draped in the mantle of night, he headed straight for Liu Ruyan's grand hall...

His mind was already calculating which pill to take tonight.

Liu Ruyan had summoned him because she was clearly craving him. Since it couldn't be avoided, he might as well be proactive about it...

Never fight an unprepared battle!

Ye Chen wasn't opposed to the idea. Picturing Liu Ruyan's alluring face and bewitching figure, he felt a surge of heat...

Besides, with Liu Ruyan's Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root, who knew what amazing drops she might yield...
