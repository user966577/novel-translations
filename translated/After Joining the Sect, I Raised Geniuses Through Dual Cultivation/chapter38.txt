Jiangye City, the Zhang Family Estate.

This had once been the Ye family's property. After the Ye family was destroyed by the Zhang family working together with the Young Sect Master of Profound Heaven Holy Land, the Zhang family had completely taken over this place.

Those Zhang family members who had participated in the slaughter of the Ye family had all received considerable benefits, and the entire family had settled in Jiangye City.

Just by devouring the industries and resources left behind by the Ye family, the Zhang family had risen from an insignificant clan to become a third-rate noble house overnight!

Now, all those coming and going from this grand estate were Zhang family members, and even the servants and guards had all come from the original Zhang family.

In a room in the rear courtyard of the Zhang estate...

A spiritual energy halo suddenly appeared, forming a bottomless black vortex!

The next second, Ye Chen stepped out of it...

The spiritual vortex vanished!

Ye Chen paused, surveying the familiar yet strange room, and couldn't help furrowing his brow.

This was the room he remembered living in, which was why the teleportation array had brought him directly here.

Only now, the room had completely changed.

It was filled with pink accents, decorated with many expensive ornaments, and the air carried a sweet fragrance!

It seemed to have become a woman's boudoir!

Returning to this place, Ye Chen had no mood for admiration. His heart held only hatred!

He had fled the Ye family in disgrace and cultivated day and night at the Blissful Union Sect, all for this very day...

He had been waiting for a long time!

Killing intent immediately radiated from Ye Chen's body.

"Who are you?"

"How dare you barge into the young miss's room?"

"You lecher, you're courting death!"

A startled cry broke the room's tranquility.

A maidservant dozing by the bed suddenly woke up. Seeing Ye Chen standing in the room, she was startled, then immediately pointed at him and berated him.

This was the Zhang family estate—no one dared act impudently here!

The maidservant was full of confidence, not the least bit afraid of Ye Chen.

Hearing this, Ye Chen turned his head and merely gave the maidservant a cold look before raising his hand and slashing with his sword...

A flash of sword light...

*Splurt!*

The arrogant maidservant from a moment ago collapsed in a pool of blood.

Ye Chen didn't even raise an eyebrow. His gaze fell on the woman on the bed who had been startled awake...

"Xiao Huan... you killed Xiao Huan?"

The woman looked at the maidservant's corpse on the floor, momentarily dazed.

She had woken up to find her maidservant dead?

"Was she always this brave?"

Ye Chen said indifferently.

A maidservant without any cultivation dared to threaten him? Who gave her that courage?

"Who are you?"

"What are you doing in my room?"

"I'm the young miss of the Zhang family. If you touch me, when my father and aunt return, they won't let you off!"

Zhang Miaoyin stared at Ye Chen with a terrified expression, warning him.

Ye Chen walked step by step toward the bed. Just as he was about to act, he heard what she said and paused, furrowing his brow...

"Who are your father and your aunt?"

He wasn't very familiar with the Zhang family. He only knew Zhang Shuyu and the Nascent Soul stage Zhang family patriarch. Even this woman before him, he was seeing for the first time.

"My aunt is Zhang Shuyu, a Golden Core expert!"

"My father is the patriarch of the Zhang family, a great Nascent Soul cultivator!"

"If you kneel down and kowtow in apology now, I might consider sparing your life. Otherwise, when my father and aunt return, you'll die without a burial place!"

Zhang Miaoyin had thought Ye Chen was scared, so she immediately grew bold and shouted at him.

"Zhang Shuyu!"

"That slut is your aunt?"

"Your father is the Zhang family patriarch..."

"Good, good, good. Now I can rest easy!"

Ye Chen's face was dark as he sneered.

He had worried about killing the wrong people. Now that she had revealed her identity, he was much more at ease.

He could kill without any burden.

"You... what do you mean?"

"How dare you call my aunt a slut?"

"Who exactly are you?"

Zhang Miaoyin looked at Ye Chen in alarm, feeling he seemed somehow familiar, as if she had seen him somewhere before...

Suddenly, a portrait flashed through her mind!

"You... you're the Ye family remnant, Ye Chen?"

Zhang Miaoyin's expression froze as she suddenly recalled Ye Chen's identity.

After the Ye family was slaughtered, both the Zhang family and the Young Sect Master of Profound Heaven Holy Land had been searching for Ye Chen, trying to eliminate him completely.

For this purpose, the Zhang family had posted many portraits of Ye Chen everywhere, offering a hefty bounty to find him!

Zhang Miaoyin had some impression of them. She just never imagined Ye Chen would dare show himself!

Was he looking to die?

"That's right, it's me!"

Ye Chen stared at her coldly.

"Where have Zhang Shuyu and your father gone?"

"When will they return?"

If he hadn't learned from her that his enemies weren't at the estate, Ye Chen would have already begun his massacre!

Sensing the killing intent in Ye Chen's eyes, Zhang Miaoyin was terrified. Her whole body trembled, and she didn't dare hide anything...

"A few days ago, a mountain collapsed outside the city, revealing a cave dwelling."

"My father and aunt took the clan's experts and retainers to explore it, searching for opportunities and treasures."

"Yesterday they sent word that they would return fully loaded today, telling the clan not to worry..."

After she finished, Zhang Miaoyin glanced at Ye Chen in fear and tried to persuade him.

"You'd better leave now. Otherwise, when they return, you won't be able to escape!"

"Leave?"

Ye Chen gave a disdainful snort, as if he had heard the biggest joke in the world...

"Who said I was leaving?"

"I came back today specifically to take revenge on your Zhang family!"

"I will make your Zhang family pay blood for blood..."

His voice was ice-cold, and the hatred in his heart surged to its peak!

If not for the Zhang family, he wouldn't have lost his family.

This grudge must be settled!

Ye Chen's gaze swept over and landed on Zhang Miaoyin.

She too was in the flower of youth, with delicate and pretty features. Having just been startled from sleep, she wore only a thin purple undergarment, large patches of snow-white skin exposed to the air.

Her seductive figure was full of temptation!

"What... what are you going to do?"

As if sensing Ye Chen's gaze, Zhang Miaoyin asked warily, her heart in panic.

She hastily grabbed the quilt to cover herself...

"What am I going to do?"

Ye Chen narrowed his eyes, suddenly developing a hint of interest...

"You're quite attractive..."

"Since that slut Zhang Shuyu isn't back yet..."

"I might as well collect some interest from you first!"

"Consider it punishing you on behalf of the dead Ye family members..."

Ye Chen put away his spirit sword and moved toward Zhang Miaoyin on the bed...

"No!"

"I... I'm already promised to the eldest young master of the Zhao family!"

"You can't do this to me, please..."

Zhang Miaoyin pleaded through her tears.

She wanted to resist, but her cultivation was inferior to Ye Chen's—he had completely overpowered her!

Ye Chen glanced at her and said indifferently.

"Relax. Once you're dead, the engagement with the Zhao family will be canceled."

"Who will care about your purity then?"

Zhang Miaoyin: ???

She froze for a moment. When she realized what he meant, her face drained of color...
