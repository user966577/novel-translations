"What is that..."

Jiang Yuyan frowned slightly, staring at the Immortal-Slaying Talisman in Ye Chen's hand. An inexplicable unease crept into her heart.

She sensed a threat from the talisman!

This talisman could potentially kill her...

How could a Foundation Establishment disciple possess such a high-grade talisman?

Seeing that Ye Chen had already activated it, she had no time to think further.

"Brat, you've lost your mind!"

Jiang Yuyan grew frantic.

Why did this kid go straight to attacking without any room for negotiation?

Not a shred of willingness to talk things out.

She hastily condensed a spiritual energy shield to defend herself, planning to weather this strike first before settling scores with Ye Chen.

She absolutely had to kill this brat today!

Jiang Yuyan's hatred for Ye Chen reached its peak!

The next second, the Immortal-Slaying Talisman released terrifying spiritual power...

Countless flying swords emerged from within it, circling in the sky above, radiating an icy gleam.

The powerful sword qi sent shivers down one's spine.

Like a sword formation enveloping the entire residence...

The myriad flying swords locked onto Jiang Yuyan's aura, then descended mercilessly!

"Block it!"

Jiang Yuyan's heart lurched with fear. She desperately channeled spiritual energy to defend.

She even brought out her natal treasure to block the tens of thousands of sword qi!

*Boom—*

*Boom—*

*Boom—*

In an instant, spiritual light exploded in rapid succession!

"No!!!"

Jiang Yuyan's pupils contracted as endless terror consumed her...

Her natal treasure was shattered...

The spiritual energy shield before her collapsed with a thunderous crash...

Countless flying swords pierced through her body, obliterating her primordial spirit...

A body riddled with wounds, drenched in blood, collapsed to the ground.

A Soul Transformation Stage powerhouse had fallen, just like that!

The flying swords scattered, the sword formation vanishing without a trace.

The courtyard returned to silence once more...

Su Nianwan stared dumbfounded at the scene before her, as if in a dream, her mind completely blank.

"This... how is this possible!"

"The Vice Sect Master is... just dead like that?"

She even wondered if she was hallucinating.

The Soul Transformation Stage Jiang Yuyan, killed instantly by a single talisman...

It was simply unbelievable!

Ye Chen was also somewhat surprised.

Even though he'd known the Immortal-Slaying Talisman's power beforehand, witnessing its release still left him in awe!

So this was the might of the Void Refining Stage?

In that moment, Ye Chen's desire for strength burned fiercely...

Just then, several figures rushed over through the void.

Liu Ruyan appeared in the courtyard. Seeing that Ye Chen was unharmed, she breathed a sigh of relief.

When she saw Jiang Yuyan's corpse, she was instantly stunned, frozen in place, at a complete loss.

She thought she'd seen wrong.

She even suspected Jiang Yuyan was playing dead!

Jiang Yuyan was also at Soul Transformation Stage—who in the entire sect could kill her?

"Jiang Yuyan..."

"How can this be possible!"

The next second, several Supreme Elders also appeared before everyone.

"What happened? Who attacked just now?"

"A Void Refining Stage expert—could it be someone from the Profound Heaven Holy Land?"

"Wait... Jiang Yuyan is dead?"

They had all been alerted by the power unleashed by the Immortal-Slaying Talisman.

An attack equivalent to a Void Refining Stage cultivator's full strike—there was no way to hide such commotion from them.

Upon suddenly seeing Jiang Yuyan's corpse on the ground, the Supreme Elders' expressions all changed...

"Who did this?"

The hot-tempered Second Elder's face darkened as he demanded.

The Vice Sect Master had died within the sect—this was clearly a provocation against the Blissful Union Sect, a slap in their faces!

In an instant, the Supreme Elders' gazes all turned in unison toward Liu Ruyan...

Besides Liu Ruyan and themselves, the only ones present in the courtyard were Ye Chen and Su Nianwan—two disciples.

One at Foundation Establishment, one at Golden Core—the two of them combined couldn't match even one of Jiang Yuyan's fingers. How could they possibly have killed her?

Liu Ruyan was undoubtedly the prime suspect!

She certainly had the capability...

Moreover, Liu Ruyan and Jiang Yuyan had never gotten along—she had every motive to kill her.

Liu Ruyan: ???

Meeting the Supreme Elders' suspicious gazes, Liu Ruyan was stunned for several seconds before hastily explaining.

"Why are the elders looking at me?"

"I only just arrived!"

"Even if Junior Sister and I didn't get along, I would never kill her..."

Liu Ruyan smiled wryly, inexplicably taking the blame.

Though she had always wanted to eliminate Jiang Yuyan, she hadn't actually made a move, for the sake of maintaining sect stability.

She too was puzzled—who exactly had killed her?

Perhaps recalling that they'd seen Liu Ruyan en route, the Supreme Elders gradually set aside their suspicions of her.

"Then who could it be?"

The Second Elder furrowed his brow and spoke through gritted teeth.

His gaze couldn't help but drift to Ye Chen and Su Nianwan not far away...

"You two!"

"Tell us—who killed the Vice Sect Master?"

As witnesses at the scene, they must know who had struck.

Everyone else looked over as well.

"It was a... man in black robes!"

"He came to the courtyard while invisible, then suddenly appeared and ambushed the Vice Sect Master!"

"The man in black was extremely powerful. Before the Vice Sect Master could even react, she was killed..."

Ye Chen raised his head, meeting everyone's gaze, feigning terror as he explained.

His voice carried a tremble of fear and panic, like a quail frightened out of its wits...

"An invisible man in black robes?"

Everyone's expressions changed as they immediately went on alert...

A Void Refining Stage enemy capable of hiding their aura posed a significant threat to them.

He could appear at any moment for a surprise attack!

"Which way did he go?"

One of the elders demanded nervously.

Ye Chen raised a trembling hand and pointed in a direction...

"After he killed the Vice Sect Master, he fled that way."

Everyone looked in the direction Ye Chen indicated, frowning with hesitation.

They hadn't sensed anyone fleeing when they'd rushed over.

Could the opponent be so powerful that they'd hidden their aura again while escaping?

"Did this man in black... leave any message?"

The Grand Elder, who had remained silent until now, looked at Ye Chen and asked.

Deep within his murky eyes flickered a penetrating gleam, filled with killing intent!

Daring to kill the Blissful Union Sect's Vice Sect Master—this was naked provocation.

Equivalent to declaring war on the Blissful Union Sect!

Facing the Grand Elder's question, Ye Chen answered without hesitation.

"He said... this is what happens when you offend the Profound Heaven Holy Land!"

Su Nianwan, watching from the side, was completely stunned.

Ye Chen told lies without even blinking—it seemed so real...

She even wondered if she'd seen wrong earlier.

Su Nianwan saw through it but said nothing. There was no way she would expose Ye Chen's lie.

From the moment Ye Chen saved her, her entire being belonged to him—she was even willing to die for him!

"What!"

"Someone from the Profound Heaven Holy Land?"

"Damn them! Do they really think our Blissful Union Sect is easy to bully?"

Several Supreme Elders immediately cursed in fury...

Though they were wary of the Profound Heaven Holy Land, they wouldn't let themselves be trampled upon.

Especially now that a Vice Sect Master had died—this was an insult they absolutely could not swallow...

At this point, none of them doubted Ye Chen's words. They all believed the Profound Heaven Holy Land was responsible for the murder.

After all, only two Foundation Establishment and Golden Core disciples remained in the courtyard. Surely Jiang Yuyan hadn't been killed by them?

No one would believe that.

In their anger, everyone overlooked why Ye Chen and Su Nianwan had appeared in this courtyard in the first place.

Two disciples coming to seek guidance from the Vice Sect Master was perfectly reasonable...
