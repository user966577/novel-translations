If those words were overheard, where would she put her face?

A Sect Master seducing a disciple?

Meeting Liu Ruyan's murderous gaze, Ye Chen hastily waved his hands.

"Alright, alright, I won't say it anymore!"

Yet inwardly he was muttering—she really had seduced him first...

That's not what she had said when they were on the bed!

This woman's moods changed faster than flipping pages.

Liu Ruyan shot Ye Chen a resentful glare. She always felt that in front of this brat, her dignity as Sect Master completely vanished.

How infuriating!

Could this kid be her natural nemesis?

Suddenly, Liu Ruyan seemed to remember something. She looked at Ye Chen with a puzzled expression and raised an eyebrow.

"Wait—how do you have time to come see me?"

"Didn't I just arrange a new disciple to go to your place?"

"Even if you're resting during the day, shouldn't you be at the courtyard conserving your energy?"

At the Grand Elder's request, she had arranged first thing in the morning for Shangguan Yanran to go serve Ye Chen at his courtyard.

By all rights, Ye Chen should be quite busy right now—how did he have the leisure to come find her?

Could it be that she was more tempting than Shangguan Yanran?

At this thought, Liu Ruyan felt a small surge of secret delight!

"Sect Master, I came precisely to discuss this matter with you..."

"I don't like that Shangguan Yanran. I've already sent her away!"

Ye Chen looked frankly at Liu Ruyan on her bed.

At the same time, he explained everything that had happened earlier at the courtyard...

Including the Grand Elder's appearance.

"So that's what happened..."

Liu Ruyan nodded in understanding.

When she heard that Ye Chen had driven Shangguan Yanran away, she had worried he might offend the Grand Elder.

Learning that the Grand Elder had appeared and, being the bigger person, had taken Shangguan Yanran away, she finally relaxed.

"That Shangguan Yanran was spoiled from childhood—she really is willful and unruly."

"Since the matter is already resolved, don't take it to heart."

Liu Ruyan looked at Ye Chen and tried to comfort him.

She hadn't wanted to send Shangguan Yanran to the courtyard in the first place. Someone raised in luxury like her—how could she possibly serve anyone?

It was only out of respect for the Grand Elder that she had agreed to his request.

And then this had happened!

"You came to find me—don't tell me you want..."

"Me to send you a replacement?"

Liu Ruyan seemed to think of something, her expression turning strange as she looked at Ye Chen.

"Is that possible?"

Ye Chen asked tentatively.

"Get lost!!!"

Liu Ruyan glared at him and snapped.

He'd driven the person off himself, and now he wanted her to send another?

That was too much!

Ye Chen shrugged helplessly. His purpose in coming to Liu Ruyan wasn't actually to get a replacement—he'd just said it offhandedly.

If she really could give him another one, that would be great. If not, it didn't matter either. He wasn't lacking for company right now anyway...

"Sect Master..."

"About the Profound Heaven Holy Land..."

Ye Chen's expression turned serious.

"You want to ask how the Grand Elder learned that you were being hunted by the Profound Heaven Holy Land?"

"And how he found out about your talent?"

Liu Ruyan cut him off directly.

"Yes!" Ye Chen answered frankly.

Liu Ruyan had promised him back then that she would never reveal the secret!

Once the sect's upper echelons learned about his feud with the Profound Heaven Holy Land, they might be unwilling to shelter him—or might even hand him over!

One disciple versus a holy land power—which was more important?

"Your talent—I told the Grand Elder!"

"But I did it for your own good..."

Liu Ruyan's expression was calm as she admitted it.

She had been wanting to find an opportunity to explain this to Ye Chen.

Since Ye Chen had brought it up, she recounted the earlier incident when the Profound Heaven Holy Land had come to the sect's gates, threatening and demanding he be handed over...

"If I hadn't told the Grand Elder about your astonishing talent, he would never have overruled the others to protect you!"

Hearing Liu Ruyan's explanation, Ye Chen was shocked!

He hadn't expected the Profound Heaven Holy Land had found the Blissful Union Sect three months ago. If not for Liu Ruyan and the Grand Elder protecting him, he might have already been handed over!

By now, the grass on his grave would probably be several feet tall!

At this thought, Ye Chen broke into a cold sweat. Without realizing it, he'd already taken a trip to death's door.

Liu Ruyan glanced at him, a slight smile curling at her lips.

"Relax—the sect will protect you completely!"

"Three months ago, the elder the Profound Heaven Holy Land sent was already killed by two of our Supreme Elders!"

"As long as you stay obediently within the Blissful Union Sect, you won't be in any danger!"

She wanted Ye Chen to understand her determination and the sect's commitment to protecting him, so he could feel at ease staying in the Blissful Union Sect and contributing to the sect.

Hearing Liu Ruyan say this, Ye Chen was stunned with disbelief!

The sect had killed an elder of the Profound Heaven Holy Land for his sake?

They had truly gone all in!

His heart was instantly filled with gratitude toward Liu Ruyan and the Grand Elder...

"Thank you, Sect Master!"

"This disciple will never let you down!"

Ye Chen looked at Liu Ruyan with earnest gratitude.

"No need for thanks..."

"Just show this Sect Master a little more respect from now on!"

Liu Ruyan said with a pout.

"Haven't I been respectful enough?" Ye Chen's expression froze as he spread his hands innocently.

"Heh!"

Liu Ruyan snorted coldly, shooting him a glare.

What disciple would ask the Sect Master if she submitted?

And demand she beg for mercy before he would stop!

Was that something a disciple should do?

Meeting Liu Ruyan's gaze, Ye Chen seemed to recall his bold actions from yesterday and guiltily looked away...

The side hall fell quiet.

The atmosphere became somewhat subtle...

Ye Chen remembered another pressing matter and turned his gaze to Liu Ruyan on the bed.

His expression was full of anticipation.

"Sect Master, I want..."

"No!"

"Absolutely not!"

"I... I just underwent tribulation last night. My body hasn't recovered yet!"

Before Ye Chen could finish, Liu Ruyan immediately cut him off, a blush flashing across her cheeks...

This brat had no idea how to be gentle!

Couldn't he let her rest for a few days?

"What... hasn't recovered?"

"I just wanted a high-level martial technique..."

"Sect Master, what are you talking about?"

Ye Chen looked at Liu Ruyan strangely, his gaze gradually becoming peculiar.

He just wanted a martial technique—why was she blushing?

"You..."

Liu Ruyan froze, realizing she had misunderstood. She gritted her teeth and glared at Ye Chen.

Was this brat doing it on purpose?

One moment he was talking about respecting her, the next he was teasing her...

How infuriating!

He really didn't treat her as the Sect Master anymore...

Ye Chen completely ignored Liu Ruyan's resentful gaze and rubbed his hands together cheekily.

"Sect Master, does that mean... once your body recovers, it's okay?"

Liu Ruyan: ???

"Get lost!!!"

"Get out!"

Liu Ruyan roared.

Her voice echoed throughout the entire hall...

This brat was lusting after her body!!!
