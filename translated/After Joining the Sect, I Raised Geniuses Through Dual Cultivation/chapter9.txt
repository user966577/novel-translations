Su Nianwan was still nervous. Hearing footsteps in the corridor outside, she knew Ye Chen had arrived...

When she felt a heated gaze upon her, she instinctively looked up.

Their eyes met...

Su Nianwan's heart raced like a startled deer. Her face flushed instantly.

Ye Chen's handsome, attractive appearance etched itself into her mind—her first impression of him...

This Senior Brother Ye was dashing and talented. Dual cultivating with such a fine man wasn't a bad deal at all.

Thinking about what would happen tonight, Su Nianwan shyly lowered her head, her fingers fidgeting nervously.

*Senior Brother Ye just finished with Junior Sister Lin. Surely he won't have the energy for the bridal chamber tonight?*

As she thought this, Su Nianwan actually felt a twinge of disappointment...

The passionate sounds from the adjacent room earlier had already set her imagination running wild, filling her with curiosity and anticipation about dual cultivation.

"Senior... Senior Brother Ye."

"The Sect Master sent me to serve you..."

Su Nianwan bit her lip gently, face flushed as she spoke first, explaining her purpose to Ye Chen.

Ye Chen approached step by step until he stood before the bed. He looked down at the shy Su Nianwan and raised an eyebrow with a mischievous grin, unable to resist teasing her.

"So did the Sect Master tell you how to serve me?"

"N-no..."

Su Nianwan's cheeks burned crimson, as if blood might drip from them.

"The Sect Master only said I should follow Senior Brother Ye's arrangements in everything!"

"Follow my arrangements?"

"So whatever I tell you to do, you'll do it?"

Ye Chen continued to tease, his gaze roaming over her as he leaned closer. He reached out and lifted Su Nianwan's chin with a finger, getting a better look at that enchanting face...

"Yes..."

"Whatever Senior Brother tells me to do, I... I'll do."

Su Nianwan trembled slightly. Feeling the warmth of his fingertip, her cheeks burned, yet she didn't pull away.

Her bright eyes couldn't help but look at Ye Chen so close before her, ripples stirring in her heart.

The atmosphere grew increasingly intimate!

They gazed at each other for several seconds...

Su Nianwan's whole body burned with heat, her eyes growing hazy, her body going limp.

"Senior Brother... take me!"

Warm breath brushed against Ye Chen's face.

Like a demon's whisper, it made his blood surge!

Ye Chen was in the prime of his youth. How could he refuse such temptation?

A delicate beauty sat before him—that impressive 36D figure, the allure of the red silk dress with golden embroidery...

Even though Ye Chen had just finished a battle in the adjacent room, his blood was boiling once more!

"Senior Brother will take good care of you..."

Ye Chen hesitated no longer. He immediately sounded the charge!

He was determined to conquer the Su Nianwan before him...

"Ahh!!!"

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving two years of cultivation as a reward!]

Even as he fought, Ye Chen—still clinging to a shred of reason—noticed the system notification that flashed through his mind...

He was somewhat surprised!

Before, each trigger during his plowing sessions had only yielded one year of cultivation. But this time, it had doubled!

Why was that?

Ye Chen couldn't help but look at Su Nianwan...

Could it be... because this dual cultivation partner had a different Spiritual Root grade?

Su Nianwan was also at Foundation Establishment, the same realm as Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao. The difference was that she possessed an Earth-Grade Spiritual Root!

This made her an extremely rare genius even within the Blissful Union Sect!

Ye Chen had been quite shocked when he'd sensed her Spiritual Root grade earlier.

He hadn't expected Liu Ruyan to be so generous, willing to send even an Earth-Grade Spiritual Root disciple to dual cultivate with him...

Such a great opportunity for advancement—Ye Chen certainly wouldn't let it slip by.

In the courtyard...

Lu Mengyao was leading several servant girls back with food.

Before she even got close to the room, she suddenly stopped. Her face flushed in an instant...

She immediately understood what was happening. She didn't continue forward, not wanting to disturb Ye Chen's good time.

"Senior Brother just finished practicing with Sister Lin. How does he still have energy for Senior Sister Su?"

"Is he trying to kill himself?"

Lu Mengyao murmured under her breath, face red.

She was also worried that Ye Chen's body wouldn't be able to handle it.

He'd barely had any time to rest!

Lu Mengyao hesitated for a moment, then waved at the servant girls behind her.

"Everyone out!"

She knew Ye Chen definitely wouldn't have time to eat right now.

By the time he finished practicing the "Kun Trigram Technique" with Su Nianwan, it would probably be late at night—or possibly even the next morning...

The food would have gone completely cold by then.

The servant girls sensibly carried the dishes away.

Lu Mengyao had originally wanted to retreat to her room for some peace and quiet, but Lin Qingxue was still sleeping there after their earlier session. She could only turn and head for Lin Qingxue's room instead...

Even with the door closed, Lu Mengyao couldn't escape the sounds. Her whole body burned with restless heat, wishing she could join the battle.

"Senior Brother's body... he won't break down, will he?"

An hour later...

Ye Chen leaned against the headboard, breathing slightly heavily, his mind showing hints of fatigue.

After his thorough instruction, Su Nianwan lay curled up beside him, fast asleep...

She was completely exhausted.

[Ding! Congratulations, Host for hitting the mark on the first try! Would you like to spend 50,000 Spirit Stones to improve offspring aptitude probability?]

[After improvement, 100% chance for Earth-Grade Spiritual Root]

[20% chance for Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root]

[4% chance for Divine-Grade Spiritual Root]

[0.02% chance for Ancient Supreme Spiritual Root!]

Ye Chen's eyes lit up. Seeing the system notification trigger, his spirits immediately rose.

This time, more Spirit Stones were required, but the probability of offspring receiving higher-grade Spiritual Roots had improved dramatically!

Doubled compared to before!

And after this enhancement, any child he had with Su Nianwan was guaranteed to have an Earth-Grade Spiritual Root at minimum!

That alone was incredible!

It meant any child they casually produced would be a sect genius...

If mass-produced, it would be enough to build a holy land-level power.

Not to mention the even higher chances of producing offspring with Heaven-Grade or Divine-Grade Spiritual Roots...

"Yes! Spend the Spirit Stones."

Ye Chen chose to consume the Spirit Stones without hesitation, improving the offspring's Spiritual Root probability.

[Ding! Successfully deducted 50,000 Spirit Stones!]

[Congratulations, Host, for successfully improving offspring Spiritual Root aptitude.]

The next second, all the Spirit Stones Ye Chen had recently extracted vanished from his storage ring.

But he felt no heartache at all. Instead, he was filled with anticipation...

He eagerly awaited the birth of his child with Su Nianwan.

Liu Ruyan's original expectation of Ye Chen was simply that he could produce offspring possessing any Spiritual Root at all.

Now the baseline was Earth-Grade Spiritual Root offspring!

If Liu Ruyan learned that female disciples who dual cultivated with Ye Chen could bear children with Earth-Grade Spiritual Roots, she would absolutely arrange hundreds or thousands of female disciples for him without a second thought...

At that point, it wouldn't be ten rounds a night—it would be round-the-clock shifts of plowing.

He'd be busier than a donkey on a production line!
