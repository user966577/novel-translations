*Knock, knock, knock!*

Ye Chen rapped on the door three times.

This wasn't his own courtyard, after all. Liu Ruyan might have briefed these disciples in advance, but showing up for the first time and barging in would be a bit much.

First impressions mattered!

"Who's out there?"

A clear, bright voice called from inside...

"It's me."

"Ye Chen."

He announced himself casually.

"Senior Brother Ye..."

A surprised gasp came from within!

Then came the hurried patter of footsteps, growing closer...

*Creak!*

The door swung open...

A woman in a purple nightgown stood before him, her long hair flowing freely.

Delicate features, porcelain skin like a lotus emerging from water, eyes that sparkled like stars and moons...

A figure that put 36D to shame—and then some!

One look, and a fire ignited in Ye Chen's chest...

Liu Ruyan really did have an eye for talent. The very first one was this exceptional!

She was every bit as impressive as Lin Qingxue and the others, and could even give Liu Ruyan a run for her money...

"Senior Brother Ye, you're here!"

"Please... please come in..."

The disciple's face flushed with a rosy blush as she spoke in a sweet, shy voice.

"Alright!"

Ye Chen stepped inside.

He'd already confirmed that Liu Ruyan had briefed these disciples about the dual cultivation arrangement beforehand. Otherwise, this woman wouldn't have so naturally invited him into her chambers.

The room was suffused with a distinctive fragrance, intoxicating and mesmerizing...

*Click!*

The door shut behind them.

The disciple returned to Ye Chen's side...

"Senior Brother, my name is Li Xinyue."

When she drew close, the scent emanating from her grew even richer.

"Xinyue?"

"Beautiful name..."

Ye Chen offered his compliment and was about to make small talk when Li Xinyue caught his arm...

"The Sect Master already told me everything..."

"Don't worry, Senior Brother. I'll take very good care of you!"

"Come on, let's chat on the bed..."

Li Xinyue swayed his arm playfully, her coquettish manner adorable and inviting.

His arm was tucked against her, and the warmth of her body pressed through.

"You..."

Ye Chen turned to look at her. Meeting those dewy, come-hither eyes, the words died on his lips.

This little minx had eyes that could steal a man's soul...

Without further preamble, Li Xinyue pulled Ye Chen to the bedside, her gaze falling to his clothes...

"Senior Brother, let me help you!"

Her boldness made Ye Chen wonder for a moment if he was the one being used as a cultivation furnace...

This was their first meeting, yet Li Xinyue showed not a shred of shyness. She acted as naturally as a long-time lover.

Where did she get this kind of audacity?

Ye Chen's gaze roamed over Li Xinyue's ravishing figure. In that purple silk nightgown, she was positively bewitching.

He stared, transfixed, until the fire in his chest became impossible to contain.

"You little temptress..."

Ye Chen dropped all pretense. She was being this forward—he wasn't about to hold back!

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one year of cultivation as a reward!*

Li Xinyue had a Profound-Grade Spiritual Root, so the rewards weren't high.

Ye Chen didn't mind. His job was simply to elevate these disciples' cultivation...

Of course, if luck smiled on him and yielded some high-grade drops, that would be the cherry on top!

Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao also had Profound-Grade Spiritual Roots, and Ye Chen had never given it a second thought. He certainly wasn't going to start now with Li Xinyue.

The younger generation of the sect was struggling precisely because most disciples' Spiritual Roots were so low-grade. Having a few with Earth-Grade Roots was already a luxury.

It was only because of Ye Chen's dual cultivation talent that he'd gained access to personal disciples like Su Nianwan and Zhao Ling'er, who possessed Earth-Grade Spiritual Roots...

Among the hundred selected disciples in the compound, there might not even be a single Earth-Grade root in the bunch.

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one year of cultivation as a reward!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Clone Talisman!*

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received one Earth Fire Bomb!*

Four hours later...

Ye Chen was fading, his body hollowed out.

He'd failed to get an Endless Vitality Pill or Strength Restoration Pill in several consecutive attempts, and his stockpile was depleted.

Even if he wanted overtime, his spirit was willing but his flesh was weak.

"What a shame..."

"If only I could get an Endless Vitality Pill!"

Ye Chen sighed, storing the Clone Talisman and Earth Fire Bomb in his ring.

These were decent items—useful in their own right.

Li Xinyue was already sleeping soundly, fully satisfied. Ye Chen exhaled a long breath of relief...

*Ding! Congratulations, Host! Perfect shot! Would you like to spend 10,000 spirit stones to enhance offspring aptitude?*

*After enhancement: 100% chance of Profound-Grade Spiritual Root*

*50% chance of Earth-Grade Spiritual Root*

*10% chance of Heaven-Grade Spiritual Root*

*1% chance of Divine-Grade Spiritual Root*

*0.01% chance of Ancient Supreme Spiritual Root!*

A cold notification chimed through his mind...

Ye Chen blinked, remembering that this was his first time with Li Xinyue.

The way she'd acted—so forward, so familiar—he'd almost forgotten it was their first encounter.

"Spend the spirit stones!"

Ye Chen chose to enhance without hesitation.

Li Xinyue was one of Liu Ruyan's trusted disciples, so Ye Chen had no qualms about her bearing his offspring.

It benefited the sect and benefited him.

When the child was born, Ye Chen would receive generous rewards...

*Ding! 10,000 spirit stones deducted successfully!*

*Offspring aptitude enhancement successful!*

Ten thousand spirit stones was pocket change to Ye Chen now.

He then retrieved from his storage ring a pill that radiated a rich medicinal fragrance, its body crystalline and translucent!

"The Soul Essence Pill!"

This was the prize he'd won while dual cultivating with Liu Ruyan earlier—a treasure he guarded jealously!

"Here's hoping it gives me a nice boost in spiritual power!"

Ye Chen whispered, brimming with anticipation...

He was counting on stronger spiritual power so he could control more clones!

Without a moment's hesitation, he placed the Soul Essence Pill on his tongue...

The pill dissolved instantly, and a surge of heat rushed toward his mind!

Moments later, everything around him snapped into sharper focus...

Without needing his eyes, he could perceive the most minute changes in his surroundings!

Even the range of his released spiritual sense expanded more than tenfold...

This meant his spiritual power had increased by at least ten times!

And that was from just one Soul Essence Pill...

Ye Chen's spirits soared. If he could take a few more, his spiritual power could rival that of a Grand Ascension—even a Tribulation Transcendence—powerhouse...

But pills of that caliber were impossibly rare. He could only hope that the next session with Liu Ruyan would yield another one...

With his spirit nourished, a profound sense of calm settled over Ye Chen's mind.

The next instant, a wave of drowsiness swept over him, and he closed his eyes and sank into deep sleep...

He was utterly spent.
