"Mm..."

Su Nianwan stirred awake at the sound, her eyes bleary as she looked at Ye Chen beside her and murmured softly...

"Senior Brother, who were you talking to?"

"Something about Spirit Stones?"

There were only the two of them in this room. Su Nianwan had vaguely heard something and couldn't help feeling puzzled.

Was Senior Brother talking to himself?

"No one. You must have misheard."

Ye Chen brushed it off casually.

This wasn't something he could explain.

Looking down, his gaze fell on Su Nianwan's pure, lovely face...

The flames that had only just died down were doused with fuel once more, instantly blazing back to life!

His blood surged throughout his body.

"Senior Brother..."

Su Nianwan's face flushed crimson in an instant...

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving two years of cultivation as a reward!]

A cold notification chimed...

This undoubtedly confirmed Ye Chen's earlier suspicion. The higher the woman's Spiritual Root grade, the greater the reward!

When he'd been with Lin Qingxue and Lu Mengyao before, he'd never received two years of cultivation in a single session.

Only with Su Nianwan did he reap such rewards.

"What if I dual cultivated with a Heaven-Grade or Divine-Grade Spiritual Root woman? Would I break through a minor realm with each session?"

This discovery filled Ye Chen with elation.

He'd been worried that once his realm grew higher, accumulating cultivation one year at a time would become too slow.

Now it seemed that as long as he had suitable female disciples to dual cultivate with, the problem would solve itself.

Ye Chen couldn't help but think of Sect Master Liu Ruyan...

He wondered what grade her Spiritual Root was?

Blossoms bloomed repeatedly through the night...

In the nearby wing, Lu Mengyao didn't sleep a wink all night.

Even with a room between them, she could hear everything crystal clear.

The sounds echoing in her ears made it feel as if they were right beside her.

She might as well have been there in person.

How was Lu Mengyao supposed to sleep?

She had wanted to sit in meditation and cultivate, but her whole body burned so hot that she gave up, afraid of suffering qi deviation.

"Has Senior Brother gone mad?"

"Is he trying to kill himself?"

Lu Mengyao exclaimed in shock.

This was even more intense than last night's dual cultivation session with her!

During all this time, Ye Chen had barely rested at all. Could his body handle it?

She was genuinely worried that Ye Chen might work himself to collapse.

It wasn't until dawn that the courtyard finally fell quiet.

Only then could Lu Mengyao breathe a sigh of relief and drift off into dreamland.

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving two years of cultivation as a reward!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one bottle of Heavenly Origin Pills (Enhances cultivation below Soul Transformation Stage)!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving Endless Vitality Pills (Restores body to peak condition within three seconds)!]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, for receiving one Clone Talisman (Creates a clone of the Host with half the Host's cultivation, controllable through spiritual will)!]

Ye Chen was utterly spent.

Listening to the stream of reward notifications, he felt all his efforts had been worth it.

So what if he was tired? As long as he could increase his strength, it was fine.

This time, he hadn't just received cultivation rewards—he'd also obtained unexpected pills and talismans.

This filled Ye Chen with excitement.

Pills that other cultivators had to rack their brains to refine, he could obtain easily just by working the fields diligently.

From now on, whether he lacked artifacts, talismans, or anything else, finding a female disciple would solve everything.

Ye Chen closed his eyes amid his elated thoughts and drifted off to sleep...

In a refined, elegant great hall...

Liu Ruyan paced back and forth in a pink dress, her expression tinged with impatience.

She had been waiting since early morning for her agent monitoring the small courtyard to deliver intelligence, but she'd waited and waited with no news.

This was making her anxious!

Why was today's report so late?

Had something happened?

She desperately wanted to know the results of last night's dual cultivation between Ye Chen and Su Nianwan...

She also wanted to verify whether her suspicions were correct!

The Grand Elder was also waiting for her news.

This dual cultivation session concerned her position as Sect Master and the entire sect's interests!

Liu Ruyan naturally couldn't stay calm.

Just as she was about to send someone to investigate the secret courtyard, a disciple finally rushed in with a sealed letter.

"Finally!"

Liu Ruyan immediately dismissed everyone.

The great hall fell silent, leaving her completely alone.

*Rustle!*

She opened the letter and read carefully...

The next second, Liu Ruyan's eyes went wide. Her body trembled involuntarily.

The contents of the letter left her stunned!

[Lin Qingxue, Mid Foundation Establishment cultivation. After dual cultivating with Ye Chen yesterday, this morning her cultivation broke through to Peak Foundation Establishment!]

[Su Nianwan, Peak Foundation Establishment cultivation. After dual cultivating with Ye Chen last night, this morning her cultivation broke through to Golden Core!]

"This... this is actually real!"

"I never imagined this kid would have such abilities!"

Liu Ruyan read the letter's contents with wild joy.

Everything was exactly as she'd suspected. Dual cultivating with Ye Chen really could boost one's cultivation and break through realms!

This was no coincidence!

She knew she'd bet correctly. Not handing Ye Chen over to the Profound Heaven Holy Land had been the right choice—even if it meant offending them.

As long as Ye Chen remained in her hands, the Blissful Union Sect would soon rise to power again!

In her excitement, Liu Ruyan even felt tempted to personally seek out Ye Chen and try it herself...

Who didn't want to become stronger?

She too had encountered a bottleneck. She dreamed of advancing her realm...

Now that an opportunity lay before her, Liu Ruyan found herself wavering.

"I hope this kid isn't just fooling me..."

She looked down at the letter in her hand. With a thought, it burst into flames and scattered as ash.

Liu Ruyan formed a hand seal, using spiritual energy to conjure a message-carrying crane. She briefly summarized the letter's contents and sent it flying away...

Outside the hall, a disciple suddenly arrived to report.

"Sect Master!"

"Ye Chen is outside requesting an audience..."

Liu Ruyan's expression flickered. Without thinking, she replied, "Let him in!"

She still hadn't forgotten the idea that had just occurred to her!

If she dual cultivated with this kid, could she really break through her realm barrier?

She had been stuck at Soul Transformation for decades, unable to advance to Void Refining no matter how hard she tried...

This had practically become her inner demon!

If she could break through to Void Refining, she could secure her position as Sect Master, give the Blissful Union Sect another Void Refining powerhouse, and perhaps even shake off the suppression of their sworn enemies, the Heavenly Demon Sect...

These were all Liu Ruyan's obsessions!

To achieve her goals, she would stop at nothing.

Dual cultivating with a disciple—what was so impossible about that?

The moment this thought took root, it consumed all of Liu Ruyan's attention...
