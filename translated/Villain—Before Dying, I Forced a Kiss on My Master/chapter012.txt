Chapter 12: Senior Sister, Don't Smile So Easily Next Time

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

Outside the magnificent Chaoge City, a handsome young man and a beautiful young woman descended.

The bustling, noisy surroundings fell silent enough to hear a pin drop.

The young man rode a celestial crane, jade-like in his refinement, strikingly handsome like an immortal descended to the mortal world.

The young woman flew on her sword, graceful and poised, like a fairy from the nine heavens.

The moment they landed at the city gates, they attracted countless gazes.

Their elegant, noble attire marked them as no ordinary people—clearly scions of great families.

In the crowd, some with ill intentions stirred.

But when they noticed the heavy guard presence at the gates, they shrank back. No point courting death.

The two were none other than Su Jue and An Ke, who had traveled thousands of miles from the Sword Sect.

Seeing they had arrived, Su Jue lightly patted the Cloud-Riding Crane and leaped down. The crane cried out and soared into the clouds.

An Ke stepped off her flying sword and landed beside Su Jue.

"May I ask who you are?"

A perceptive soldier approached and inquired respectfully.

In this world of cultivation, age and appearance meant nothing—only strength and background mattered.

These two had arrived in spectacular fashion, exuding noble airs and dressed lavishly. They were clearly extraordinary.

Moreover, with the Prodigy Assembly about to be held in the city, the soldier guessed they must be personal disciples from some sect.

Su Jue deliberately fell a step behind An Ke. He wasn't familiar with the Prodigy Assembly, so An Ke would take the lead while he supported.

"From the Sword Sect," An Ke replied crisply.

"Please, enter."

The soldier's eyes lit up with understanding, and he quickly stepped aside.

The Sword Sect's name resounded throughout Central Region. As one of the top powers, its Sect Master was an Emperor-level powerhouse.

An Ke nodded to the soldier, then walked into Chaoge City with Su Jue.

Just as the two vanished through the gates, a sinister gaze watched them from not far outside the city.

"We meet again, Su Jue. Hehehe."

........

Entering Chaoge City, Su Jue and An Ke were immediately dazzled by its prosperity.

Everything was new and splendid.

The streets bustled with traffic and crowds. The citizens' faces were wreathed in happy smiles.

Countless shops lined both sides, along with every manner of restaurant and high-end establishment. Music and dance filled the air, the fragrance of wine wafting everywhere.

The river's surface sparkled, its waters clear and bright. Pleasure boats and poetry vessels dotted the water like a forest. Scholars and literati were everywhere.

Chaoge City belonged to the Zhenguan Dynasty, serving as its capital.

The Zhenguan Dynasty's ruling imperial family was the Li clan, backed by an Emperor-level powerhouse—a true top-tier force.

Emperor-level cultivators could be counted on two hands throughout all of Central Region.

The Sword Sect and Zhenguan Dynasty were both among these top powers.

"Where to now?" Su Jue asked.

An Ke calculated the time. They had arrived as planned. "No rush. Someone will come to receive us."

"Welcome, honored guests. You must be the distinguished visitors from the Sword Sect."

Just moments after An Ke finished speaking, a middle-aged man appeared before them.

The middle-aged man exuded powerful cultivation, his vitality robust as an ox.

Standing before them, he seemed like a mountain.

"That's correct."

An Ke replied.

This was Chaoge City's official liaison. She had been waiting for him.

"Please follow me. Her Highness the Princess awaits."

The middle-aged man was Wei Bing, Commander of Chaoge City, responsible for receiving the honored guests arriving for the Prodigy Assembly.

"Lead the way."

An Ke nodded. After exchanging a glance with Su Jue, they followed Wei Bing.

"The person we're about to meet is the Long Princess of Zhenguan Dynasty, Li Changle. She hosts the Prodigy Assembly every year."

An Ke explained to Su Jue along the way.

"Understood."

Su Jue nodded. She was probably not a simple character if she could host such a major event.

The Prodigy Assembly was the most concentrated gathering of the younger generation in all of Central Region.

Some exceptionally talented young men and women were waiting for just such an opportunity to showcase themselves at the assembly and soar to the heavens.

Following Wei Bing, they arrived at a magnificent, golden restaurant.

Long Princess Li Changle had prepared a grand banquet here to welcome the distinguished guests who had traveled far for the Prodigy Assembly.

At the restaurant entrance, Wei Bing bid them farewell. Su Jue and An Ke then entered.

Inside, they saw delegates from various sects. Their purpose was the same as Su Jue and An Ke's—they had come for the Prodigy Assembly.

When Su Jue and An Ke appeared, the somewhat noisy restaurant quieted noticeably.

"Let's go to the private room."

An Ke surveyed the crowded main hall and said to Su Jue.

"There are private rooms?"

Su Jue looked at the packed hall, somewhat surprised.

With private rooms available, why were they all gathered here?

Looking for marriage prospects?

"Of course."

Sensing Su Jue's confusion, An Ke smiled and asked, "Is this your first time on a sect mission, Junior Brother?"

"How did you know, Senior Sister?"

Su Jue looked at her curiously.

An Ke smiled lightly. "I can tell. Our Sword Sect carries significant weight in Central Region. On previous missions, I've always received first-class treatment."

"I see."

Su Jue chuckled. In this world where martial power reigned supreme, having strength and status really did make you superior.

"Let's go, Junior Brother."

Sensing the heated gazes from around them, An Ke felt uncomfortable. She tugged Su Jue's sleeve and headed toward the second floor.

A stunning beauty naturally attracted attention. An Ke's gorgeous, sweet appearance made her exactly the kind of prey those men wanted to pursue.

"Alright."

Before going upstairs, Su Jue smiled and raised his middle finger at the young hotheads below, then followed close behind.

They were instantly enraged, but seeing the pair heading upstairs, they could only swallow their anger, furious but silent.

Only disciples from top sects with Emperor-level backing could access the second floor. They couldn't afford to offend them.

Sects were ranked in tiers. Any sect could attend the Prodigy Assembly.

But lower or mid-tier sects didn't have the privilege of personal reception from Chaoge City, nor private rooms.

Noticing Su Jue's gesture, An Ke let out a pfft of laughter, her smile radiant as a blooming flower. Several inexperienced young men instantly went slack-jawed.

"Senior Sister, don't smile so easily next time."

Su Jue said casually.

An Ke tilted her head. "Hm? Why?"

"If looks could kill, your junior brother would've died a hundred times over."

Su Jue glanced at the jealous, resentful gazes below and spoke matter-of-factly.

"Oh?"

An Ke didn't understand at first, but seeing Su Jue's knowing smile, she quickly caught on.

He was complimenting her.

An Ke lowered her head slightly, her fair jade face warming, looking quite lovely.

She felt a flutter of joy in her heart.

This junior brother was rather interesting.
