Chapter 4: Were You Jealous of Your Junior Sister?

"Remember what you said. If you break your word, This Seat... This Seat will never speak to you again!"

Bai Ruxue huffed.

"Rest assured, Master. I won't break my promise. On such a beautiful night, why don't we enjoy it together?"

Su Jue said with a warm smile.

"Enjoy what?"

Bai Ruxue glanced around at the quiet surroundings. Apart from a forest of maple trees, there was nothing else.

"The moon."

Su Jue sat down and patted the empty space beside him.

"The moon?"

Bai Ruxue sat down next to Su Jue, the two of them very close together.

She lifted her head to gaze at the sky. Tonight was a full moon, its radiant light bathing the earth in ethereal beauty.

"Master, do you think this counts as our first date?"

Su Jue propped himself up on his hands behind him, watching the bright moon overhead with a smile.

"D-date?"

Bai Ruxue's pretty face flushed slightly. "I suppose so?"

"I will remember this day forever."

Su Jue spoke honestly.

"So will I."

Bai Ruxue felt she would never forget this extraordinary day.

It was today that she had gained a Dao Companion.

And that Dao Companion was her own disciple.

It sounded utterly ridiculous. Even if she had racked her brain before, she never could have imagined such a thing happening.

"Actually, I know you didn't truly mean to harm me. You had difficulties, didn't you?"

Bai Ruxue turned her head to look at Su Jue beside her. His flawless profile, illuminated by moonlight, was strikingly handsome.

For a moment, she found herself lost in a daze.

What was happening?

Was this what they meant by "beauty is in the eye of the beholder"? She had never noticed before how handsome her disciple truly was.

Though she had grown accustomed to Su Jue's appearance, she still found herself marveling at it.

"Yes."

Since there was no going back, Su Jue had no reservations. He nodded.

"I knew it all along."

Bai Ruxue smiled knowingly.

"Since when?"

Su Jue asked curiously. He thought his acting had been rather good.

"Since the day your personality changed so drastically."

"The old you wasn't a wastrel at all. You had exceptional talent, a mature and steady temperament, yet you still possessed the vigor of youth. You were truly kind-hearted."

"But I don't know what happened to you. You became wasteful, cold-natured, petty, and reckless."

"I've always been curious—why did you change so much?"

Bai Ruxue voiced the question in her heart.

Having spent ten years with Su Jue, she knew exactly what kind of person he was.

Su Jue's temperament was the most mature and steady she had ever seen, yet this steadiness was different from simply hiding one's emotions.

He also possessed the vigor and confidence of youth—these two qualities were his hallmarks.

Combined with his extraordinary talent, he was a true son of heaven. Otherwise, Bai Ruxue would never have chosen him as a candidate for the Sword Sect's next master.

The occasional displays of brilliant spirit had once made him the most sought-after figure in the Sword Sect.

He was the prince charming in the hearts of female disciples, and the idol of male disciples.

"Master, there's nothing your disciple can hide from you. But this particular matter—whether I tell you or not won't make any difference."

Su Jue couldn't reveal that he possessed a system. This would remain his eternal secret.

"It's alright."

Bai Ruxue showed understanding. Everyone had their secrets. She asked, "Was it because of your junior sister's appearance?"

"It's inseparably connected to her."

Su Jue nodded.

According to the plot, his junior sister's arrival had triggered his jealousy, leading him down a path of no return.

Though he had taken a different path, it still followed the general storyline.

"I see."

Bai Ruxue's gaze upon Su Jue became extraordinarily tender.

"Master, what do you understand?"

Su Jue asked in confusion.

"Were you jealous of your junior sister?"

Bai Ruxue's eyes sparkled with amusement.

"Huh?"

Su Jue wanted to say no, but there didn't seem to be a better explanation.

He could only nod with a red face, looking rather embarrassed.

A grown man being jealous of a woman—it was indeed a bit embarrassing.

"I never imagined your feelings for me ran so deep. Don't worry—my relationship with your junior sister is merely that of master and disciple."

"The reason I've been so attentive to her is that she's an orphan. I wanted to make it up to her."

"There's no need to worry about my heart being divided."

Bai Ruxue consoled him.

Though her expression remained calm, her heart was filled with happiness.

Su Jue loving her this much was exactly what she wanted to see.

Though being jealous of a junior sister was somewhat improper, it was proof enough of Su Jue's feelings for her.

"Well, about that..."

Su Jue scratched his head. He decided not to explain and let this beautiful misunderstanding continue.

Though he genuinely hadn't known his junior sister was an orphan.

He only knew the plot that pertained to himself.

"Also, next time you want to harm me, could you choose a different method?"

Bai Ruxue shot Su Jue a disdainful look.

Su Jue's mouth twitched. "There won't be a next time, Master. Your disciple couldn't bear it."

Bai Ruxue rolled her eyes. With a wave of her jade hand, a delicious dish appeared before them.

However, atop this delicious dish were some black powder particles, looking particularly conspicuous.

"Did you really think I wouldn't have noticed without your junior sister telling me?"

Bai Ruxue looked at Su Jue.

"Ahem, was it that obvious?"

Su Jue awkwardly rubbed his nose.

Bai Ruxue said irritably, "If you fed this to a dog, it would spit on it before walking away."

He hadn't thought much about it at the time. He just wanted to complete the plotline quickly so he could become the protagonist.

So not only had he not thought carefully when administering the poison, he had deliberately told his junior sister so she would inform their master.

"......"

Su Jue smiled sheepishly.

"This Seat knew you wouldn't harm me. And just now, This Seat had no intention of killing you—I only wanted to lure out whoever gave you that idea!"

"Who knew you'd be so reckless and throw yourself onto my sword!"

Bai Ruxue rapped Su Jue on the head with an annoyed huff.

Su Jue declared righteously, "Your disciple was overcome with guilt and wished to atone with death."

"There are many ways to atone. Did you have to die?"

"This Seat painstakingly trained you for ten years, and you just want to die?"

Bai Ruxue glared at Su Jue with alluring displeasure.

"So your disciple chose another method—to become Master's husband and stay by your side forever."

Su Jue blinked with a playful smile.

"Smooth-talker! Never serious about anything. Hurry up and tell me—who was behind this?"

Bai Ruxue's lips curved upward slightly, clearly in good spirits.

Su Jue thought of that old hag, and a cold glint flashed in his eyes. "Master, it was the Grand Elder."

Now, Bai Ruxue was not only his master but also his woman. The Grand Elder was their common enemy.

"I knew it was her!"

Bai Ruxue's gaze turned icy, her expression frosty.

Before Su Jue even spoke, she had already suspected it was the Grand Elder.

As a remnant of the previous Sect Master's faction, the Grand Elder had always coveted the position of Sect Master, harboring wild ambitions.

If not for Bai Ruxue's sudden intervention back then, the current Sect Master would be the Grand Elder.

Clearly, the Grand Elder hadn't given up and still wanted the position.

But she should never have provoked Bai Ruxue!

"Leave this matter to me."

Bai Ruxue said coldly.

Su Jue nodded without saying more.

He had never underestimated Bai Ruxue. Her strength went without saying, and as the Sword Sect's master, her methods were certainly not soft.

This matter was merely a trifle for her to handle.
