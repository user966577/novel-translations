Chapter 8: A Fleeting Glimpse

[Sword Embryo Heart fusion successful.]

[Host, if you fuse the Immortal-Grade Golden Core Breaker with your current Foundation Establishment Late Stage cultivation, the medicinal efficacy will be greatly diminished.]

"What do you mean?"

Su Jue asked.

[The Immortal-Grade Golden Core Breaker, as the name suggests, can only reach its full efficacy when taken at Foundation Establishment Perfection, during the moment of forming a Golden Core.]

[If the Host takes the pill at Foundation Establishment Late Stage, there's a high possibility that it will only bring you to Foundation Establishment Perfection and stop there.]

"You're saying this pill can only be taken when I'm forming my Golden Core to achieve maximum effect?"

Su Jue asked curiously.

[Correct, Host. As long as you reach Foundation Establishment Perfection, this Immortal-Grade Golden Core Breaker will help you form your core without any obstacles.]

"I see. Thank you, System. Don't worry—this young master isn't impatient. Waiting is no problem."

Su Jue smiled.

He could sense he wasn't far from Foundation Establishment Perfection. Three months at most, and then he could leap straight to becoming an eighteen-year-old Golden Core cultivator!

An eighteen-year-old Golden Core—if he remembered correctly, that was unprecedented in history.

If he could form his core at eighteen, his name would go down in the annals of history and resound throughout Central Region!

[You're welcome, Host. Now extracting the Heaven-Slaying Sword!]

Su Jue rubbed his hands together eagerly. "Heaven-Slaying Sword—with such a domineering name, what kind of extraordinary treasure could it be?"

White light flashed.

Su Jue's expectant gaze immediately turned to bewilderment.

This Heaven-Slaying Sword... was just a wooden sword?!

The wooden sword looked completely ordinary, without any fancy patterns. The only notable thing was that the characters for "Heaven-Slaying" were carved into the hilt.

"System, are you sure about this?"

Su Jue asked in disbelief.

[Host, this is indeed the genuine Heaven-Slaying Sword!]

"You're telling me this thing can slay the heavens?"

Su Jue's mouth twitched as he swung the ordinary-looking wooden sword.

[Yes, Host!]

"Fine, I'll trust you for now. After all, you have no reason to deceive me."

Su Jue was calm about this. He didn't believe this wooden sword was truly ordinary—it had just surprised him initially.

Perhaps the wooden sword had some special mechanism to awaken it. Maybe it was some kind of divine sword.

Su Jue tried several methods.

Whether infusing spiritual power into it, burning it with fire, dousing it with water, or even confessing his feelings to it and whispering sweet nothings—nothing worked.

It remained a perfectly ordinary wooden sword.

"Fine, you win. I refuse to give up. Sooner or later, I'll figure you out."

After half a day of fruitless effort, an exhausted Su Jue stared intently at the wooden sword before storing it in his spatial ring.

The days were long. No rush—take it slow.

"System, extract the Dharma Form, God-Demon Fearless!"

Su Jue looked at his final reward and commanded.

[Understood, Host! Please prepare yourself!]

"Prepare for what?" Su Jue asked curiously.

Just as the system's voice fell, Su Jue felt the world spin around him.

When he opened his eyes again, he found himself in an unfamiliar realm!

Calling it a realm was generous—it was more like hell!

Blood light shot into the sky. Endless crimson mist swirled about.

Gusts of foul, blood-tinged wind made him want to retch. Scarlet blood pooled into rivers.

Magma occasionally churned up. Bottomless chasms stretched everywhere—one wrong step would send you plunging into an abyss.

The earth shook violently. Muffled demonic howls occasionally echoed from deep below.

The ground glowed red-hot like heated iron.

All the massive stone pillars and rock walls flickered with terrifying blood-light.

The sky held neither sun nor moon—dark and lightless.

"Holy crap, does it have to be this intense?"

Su Jue was dumbfounded, staring in disbelief at his surroundings.

He drew in a sharp breath—this was all so vivid, as if he had truly descended into hell.

A sense of deathly stillness enveloped him completely. This was the feeling of death.

Having died once before, Su Jue knew exactly what death felt like.

But Su Jue didn't panic. The system wouldn't harm him.

Besides, he had also realized that his physical body hadn't entered this world. The magma beneath his feet carried no burning heat.

Only his consciousness had come to this hellish realm!

So it couldn't hurt him.

The next moment, the earth trembled as magma continued to erupt.

Suddenly, a dazzling light swept in from the horizon!

Su Jue was nearly blinded. He shaded his eyes and looked.

An enormous being strode through the shattered void!

With every step the giant took, the earth quaked!

From a distance, the giant stood a thousand zhang tall. Behind it rotated a massive divine ring radiating brilliant divine light!

Shining dao patterns covered its entire body. Its physique was magnificent, its upper body bare.

In its left eye blazed a blazing sun, rotating endlessly. In its right eye shone a pure, bright moon, cycling through its phases!

On the left half of the giant's body was blood-red, exuding the aura of hell, just like the land beneath Su Jue's feet.

The right half radiated pure, holy divine light, like the brilliant moon, filled with sacred divinity!

"What kind of monster is this? The sun and moon in its eyes?"

Su Jue's breath caught. His entire worldview had been overturned.

Just how powerful did something have to be to hold the sun and moon within its eyes!

The sun-half of its body was demonic, the incarnation of hell. The moon-half was saintly, the incarnation of divinity!

Suddenly, the giant seemed to notice Su Jue. Those eyes of sun and moon turned toward his location.

It was merely a fleeting glimpse. Su Jue hadn't even fully met its gaze when his head suddenly erupted in agony, as if about to explode.

Su Jue couldn't bear it. He clutched his head as his consciousness seemed ready to shatter, to die in this place!

The next second, Su Jue returned to his residence.

"Hah... hah... hah!"

Su Jue gasped heavily for breath. Beads of sweat the size of beans rolled down his forehead. He was soaked through with perspiration.

"What on earth was that?"

Su Jue recalled the terrifying figure of the sun-moon giant, unable to imagine what kind of monster it could be.

Just a single glance—separated by countless eons, countless days and nights, countless planes—had nearly killed him!

"Crushing all in its path" didn't even begin to describe its power!

[That is your Dharma Form, Host!]

"My Dharma Form?"

Su Jue steadied his emotions, his brows furrowing.

His Dharma Form?

Why was there not a shred of memory or operational knowledge in his mind?

[Correct, Host. You can only summon your Dharma Form after reaching Golden Core.]

[Because the burden of the Dharma Form is not something your current self can bear.]

[At that time, with but a thought, you will be able to summon your Dharma Form!]

"System, are you saying my Dharma Form is that monster?"

Su Jue didn't find this exciting at all. That monster was far too terrifying. If he couldn't control it properly, it would be a double-edged sword.

[Don't worry, Host. What you can summon now is only a reduced version.]

[By the time you can truly summon its true form, your strength will be sufficient to command it.]

"That's good."

Su Jue exhaled in relief. As long as it wouldn't backfire on him.

That single glance had nearly killed him—it was simply too terrifying.

But if he could truly harness it, it would be an immensely formidable power!

As for commanding it?

Su Jue truly didn't know how strong he would need to become.

It had already completely exceeded his understanding!
