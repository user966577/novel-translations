Chapter 2: Explain Yourself—Why Did You Force a Kiss on This Seat?

"You!"

Bai Ruxue snapped back to her senses, about to scold Su Jue, only to find he had already collapsed in her arms, devoid of life!

"This impudent disciple!"

She had been forcibly kissed!

Bai Ruxue's teeth itched with fury. Throughout the Vast Earth, everyone knew that Bai Ruxue despised male cultivators and had no interest in them whatsoever.

Dedicated solely to the path of the sword, ever since becoming the Sword Immortal Empress, Bai Ruxue's reputation had grown even more formidable. No one dared approach within three feet of her.

Forget being forcibly kissed—she had never even had physical contact with a man. From this, one could see that Bai Ruxue was a powerful woman who had been single since birth.

"I wonder if what he said was true or false?"

"He loves This Seat?"

"'Love knows not whence it comes, yet once begun, runs deep'—quite poetic, actually."

"This Seat is so cold and unreasonable. Would anyone truly love This Seat?"

Bai Ruxue's expression became extraordinarily complex.

Su Jue had been by her side for ten years. He didn't seem like someone who would deceive her.

What he said was most likely true!

Thinking this, Bai Ruxue felt an inexplicable shyness.

"If you think you can die so easily after forcibly kissing This Seat, you're sorely mistaken."

Bai Ruxue flipped her jade hand, and a crystalline, translucent green sapling appeared in her palm.

In an instant, the withered trees around them began to surge with vibrant life.

With Bai Ruxue at the center, green grass and beautiful flowers began sprouting from the dry ground.

What should have been the dying season of autumn now looked full of spring vitality, as if spring had arrived!

The Life Spirit Tree!

Legend had it this was an Immortal-grade medicinal material. As long as someone had been dead for less than a quarter-hour, no matter how severe their injuries, it could pull them back from the gates of death.

Such a precious medicine would be frantically fought over by every major sect and clan in Central Region!

Bai Ruxue waved her jade hand, and the Life Spirit Tree transformed into a stream of energy that flowed directly into Su Jue's forehead.

The next second, the wound on Su Jue's chest began healing at a visible rate.

After merely a few seconds, aside from the hole and bloodstains on his clothes, there was no trace that a longsword had ever pierced his body!

......

An unknown amount of time passed.

Su Jue slowly regained consciousness. Sensing the surging vitality within his body—completely different from his near-death state before—he felt alive again.

"OK! This young master's script has officially begun!"

Brimming with energy, Su Jue leaped to his feet, his heart bursting with excitement.

Ten years of tempering, and today he had finally achieved success!!!

Though he felt reluctant to leave his master, one had to look forward. The past wouldn't return—he needed to cherish the present and walk his own path to greatness!

"Oh-kay? What does that mean?"

A puzzled voice reached his ears.

"Hm? Where's that voice coming from?"

Su Jue found the voice familiar. He looked toward its source and discovered an absolutely stunning woman watching him with a half-smile.

"I know I miss Master, but surely not enough to hallucinate?"

Su Jue smacked his lips, completely disbelieving that he hadn't been reborn.

After all, he had already died at that point. How could a dead person possibly be revived?

"How much do you miss me?"

Bai Ruxue asked.

"Holy crap, she's real?"

Hearing Bai Ruxue continue to speak, Su Jue froze. He wasn't stupid—no hallucination could be this vivid.

"You've got some nerve, Su Jue—forcibly kissing This Seat!"

Bai Ruxue crossed her arms over her chest and glared at Su Jue.

"I'm not dead?"

Su Jue's eyelid twitched. He looked down at his chest in disbelief, finding that the wound had completely vanished.

The only evidence of his injury was the bloodstains and hole in his clothes.

"Explain yourself. Why did you forcibly kiss This Seat? Didn't you also say you love This Seat?"

"If you can't give This Seat a satisfactory explanation, you really will die!"

Bai Ruxue spoke coolly.

[Ding! Choice triggered.]

[1. Admit your love and pursue your master. Upon success, reward: Unknown.]

[2. Fabricate an excuse and continue as master and disciple. Upon success, reward: Heaven-rank sword technique, Canglan Sword.]

[3. Leave your master and become a wandering rogue cultivator. Reward: Sword King Legacy.]

(Note: Choices can be accepted or declined. There is no compulsion.)

A system?

Su Jue wasn't stupid. His adaptability was quick.

After briefly scanning the three options, Su Jue needed only a second to reach his decision.

"Your disciple has nothing to hide. I do indeed love Master."

Su Jue took a deep breath. What had been a death's-door impulse had unexpectedly bounced him back from the brink.

This time, Su Jue couldn't be certain whether he could be reborn after death. Since he had survived, he would live well.

Better a bad life than a good death. Besides, the system had changed from before.

"Impudent disciple! Do you realize that loving This Seat is an act of utter impropriety?!"

Bai Ruxue's beautiful eyes trembled as she rebuked him.

Su Jue lifted his gaze. "So what?"

Bai Ruxue was stunned. The youth's eyes were clear and bright, matching perfectly with when they first met.

Su Jue spoke frankly: "Su Jue acts with candor. If I love someone, I love them—your disciple never hides his feelings!"

"Others only remember your strength and status. They fear you because of these things, keeping their distance, showing you respect."

"But your disciple only remembers the gentle gaze you showed me, your tenderness toward me, all the kindness you've given me."

"Though your disciple's strength is meager, I vow to cultivate diligently. Given time, I will stand by your side, protect you, and become someone you can rely on!"

His words were gentle and calm, his expression composed and natural.

Elegant and poised, handsome and graceful.

Although the sudden confession and forced kiss had been Su Jue's death's-door impulse, he couldn't deny that his master was an exceptionally outstanding woman.

Never having had a Dao Companion, possessing formidable strength as a titan of Central Region, serving as the Sword Sect's master, revered by tens of thousands as the Sword Immortal Empress.

Wasn't such a remarkable woman the ideal choice for a partner?

To say he wasn't moved would be a lie. Since the system had given him this opportunity, he had to cherish it.

After all, he hadn't died. Surely he couldn't just give up on living?

He refused to believe he couldn't make something of himself in this world!

Bai Ruxue stared blankly at the youth before her, momentarily at a loss for words. "Do you realize what you're saying? Protect This Seat? Become someone This Seat can rely on?"

"That's right. Your disciple knows that Master has already reached the pinnacle of Central Region."

"But your disciple also wishes to stand by Master's side, to hear Master share her thoughts, to help Master shoulder her troubles."

Su Jue smiled faintly, his handsome face like sculpted jade.

"How do you want me to punish you?"

"Violating sect rules and harboring improper intentions toward This Seat—whether by moral standards or human principles, you've transgressed both!"

Bai Ruxue gazed coldly at Su Jue.

"Though your disciple spoke only his heart's true feelings, I'm willing to accept any punishment."

Su Jue replied calmly.

"Very well. Then die!"

Bai Ruxue drew her sword. White light flashed as a dazzling sword gleam burst forth.

Su Jue neither dodged nor evaded, his eyes showing no fear whatsoever.

He knew that if his master truly wanted to kill him, with her abilities, he would have no chance of resistance.

He probably wouldn't even know how he died.

The sword gleam was blinding, streaking past Su Jue's cheek by less than a millimeter.

A strand of hair from his temple drifted down. Su Jue swallowed.

He had brushed shoulders with death!
