Chapter 3: My Feelings for Master—The Sun and Moon Can Bear Witness

"Why didn't you dodge?"

Bai Ruxue looked at Su Jue with a frosty expression.

"My feelings for Master are true—the sun and moon can bear witness. Though mountains and seas may separate us, I shall cross them all."

Su Jue spoke with unyielding resolve.

"Though mountains and seas may separate us, I shall cross them all."

Bai Ruxue's gaze froze.

The meaning wasn't difficult to grasp. Su Jue was saying that this burning, sincere heart of his—

No matter what obstacles lay before him, he would overcome them all to be with her.

Indeed, for Su Jue, being with her was like having mountains and seas standing between them.

Not to boast, but objectively speaking—she was the Sword Immortal Empress, a titan of Central Region, the Sword Sect's master.

And Su Jue was merely a disciple. Even if his talent was monstrous, the gap between them was more than just a star and a half.

"Ten years ago, if not for Master, how could your disciple have embarked on the immortal path of the Sword Sect? This life belongs to Master."

Su Jue steeled his heart. He stepped forward and grasped the blade of Bai Ruxue's sword.

Bai Ruxue's weapon was no ordinary steel—it was a superior Immortal Artifact, its sharpness beyond imagination.

It easily sliced through Su Jue's palm, embedding itself in his flesh.

Black hair swayed in the wind as fresh blood dripped down the snow-white blade.

Su Jue's expression didn't change. He pressed the sword against his own throat.

"If Master wants my life, I offer it willingly."

"You..."

Bai Ruxue was stunned. As an empress-level figure, she found herself completely at a loss in this moment.

"Master, your disciple only wishes to receive your true love."

Su Jue gazed at Bai Ruxue with deep affection.

"True love?"

Bai Ruxue bit her crimson lips. How long had it been since she'd heard the word "love"?

Having cultivated for thousands of years, never touched by worldly affairs, devoted solely to the Dao—her loneliness was beyond what ordinary people could endure.

She had thought she would remain indifferent to romance for the rest of her life. Yet here was this youth before her, his few words throwing her heart into turmoil.

As a titan of Central Region, to become her disciple required both exceptional talent and temperament—neither could be lacking.

Su Jue possessed a supreme sword physique. His future achievements would only exceed her own. Given time, surpassing her wouldn't be a question of if, but when.

Moreover, Su Jue was extraordinarily handsome. In all of Central Region, even Bai Ruxue, who had met countless people, had never seen a man more handsome than Su Jue.

His eyes were clear and bright—the eyes of a kind-hearted person. Bai Ruxue truly couldn't think of any reason to refuse him.

Su Jue could disregard the world's judgment, could ignore the vast chasm between them. What else could she possibly say?

Such a devoted disciple, combined with ten years of memories together—she simply couldn't refuse.

"If I cannot receive Master's true love, I might as well die."

Su Jue smiled faintly.

"Put down the sword first."

Bai Ruxue was deeply moved. She glanced at Su Jue's blood-covered palm, her heart aching.

"You answer me first."

Su Jue shook his head, his gaze gentle.

There was no turning back now. Having chosen this path, he would walk it to the end.

Just like ten years ago, when he decided to play his villain role perfectly.

Once he committed to a path, he would never look back.

Bai Ruxue, under Su Jue's steady gaze, felt her face growing warm. She turned away and softly bit her lip. "This Seat... agrees. There."

"Really?! Master agrees to date your disciple?!"

Su Jue looked at Bai Ruxue with pleasant surprise.

"Keep your voice down! Any louder and This Seat is leaving!"

Bai Ruxue's pretty face flushed crimson, her voice barely a whisper.

Though outwardly she was an empress, the Sword Sect's master, when it came to matters of the heart, she was as inexperienced as a blank sheet of paper.

She was human too, with the same seven emotions and six desires. Before, they had simply been buried beneath her cultivator's heart.

And Su Jue was like a magic spell cast upon that seed, causing it to take root and sprout within Bai Ruxue's heart!

"This is wonderful! I'm dating Master!"

Su Jue was overjoyed. In his excitement, he stepped forward and pulled Bai Ruxue into an embrace.

[Ding! Mission completion rating: SSS!]

[Rewards: Sword Embryo Heart, Immortal Medicine Golden Core Breaker, Heaven-Slaying Sword, God-Demon Fearless!]

Hearing the mechanical voice in his mind, Su Jue grew even more excited. Though he hadn't heard of some of these, they sounded incredibly powerful!

"Stop fooling around, you impudent disciple. Let your master see your hand."

Bai Ruxue's face was burning red. She gently slipped out of Su Jue's embrace.

Apart from when Su Jue had forcibly kissed her, she hadn't had direct contact with a man in a thousand years. She certainly wasn't used to this yet.

"It's nothing, Master."

Su Jue was in excellent spirits. He smiled brightly.

These were just flesh wounds. Some healing pills back at the sect would fix them right up.

If this was the price for winning his master's heart, he would gladly pay it a hundred times over.

"Be good. Show me your hand."

Bai Ruxue gave Su Jue an exasperated glare.

"Alright then."

His master's concern naturally made Su Jue happy. He smiled and extended his blood-covered hand.

"Does it hurt?"

Bai Ruxue looked at Su Jue's hand with a pained expression. This stubborn disciple had actually grabbed a sword blade with his bare hand.

Fingers connected to the heart—it must have been agonizing.

"It's alright, Master. The happiness has already overshadowed the pain."

Su Jue answered honestly with a smile.

"Silver-tongued scoundrel!"

Bai Ruxue shot Su Jue an annoyed look. A soft green glow emanated from her jade hand as she healed his wound.

The wound on his hand gradually closed. Su Jue gazed at Bai Ruxue's perfect profile, shaking his head with a smile.

Wasn't this a blessing in disguise?

Having his master as his girlfriend—how many men could cultivate such fortune?

Not only did he no longer have to play the villain, but his system had been upgraded, laying a solid foundation for his future path.

"What are you smiling about?"

After healing Su Jue's palm, Bai Ruxue asked curiously.

"Smiling because I have such a beautiful wife."

Su Jue spoke truthfully.

Bai Ruxue's pretty face reddened. "Is it only because I'm beautiful? If I grow old someday and am no longer this young and beautiful, will you still love This Seat?"

"Well, about that..."

Su Jue's expression was ambiguous.

"Tell me now!"

Nervousness—an emotion that hadn't surfaced in Bai Ruxue's heart for who knew how long.

She cared deeply about Su Jue's answer. If it wasn't what she hoped for, she would be terribly upset.

"Having been with Master for ten years, your disciple loves Master completely—both your appearance and your inner self."

"Though you seem cold on the surface, your disciple knows that Master is actually a very gentle and adorable person!"

Su Jue blinked, speaking with a beaming smile.

"Very gentle and adorable?"

Bai Ruxue was almost too embarrassed to function. Her heart felt as if it had been dipped in honey—sweet beyond measure. This was the first time anyone had used such words to describe her.

She had once happened upon a romance novel that said: No matter how flawed you are, in your beloved's eyes, you are perfect.

Now it seemed Su Jue was exactly like that—treating her as his true beloved.

"Yes. So your disciple will always stay by Master's side."

Su Jue smiled.

With such an excellent wife, letting her get away would mean never finding another.

Bai Ruxue acted just like a young girl, pouting: "Then make a vow."

"I vow."

Su Jue raised three fingers.

"It should be four."

Bai Ruxue pursed her lips.

Su Jue suddenly froze. Moonlight bathed Bai Ruxue's jade-like face, and paired with the faint blush on her cheeks, she was breathtakingly beautiful.

Everything within a hundred li paled in comparison before her.

Bai Ruxue was truly the most beautiful woman Su Jue had ever seen in both his lives.

"Why aren't you saying anything?" Bai Ruxue waved her slender, pale fingers before Su Jue's face.

Su Jue shook his head with a smile. "I vow to never leave Master's side."
