Chapter 13: Su Jue: I Prefer Original Equipment

The second floor was more spacious, lined with many exquisite private rooms. The environment was clearly far superior to the first floor.

Su Jue quickly noticed a token with "Sword Sect" engraved on it hanging at the entrance of one particular room.

Obviously, this was the room prepared for the Sword Sect.

The moment they entered, a refreshing fragrance filled their senses.

Su Jue noticed the room was even equipped with a sound-dampening formation array—the clamor from outside was blocked the instant they stepped in.

All the furnishings were made of top-grade Crimson Spirit Wood, soothing to the mind and clearly luxurious.

The table was laden with fresh fruits, premium wines, and Chaoge City's specialty snacks.

Sitting in their seats and looking down at the main hall below gave one a feeling of being in a position of power, looking down upon everything.

"Good day, my lords. I'm Xiao Qing, your attendant. If you need anything, please let me know."

A fair-faced attendant with a curvaceous figure walked in and bowed respectfully.

The moment she entered, her gaze fell upon Su Jue.

Seeing how handsome he was and knowing he was a prodigy from the Sword Sect, her heart fluttered. She deliberately leaned forward when bowing toward Su Jue.

The favorable angle, combined with her somewhat revealing qipao, gave Su Jue a clear view of the snow-white curves at her chest.

But Su Jue's gaze remained calm as still water.

"You may leave," he said coolly. "We'll call if we need anything."

"Young Master, Xiao Qing is required to stay in the private room."

Xiao Qing bit her red lips and looked at Su Jue with a pitiful expression, appearing vulnerable and pitiable.

"Leave."

Su Jue's tone was indifferent as he repeated himself.

"Yes, Young Master."

Seeing Su Jue's dismissive expression, Xiao Qing's pretty face stiffened. She had no choice but to comply and withdraw.

"Junior Brother Su Jue, why didn't you let her stay?"

An Ke asked curiously. Rumor had it Su Jue was a playboy. Wouldn't playboys love this sort of thing?

Su Jue smiled. "I'm not interested in her."

This wasn't an act. With a beauty like his master constantly at his side, he had long developed immunity to beautiful women.

Moreover, there was another stunning woman sitting right beside him, making him even less interested in the flirtatious Xiao Qing.

"Why?" An Ke wondered. Didn't all men like this kind of thing?

Su Jue grinned. "I prefer original equipment."

"Huh?"

An Ke scratched her head. Her little brain couldn't comprehend what Su Jue meant.

That single sentence had her processor overheating.

"Don't understand?"

"Mhm, explain?"

"No."

"Okay then..."

An Ke pouted helplessly.

Su Jue couldn't help but laugh. "I'm just teasing. Didn't you notice the calluses on her hands?"

This Xiao Qing was no simple character.

When she had bowed earlier, Su Jue's attention hadn't been drawn to her cleavage. Instead, he had focused on Xiao Qing's callused hands.

As a decorative attendant, how could her hands have calluses? That would never be allowed.

There was only one explanation: she was hiding her abilities.

She possessed real strength but was putting on an act of being soft and alluring, trying to make them lower their guard—so she could monitor them.

"Calluses? That attendant didn't look like someone who'd have calluses."

An Ke scratched her head.

"That's why she's not a normal attendant. She's most likely someone the Long Princess sent to watch us."

"And her strength is considerable—at least above Golden Core—with some artifact concealing her aura."

Su Jue glanced outside the curtain. He had transmitted these words to An Ke mentally.

Who knew if the walls had ears?

"Is that even possible?"

An Ke's beautiful eyes widened. She hadn't considered this at all.

Xiao Qing's appearance was too deceiving—impossible to associate with being a master.

"Besides the calluses, the second knuckle on each finger of her right hand is noticeably thicker than on her left thumb."

"This is muscle development from practicing swordsmanship."

"If you don't believe me, check your own hands."

Su Jue had spent ten years with swords. He knew exactly what long-term sword practice did to someone.

Even An Ke's own sword hand had thicker finger joints than her other hand.

"It's true."

An Ke compared her own slender, fair hands. Her right hand was indeed slightly thicker than her left.

Without careful observation, it would be hard to notice.

"And this sort of thing is easy to test."

Su Jue smiled mysteriously. He called out, "Xiao Qing."

Outside, Xiao Qing had been pressing her ear to the wall. She immediately walked in.

Seeing Su Jue's smiling face, she assumed he had been captivated by her charms.

Xiao Qing smiled confidently.

Hmph, men—all seduced by appearances after all.

Acting all aloof.

"How may I serve you, Young Master?"

She batted her eyes at him seductively.

"Please peel a banana for me."

Su Jue smiled.

Xiao Qing replied naturally, "Young Master, our restaurant doesn't serve tea, only wine. Shall I pour you a glass instead?"

Su Jue glanced at the deep purple wine bottle, then pointed at the fruit on the table. "Never mind. Just peel me a banana."

"Alright."

Xiao Qing's expression shifted subtly. She had a vague sense that she was about to be exposed, but she had no grounds to refuse this time.

When reaching for the banana, her slender fingers curled slightly. Just before touching it, she gripped it firmly.

While peeling, her other hand used only her index finger and thumb; the remaining three fingers stayed pressed against her palm.

Her movements were fluid, her concealment nearly perfect.

But An Ke, forewarned and watching for it, saw everything clearly.

Not only did she spot the problem, but she even caught Xiao Qing's fleeting micro-expression.

Though the girl seemed soft and naive, she wasn't stupid. Su Jue's observations were spot-on.

"Thank you. You may go now."

Su Jue knew this was enough. When he took the banana, he deliberately brushed his fingers across Xiao Qing's palm.

Xiao Qing noticed and tried to pull her hand back, but Su Jue was faster. He still managed to feel it.

"Young Master, I only sell my skills, not my body. How can you take advantage of me?"

To cover her panic, Xiao Qing quickly feigned a shy, flustered look.

"Blame it on your beauty."

Su Jue said with a casual smile.

"Then Xiao Qing will take her leave. Call me if you need anything."

Xiao Qing flashed a coquettish smile, then sashayed out on her slender waist.

The moment she stepped through the door, her expression turned icy.

Damn. She might have been found out.

That man from the Sword Sect was dangerously perceptive!

This matter needed to be reported to the Princess.

With that thought, Xiao Qing found a blind spot in the private room's coverage and slipped deeper into the restaurant.

"Did you see it this time?"

Su Jue looked at An Ke beside him.

An Ke was staring at him with an expression of pure admiration. "Wow, Junior Brother Su Jue, you have such keen eyes."

"......"

Su Jue suddenly realized that his senior sister's innocent charm might come at the cost of being a bit scatterbrained.
