Chapter 6: Drawing the Sword with a Lost Heart

"Watch my sword!"

"Cloud Shadow Sword Rain!"

Lin Qingchen struck first, holding nothing back. With a sweep of her sword, sword qi swirled around them.

Her graceful figure appeared above Su Jue in an instant. Robes billowing, countless sword qi materialized behind her and shot toward him.

"Quantity over quality?"

Su Jue watched the rain of swords filling his vision, his expression calm and collected.

He swept his sword forward with force. A crescent of snow-white sword qi surged toward the sword rain.

The moment they collided, the sword rain shattered into countless specks of starlight scattering between heaven and earth.

That attack had looked impressive, but it had crumbled like paper.

"You need more practice."

Su Jue smiled.

"Hmph, you're underestimating me!"

Lin Qingchen snorted coldly. Her figure instantly appeared behind Su Jue, her sword thrusting viciously toward him. Sword qi resonated as the blade moved with incredible speed.

"A feint?"

Su Jue nodded approvingly. This was indeed a good tactic against enemies stronger on paper.

But he wasn't that simple to deal with.

Su Jue shifted his body slightly. Lin Qingchen's sword passed through the space beside his waist!

"Such reflexes."

Lin Qingchen was astonished but not one to hesitate.

Being acknowledged by Bai Ruxue required not just exceptional talent but also exceptional composure.

When her strike missed, she didn't falter. She changed the thrust into a sweep, her qi-infused blade slashing toward Su Jue's waist.

"That's ruthless."

Su Jue clicked his tongue. He lightly tapped his toe and leaped into the air, easily dodging Lin Qingchen's follow-up attack.

In the blink of an eye, he landed behind her.

"So fast!"

Lin Qingchen's eyes widened. She tried to dodge but was too late.

Su Jue raised his foot and kicked Lin Qingchen squarely in the back. With a pained grunt, she was sent flying several meters.

Lin Qingchen had barely steadied herself when Su Jue pressed his advantage. With a sweep of his sword, sword qi shot toward her!

"I'm not that weak!"

Lin Qingchen was somewhat frustrated. She countered with her own sword qi, but it shattered instantly against Su Jue's attack.

Still, it was enough to delay his strike for one second—and in that second, Lin Qingchen flickered aside to dodge.

"That's not weak?"

As his words fell, Su Jue's figure appeared behind Lin Qingchen again. Another kick lashed out.

Unable to dodge, Lin Qingchen took the full force of this kick.

She was sent flying several meters again. Feeling the burning pain radiating from her backside, Lin Qingchen was equal parts embarrassed and furious.

"Nice and springy."

Su Jue offered an appreciative comment. At just sixteen, developing this well was quite impressive.

"You pervert!"

Lin Qingchen flushed red and white in turn as she cursed him.

"Cursing me?"

Su Jue's expression darkened. He instantly unleashed three sword qi strikes, each one requiring Lin Qingchen's full effort to block.

Lin Qingchen didn't have time to think. She quickly employed her sword techniques, struggling to defend against the three sword qi attacks.

She dodged what she could and blocked what she couldn't. Once she finished dealing with them, she was about to catch her breath when she found Su Jue behind her once again.

"Don't kick me!"

Before Lin Qingchen could finish speaking, she was sent flying several meters again. This time, however, the kick landed slightly higher on her back.

"Damn you, are you making fun of me?"

Lin Qingchen felt the burning pain radiating from behind and seethed with rage.

She knew the gap between herself and Su Jue was large, but she hadn't expected it to be this large.

He was only at Foundation Establishment Late Stage, yet he was toying with her, leaving her utterly defenseless—like a helpless infant.

"Not at all."

Su Jue put away his longsword into his storage ring, answering honestly.

He had thought his junior sister would put up more of a fight. Now it seemed he didn't need to use his weapon at all.

But this wasn't really Lin Qingchen's fault for being weak. Su Jue was just too strong.

To be fair, reaching Body Tempering Perfection at sixteen was already top-tier talent in Central Region.

Even compared to him, she wasn't far behind.

But Su Jue's talent and dedication were beyond ordinary comprehension.

After all, villains had everything at their disposal except brains.

Artificially dumbing down villains was a standard trope in fantasy novels.

If Su Jue hadn't been sabotaging himself, if he had cultivated seriously, Lin Qingchen might never have been able to surpass him.

"If you're so capable, fight me head-on!"

"All this dodging and weaving—what kind of skill is that!"

Lin Qingchen glared coldly at Su Jue, watching as he sheathed his sword.

This was a blatant show of contempt. She would use this contempt to make Su Jue pay.

Wasn't fighting above one's level the whole point?

That was precisely what she excelled at!

"Fine, as you wish."

Su Jue smiled. The next second, his figure vanished from sight.

Lin Qingchen watched the afterimages racing toward her. Forcing herself to remain calm, she raised her sword but didn't know which one to attack.

Drawing the sword, she looked in all directions, heart lost.

"Over here."

The next moment, Su Jue appeared on Lin Qingchen's left, even calling out to provoke her.

"Got you!"

Lin Qingchen reacted swiftly, her sword slashing out without hesitation.

But the next instant, Su Jue appeared on Lin Qingchen's right. The moment she completed her swing, Su Jue struck with his palm!

The palm landed directly on Lin Qingchen's abdomen. Feeling the violent pain in her stomach, Lin Qingchen stumbled back several meters.

"Already done?"

Su Jue smiled faintly. Giving Lin Qingchen no chance to catch her breath, he flashed to her left.

"I won't fall for the same trick twice!"

Lin Qingchen endured the pain. Having been tricked once, she wouldn't be fooled again. Without thinking, she swung her sword to the right.

Unfortunately, this time Su Jue really was on the left.

"Sorry, but this time it really is the left."

Su Jue grinned, his teeth gleaming white. Controlling his strength, he struck Lin Qingchen's left side with his palm.

Lin Qingchen staggered back again in pain. The piercing pain from both flanks and her back forced her to drop her longsword.

The sword clattered to the ground. Lin Qingchen clutched her stomach, biting down on her teeth, staring fixedly at Su Jue with an aching heart.

Though she didn't want to admit it, the senior brother before her was terrifyingly powerful!

He could take her life at will.

"Remember this: no matter what enemy you face, never let go of the sword in your hand!"

Su Jue walked to the fallen sword and looked calmly at Lin Qingchen.

Then he kicked the sword over to her. "Didn't you want to fight? Pick it up. We'll continue."

"Damn it!"

Lin Qingchen wiped the blood from her mouth and forced herself to stand. She gripped her sword tightly, her blazing gaze fixed on Su Jue.

"Not bad. Now you're starting to look like my junior sister."

Su Jue laughed, then his eyes flashed with cold determination. "But I won't hold back!"

The next moment, Su Jue's figure began flickering around Lin Qingchen.

Lin Qingchen didn't panic. She unconsciously committed Su Jue's words to heart, gripping her sword tightly.

"On your left!"

"Too slow—right side!"

"Get up!"

"Never turn your back to the enemy!!"

With one final palm strike, Lin Qingchen went flying more than ten meters. Just as she was about to crash into a large boulder, Su Jue appeared behind her and caught her. Looking at the weakly breathing girl in his arms, he knew this was enough.

"Pfft!"

Lin Qingchen spat out a mouthful of blood. Her clothes were covered in dust, tattered and torn, with patches of snow-white skin visible beneath. She looked utterly disheveled.

"Do you yield?"

Su Jue asked calmly.

"No!"

Lin Qingchen spat defiantly. Setting aside the superficial wounds, even her internal organs felt like they had been rearranged. Tearing pain wracked her entire body.

"Don't be stubborn. Stubbornness will only hurt you. I'll ask one more time—do you yield?"

Su Jue stared coldly at Lin Qingchen.

Lin Qingchen met his gaze without backing down. "I. Do. Not. Yield!"
