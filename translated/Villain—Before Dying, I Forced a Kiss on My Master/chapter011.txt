Chapter 11: This Really Tests His Perception

After discussing the Prodigy Assembly matters, Bai Ruxue spent some more time with Su Jue before leaving his residence.

A day passed. After Su Jue had settled the system's rewards, it was time to depart.

Su Jue bid farewell to his master and learned that he was to meet the Fourth Elder's personal disciple at the Sword Sect's plaza.

As he walked toward the plaza, Su Jue could clearly sense that the gazes around him were filled with fear. No one dared approach him.

This was normal. Su Jue had grown accustomed to it.

To play his villain role well, during the days since his junior sister had appeared, he had done no shortage of bullying cats and dogs, tormenting his junior disciples.

Even some senior brothers and sisters, wary of Su Jue's status, had turned a blind eye to his arrogant behavior.

Upon reaching the meeting point, Su Jue found no one waiting for him.

Just as he was wondering if he had gotten the place or time wrong, a sweet voice came from behind him.

"Excuse me... are you Junior Brother Su Jue?"

Su Jue turned to look. An extraordinarily beautiful young woman came into view.

Her hair was black as lacquer, her skin fair as jade.

Her complexion was fair, glowing like a luminous pearl.

Her beautiful eyes sparkled and shimmered.

She stood behind him, looking at him somewhat timidly.

This was a young beauty no less lovely than his master or junior sister.

While Su Jue was sizing up An Ke, An Ke was also sizing him up.

Before coming, she had heard that Su Jue was arrogant, spoiled, and a shameless playboy.

But seeing him now—dressed in white, his ink-black hair tied high, strikingly handsome with an extraordinary air.

His clear black-and-white eyes were pure and bright, warm and gentle.

He looked every bit the elegant, refined young gentleman.

"Senior Sister An Ke?"

Su Jue asked tentatively.

Before coming, his master had told him that the Fourth Elder's personal disciple was named An Ke, and he should address her as Senior Sister.

"That's me."

Seeing Su Jue's handsome face, An Ke's nervousness eased somewhat.

This junior brother didn't seem as bad as the rumors suggested.

"Hello, Senior Sister. Just call me Su Jue."

Su Jue extended his hand politely.

"Hello, I'm An Ke."

After a moment's hesitation, An Ke clasped his hand.

Her small hand was cool and smooth, with a pleasant texture.

But Su Jue was no boor. After a smile and a brief touch, he let go.

"This senior sister's strength is not to be underestimated."

Su Jue probed An Ke's cultivation and found he couldn't see through this seemingly soft and innocent girl.

Clearly, she was above Golden Core, though he couldn't determine her exact level.

This made sense. The Prodigy Assembly was an important way for sects to recruit new blood. How could they send just anyone?

This seemingly naive girl was no pushover.

"Let's set off, Junior Brother Su Jue."

Seeing Su Jue's calm and composed demeanor, An Ke relaxed.

Fortunately, he wasn't the impulsive type. If he had made verbal or physical advances the moment they met, she would have refused to travel with him regardless of his status as the Sect Master's disciple.

"Agreed."

Seeing no reason to delay, Su Jue gestured toward the sky.

From the heavens came a crane's cry.

A snow-white crane with feathers gleaming with spiritual light burst through the clouds and landed before them.

The Cloud-Riding Crane nuzzled Su Jue's palm with its head, remarkably elegant and docile.

Watching Su Jue's gentle movements, An Ke's eyes flickered with interest.

Su Jue stroked the Cloud-Riding Crane's forehead, then leaped onto its back.

This was the mount his master had given him years ago. He and the crane shared a deep bond.

He then turned to An Ke on the ground. "Care to join me, Senior Sister?"

"Hm? Thank you, Junior Brother Su Jue, but I'll pass. I can fly on my sword."

An Ke was partly embarrassed and partly worried Su Jue might take advantage of her during the journey.

The Cloud-Riding Crane was still young and not fully grown. One person could sit comfortably; two could fit but would be rather cramped.

After all, Su Jue's reputation at the Sword Sect wasn't exactly stellar. Terms like "playboy," "arrogant," and countless other unflattering descriptions were associated with him.

Su Jue didn't press the matter when An Ke declined. He nodded.

An Ke's strength spoke for itself. Though the journey was long, flying by sword shouldn't be a problem.

"In that case, I'll go on ahead."

Su Jue patted the Cloud-Riding Crane. The crane let out a long cry, spread its great wings, and soared into the sky, vanishing in an instant.

Watching Su Jue disappear into the clouds, An Ke felt that this junior brother wasn't as bad as the rumors claimed.

Perhaps there was some misunderstanding?

The gaze he turned on her held no trace of inappropriate intent—it was frank and pure.

Su Jue, surrounded daily by a first-rate beauty, had developed a degree of immunity to beautiful women.

Though An Ke was indeed exquisite, she wasn't enough to make Su Jue lose his composure.

Shaking her head and thinking no more of it, An Ke lightly tapped her toe and stepped onto her sword blade, following close behind.

After all, they would be traveling together for several days. There would be plenty of time to learn whether this junior brother was truly as detestable as the rumors suggested.

Up in the clouds.

Su Jue sat on the Cloud-Riding Crane's back, eyes half-closed in meditation.

Even though the sky was the crane's domain and it flew incredibly fast, they would still need two days to reach Chaoge City.

He recalled that his last visit to Chaoge City had been three years ago.

It had been three years since he'd gone home to visit his family. He wondered how his parents were doing.

Though Su Jue had transmigrated here, the years he had spent with his family were real, and his parents' kindness remained engraved in his heart.

This Prodigy Assembly trip served two purposes: visiting home and the more important task.

Recruiting a disciple for his master—a reincarnated empress who would become his junior sister.

The term "reincarnated empress" left Su Jue somewhat clueless, though he expected she would likely shine at the assembly.

He could use probing questions to determine who the reincarnated empress was.

Of course, this was just speculation.

If he was the only one who knew the reincarnated empress's identity, that would be ideal.

But if everyone knew, the competition would be fierce, and he would lose his advantage.

He needed to keep a low profile and observe carefully.

This really tested his perception.

"System, any hints?"

Su Jue asked.

[No, Host.]

Su Jue lay back on the Cloud-Riding Crane and gazed at the azure sky. With no hints, he would just let things take their natural course.

If he didn't find her, he'd only miss out on the reward. At least the trip home wouldn't be wasted.

Suddenly, his peripheral vision caught An Ke flying alongside them on her sword.

Robes billowing, she looked like a celestial maiden.

"Doesn't that tire you?"

Su Jue shook his head.

Sword-flying looked elegant, but it constantly drained spiritual power.

He then closed his eyes, preparing to take a short nap.

The Cloud-Riding Crane's back had a formation array he had set up—unaffected by strong winds or clouds. Quite comfortable.

Certainly better than sword-flying.

An Ke noticed Su Jue too. Seeing him settle in for sleep on the crane's back, her mouth twitched.

Was this junior brother here on business or on vacation?
