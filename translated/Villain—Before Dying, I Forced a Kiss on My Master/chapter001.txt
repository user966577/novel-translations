Chapter 1: Seeking Death with All My Heart

Autumn wind rustled through the air, the weather in Central Region especially crisp and clear.

Within a forest of maple trees, withered yellow leaves drifted down with the breeze, creating a scene of melancholic beauty.

"Su Jue, do you have anything left to say?"

A stunning silhouette stood with sword in hand, her white palace dress fluttering in the wind.

Eyes like autumn waters gazed upon the youth kneeling before her with sword in hand, revealing deep disappointment and fury.

"Nothing to say."

Su Jue's body swayed unsteadily. He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and let out a cold laugh.

He raised his head to look at the celestially beautiful woman before him, a flash of reluctance and regret passing through his eyes.

But it was quickly replaced by an icy chill.

The gorgeous woman took a deep breath. "You and This Seat have been master and disciple for ten years. This Seat permits you one final word."

"I have no final words."

Su Jue tilted his head toward the sky, a look of relief and excitement emerging on his pale face.

It was finally coming to an end.

More than a decade ago, while he was reading a cultivation fantasy novel, he was suddenly struck by lightning.

When he woke again, he had somehow arrived in the world of that very novel.

And he had possessed the body of a villain destined to die later in the story.

At the same time, he was bound to a Script System, with the first mission being to play his villainous role well.

Once he completed his designated plotline, he would receive abundant rewards and be reborn, rising to become a dominant protagonist.

Only then would he obtain his own protagonist script.

The process had been excruciatingly long—he had acted for a full ten years.

Today, he had finally endured through it all and could claim the protagonist script that belonged to him.

The woman before him was his master, Bai Ruxue.

And this chapter of the story was about Su Jue's brilliance gradually being overshadowed by his junior sister.

With his petty, vindictive personality and wastrel nature—a quintessential stepping-stone character—he naturally couldn't compete against the protagonist junior sister.

His master gradually lost faith in him and began nurturing his junior sister instead.

Fury and resentment consumed his reason. Having lost his sanity, he was soon manipulated by the Grand Elder.

The Grand Elder promised that if Su Jue drugged his master and crippled her cultivation, he would become a candidate for the Sword Sect's leadership.

To secure the future sect master position, he tried to kill his master. But as a villain, he was destined to fail.

Just as his master was about to consume the poison, his junior sister exposed his scheme, and he died by his master's sword.

"This Seat doesn't understand. We've been master and disciple for ten years—why would you try to kill This Seat?"

Bai Ruxue shook her head, her beautiful eyes fixed intently on Su Jue's handsome face.

If Su Jue had been coerced, she would have reason not to kill him.

Ten years as master and disciple—she truly couldn't bring herself to strike. Even though this disciple had tried to kill her.

Thinking of those ten years, of how she had devoted herself entirely to teaching him, she couldn't bear it.

A few years ago, Su Jue hadn't been such a frivolous wastrel.

Back then, he had been clever and quick-witted, supremely talented, and diligent in his efforts.

She had once believed he would surpass her and become the foremost of the Sword Sect.

Yet somehow, ever since his junior sister arrived, Su Jue had transformed into a completely different person.

His personality had drastically changed from before—something that deeply puzzled Bai Ruxue.

And deeply disappointed her.

"Pfft."

Su Jue was about to speak, but his injuries were too severe. A mouthful of blood sprayed out.

His handsome face pale, his clear black-and-white eyes bright and lucid, he looked directly at his master and spoke word by word.

"Master, you talk too much. Hurry up and kill me."

Please, just do it, Master.

Thank you for these ten years of guidance. But your disciple is ultimately a villain—there's no way for us to have a happy ending together.

"Very well. Since you're determined to die, no one can save you."

Bai Ruxue's gaze turned cold as she looked at the youth before her, showing no more mercy.

She raised her longsword, preparing to give Su Jue a dignified death, when—

Su Jue suddenly spoke: "Wait."

"What else do you have to say?"

Bai Ruxue suspended her sword before Su Jue's forehead.

Su Jue thought it over. He should at least say goodbye.

He wasn't heartless. He clearly remembered all the kindness his master had shown him over the years.

From the day he entered the sect, she had never mistreated him, giving her all to teach him.

If he hadn't received the villain script, if he couldn't escape the world's laws correcting the plot no matter what...

He truly wanted to stay by Bai Ruxue's side. But fate was fickle—he could only fulfill his role.

"These years... thank you."

Su Jue forced himself to endure the pain. He struggled to his feet, his bright eyes gleaming with a faint smile.

"You..."

Bai Ruxue's jade-like eyes suddenly trembled.

"Your disciple has no hidden difficulties. I simply feel... unwilling to accept this."

"Why should everything good that belonged to me be given to that junior sister who hasn't even been here a few months?"

"Your disciple is unwilling. Your disciple doesn't understand. Your disciple can't accept it."

"Your disciple was foolish to commit such a grave mistake. Death is inevitable."

"I'm not saying these sentimental words to beg for mercy—these are my heartfelt feelings."

"Thank you for your guidance these years. Being with you... I was truly happy."

"Kill me. Consider it your disciple's final act of accountability."

Su Jue spread his arms wide.

In the end, he couldn't hold back. In the original chapter, his character had been unrepentant, never saying any of this.

But remembering his master's kindness over the years, he couldn't bear it. He had to speak from his conscience.

Bai Ruxue stared blankly at the youth before her. Moments from their ten years together flashed continuously before her eyes.

The youth's eyes were clear and composed. She still remembered the first time she saw Su Jue.

Those eyes had captivated her immediately—pure eyes, without a trace of impurity.

Only someone extraordinarily kind-hearted would possess such eyes.

Su Jue closed his eyes, ready to accept death.

"Leave."

After a long while, Bai Ruxue turned her head and spoke softly.

"Huh?"

Su Jue froze. He opened his eyes to see Bai Ruxue standing before him with no killing intent. He panicked.

Damn it, don't mess things up at this critical moment!

"Master, please just kill me."

Su Jue hurriedly spoke.

"I told you to leave!"

Bai Ruxue looked directly at Su Jue, her reddened eyes filled with extraordinarily complex emotions.

"No, I won't leave!"

Su Jue shook his head.

"Are you insane? Leave now or I really will kill you!"

Bai Ruxue snapped coldly.

Su Jue nodded eagerly, stepping forward. "Master, please kill me."

Bai Ruxue's brows furrowed slightly. What was going on with Su Jue being so determined to die?

Could he really have some hidden difficulty? Was he being coerced?

Parents being threatened? Siblings being held hostage?

Various scenarios flashed through Bai Ruxue's mind.

"Do you perhaps have..."

Bai Ruxue was about to ask. She could help her disciple.

But before she could finish—

The handsome youth before her suddenly lunged forward.

The longsword pierced through his chest, warm blood instantly spraying forth.

"You?!"

Bai Ruxue's beautiful eyes widened, staring at the youth now mere inches away, his body impaled on her sword.

"Finally... free."

Su Jue felt his life rapidly draining away. A intoxicating, handsome smile curved at the corner of his lips.

Bai Ruxue couldn't believe it. "Free? Was being This Seat's disciple torture for you?"

"Of course not. It's because your disciple loves you. Being able only to be master and disciple with the one I love, never able to become Dao Companions..."

"Isn't that torture?"

Su Jue spoke softly, blood seeping from the corner of his mouth, his face deathly pale.

"Impudent disciple! How dare you harbor such thoughts toward This Seat?"

Bai Ruxue said angrily.

Su Jue shook his head with a smile, gazing at Bai Ruxue's celestially beautiful face before him.

Suddenly, a strange feeling stirred within him.

Ten years of being together day and night—it would be false to say there were no feelings.

His master was so beautiful, and she had taught him with such devotion. If not for the plot demanding otherwise, Su Jue would never have let his master leave his side.

Having been here so long, having played by the rules for ten years, it was time to leave his own mark before departing.

With this thought, Su Jue endured the pain and leaned forward.

They were already so close, and Bai Ruxue had no defenses up—her mind was still fixed on Su Jue's confession of love.

Without any obstacle, Su Jue gently pressed his lips to Bai Ruxue's.

His handsome face reflected in Bai Ruxue's astonished eyes. Feeling the warm sensation on her lips, Bai Ruxue froze.

"Love knows not whence it comes, yet once begun, runs deep!"

Feeling his life rapidly slipping away, Su Jue contentedly closed his eyes.

Script, activate!

Just as his consciousness was fading, a mechanical voice echoed in his mind.
