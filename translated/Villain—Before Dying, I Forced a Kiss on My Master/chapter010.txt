Chapter 10: Heaven-Mending Pavilion, Fairy Yue?

"Hmph, I'll believe you for now."

Bai Ruxue huffed.

[Ding! Choice triggered.]

[1. Attend the upcoming Prodigy Assembly, find the reincarnated Empress and recruit her as a junior sister. Reward: Unknown.]

[2. Ignore everything and focus solely on cultivation and pursuing the Dao. Reward: Earth-rank sword technique, Wandering Dragon Shadow Sword.]

Prodigy Assembly?

Su Jue paused briefly, then quickly made up his mind. "By the way, Master, isn't the Prodigy Assembly starting soon?"

"That's right. Why do you ask?"

Bai Ruxue replied.

The Prodigy Assembly was held once a year.

It was a stage for the younger generation to showcase their talents and be selected by various sects.

The Sword Sect naturally attended to observe and select suitable disciples for the sect.

No matter how powerful a sect was, fresh blood was essential—better to have more than less.

In previous years, however, Su Jue had never paid attention to such matters.

"I heard the senior sister handling this year's event has something come up and can't go."

Su Jue was familiar with Sword Sect affairs. In previous years, the Second Elder's personal disciple had led the delegation.

But recently, he had heard she was in closed-door cultivation attempting a breakthrough to Nascent Soul and couldn't handle this matter.

"Correct."

Bai Ruxue nodded. "Why? Are you interested?"

"Yes. If possible, Master, let me go this year," Su Jue said.

Bai Ruxue asked curiously, "That's fine, but you've never cared about these things before. Why the sudden interest?"

Su Jue smiled. "The Prodigy Assembly is being held in my hometown, Chaoge City."

The system's reminder had jogged his memory—he hadn't been home in quite some time.

Having been away for years, this task provided the perfect opportunity to visit.

"You want to go home?" Bai Ruxue turned to look at Su Jue.

"Yes. It's been so long since I left. I should go back and visit."

Su Jue replied.

The Su family was definitely one of the top families in Chaoge City, and Su Jue's father was the family head.

As the Su family's leader, Su Jue's father and mother were both formidable in strength, giving them much longer lifespans than ordinary people.

Being away for several years was a long time for mortals, but for those on the path of cultivation, it really wasn't that long.

"Alright, I agree."

Though reluctant to part with Su Jue, Bai Ruxue couldn't obstruct such important matters.

"Thank you, Master. Rest assured, your disciple will definitely bring back the most talented disciples for you!"

Su Jue spoke earnestly.

"Never mind the disciples—the Sword Sect isn't lacking in young talent. But you must return as soon as possible."

Bai Ruxue said gently.

This trip to Chaoge City would take several days just for the round trip.

Add the Prodigy Assembly and the home visit, and a series of matters meant he wouldn't be back for at least ten days to half a month.

For a powerhouse like Bai Ruxue, ten days or half a month was but the snap of a finger.

But with Su Jue in her life, even a single day apart left her missing him terribly. Strange indeed.

"Is Master reluctant to let me go?" Su Jue said with a smile.

"Don't be so full of yourself. This Seat is telling you to focus on your cultivation. Heaven-Mending Pavilion's Saintess has already broken through to Foundation Establishment Perfection."

Her inner thoughts exposed by Su Jue, Bai Ruxue's pretty face warmed as she changed the subject.

"The Heaven-Mending Pavilion Saintess? Is that the one recently famous throughout Vast Earth as the foremost prodigy?"

Su Jue asked.

"Correct. You know of her?"

Bai Ruxue gave Su Jue a suspicious look.

"As a fellow prodigy, naturally I've heard a bit. But I wouldn't say I know her—just a general awareness."

Su Jue shook his head and answered honestly.

Bai Ruxue said, "Indeed, she's currently the cream of the younger generation. She may very well encounter you at the Prodigy Assembly."

"What's her name?" Su Jue asked curiously.

Bai Ruxue thought for a moment. "I believe it's Yue Qinglian."

"The same age as me?"

Su Jue stroked his chin. If so, he should keep her in mind to avoid being caught off guard.

If she was his age, then reaching Foundation Establishment Perfection at eighteen showed talent comparable to his former self—perhaps even slightly superior.

"Presumably so. Why? You seem very interested in this fairy."

Bai Ruxue narrowed her eyes, deliberately emphasizing "fairy" before asking coolly.

"Ahem, do I?"

Su Jue suddenly felt a chill down his spine.

Bai Ruxue crossed her arms. "Don't you? Asking this and that about her."

"Know yourself, know your enemy, and you'll never lose. This fairy is my age and has reached Foundation Establishment Perfection. I only became curious about her after hearing Master mention her breakthrough."

Su Jue quickly explained.

"Is that so?" Bai Ruxue huffed.

"Of course, Master. I'm only interested in you."

Su Jue blinked, then smiled mysteriously. "Please rest assured—she's only at Foundation Establishment Perfection."

"You're about to break through too?"

Bai Ruxue's eyes brightened. Observing Su Jue, she noted his surging spiritual power and smoothly flowing meridians.

His dantian swirled with spiritual energy, on the verge of overflowing.

His vital energy was robust, his spirit radiant.

Clearly, Su Jue was also about to break through.

"Yes. Very soon."

Su Jue smiled confidently. After fusing with the Sword Embryo Heart yesterday, his cultivation speed had multiplied.

Within a month, he would definitely break through to Foundation Establishment Perfection.

Then he would take the beneficial Immortal-Grade Golden Core Breaker and form his core in one leap!

"By the time you return to the Sword Sect, you'll already be at Foundation Establishment Perfection."

Bai Ruxue's perception was extraordinary. She saw through Su Jue's breakthrough timing immediately.

"Foundation Establishment Perfection won't satisfy me."

Su Jue decided not to tell his master, planning to surprise her when he returned.

"Don't reach beyond your grasp in cultivation. Stay grounded and practical."

"The path of immortality is long, with opportunities everywhere. No need to rush."

"Don't let this so-called fairy disrupt your cultivation rhythm. Everyone has their own pace and tempo."

Bai Ruxue cautioned earnestly.

Thinking the Heaven-Mending Pavilion Saintess had sparked Su Jue's competitive spirit, she worried he might neglect rest in his cultivation, abandon balance between work and rest, and suffer qi deviation.

That would be more loss than gain.

"Rest assured, Master. I won't disappoint you."

Su Jue blinked. He understood these basic principles well, but seeing Bai Ruxue's serious expression warmed his heart.

"Good. The Prodigy Assembly begins in less than three days. Start preparing—you'll need to depart tomorrow."

Bai Ruxue relaxed and continued.

Su Jue nodded. He had nothing to prepare, traveling light. "Master, will I be going alone this time?"

"Accompanying you will be the Fourth Elder's personal disciple."

Bai Ruxue shook her head.

"Alright, your disciple understands."

Su Jue had no impression of this Fourth Elder's disciple, but presumably their strength wasn't weak. At least they'd have each other's back on the road.
