Chapter 7: The White Heart

"Wait."

Suddenly, Lin Qingchen sensed something. She immediately calmed her mind and assessed her own condition.

Then Lin Qingchen's head snapped up, her face filled with disbelief as she looked at Su Jue.

Seeing Lin Qingchen's reaction, Su Jue knew the silly girl had finally realized.

Surely he didn't have to give her a beating and then explain he did it to help her, right?

That just wouldn't sound right no matter how you spun it.

"What? Comparing whose eyes are bigger?"

Seeing Lin Qingchen's widened eyes, Su Jue replied casually.

"You just helped me?"

Lin Qingchen looked at Su Jue with a complicated expression. She wasn't stupid—she could clearly feel that her meridians were now flowing freely.

When spiritual energy circulated, there was no sensation of blockage whatsoever. This was a sign of imminent breakthrough to Foundation Establishment!

Connecting this to where Su Jue's strikes had landed on her body—weren't those exactly the blocked points in her meridians?

Now they had been cleared by Su Jue's blows!

Lin Qingchen didn't believe this was a coincidence. Every single one of Su Jue's strikes had landed precisely on her blocked meridian points.

No wonder she usually would have been unable to lift her arms after such a beating.

Yet although pain kept coming, she had grown more energetic as the fight went on, finding it easier and easier to mobilize her spiritual energy.

Obviously, Su Jue had cleared her meridians for her.

He hadn't put away his sword out of contempt—he simply couldn't use a weapon to clear meridians!

"Consider it an apology."

Su Jue replied.

Whatever the case, the little girl's concern for their master was something he acknowledged.

Such a junior sister hadn't been taught in vain. Since Bai Ruxue was now his woman, this counted as a reward for the little girl.

"Thank you... Senior Brother."

Lin Qingchen bit her cherry lips, her expression moved.

"Go ahead and break through. I'll protect you."

Su Jue spoke, and to avoid distracting Lin Qingchen during her breakthrough, he turned and walked some distance away.

He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his back facing Lin Qingchen.

Without another word, Lin Qingchen immediately sat down cross-legged.

The surrounding spiritual energy was instantly drawn toward her, pouring continuously into her spiritual sea.

She cycled her cultivation method continuously, white spiritual energy suffusing her entire body. Feeling the smooth flow through her meridians, her dantian gradually filled with spiritual energy.

Along with excitement, Lin Qingchen felt several degrees more grateful toward Su Jue.

Just as she was about to break through—

"Oh no."

Lin Qingchen's brows furrowed slightly. She suddenly felt something wrong, and the wrongness came from her physical body.

Waves of sharp pain radiated from her body, making her grit her teeth.

The earlier battle with Su Jue had pushed her body past its limits.

Now that she was about to break through to Foundation Establishment, her physical weakness could easily affect her progress. If things went badly, her breakthrough might fail!

The next second, Su Jue appeared behind her.

"Cycle your spiritual energy. Focus solely on breaking through. Leave the rest to me."

Su Jue placed both hands on Lin Qingchen's back, transferring his own spiritual power into her body.

His spiritual power was different from natural spiritual energy—it was gentle and controllable.

Su Jue's method was to use his spiritual power to heal Lin Qingchen's injuries and minimize her pain.

The intense pain began to fade as that gentle spiritual power soothed her wounds.

Lin Qingchen shot Su Jue a grateful look, then focused completely!

Spiritual energy swirled around her uncontrollably, completely enveloping her.

At this point, Su Jue could stop transferring his spiritual power.

The breakthrough hinged on this moment.

The next second, accompanied by a muffled rumble, the spiritual energy contracted and gradually dispersed into the heavens and earth.

Lin Qingchen, who had been wrapped in spiritual energy, now appeared in Su Jue's view.

Only this time, she was no longer at Body Tempering Perfection—she had reached Foundation Establishment Initial Stage!

"I... I've reached Foundation Establishment!"

Lin Qingchen looked at Su Jue excitedly.

"Congratulations."

Su Jue smiled slightly.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"

Lin Qingchen stood up and spoke with genuine sincerity.

Su Jue waved his hand. "No need for such formality. Go stabilize your cultivation."

"After reaching Foundation Establishment, future cultivation is both easy and difficult."

"Heaven rewards the diligent, and the Great Dao is bitter and cold. I hope you'll stay true to your original aspirations and forge ahead."

Lin Qingchen bowed respectfully. "Yes, Senior Brother!"

But when Lin Qingchen raised her head, she found that Su Jue's figure had already vanished.

The scene showed no trace of their battle, save for her tattered clothes and the blood at the corner of her mouth.

"Senior Brother..."

Feeling the faint burning sensation still lingering behind her, Lin Qingchen's pretty face couldn't help but flush pink.

........

Night fell.

Main Sword Peak, inside Su Jue's residence.

"System, extract the system rewards!"

Su Jue sat cross-legged in his room.

[Does the Host wish to fuse the Sword Embryo Heart, the Immortal Medicine Golden Core Breaker, and the Dharma Form God-Demon Fearless? And extract the Heaven-Slaying Sword?]

"That's too much at once. Let's do them one by one—I'm worried I won't be able to handle it all."

Su Jue understood the danger of biting off more than one could chew. He decided to take things slowly. Besides, everything was already in the system space and would belong to him no matter how long he waited.

[Understood. First: fusing the Sword Embryo Heart!]

Su Jue closed his eyes, carefully sensing the changes within his body.

Suddenly, a warm current flowed through his meridians, eventually converging upon his heart.

The next moment, his steadily beating heart abruptly stopped.

Su Jue's pupils contracted sharply as an indescribable feeling of despair surged from his chest.

Pain swept through his mind. Before Su Jue could react, his heart resumed beating.

But when Su Jue used inner vision to examine his body, he found that his heart was no longer crimson.

Instead, it was a transparent white—crystalline and lustrous, like a work of art.

This was the Sword Embryo Heart!

With each beat of this white, translucent heart, an imperceptible energy expanded through his meridians.

And wherever this energy reached, his meridians grew stronger bit by bit, spiritual power flowing more smoothly and robustly!

He could clearly feel that even without actively cultivating, his spiritual power would never run dry. At a certain point, it would break through on its own!

It was like an auto-cultivation cheat. He didn't need to do anything—just idle, and he would grow stronger and level up!

But that wasn't even the most outrageous part.

Su Jue could sense that the Sword Embryo Heart was extremely sensitive to swords.

He drew out the Snow White Sword his master had given him. The moment he gripped the longsword, his body changed again.

The Sword Embryo Heart was directing all the spiritual power throughout his body to flow toward his sword hand.

This was utterly terrifying.

No matter how strong a cultivator was, unconsciously mobilizing all the spiritual power from every part of their body and concentrating it in one place was extremely difficult.

One would need to reach the Emperor realm at minimum to achieve this.

For example, if Su Jue's sword could shatter a boulder before, now a single strike could shatter at least three boulders—or even more.

The Sword Embryo Heart's enhancement scaled with his overall strength.

Already possessing the Supreme Sword Physique with exceptional cultivation talent, Su Jue had developed emotional immunity to special physiques.

Yet this Sword Embryo Heart had truly shocked him!

He could cultivate even while sleeping. A casual swing could unleash three times his previous power.

Terrifyingly impressive!
