Chapter 5: Ten Years of Patience—The Long Sword Finally Unsheathes

The next day.

Bai Ruxue slowly awakened. She lifted her head slightly to gaze at the peacefully sleeping youth before her, feeling both shy and sweetly content.

At her level of cultivation, she no longer needed sleep and could abstain from food indefinitely.

But to prevent her cultivation from going astray, Bai Ruxue would occasionally eat and rest as normal.

Today, however, was the most peaceful and restful sleep she had experienced in many years.

Lying against the young man's chest, listening to his strong, steady heartbeat, Bai Ruxue felt warmth spreading through her heart.

So this was what love felt like. It really was different.

The two had talked late into the night, eventually falling asleep together without realizing when.

Suddenly, Su Jue's fingers trembled slightly.

Sensing that Su Jue was about to wake, Bai Ruxue quickly closed her eyes and lay motionless in his embrace.

Soon, Su Jue opened his eyes and slowly awakened. Feeling the warmth in his arms, he looked at the "sleeping" Bai Ruxue and smiled.

He gently shook his shoulder. "Master, stop sleeping. The sun's already high."

The shy Bai Ruxue remained still, only her eyelashes trembling faintly.

"If someone's pretending to sleep, I might have to spank them."

Su Jue laughed.

"Impudent disciple, you wouldn't dare!"

Bai Ruxue's face flushed red as she instantly flashed to a spot far from Su Jue.

"Wasn't Master still asleep?" Su Jue said with a smile.

Bai Ruxue snorted and spat, "Hmph, that's none of your business! Impudent disciple—we've only just started dating, and you already want to spank me!"

"Still better than someone who just started dating and sleeps on their partner's chest."

Su Jue said with a half-smile.

"Impudent disciple, don't say that!"

Bai Ruxue's face burned red as she quickly covered Su Jue's mouth.

Su Jue gently kissed Bai Ruxue's soft, fair palm.

"Ah! You impudent disciple!"

Bai Ruxue hastily withdrew her hand, pouting coquettishly.

"No, I'm not an impudent disciple."

Su Jue waggled his finger.

"You still say you're not? What disciple would fall for their master and boldly confess to date her?"

Bai Ruxue glared at Su Jue in exasperation.

Su Jue smiled. "What I mean is that 'impudent disciple' doesn't quite capture it."

"Then what would?"

"Master-chasing impudent disciple!"

"Get out!"

........

The Sword Sect was divided into four peaks.

These were Cloud Sword Peak, Jade Sword Peak, Holding Sword Peak, and Main Sword Peak.

Main Sword Peak was Sect Master Bai Ruxue's residence, and also where Su Jue lived.

The other three peaks each had their own characteristics.

Cloud Sword Peak and Jade Sword Peak were both inner sect.

Cloud Sword Peak only accepted male cultivators, managed by the Grand Elder and Second Elder.

Jade Sword Peak only accepted female cultivators, managed by the Third Elder and Fourth Elder.

Holding Sword Peak housed outer sect disciples, managed by the Fifth Elder and Sixth Elder.

Normally, if nothing required her attention, Bai Ruxue would not appear at the Sword Sect, let alone show herself. Cultivation was her priority.

The Sword Sect's legacy spanned tens of thousands of years, and its system had long been mature and stable. Everyone had their own duties, and the sect endured through the ages.

This was why the Sword Sect had dominated Central Region for so long.

Su Jue returned to Main Sword Peak from the maple forest.

Originally, Bai Ruxue had planned to return with Su Jue, but she was a decisive woman of action.

Her methods were swift and thorough—she always eliminated problems at the root.

With the Grand Elder still scheming, Bai Ruxue feared complications would arise. She needed to resolve this matter immediately.

On Main Sword Peak, a graceful figure was practicing sword dance.

Beneath a tree.

The figure held a three-foot longsword, performing an exquisite sword dance.

Her flowing black hair danced in the wind, white robes billowing elegantly.

Her lithe, curvaceous figure seemed ethereal and transcendent, her flawless face beautiful as a flower beneath the moon.

Leaves occasionally drifted down from above.

She looked like a fairy dancing among flowers—breathtakingly beautiful.

One glance was enough to make anyone lose themselves, forgetting the passage of time.

As the graceful figure stilled her elegant form, this mesmerizing sword dance finally came to an end.

The figure gently smoothed her hair behind her ear, then glanced toward a certain spot, a cold glint flashing in her eyes. "If Senior Brother wants to watch, he can watch openly. Why skulk about?"

Her autumn-water eyes gazed toward a spot behind a cherry blossom tree, as if someone were standing there.

Her longsword gleamed with silver light under the sun.

The thin blade gave off an impression of solidity and sharpness—clearly no ordinary weapon.

Just then, Su Jue emerged from that very spot. He walked toward his residence without looking to the side.

On Main Sword Peak, Bai Ruxue had built him a residence—this was where he lived.

"Stop! I'm talking to you!"

The figure called out sharply.

"Is something the matter?"

Su Jue turned to look at his junior sister.

Because of the plot, he hadn't had much interaction with her. He was afraid of affecting his arrangements.

So although they were fellow disciples, their relationship had always been lukewarm.

Now that he was being so cold and firm with his junior sister, she was probably holding a grudge over his attempt to poison their master. He understood.

But he had no need to explain. Once Master returned, everything would become clear.

"Why did you try to poison Master?"

Lin Qingchen stepped forward and asked.

"Adult matters are none of a child's business."

Su Jue couldn't be bothered with her. He had just received a heap of system rewards that he hadn't yet had time to examine, and he was quite eager.

"You're the child! I'm asking you—why did you try to poison Master? She's been so good to you!"

Seeing Su Jue's flippant attitude, Lin Qingchen grew furious.

"Which eye of yours saw me poisoning Master?"

Su Jue asked.

"Both eyes saw!"

Lin Qingchen pointed at her own autumn-water eyes.

Su Jue smacked his lips. "Must be going blind. Go see the Third Elder—she's skilled in medicine."

"Bastard! Master may have let you go, but I won't!"

Lin Qingchen glared hatefully at Su Jue. She had never imagined that this senior brother she once admired could be so vicious.

He was so handsome, with talent so exceptional that others could only look up to him—yet he had chosen such a path of no return.

"You won't let me go? What can you possibly do to me?"

Su Jue looked at Lin Qingchen with amusement. Body Tempering Perfection—not worth his attention.

Lin Qingchen was indeed a first-rate beauty, comparable to their master. But she was still young, lacking that ethereal, captivating quality their master possessed.

Still, she had her own unique charm—youthful and spirited, like the girl next door.

"Fight me, Senior Brother!"

Lin Qingchen drew her sword, her expression cold.

"Fight? Can you even beat me?"

Su Jue didn't deny that his junior sister's talent was equally extraordinary, but she was no longer a match for him.

Though reaching Body Tempering Perfection at sixteen was genius-level talent, not much inferior to his own.

Due to various circumstances, he had only begun cultivating at fifteen.

As for why—that was simply how the original story went. Su Jue had just followed the script.

At eighteen, he had reached Foundation Establishment Late Stage. The gap between him and his junior sister was considerable.

Being several years younger, a difference in cultivation was inevitable.

Moreover, times had changed. He was a protagonist now too.

When it came to being a protagonist, he feared no one.

Still, he couldn't let his guard down. After all, protagonists typically had the ability to fight above their level.

"We'll find out when we fight. Today, please forgive this junior sister's rudeness, but I must make you pay!"

Lin Qingchen saw that Su Jue was completely unharmed and felt indignant on their master's behalf.

Su Jue hadn't wanted to tangle with her. He was very curious about his rewards. But just then, a voice echoed in his mind.

[Ding! Choice triggered.]

[1. Accept the fight, help junior sister clear her meridians and assist her in reaching Foundation Establishment! Reward: Unknown.]

[2. Refuse junior sister's challenge and leave. Reward: Earth-rank sword technique, Dragon Shadow Three Swords.]

Su Jue smiled. Well, that made things easy.

An Earth-rank sword technique was certainly tempting, but Su Jue was a man who had refused a Heaven-rank sword technique.

He was a true gambler.

His gaze fell upon Lin Qingchen. Suddenly, he found his junior sister quite endearing at this moment.

He had been hiding his true abilities all along, dedicating himself to playing the villain role. It seemed it was time to test what level he had truly reached.

In this moment, he decided to completely drop the pretense.

"As you wish."

A snow-white longsword materialized in Su Jue's hand. He pointed it at Lin Qingchen.

His gaze burned with intensity, sword intent surging.

The long sword unsheathed—that once-famous prodigy who had shaken all of Central Region had returned!

It felt so good to finally let go!

Seeing Su Jue's inexplicable smile, Lin Qingchen's heart wavered, as if she were being watched by a fierce tiger.
