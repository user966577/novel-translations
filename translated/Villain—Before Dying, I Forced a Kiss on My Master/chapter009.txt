Chapter 9: The Sword Sect's Death Ground

Time gradually passed.

Deep into the night.

Just as Su Jue had fully absorbed the system's rewards, a figure appeared in his courtyard.

"Who's there at this hour?"

Su Jue furrowed his brows and pushed open the door, only to find a stunning silhouette suddenly appearing before him.

"Impudent disciple, what are you up to?"

"Holy—!"

Su Jue was startled by Bai Ruxue's sudden appearance and quickly retreated several steps.

"Was that really necessary? Such an overreaction?" Bai Ruxue clicked her tongue.

"Master?!" Su Jue's mouth twitched. He had nearly been scared to death.

Bai Ruxue huffed, "It's me. What's wrong? Can't I come see you?"

Su Jue calmed himself and said irritably, "Of course you can, but Master, could you enter normally next time?"

"Scaring people can actually kill them, you know?"

"Fine. You're complaining about me? Then I won't come next time."

Bai Ruxue huffed in aggrievement and turned to leave.

Her coquettish manner bore no resemblance to the Sword Immortal Empress. She was entirely like a young girl who had fallen in love.

"Wait, Master. Your disciple can adapt—just please enter normally next time."

Su Jue grabbed Bai Ruxue with a smile. After just one day apart, he missed her terribly.

"We'll see how I feel."

Feeling the warmth from Su Jue's palm, Bai Ruxue's pretty face flushed slightly.

She didn't know what had come over her. The moment she parted from Su Jue during the day, his image as he confessed his love to her kept replaying in her mind.

This left her distracted no matter what she was doing, constantly missing Su Jue's handsome face.

So the moment she finished her business and returned to Main Sword Peak, her first priority was finding Su Jue.

The feeling of being in love had Bai Ruxue utterly captivated.

"Please, Master, come in. You must be tired after being busy all day."

Su Jue quickly ushered his master inside, seated her in a chair, and poured her a cup of hot tea.

"At least you know your manners."

Bai Ruxue smiled at Su Jue, her heart warming.

Su Jue smiled slightly, then asked curiously, "Master, how was the Grand Elder matter resolved?"

"Don't mention it. That old hag actually entered the Death Ground!"

Bai Ruxue slammed her palm on the table.

"The Death Ground?"

Su Jue was also taken aback. "I didn't expect her to have such resolve."

The Death Ground was the Sword Sect's place of atonement.

The first Sect Master of the Sword Sect, Sword True Master, believed that no matter what crime one committed, there should always be a chance for redemption.

Thus, if you committed an unforgivable sin, you could enter the Death Ground to repent.

The conditions inside the Death Ground were extremely harsh—one could even say it was a narrow escape from death.

Of ten thousand who entered, not even one might emerge.

However, if you entered and managed to come out, you would be absolved. Everyone would have to let bygones be bygones.

If you couldn't come out, it was simply fate.

As Sect Master, Bai Ruxue couldn't do anything about this even after learning what had happened.

She could only wait quietly for the outcome.

"I underestimated her!"

Bai Ruxue snorted coldly. If the Grand Elder had been one step slower in entering, she would have killed her on the spot.

Su Jue nodded. "Desperate people with no way out will try anything. It makes sense."

"But whether she can emerge—that depends on her own fortune."

Bai Ruxue said viciously, "That old hag better die in there!"

"As expected of Master—even when angry, you're so beautiful."

Su Jue couldn't help but smile at Bai Ruxue, who looked lovely even in her fury.

"Smooth talker!"

Bai Ruxue shot Su Jue a look, though her slightly upturned lips couldn't hide her inner delight.

Su Jue chuckled. "Everyone can say pretty words to everyone, but I only want to say them to Master."

"Impudent disciple, always finding ways to make This Seat blush!"

Bai Ruxue's pretty face grew hot. The flush spread down to her fair, swan-like neck as she spat softly.

"Then if Master doesn't like it, your disciple will stop. Everything according to Master's wishes."

Su Jue spoke earnestly, as if he meant it.

"Don't!"

Before he could finish, Bai Ruxue quickly cut him off.

She wanted Su Jue to be exactly like this. This proved that Su Jue loved her.

If he wouldn't even say sweet words to her, wouldn't that mean he no longer loved her?

"Oh dear, how annoying!"

Seeing Su Jue's knowing smile, Bai Ruxue realized she had been tricked.

"Master is too adorable."

Su Jue gazed fondly at the peerless beauty before him. Having Master was truly the happiest thing about coming to this world.

"Impudent disciple..."

Hearing this, Bai Ruxue's eyes shimmered, her heart sweet as honey.

Standing at the position of Sword Sect Master, she had heard countless flowery praises.

But none of those compliments brought her as much joy as a single word from Su Jue.

Suddenly, Bai Ruxue said somewhat shyly, "Could you stop calling me Master when you say these things? It feels strange..."

"What do you mean?" Su Jue asked.

"It's just that we're both master and disciple and Dao Companions. It feels weird."

Bai Ruxue felt a bit embarrassed. If this got out, both she and Su Jue would be condemned by everyone.

It was indeed morally questionable.

And Su Jue calling her "Master" while saying romantic things felt like a constant reminder of the taboo nature of their relationship.

"I see. But doesn't Master find it exciting?"

Su Jue's eyes lit up with understanding as he asked with a playful smile.

"No. I find it embarrassing." Bai Ruxue bit her lip, her pretty face burning.

"Then what should I call you?"

"Baby? Little Snowy? Sweetie? Darling? Wifey..."

Su Jue tried tentatively.

"Stop, stop, stop! What nonsense is all this!"

These intimate terms of endearment from his previous life left Bai Ruxue flustered and red to her ears.

Baby, Little Snowy, Sweetie?

Where did he get all these strange terms!

"Then what should I call you, Master?" Su Jue smiled helplessly.

"Just keep calling me Master."

After much deliberation, Bai Ruxue decided Master was still best.

At least it sounded safer than those mushy alternatives.

Otherwise, someone who had never experienced romance like Bai Ruxue really couldn't handle such intimate terms—at least not yet.

"Alright then, Master."

Su Jue nodded with satisfaction.

Bai Ruxue huffed, "I really can't do anything with you. Did you deliberately suggest those terms?"

"Truly not, Master. Those are all the appropriate terms your disciple could think of for us."

Su Jue explained with a straight face.

Bai Ruxue narrowed her eyes. "Then how do you know so many strange terms?"

"Tell me—who else have you said them to besides This Seat!"

A woman's intuition was sharp, let alone Bai Ruxue's. One moment she was an adorable master, the next a shrewd detective.

Su Jue quickly explained, "Master, I've been wronged! Since coming to this world, your disciple hasn't dated anyone besides you."

"I only learned those terms from storybooks."

This was true—he really hadn't dated anyone since arriving in this world!
