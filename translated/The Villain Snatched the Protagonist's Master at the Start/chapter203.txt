The Snake Race was divided into numerous territories, each home to a different serpent species. Even the weakest clans had at least one Great Emperor in residence. Stronger factions like the Purple-Scale Serpent and Black Water Serpent boasted Ancient Emperors along with several Great Emperors each, placing them among the Snake Race's elite bloodlines.

As for the Immortal-level cultivators, they remained in perpetual seclusion, rarely concerning themselves with tribal affairs. Even so, they all had their biases. One of the five Immortals hailed from the Black Water Serpent clan, and though he'd been in closed cultivation for ages, his support had undoubtedly benefited his kin. Yu Lan even suspected the bloodline poison that had nearly destroyed her was his handiwork—the Black Water Serpent's royal-blooded chieftain shouldn't have possessed the means to create it on his own.

But suspicions were useless without power to act on them. Before Qin Jiang arrived, Yu Lan had been the strongest fighter in the Purple-Scale Serpent faction, and she was nowhere near the Immortal path.

Of course, that was before.

Qin Jiang and his companions emerged from the mountain range, encountering various serpent clans along the way. The sight of the Purple-Scale Serpent faction moving openly drew astonished stares—clearly, most of the Snake Race hadn't yet heard about what had happened. Some of the smaller clans, eager to curry favor with the Black Water Serpent, were even foolish enough to try blocking their path. Qin Jiang was happy to oblige their death wish.

Word spread rapidly. The entire Snake Race realized that the Purple-Scale Serpent faction had returned, and they'd done so with neither stealth nor apology, sweeping aside several minor clans along the way. Bolder than even the Black Water Serpent at their most aggressive.

Without any attempt at concealment, the group returned to the Purple-Scale Serpent's ancestral territory. In their absence, it had been occupied by other serpent clans, but as the Purple-Scale Serpent faction marched home, every last squatter withdrew in advance.

In the Black Water Serpent clan's dimly lit great hall, the faction's leadership had assembled. The empty seats scattered throughout the chamber told their own grim story.

At the head of the table sat a dark-skinned, powerfully built young man with emerald-green eyes and a sinister cast to his features. He surveyed the vacant chairs, a muscle twitching in his jaw.

"They're all... dead?"

The other leaders flinched. A white-haired elder stepped forward, his hands trembling around a pile of shattered stone fragments. "Chieftain, these are their life tablets. All broken."

The young man stared at the shattered tablets, his expression darkening. This represented the bulk of their clan's fighting strength.

"What happened?" he snarled, slamming his fist on the table. "Four Great Emperors, more than twenty Supremes—all dead? How?"

A beat of silence, then one of the remaining Emperors spoke up. "Mo Yuan sent a message before he died. He said he'd found the Purple-Scale Serpent faction's hiding place. After that... nothing."

Mo Yuan had been one of the Emperors dispatched to hunt Yu Lan. Upon discovering the concealment formation, he'd reported back before leading his forces into the ambush. The result was obvious in hindsight—they'd been little more than target practice for Mo Mo.

"The Purple-Scale Serpent?" The young man's disbelief was palpable. "Impossible. Yu Lan was gravely injured, her bloodline crippled. You're telling me those few Purple-Scale Emperors did this?"

Before he could say more, a commotion erupted from outside the hall. Hurried footsteps preceded a figure who burst through the doors and dropped to one knee.

"Chieftain! There's trouble!"

"What now?" The young man scowled, his irritation mounting.

Everything had been going perfectly. The Snake Race chieftain position was practically in his pocket, and once he found the Purple-Scale faction, he'd even claim their beautiful Empress as his prize. A crippled royal bloodline—he was confident he could handle her.

But now the forces he'd sent to hunt the Purple-Scale Serpent were wiped out, his clan's power was dramatically diminished, and whatever was happening within the Purple-Scale faction remained a mystery. Had Yu Lan not been injured at all? Yet even an Ancient Emperor, powerful as she was, shouldn't have been able to kill them all without a single survivor escaping.

Unless an Immortal was involved. But Yu Lan was still far from that level.

While his mind churned, the messenger kept his head low and delivered the news: "The Purple-Scale Serpent clan has returned!"

"What?"

The young man's expression hardened. They'd returned—and they clearly had the confidence to back it up. His own forces had almost certainly fallen to them.

"Details," he demanded.

The messenger relayed everything he'd learned. With each word, the young man's frown deepened. Not only had they come back, but they'd done so with overwhelming force, crushing several smaller clans along the way. Even more brazen than the Black Water Serpent.

"What gives you this kind of confidence?" he muttered to himself, a growing unease settling in his gut. The situation had spiraled completely beyond his control.

The Purple-Scale Serpent territory. After some quick tidying up, the clan was buzzing with excitement. Being home was a wonderful thing.

As for the Black Water Serpent, they weren't worried anymore. Their Empress and her sister had both latched onto a powerful backer. The Black Water Serpent? Easily handled.

The future was looking bright for the Purple-Scale Serpent clan.

Inside a magnificent palace—the residence shared by Yu Lan and Yu Ru—the two sisters and Qin Jiang settled in. Within the Purple-Scale Serpent territory, the two women reigned as queens.

"Qin Jiang, do you think you can handle the entire Snake Race?" Yu Lan's beautiful eyes held a trace of worry.

No matter how she framed it, Qin Jiang was an outsider to the Snake Race—and he'd already killed quite a few of their members. Even if he'd done it to help her, the Snake Race would inevitably hold it against him. The disdain of ordinary serpent clans was manageable, but the Snake Race had five Immortal-path cultivators, and one of them hailed from the Black Water Serpent clan. After Qin Jiang's people had wiped out most of the Black Water Serpent's forces, that Immortal wouldn't simply let the matter rest. The other Immortals would likely support their own kind as well—they might even unite against him. Against Immortal cultivators, the Purple-Scale Serpent faction had little to offer Qin Jiang.

"Five Immortals?" Qin Jiang smiled calmly, confidence radiating from him. "Just sit back and wait to be crowned Empress."

Right now, Yu Lan was only the Empress of the Purple-Scale Serpent faction. But with Qin Jiang backing her, claiming the entire Snake Race shouldn't be much of a problem.

His confidence put her somewhat at ease. Her red lips parted softly. "I don't need to be Empress of the whole Snake Race. I just want you to be safe. If things go south, we can leave. Even without the Snake Race, we'll be fine."

She was worried he'd dig in against the Snake Race for her sake. She needed him to know—she was willing to leave. As long as she could be with Qin Jiang, nothing else mattered.

"Relax," Qin Jiang said with a smile, taking her hand. "I know what I'm doing." He paused. "By the way, that bloodline poison—is there any residual left?"

"Huh?" Yu Lan blinked, then blushed, her voice going soft and sweet. "I... I think there might be a little."
