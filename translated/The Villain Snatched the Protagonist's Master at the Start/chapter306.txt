Chen Qi'er's face fell. He couldn't even have his dying wish?

Fighting through the agony, he turned to look at Chen Changsheng. Since losing his manhood, something had been shifting inside him — a gradual transformation that only needed one final push. And Qin Jiang had provided exactly that. Being forced together with Chen Changsheng had given him an experience that, while mortifying, had stirred something he hadn't expected — something with disturbingly little anger behind it. Under normal circumstances, he might have buried it. But now, facing death, he wanted to let go completely. Just once.

Yet even that was denied.

He gazed at Chen Changsheng, eyes filled with regret. "Changsheng... I'm sorry. I can't give you another round."

Chen Changsheng vomited.

Qin Jiang broke out in goosebumps. Liu Shuwan and Chen Baizhe buried their faces in his arms, bodies stiff, burrowing into his chest. They couldn't look. They couldn't listen. The nausea was overwhelming. Only the warmth of Qin Jiang's presence kept them from losing their own meals.

"Just do it already," they urged in unison.

It was the first time either of them had ever been this eager to see someone die.

Qin Jiang, at least, was unruffled. He'd dealt with Ye Xuan back in the Qin Domain, and that one had been even worse. But his women were on the verge of retching, so Chen Qi'er's time was up.

The force imprisoning Chen Qi'er spiked.

"Ah!" He let out one final howl as his body burst apart. With his last breath, he managed: "Changsheng... I'll wait for you. On the road to the Yellow Springs, we'll continue where we—"

The words died with him. His body detonated into a cloud of blood mist, his Primordial Spirit extinguished. A law surged free, captured by the Myriad Dao Stone. The system chimed, but Qin Jiang ignored it for now.

He turned to Chen Changsheng.

Chen Changsheng was somewhere between numb and terrified. Qin Jiang's refusal of Chen Qi'er's request had been a relief — but that final declaration...

Waiting for him on the road to the Yellow Springs.

He was now genuinely afraid to die. Because dying meant being on the receiving end again, forever.

"Your turn."

Qin Jiang's eyes gleamed. His Reincarnation Law — he'd nurtured it for so long. Harvest time at last.

Despair settled over Chen Changsheng like a stone. Chen Qi'er was dead. If someone that powerful couldn't survive, he had no chance whatsoever. He looked at Qin Jiang, and the hatred in his eyes slowly drained away, replaced by a weary calm.

"The victor takes all. You've won."

Ten lifetimes. His composure was genuine — it was only the recent cascade of humiliations that had cracked his foundation. Now, facing death, there was nothing left to say. He just wanted it to end. He was tired. So unspeakably tired. Ten reincarnations of struggle, and it all came to this.

He closed his eyes and let his body go slack, waiting for the end.

Qin Jiang hurled the Myriad Dao Stone.

Chen Changsheng's eyes snapped open, pain twisting his features. His Reincarnation Law — the power born from ten lifetimes of death and rebirth — was being ripped out of him. He stared at Qin Jiang. "You're after it!"

The Reincarnation Law was his ultimate trump card. Fully matured now, it could grant him a new life even after death. His show of acceptance had been a ploy to lower Qin Jiang's guard. He'd planned to die, then be reborn in secret — grow quietly, develop in the shadows, and return only when he was truly strong enough to destroy Qin Jiang.

But Qin Jiang was stripping the Reincarnation Law from his body.

'He knew I had it? From the very beginning?'

Panic flooded Chen Changsheng's face. Without the Reincarnation Law, death was final. He clenched his jaw and fought to suppress the extraction.

Qin Jiang snorted and slapped him across the face. Stars exploded behind Chen Changsheng's eyes, and the Reincarnation Law resumed its separation. He thrashed desperately — in ten lifetimes, he'd never encountered anything this bizarre. An ability that could forcibly extract another person's dao law?

Qin Jiang restrained him with one hand and drove the Myriad Dao Stone with the other. Before long —

"No!" Chen Changsheng roared, spewing blood. His aura collapsed, his cultivation plummeting.

Qin Jiang caught the returning Myriad Dao Stone. The Reincarnation Law rested inside, quiet and complete. "Finally mine."

He looked at Chen Changsheng and smiled approvingly. "Well done. In such a short time, you matured my Reincarnation Law beautifully."

Chen Changsheng coughed up another mouthful of blood. He stared at Qin Jiang in horror. This time, the despair was real. His trump card — stolen.

He took a shuddering breath, eyes darting. He had nothing left. But he didn't want to die.

"Qin Jiang — you can't kill me!"

An idea struck him. Chen Qi'er had had a sister at Qin Jiang's side. And Chen Changsheng himself — his previous life's disciple was also one of Qin Jiang's women. He just hadn't had the chance to reveal himself. If he could tell her the truth, then perhaps, if he lowered his head sincerely, he might survive.

Linglong didn't yet know that Chen Changsheng was her former master. As long as he stayed alive, there was hope. This, Chen Changsheng believed with every fiber of his being.

Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed. He saw through the gambit immediately. Linglong still had no idea, and by now, she'd practically forgotten her search. Even if she learned the truth, she'd stand by Qin Jiang without question. But unlike Chen Baizhe, there'd been no gradual process — no clean break. If Linglong found out, she'd probably plead for his life. And that would be messy.

Better to keep her in the dark. Better to leave her with a vague, fond memory of a master she never found. As long as Chen Changsheng died and Qin Jiang kept his mouth shut, no one would ever know.

What no one knows doesn't exist.

Chen Changsheng was not Linglong's master.

The logic was flawless.

A brilliant smile spread across Qin Jiang's face. Chen Changsheng's heart lurched. He opened his mouth to say something — but his face was already contorting. The next instant, his body exploded into a crimson fog.

In his final moment, he caught a glimpse of Qin Jiang's mocking eyes.

'He knew. He'd known who I was all along.'
