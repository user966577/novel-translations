Seeing Black Dragon's composure, Zhao Sheng snorted. "What does it matter that the Great Emperor is gone? Right now, my strength is enough to crush you—unless you can unleash that attack from before. Can you?"

He spoke with contempt, but his tone was also probing. That earlier blast had nearly obliterated the Great Emperor. Even in his current state, Zhao Sheng knew he couldn't survive something like that.

Black Dragon smacked his lips with theatrical regret. "That kind of power? No, I really can't use it again."

The Immortal King Killing Formation needed recharging—a lot of energy, in fact. Qin Jiang's Taotie Divine Body made recharging trivial, but Black Dragon didn't have that luxury. After a single use, the formation needed significant time to recover. It was definitely spent.

Zhao Sheng relaxed slightly. Looking at Black Dragon's group, confidence and killing intent crept into his eyes. These people had caused all of this. Without them, he'd already have the Immortal Emperor's legacy.

His aura surged, pressing down on Black Dragon's group with genuine weight. They felt the pressure. But Black Dragon remained calm. He looked at Zhao Sheng with an easy smile. "That attack from before is off the table, sure. But I've got something even stronger. Want to test it?"

Zhao Sheng's heart skipped, but he forced a sneer. "Trying to scare me?"

Outwardly dismissive, inwardly alert. He watched as Black Dragon slowly raised his arm. Zhao Sheng's attention locked on completely, every muscle taut. Then Black Dragon grinned—and swung his hand down.

Zhao Sheng's whole body flinched. All his borrowed power erupted defensively.

Nothing happened.

"Ha! Got you!" Black Dragon roared with laughter.

Zhao Sheng's face flushed crimson. He'd actually flinched. He took a deep breath, suppressed his fury, and clenched his fists. No more talking. Time to fight.

And that was when two silent attacks slammed into his back.

Blood sprayed from his mouth—mixed with fragments of ruptured organs. His face went deathly pale. He turned and saw his attackers: Liu Xing's two True Immortal companions.

"You..." His hand trembled as he pointed at them, face blank with disbelief. Why would they attack him? They were Liu Xing's friends.

Having landed their blow, the two didn't press the attack. They flickered to Black Dragon's side and bowed. "Boss."

"Well done." Black Dragon nodded.

He looked at Zhao Sheng. That single strike from behind had devastated him. His borrowed power was finished—he couldn't use it anymore. Not unless he wanted to die.

Zhao Sheng's expression glazed over with bewilderment. What was happening?

"So—how about that? The backstab. Now that's a powerful technique, wouldn't you say?" Black Dragon sneered.

The mockery hit like a physical blow. Fury churned Zhao Sheng's blood, and another mouthful sprayed from his lips. His body swayed, on the verge of collapse.

Liu Xing darted over and caught him. He turned toward the two True Immortals, face twisted with shock and outrage. "What are you doing?!"

"Tch. You really thought being called 'bro' made you our boss? Know your place."

The two sneered dismissively. Liu Xing's eyes went wide. He raised a trembling hand, pointing at them—then coughed up blood himself, as though the rage had overwhelmed him.

"Liu Xing!" Zhao Sheng's face creased with worry and guilt. For a moment, he'd suspected Liu Xing was one of them. But seeing Liu Xing's reaction now, he'd been wrong—again. He kept doubting the one person who'd been loyal to him. He silently swore never to doubt Liu Xing again.

Liu Xing wiped the blood from his mouth. "I'm alright. How about you?"

"I'll live." Zhao Sheng shook his head and glanced toward the Immortal Emperor's legacy, resentment burning in his eyes. "But that power is gone. I can't use it anymore."

Without his ancestor's strength, he had no chance of competing for the legacy. Liu Xing, meanwhile, exhaled with quiet relief. If Zhao Sheng could still use that power, Liu Xing would've had to be the one to backstab him next. Good thing it was spent. He could save his own betrayal for another day.

"The legacy is lost, I'm afraid," Liu Xing said, his voice heavy with regret.

Zhao Sheng nodded bitterly. The two of them were no match for Black Dragon's group.

"Still thinking about the legacy?" Black Dragon's cold voice cut in. "What you should be worrying about is staying alive."

His aura crashed down on them. Zhao Sheng's blood ran cold. He was right—survival, not the legacy, was the priority now. Black Dragon advanced, step by step.

Zhao Sheng's expression shifted rapidly before he spoke through gritted teeth. "Take the legacy. Let us leave. Otherwise, I'll drag you down with me even if it kills me."

"You? With what?"

"That power isn't completely gone. Want to find out?" Zhao Sheng bluffed.

In truth, he could still tap into the ancestral power—but his body couldn't survive it. Forcing it would mean certain death. Black Dragon stopped, brow furrowing, seemingly wary.

Seeing this, Zhao Sheng pressed his advantage. He released a burst of aura, biting down against the searing pain that ripped through his body. He held the bluff, teeth locked, refusing to show weakness.

Then the legacy space began to tremble violently.

Liu Xing's face brightened. "The Heavenly Waters Great Emperor is gone—this space can't sustain itself. Once it collapses, we can escape."

The tremors intensified until, at last, the legacy space shattered entirely. Everyone was expelled back into the main Immortal Emperor secret realm.

"Run!" Without hesitation, Liu Xing grabbed Zhao Sheng and bolted. The legacy was a lost cause. Survival came first.
