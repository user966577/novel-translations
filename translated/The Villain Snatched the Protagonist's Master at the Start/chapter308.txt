In the system display, the Fortune Black Dragon had reverted to its golden disguise and was snoring contentedly again. Qin Jiang studied it for a moment, then shrugged. Appearance didn't matter as long as it was useful — and on the surface, it still looked like a perfectly normal little golden dragon.

"Fine. Let's see the actual rewards."

The image faded, replaced by the list of rewards for killing the Children of Destiny. There was a lot.

The first item was three immortal-path laws — pure ones, adaptable to any cultivator and convertible into whatever element suited them best. Combined with his existing stockpile, he now had seven total: three from the earlier harvest, these three, plus the one extracted from Chen Qi'er.

Chen Qi'er's law was formidable: the Martial Dao Law. It was universally compatible yet extraordinarily difficult to master — requiring an absolutely indomitable dao heart and an unyielding will to forge ahead. Chen Qi'er had walked that path from ordinary mortal to Human Immortal on sheer determination alone, which was how he'd truly comprehended the law. But his repeated encounters with Qin Jiang had shattered that spirit, crippling his progress.

Qin Jiang had no intention of giving this one away. It was theoretically available to anyone but practically suited to no one — only a Child of Destiny could realistically walk this road. For everyone else, the ceiling was too low. The slightest waver in conviction could permanently block advancement. Too risky for his people. Better to save it and one day gift it to some future Child of Destiny with a fragile dao heart — let the law's impossible demands destroy their path from within.

He stored the three pure laws in the Myriad Dao Stone and continued browsing. Immortal pills, immortal herbs, immortal artifacts — he skimmed past them all. Too ordinary to warrant excitement.

"Hm? Leadership Charisma? What's that?"

【Leadership Charisma enhances the host's natural presence as a leader. Those who submit to the host will be 100% incapable of betrayal.】

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. Zero chance of betrayal?

【The host should note: the 100% guarantee only applies to those who have genuinely submitted to the host.】

Fair enough. But surely everyone under him had submitted?

【Through Leadership Charisma, the host can view a list of all who have submitted.】

He pulled it up immediately. Names filled his vision in dense columns — including every single one of his women. All present and accounted for.

He grinned. 'My prowess truly knows no bounds.'

Beyond his wives, Black Dragon was listed, as was Little Xu the Void Beast, many Qin family members, Chaos District residents, and even An Xihe's five Human Immortal subordinates. The number of people who'd submitted to him was considerable. A quick scan confirmed that everyone close to him was on the list.

"Not bad at all."

He moved on. Another reward caught his eye: the True Spirit Slave Seal. "A slave brand?"

【Yes. The True Spirit Slave Seal can forcibly enslave anyone, with no method of removal. Only complete soul annihilation can release the seal. Even reincarnation will not erase it.】

"That's brutal."

First Leadership Charisma — ensuring those who submitted would never betray him. Now a slave seal — for those who wouldn't submit willingly, forced servitude with no escape clause. The message was clear: everyone bends the knee, one way or another.

Submit, and your loyalty becomes permanent. Refuse, and the seal handles it.

'Perfect.' Qin Jiang loved making friends, and these two rewards ensured every friendship would last forever. With his plan to establish a proper faction after An Xihe's breakthrough, these tools eliminated the greatest organizational risk: internal rebellion.

History's great powers had all fallen to infighting. He would never have that problem.

He continued scrolling. Treasuries, cultivation methods, immortal spiritual veins — practically everything needed to build a faction from scratch. The system knew him well.

And at the very end: ten immortal warships. Massive vessels capable of traversing the Chaos at speeds rivaling immortal-path cultivators.

"Useful for expansion." Once An Xihe broke through, Azure Cloud Heaven would effectively be his. But it was in rough shape — the spiritual energy drain had done real damage. The other Nine Heavens, however, were ripe for the taking. Resources, populations — the foundations of power. The warships would be essential.

'Start small. Conquer the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Become king of this corner of the universe.'

"Still, ten ships isn't many."

【Each warship is enormous. Ten of them could pack half of Azure Cloud Heaven.】

"That big?" Qin Jiang was genuinely surprised.

The system replied with a note of pride: 【This system's rewards are always premium quality. And if the host needs more, the shop offers additional warships. The host has accumulated considerable Villain Points — spending is encouraged.】

Spending? He actually spent plenty — lingerie, short skirts, heels, various accessories — all with astronomical attrition rates. He restocked every few days. The system's reminder prompted him to check his inventory.

"System, any new products?"

【...】

'Degenerate host.'
