Dao Zhen's mouth fell open. Qing Chan's words left him frozen in place.

'Husband?'

Qing Chan's beauty was legendary, but so was her violence. Among the older generation, who hadn't taken a beating from her at some point? Some still trembled at the mention of her name. And someone had actually tamed this violent woman—a young man, no less.

Recovering his composure, Dao Zhen marveled silently. 'Youngsters these days are something else.'

Still, calling him "Young Master Qin"? Wouldn't that be demeaning? He was a True Immortal, for heaven's sake.

"Ahem—so you're Immortal Qing Chan's husband. My apologies for the discourtesy. How about this: we'll be brothers. You call me 'big brother,' I'll call you 'Brother Qin.' Sound good?" He coughed with a smile.

Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed. He turned to Qing Chan. "Between you two, who has higher seniority?"

"..."

Dao Zhen's smile froze. 'Is he trying to make me call him "big brother"?'

Qing Chan understood immediately and almost laughed. But she shook her head. "That old fossil has the highest seniority in all of Azure Cloud Heaven."

While her strength was comparable, in generational standing, she was considerably junior.

"No problem, then." Qin Jiang smiled. "Big Brother Dao Zhen—what an honor. Truly."

"Ha ha... the honor is mine..." Dao Zhen laughed dryly.

The inner sect selection was underway, though without any advance planning, the leadership was still huddled together debating how to structure the exam. The guests watched in disbelief. 'They're making this up as they go?'

Before they could reach a decision, Dao Kun and the other elders looked up. A massive traveling palace was approaching in the distance. Recognizing the insignia, the crowd stirred.

"The Azure Lotus Divine Palace—they actually came!"

Dao Kun's eyes narrowed. He flickered forward, appearing before the palace. Three figures stood atop it—Qin Jiang, Qing Chan, and Dao Zhen. Seeing the ancestor, Dao Kun relaxed slightly.

"Junior Dao Kun greets the Ancestor. Greetings, Immortal Qing Chan."

At the sound of his voice, the visiting sect leaders were stunned. Qing Chan had come in person? And the Human Dao Sect ancestor was with her? Two True Immortals.

In the crowd, Chen Changsheng's expression darkened. 'The Azure Lotus Divine Palace is here? Their ancestor, no less.' He looked up at the palace, unease gnawing at him. He knew Qin Jiang had deep ties to the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. If Qin Jiang was here too...

He tensed. Ever since their paths first crossed, every encounter with Qin Jiang had ended in crushing defeat. The man had become a psychological shadow.

Dao Kun leapt aboard the palace and soon reappeared with someone at his side. Chen Changsheng's heart lurched. That silhouette—he'd know it anywhere.

"Qin Jiang!"

He ground his teeth. Of course. 'I worked so hard just to get a foothold in the Human Dao Sect, and this bastard shows up already standing beside the Sect Master. Why? What makes him so special?'

Jealousy gnawed at him.

"Ha ha ha! Today, our Human Dao Sect is honored to host the Azure Lotus Divine Palace!" Dao Kun laughed heartily, then gestured toward Qin Jiang. "Allow me to introduce our distinguished guest—the husband of Immortal Qing Chan and a close friend of our sect's Ancestor—Young Master Qin Jiang! Everyone, please welcome him!"

Dead silence.

The two titles preceding the name short-circuited every brain in the audience. Qing Chan's husband? The Human Dao Sect ancestor's close friend? This young man? Then it clicked. Qin Jiang—the man who'd slain the Ghost Immortal at the Heavenly Pill Palace. A collective shudder ran through the crowd, then thunderous applause. This was not someone you wanted as an enemy.

Chen Changsheng stood frozen. He'd assumed Qin Jiang had at most seduced Ning Xue'er, which would explain the sabotaged pill. But this—he'd been thinking too small. Qin Jiang had secured Qing Chan herself. A True Immortal. The kind of being Chen Changsheng didn't even dare covet.

'Why? HOW?'

His jealousy flared. He was certain he was Qin Jiang's equal in everything—except appearance. But surely a True Immortal wouldn't care about something as superficial as looks? Inner strength was what truly attracted people.

'Hmph. Shallow!'

He glared at Qin Jiang and thought of the women surrounding him, his expression twisting. 'Women are all shallow! What's so great about a pretty boy?!'

The applause continued until Qin Jiang raised a hand. He smiled, sweeping his gaze across the crowd.

"I'm honored by Sect Master Dao Kun's invitation to preside over this year's inner sect selection. From this point forward, the examination will be under my supervision. Let the trials begin!"

An outsider running their exam was unusual, but with Qing Chan's backing, the Human Dao Sect was happy to oblige. It was just an inner sect selection—nothing critical. They'd been struggling to come up with exam content anyway. Letting Qin Jiang handle it saved them the headache.

The candidates tensed with anticipation. Joining the inner sect was their dream.

Chen Changsheng wavered. With Qin Jiang personally running the examination, did joining the inner sect even matter? The gap between them was staggering—Qin Jiang was presiding over the exam, while he was just another candidate.

'Get into the inner sect first. The two great powers can't be that close.' He steadied himself. The three powers maintained distance; any two growing too cozy would alarm the third. This alliance couldn't run deep.

He touched his altered face. He'd changed his appearance slightly and was using a different name. Qin Jiang shouldn't be able to recognize him. Thank the heavens for that foresight. Otherwise, with Qin Jiang in charge, he'd never make it through.

As everyone waited, inner sect disciples brought out stacks of registration lists. Nearly a hundred thousand candidates. They'd accept a few hundred at most.
