The thunderous roar echoed like a clap of lightning.

Everyone in the city looked up in terror, gazing at the palace-carriage with reverence and fear.

Black Dragon's expression was arrogant. He let out a cold snort, and a ferocious pressure burst from his body, engulfing the entire city. In an instant, it felt as though the heavens themselves were pressing down.

Countless people dropped to their knees, trembling.

Xiao family estate.

The clan members' eyes were glazed with unease.

Patriarch Xiao An led a group of elders out of the estate in a hurry. He'd already spotted the character "Qin" on the palace-carriage, marking the visitors' identity.

"Xiao An of the Xiao family welcomes the esteemed members of the Qin family."

His heart was filled with anxiety.

Although his son had an engagement with the Qin family, the gap in status between the two families was immense. Moreover, the engagement had been arranged by the old patriarch of the Xiao family, who had since passed away.

He couldn't be certain the engagement was still valid.

Especially considering his son's talent...

He sighed inwardly. Best not to dwell on it.

Qin Jiang looked down at Xiao An, his gaze appraising. So this was Xiao Fan's father.

His cultivation was pitifully weak.

He couldn't even fly through the air.

Qin Jiang had no intention of descending. He planned to break off this engagement right here, in front of the entire city.

"Is Xiao Fan present?"

Qin Jiang spoke.

His voice carried spiritual energy, traveling far.

Xiao An glanced back. His son wasn't there. He hastily replied, "My son has been diligent since childhood. He's still cultivating at the moment. I'll send someone to fetch him immediately."

As a family within Qin territory, when facing members of the Qin family, they typically referred to themselves as subordinates.

They were essentially a vassal family of the Qin clan.

Hearing this, Qin Jiang said nothing. Xiao An immediately sent someone to find Xiao Fan.

At the same time, he stole a glance at the palace-carriage and mustered up his courage. "May I ask what business you have with my son, my lord?"

Qin Jiang couldn't be bothered to respond, giving him no face whatsoever. Xiao An didn't dare press further.

Soon, Xiao Fan was brought over.

"My lord, my son is here."

Xiao An announced.

Qin Jiang looked down. He was quite familiar with Xiao Fan—he'd seen him countless times in the system's spoilers.

Qin Lian'er also glanced over, then immediately wrinkled her nose in disgust.

"He's so ugly."

At this moment, Xiao Fan still looked confused, not understanding why he'd been summoned.

"You're Xiao Fan?"

Qin Jiang looked at him. Xiao Fan raised his head, his expression resolute, neither humble nor arrogant.

"That's right."

The moment his words fell, an overwhelming force enveloped him. Black Dragon's cold voice rang out.

"Disrespecting the Young Master is a punishable offense.

"Kneel and slap yourself!"

Such tremendous power was naturally beyond Xiao Fan's ability to resist. His legs buckled, and he crashed heavily to the ground.

His expression instantly filled with rage.

Xiao An was also startled, but he didn't dare oppose the Qin family. Especially since...

Young Master? The visitor was the Qin family's Young Master!

He swallowed hard. He had a vague idea of what was happening, and a flash of anger passed through his eyes. But he didn't dare voice it.

Taking a deep breath, he bowed slightly. "My son is foolish and didn't know the Young Master had graced us with his presence. This subordinate apologizes on his behalf. I beg the Young Master to show mercy."

"Very well."

Qin Jiang nodded. But before Xiao An could feel relieved, he continued, "However, his offense against me shall be punished by you on his behalf.

"No need to be too harsh. One slap will do."

Xiao An's body went rigid.

Fury welled up inside him. His fists clenched tight. Although Xiao Fan's talent was mediocre, he doted on his son immensely and had never laid a hand on him.

"Patriarch, don't be rash."

Behind him, an elder whispered.

Xiao An kept his head lowered, his heart torn with conflict. He didn't dare offend the Qin family for fear of bringing disaster upon the entire Xiao clan. But to strike his own son...

Just as he struggled with the decision, a crisp slap jolted him awake. Following the sound, he saw a palm print forming on Xiao Fan's face—and Xiao Fan's own hand was still raised.

Xiao Fan had slapped himself.

He lifted his head, his expression ice-cold. "Is that enough?"

Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed. This Child of Destiny was ruthless. He chuckled lightly and shook his head, pointing at Xiao An.

"I said I wanted him to slap you.

"With your pathetic strength, you couldn't even kill a fly with that slap."

His voice dripped with mockery.

Xiao Fan's body trembled. His strength was a sore spot, and hearing Qin Jiang's ridicule, a flash of hatred flickered through his eyes.

Xiao Fan struggled to his feet and knelt before Xiao An.

"Father."

His meaning was clear—he was offering himself to be struck.

"Fan'er..."

Xiao An's voice quavered. Looking at the determination in Xiao Fan's eyes, he slowly raised his arm, gritted his teeth, and brought it down hard.

The slap landed on Xiao Fan's face, but the pain struck Xiao An's heart. A collective gasp rose from the crowd.

Xiao An opened his eyes to find Xiao Fan collapsed on the ground.

"Fan'er!"

His heart lurched with alarm. He quickly crouched down.

Watching this scene, Qin Jiang's mouth twitched slightly. This father and son were both ruthless—Xiao An had knocked Xiao Fan unconscious with a single slap.

If not for Black Dragon's pressure restraining Xiao Fan, that blow probably would have sent him flying.

"Tch. Is he really his biological son?"

Black Dragon's eyes went wide.

"Fan'er, my Fan'er!"

Xiao An's voice shook as he kept shaking Xiao Fan. Fortunately, no matter how weak Xiao Fan was, he was still the Child of Destiny—he couldn't be killed by a single slap.

Dazed and disoriented, Xiao Fan opened his eyes.

His cheek was swollen, one eye barely able to open. His speech came out slurred.

"Fa... ther..."

He hadn't expected Xiao An to hit so hard.

He'd nearly blacked out completely.

Seeing Xiao Fan awaken, Xiao An let out a breath of relief. Holding his son, he looked up.

"My lord, can my son be spared now?"

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded.

"Indeed.

"That slap was so vicious, I'm starting to wonder if Xiao Fan is actually some other man's child you've been raising."

Xiao An: "..."

"Alright, time to get to business.

"I came here today for one thing only!"

Qin Jiang spoke.

Xiao An stood, supporting Xiao Fan. "Please speak, my lord."

Qin Jiang looked at Xiao Fan.

"Xiao Fan has an engagement with my sister. However...

"My sister is a peerless beauty with talent that marks her as a heaven-blessed genius. Xiao Fan is unworthy of this engagement.

"Today, I hereby declare this engagement null and void!"

As his words fell, the Xiao family members stood stunned. Throughout the city, people began whispering among themselves.

Countless gazes fell upon the father and son, their expressions varied.

Xiao Fan's face turned ugly. He pushed his father away and looked up at Qin Jiang, his expression twisted with barely suppressed rage.

"The engagement was arranged by our elders! How can you simply cancel it on a whim?"

"We don't have to cancel it."

Qin Jiang smiled calmly. The plot had already begun to change.

His humiliation had nearly driven Xiao Fan to lose his mind.

And this broken engagement was close to shattering him completely.

"Offer up the lives of everyone in the Xiao family in exchange for preserving this engagement. Are you willing?"
