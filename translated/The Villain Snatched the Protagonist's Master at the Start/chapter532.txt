Days of indulgence always seemed to pass too quickly.

After the truth came out, Murong Qing gradually integrated into the group. Eventually, she also accepted being with Xue Yue. Every time the three of them were together, Murong Qing was extraordinarily tense—which drove Qin Jiang to distraction. He found himself thoroughly addicted.

Of course, even while indulging, they couldn't neglect cultivation. The Heavenly Domain passage was drawing closer by the day, and they needed to push hard. Many of the women felt that urgency acutely. They kept pressing Qin Jiang to help them cultivate—nearly draining him dry—and took turns going into seclusion.

The most driven was An Xihe. She was aiming to break through to Immortal Emperor, to ensure that once they entered the Heavenly Domain, she'd have the strength to protect Qin Jiang. She demanded the most from him by far.

Time flew. Only five years remained before the Heavenly Domain passage opened.

During this period, Ning Xue'er successfully broke through to Immortal King. Jian Yao, Mo Mo, Xue Mei, Zi Fu, and Chen Baizhe all entered seclusion to attempt the same breakthrough—they'd very likely succeed before the passage opened. The other women still lacked the necessary foundation and probably wouldn't have a shot at Immortal King in the remaining time.

As for the other Huaxia powerhouses, some had touched the threshold of Immortal King, but without sufficient energy, the breakthrough remained elusive. In all of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, the strongest cultivators were Immortal Kings. Until An Xihe reached Immortal Emperor, Qin Jiang absolutely would not allow any outsider to attempt the Immortal King breakthrough.

One day, An Xihe came to him. "I'm ready to attempt Immortal Emperor."

"Are you confident?" Qin Jiang asked.

She nodded. "About seventy percent."

During this time, nearly all of Huaxia's resources had been channeled toward her breakthrough. Qin Jiang had redeemed numerous treasures from the system. An Xihe's cultivation was now infinitely close to Immortal Emperor.

But even the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands found it difficult to produce a single Immortal King, let alone an Immortal Emperor. Without Qin Jiang, the breakthrough would have been utterly impossible—every resource in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands combined might not be enough to nurture a single Immortal Emperor.

"Seventy percent?" Qin Jiang frowned. "Too low."

To prepare for An Xihe's breakthrough, he had invested the full might of Huaxia. Across all Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, he'd set up a massive formation designed to funnel every available scrap of energy into a single focal point—An Xihe's seclusion site.

But even that wasn't enough. The total energy of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands was simply too meager for an Immortal Emperor.

He dove into the system. His Villain Points were running low—most of them had already been fed to An Xihe. Looking at what remained, he gritted his teeth and converted every last point into treasures that could aid her breakthrough.

He flipped his palm, producing the newly redeemed treasures, and smiled at An Xihe. "With these?"

She stared, wide-eyed. Over the years, the treasures Qin Jiang had produced were each more precious than the last. She'd thought she'd grown immune to surprise. But looking at this haul, she was still stunned. Any single one of these was worth the combined output of an entire heaven—clearly not something the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands could produce. Where on earth did he get them?

Taking the treasures, she said firmly, "With these, I have ninety percent confidence."

"Ninety. Barely acceptable."

She rolled her eyes. Ninety percent was barely acceptable?

He smiled. "Alright. Since you're going for it, enter seclusion now. Time's short. I'll make up the last ten percent."

"Okay~"

She prepared to leave for the seclusion site. Qing Chan and Ning Xue'er, the two Immortal Kings, would guard her, along with all the women not currently in seclusion—their combined strength would prevent any interruption.

Moreover, An Xihe's seclusion site doubled as an excellent cultivation ground. Once the formation activated, all the energy of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands would converge there, and the others could benefit from the ambient overflow.

The chosen site was deep in the Chaos. Qin Jiang had constructed an enormous pillar from Immortal Marrow, surrounded by an ocean of spirit stones stretching as far as the eye could see—an endless glittering expanse.

Stepping into it, one could feel spiritual qi rushing in from every direction. Even without actively cultivating, one's power would rise. The qi practically forced its way into the body.

Qing Chan, Ning Xue'er, and the others spread out through the spirit stone ocean, forming a perimeter around the Immortal Marrow pillar. Every angle was covered—not a single gap. No one could reach An Xihe without alerting them first.

Qin Jiang and An Xihe ascended the pillar together.

"Xihe, what do you think of the setup?" he asked, smiling.

She surveyed the surroundings. Having spent most of her time cultivating, she'd left all the preparations to Qin Jiang. Now, seeing the result, even she was taken aback. "Isn't this a bit excessive?"

"It's fine." He scanned the area and nodded with satisfaction. The spirit stone ocean comprised nearly half of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands' total reserves, and even that hadn't been enough for the Immortal Marrow pillar—he'd had to supplement with system purchases.

This was also the core of the grand formation that spanned the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

"Secluding here should add at least some margin of safety," he said.

An Xihe agreed. The environment was impressive—far beyond what she'd imagined. Of course, raw energy alone wouldn't add much confidence. She turned to him, draped her arms around his neck, and blinked. "Then shall we begin?"

"Huh?"

"Weren't you going to make up that last ten percent?"

He paused. That wasn't exactly what he'd meant by "making up" the last ten percent. But then again... why not?

He looked her over, licked his lips, and pulled her close by the waist. "Then let's get to it?"

"Come on~"

"Heh, I'll make absolutely sure that last ten percent is filled up completely."

Atop the Immortal Marrow pillar, they fell into each other's arms, kissing deeply, oblivious to the world. Before long, the pillar trembled, and their clothes shattered to pieces.

And so, standing atop the pillar in the open sky, Qin Jiang and An Xihe worked on securing that final ten percent—ensuring her breakthrough would be nothing less than a certainty.
