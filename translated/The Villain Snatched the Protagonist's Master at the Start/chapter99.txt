Watching Chu Yuan get tossed out, Qin Lian'er whispered, "Brother, I feel like we're a couple of thugs."

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. "Feel like"? They were thugs—just thugs with money, power, and muscle. At that point, the title needed an upgrade. "Crime boss" was more like it. And the entire Qin family? The syndicate's headquarters. A family operation.

He waved his hand. "We have everything we could want—money, power, the works. We do what we please. Nobody dares criticize the Qin family."

"True," Qin Lian'er conceded, then added under her breath, "You've done so many reputation-wrecking things and nobody's said a word about it..."

Qin Jiang's face darkened. He rapped his knuckle against her forehead. "That's for the Qin family's future generations!"

"Yeah, yeah, sure~" She rubbed her forehead and shot him a look. When he raised his hand again, she ducked away and quickly changed the subject. "Brother, are we going to keep messing with Chu Yuan?"

She pointed at Chu Yuan, who stood swaying in the street, face pale, eyes vacant and seething. He looked like he could keel over at any moment.

Qin Jiang frowned. What kind of Child of Destiny was this fragile? After a moment's consideration, he shook his head. "Forget it."

Given Chu Yuan's current state—practically at death's door—if Qin Jiang kept at it personally, the guy might actually die within days. Better to leave some underlings to handle the ongoing torment. Besides, there was business elsewhere. Lin Chen was ripe for harvesting.

"We're done here. Let's head back."

Back at the traveling palace, the three women were still asleep. Without consulting them, Qin Jiang commanded the Void Beast to depart the Fire Domain.

"Where are we going?" Qin Lian'er asked, noting they weren't heading toward home.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Thousand Year Mountain. A ruins site appeared there—a Great Emperor Ruins, no less. Worth checking out."

The ruins had been discovered by Lin Chen, of course. But a site of this caliber was a public event—the Child of Destiny might claim the lion's share, but everyone else got to pick up scraps. The Qin family, however, was different. A single Great Emperor Ruins? They had the power to claim the entire thing.

When Lin Chen first discovered the ruins, the Qin family Supreme who'd been shadowing him had noticed the anomaly simultaneously and relayed the information back to the Qin family. Qin Jiang had received word shortly after.

Thousand Year Mountain wasn't far from the Fire Domain. Just one day of travel and the Void Beast arrived in the vicinity. The surrounding terrain was an endless plain, broken only by a single towering mountain range stretching over thirty miles—Thousand Year Mountain.

Even from hundreds of miles away, Qin Jiang could feel the oppressive weight of an Emperor's aura. The ruins had already manifested and attracted a swarm of cultivators, though they hadn't yet opened. Standing outside the traveling palace and gazing toward the mountain, he could see the area was packed—dark masses of people blanketing the landscape.

Word of the ruins had been out for less than three days, and already this many cultivators had gathered. The allure of a Great Emperor's legacy was simply irresistible.

"Little Xu, take us straight there," Qin Jiang commanded.

The Void Beast tore through space, its massive form carrying the traveling palace through the sky. In the time it took to say a few words, they'd arrived, the beast hovering directly above the crowd. Its enormous silhouette loomed overhead, radiating immense pressure. The cultivators below bristled with anger at the display of dominance—until a few seasoned observers recognized what they were looking at.

"A Void Beast—that's the Qin family young lord's mount!"

"The Qin family is here? There goes our chance at the main prize."

"Even without the Qin family, we wouldn't have stood a chance. Look around—ancient clan powerhouses everywhere, all here for the Great Emperor Ruins' greatest treasure. A Great Emperor's legacy could help one of these clans produce a genuine Great Emperor."

"The ancient clans must be panicking."

"Can you blame them? Nobody expected the Qin family to quietly produce several Great Emperors. The other clans are probably burning through every resource they have to cultivate one of their own."

Whispers rippled through the crowd.

The cultivators closest to the ruins were ancient clan powerhouses, their expressions far from pleased. They exchanged uneasy glances—the Qin family's arrival had just multiplied the pressure exponentially.

Among the crowd, one figure stared up at the hovering palace with particular hatred. Lin Chen. He'd been the first to discover the ruins, but the manifestation had caused too great a disturbance. He'd only managed to pocket a key that appeared during the emergence before stronger cultivators arrived to investigate. He'd been forced into hiding, blending into the growing crowd to wait for the ruins to open. That key in his possession—he was certain it was critical, likely connected to the greatest treasure within.

"Qin Jiang..." he murmured.

Without Qin Jiang in the picture, he was fully confident he could claim the ruins' grandest prize. But every encounter with Qin Jiang left him with a creeping sense of unease.

Meanwhile, outside the traveling palace, Qin Jiang stood with Fourth Ancestor, both gazing at the ruins on Thousand Year Mountain. Fourth Ancestor let out a sigh. "A Great Emperor Ruins. First one in ten thousand years."

He turned to Qin Jiang. "I'll just go in and bring everything out."

As a Great Emperor himself, Fourth Ancestor could force his way into the ruins despite whatever cultivation restrictions existed.

But Qin Jiang shook his head. "Take the entire ruins instead."

Fourth Ancestor hesitated. Taking everything was certainly possible, but the fallout would be enormous. The Qin family could become a universal enemy. Every cultivator on the continent, united against them, could pose a genuine threat—especially the more powerful ancient clans with their deep reserves. They might not have Great Emperors currently, but their ancestors had been Great Emperors. They surely had Emperor-level trump cards hidden away.

Before he could voice his concerns, Qin Jiang swept his arm outward. Nine Great Emperor Laws materialized, orbiting around him.

Fourth Ancestor's eyes went wide. His entire body trembled—not with fear, but with overwhelming excitement.

Nine Great Emperor Laws. That meant nine Great Emperors.
