That day, Chen Qi'er's search for Chen Changsheng had turned up nothing. In his frustration, he remembered his prospective disciple. Originally, the plan had been to stay at the Human Dao Sect's inner sect, living alongside his sister, and have the boy come to him there. But now...

The thought of his sister made hatred flash through his eyes. He took a steadying breath.

"Better go collect the kid first."

He returned to the ruined temple—but Chen Wuming was gone. His brow creased. Soul power swept across the entire city in an instant, yet there was no trace of the young man.

"Did he go to the inner sect early?"

If so, that could be dangerous. Qin Jiang was still at the inner sect, and Chen Qi'er didn't consider Qin Jiang a decent person. If Chen Wuming dropped his name, Qin Jiang would make the boy pay. He hesitated, then gritted his teeth and headed for the inner sect.

Meanwhile, Black Dragon and Chen Wuming were already at the Human Dao Sect's inner sect, though they hadn't gone to see Qin Jiang. A little beggar didn't warrant an audience with the young lord.

"See?" Black Dragon spread his hands. "There's no 'Chen Qi'er' here."

They'd asked around the inner sect for information on Chen Qi'er. Apart from a handful of people, no one had even heard the name—which meant their inquiries had naturally come up empty.

Chen Wuming's expression darkened. His last shred of trust in Chen Qi'er crumbled to dust.

He turned to Black Dragon, gratitude in his eyes. "Thank you, Senior Black Dragon, for exposing the deception. I'd still be in the dark otherwise."

"Heh. You saved my neck once. Showing you that man's true face makes us even."

Alarm crossed Chen Wuming's face. "You're leaving?"

"Of course." Black Dragon shrugged. "Exposing him was the most I could do. Don't expect me to go head-to-head with the guy."

Chen Wuming's mouth worked silently. Knowing the truth was one thing, but what good was it if Chen Qi'er decided to act? He had no power to resist. Black Dragon was the strongest being he'd encountered—and his only hope.

Watching Black Dragon turn to leave, Chen Wuming clenched his fists and dropped to his knees.

"Senior Black Dragon, I beg you—please save my life."

"Hey. Don't push it, kid."

Black Dragon stepped aside with practiced reluctance. Chen Wuming knelt firm, face resolute.

"I want to live!"

Black Dragon's brow furrowed in a convincing display of conflict. Seeing the hesitation, Chen Wuming's spirits rose. If the man truly couldn't help, there'd be nothing to deliberate.

"Senior, if you save me, I swear I'll repay you with everything I have!"

'No tangible reward, just an empty promise?' Black Dragon thought. But the young lord's mission had to be completed.

He sighed, patting Chen Wuming on the shoulder. "Alright, on your feet."

"You'll help me?"

"Judging by the cultivation method he left you, I alone probably can't handle him." Black Dragon shook his head. "But I serve someone who can."

Chen Wuming's eyes widened. Someone strong enough to deal with Chen Qi'er?

"But to get my boss involved, the favor you did me isn't enough."

Chen Wuming's face fell. His help to Black Dragon had been minor—the man had already repaid it many times over. And this mysterious boss, powerful enough to challenge Chen Qi'er... what could a beggar possibly offer to move someone like that?

"Is there truly no way?"

Black Dragon paused, then cleared his throat. "Well... there might be one thing."

"What?"

"The person I serve has a particular fondness for... beautiful women. If you could present him with a truly exceptional beauty, he'd absolutely help you."

Chen Wuming stared. A beauty? He was a beggar. Where was he supposed to find one? And to catch the eye of a powerhouse like that, she'd have to be extraordinary. He couldn't even get near women of that caliber.

"Nothing else?"

Black Dragon shook his head. "Afraid not. But in the short term, Chen Qi'er shouldn't make his move. Based on that method, he needs to cultivate you first—grow your strength to a certain level before he harvests you."

Chen Wuming's face twitched. So he was livestock being fattened for slaughter.

Black Dragon considered for a moment. "Here's what I'd suggest. When Chen Qi'er finds you again—and he will—pretend you don't know anything. Go along with him, train under him. Someone of his power will inevitably come across rare and valuable things. If something catches my boss's eye, you might just get your chance. What do you say?"

A light went on in Chen Wuming's eyes. He suddenly recalled that Chen Qi'er had mentioned a sister—someone he cherished deeply. If the man doted on her this much, she had to be an exceptional beauty. And Black Dragon's boss liked beautiful women...

Excitement broke across his face. He nodded eagerly.

"That could work! I'm sure I can find something to move your boss!"
