After the initial infighting, the women reunited against their common enemy.

Yan Shiya took point. Unfortunately, the vanguard's combat power left something to be desired. She fell in minutes.

The women exchanged glances and went straight to the human-wave strategy — burying Qin Jiang completely.

Against the onslaught, he didn't bother defending. All-out attack. His endurance was bottomless; he could trade blows indefinitely.

The women's reserves were another matter. One by one, they peeled off as their stamina flagged, immediately replaced by fresh combatants. Wave after wave — no fear, only excitement.

Those who withdrew retreated to the rest area. If a chance arose, they'd rejoin. But Qin Jiang was relentless in pursuit, pressing his advantage against anyone who tried to recuperate. Even with guards posted, the defense couldn't hold — his offensive wasn't something one or two women could absorb.

So even resting, they watched him warily, half expecting his next assault to land on them.

Their paranoia was justified. His eyes drifted their way constantly.

Days bled into weeks. Qin Jiang's output never wavered. The women grew increasingly exhausted — especially after he ambushed the rest area, provoking a chorus of indignant shrieks and accusations of cheating.

A month passed. Qin Jiang remained at full power. The women had given up.

Defeated once more. If only they had more sisters.

But losing was familiar by now — no real bitterness about it. And really, the aftermath was the best part.

"Qin Jiang, my legs are sore~ Rub my legs~"

"Darling, my back hurts~ Come massage me~"

"Hubby~ My feet need attention~"

"Gege~ Hugs~ Kisses~"

They called for him from every direction — legs, backs, feet, cuddles, kisses — keeping him running from one to the next.

He didn't mind. And when fatigue finally caught up, any direction he fell offered a soft, fragrant landing.

Three months in the Space-Time Temple.

The height of earthly paradise.

But Qin Jiang kept his discipline. Between indulgences, he cultivated — paying extra attention to the weaker members of the group.

"Before the Heavenly Domain opens, every one of you needs to advance at least one realm."

The Heavenly Domain was too dangerous. Without sufficient strength, there was no security. Though in truth, their current power would make them a force to reckon with even there. Qin Jiang's standards were simply warped from a lifetime of steamrolling everything in his path.

The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands could sustain up to Immortal King at most. Beyond that, the Heavenly Domain was the only option — and Qin Jiang needed time to build strength quietly after arriving.

"Do I have to break through too?" An Xihe blinked.

The others could manage — with resources, the Space-Time Temple, and motivation, one realm wasn't unreasonable. But she was already Immortal King. The gap to the next level felt impossibly vast. Honestly, it felt impossible, period.

Qin Jiang looked at her with absolute seriousness. "You too. Immortal Emperor."

She stared. "The entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands combined might not have enough resources to create a single Immortal Emperor."

"I'll help you."

"You..." She bit her lip. His Yin-Yang Law did accelerate her cultivation, but even so, the Immortal Emperor threshold was another magnitude entirely.

She ran the math. If the Space-Time Temple ran at maximum acceleration, and she and Qin Jiang spent every waking moment inside, from now until the Heavenly Domain opened...

Maybe. Just maybe.

But spending every waking moment in the Space-Time Temple — she couldn't survive that. And even Qin Jiang, beast that he was, had limits. Not to mention the other sisters would revolt.

She shook her head firmly. "No, no, no! We'd both collapse if we stayed in the Space-Time Temple permanently."

"???"

Qin Jiang blinked, then burst out laughing. "What are you thinking? I meant helping you in other ways — not spending every second doing... that."

"Oh."

Her face went crimson. She caught his teasing grin, glared, and marched over to pinch his side. "What other way could you possibly help me?"

"Ow — ow ow ow!"

He grimaced, prying her fingers loose. She huffed, released him, and rubbed the spot gently before clasping his hand.

"Fine. How do you plan to get me to Immortal Emperor?"

"Resources, obviously." He grinned. "I can give you whatever you need."

"Resources?" She frowned. "Every resource in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands combined still might not be enough."

"How about draining the Origin from all Nine Heavens? That might actually do it."

He rolled his eyes. They were heading to the Heavenly Domain, yes, but plenty of Qin family members couldn't make that trip. Destroying the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands would leave them homeless, drifting through the Chaos.

"The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands stay intact — that's our home base. As for resources..." He squeezed her hand. "Whatever you need, I'll provide."

The system offered plenty of Immortal King-tier cultivation materials. Expensive, but he'd stockpiled a mountain of Villain Points. If he poured everything in, pushing An Xihe to Immortal Emperor was entirely feasible.

An Immortal Emperor would make them a genuine power in the Heavenly Domain. The truly elite cultivators there rarely showed themselves, and Huaxia wasn't exactly without connections.

The Grand Sovereign, after all, was practically his father-in-law.

He hadn't actually met the Grand Sovereign's daughter yet, but Qin Jiang had already claimed the old man as family. If real danger came knocking, that card was absolutely getting played.
