After the training session ended and Mu Lan was thoroughly satisfied, they rested for several days inside the Space-Time Temple before returning to Skyreach City.

The city lords had already assembled and were waiting for Qin Jiang. None dared press the issue—the last thing they wanted was to irritate someone this important. He let them stew for a few days before finally showing his face.

With Mu Lan at his side, he went to meet them. The city lords all knew each other well, so when they spotted Mu Lan standing beside Qin Jiang—clearly playing the role of his woman—their expressions turned peculiar. Gazes drifted inevitably toward the local city lord.

Tieshan showed no reaction to their looks. He stepped forward with a fawning grin, slightly bowing as he gestured toward the group. "Young Master Qin, they're all here."

"Mm." Qin Jiang nodded and swept the room. Besides Tieshan, eight city lords had come. Impressive—Tieshan's network was better than expected. All eight were Immortal Kings. A respectable fighting force.

The city lords, meanwhile, were sizing up Qin Jiang. Recalling Tieshan's description, doubt flickered in their eyes. They'd never personally met anyone of such stature, but they'd heard things—and this young man was just an Immortal King. What kind of VIP was this? Second only to the Grand Sovereign, above even the Grand Sovereign's daughter? That couldn't be right.

Still, without confirmation, none dared voice their skepticism. Tieshan's demeanor alone—the man had given away his own wife—spoke volumes about this stranger's background.

Qin Jiang surveyed them once, then strode to the head of the room and sat down, pulling Mu Lan onto his lap.

Tieshan turned to the assembled lords, his expression sobering. "Gentlemen, allow me to formally introduce him. This is Young Master Qin—a prodigious talent in his own right. But his other identity..." He paused. "He is the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law!"

Stunned silence. The introductory flattery barely registered, but that last part—the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law? The Grand Sovereign had one? Since when?

They stared at Qin Jiang, incredulity plain on their faces. If he truly was the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law, then Tieshan's claim—second only to the Grand Sovereign, above even his daughter—checked out perfectly. But was it possible? The Grand Sovereign had only one daughter. A marriage would have been headline news across the myriad realms, yet they hadn't heard a whisper of it. Had Tieshan been duped?

Under their scrutiny, Qin Jiang remained perfectly composed. He smiled lightly. "What's this? Doubting me?"

The city lords laughed nervously. Skeptical as they were, none dared say so aloud—what if it was true? They waved their hands dismissively.

Qin Jiang shook his head. "No matter. You'll stop doubting soon enough."

They perked up, expecting evidence. Qin Jiang looked at them, the corner of his mouth curving upward.

"Xihe—take them."

Immortal Emperor pressure flooded the hall. Every city lord's face drained of color. In the next instant, crushing force slammed down. The hall collapsed as the city lords were driven to their knees before Qin Jiang.

An Xihe materialized beside him, cold eyes sweeping the room as her aura churned. "Does anyone still doubt my husband?"

The city lords wanted to weep. An Immortal Emperor? And she called him husband? On top of that, they were supposed to believe this woman's husband was the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law? This was pure intimidation—and they were being treated like fools.

But powerless to resist, they scrambled to respond.

"My lord, we never doubted!"

"Absolutely! We believe Young Master Qin is the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law!"

"Without question! We all believe!"

An Xihe glanced at Qin Jiang. He smiled and raised his hand. True Spirit Slave Seals shimmered at his fingertips—all Immortal King grade.

He flicked his fingers. The seals shot into each city lord's mind. Their expressions turned grim as they recognized what was happening—these seals would consume their Primordial Spirits, turning them into his slaves. Without hesitation, they began resisting.

"Xihe, suppress them."

She nodded and acted. The gap between Immortal King and Immortal Emperor was immense—she crushed their resistance effortlessly.

Pinned down, the city lords felt the seals devouring their Primordial Spirits. Fury blazed in their eyes.

"Tieshan! You conspired with an outsider to deceive us!"

"We're all Skyreach City lords! If you enslave us and Skyreach City finds out, do you know the consequences?"

"You traitor! You've betrayed Skyreach City!"

"You'll be hunted across the myriad realms! There'll be nowhere left for you! Use Skyreach City's power to free us—you still have that chance!"

Within a Skyreach City, each city lord could draw upon the city's power, boosting their strength to Immortal Emperor level. But this was Tieshan's city—only he could wield that power.

Tieshan shook his head. He was certain Qin Jiang truly was the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law. The Immortal King Seal was proof, and Qin Jiang held the number-one ranking in the Myriad Realms Tower—a structure the Grand Sovereign himself had created. That was likely how Qin Jiang had become the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law in the first place.

"Gentlemen, Young Master Qin truly is the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law. Your skepticism naturally warrants some... consequences."

Their faces grew uglier. The seals gnawed at their Primordial Spirits, twisting their expressions into masks of agony. Combined with An Xihe's suppression, resistance was impossible.

Mighty Skyreach City lords, reduced to slaves. Rage burned through them—but powerless as they were, that rage curdled into helpless despair.

As the True Spirit Slave Seals completed their work, bitterness crept across their faces.

It was over. From this day forward, they were slaves—completely and utterly.
