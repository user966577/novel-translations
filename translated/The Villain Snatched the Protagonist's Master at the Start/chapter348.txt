Qin Domain.

Formerly the Heavenly Mystery Continent, it had been unified under the Qin family and renamed Qin Domain. The entire landmass now belonged to them.

And the Qin family had earned it. In just a few short years, Great Emperor powerhouses had emerged one after another. A few months ago, they'd even produced an immortal-path cultivator, which crushed the last shred of hope in anyone harboring ill intentions.

The Qin family was untouchable.

Beyond the family itself, nearly every clan across Qin Domain had benefited from the unification. The old Ancient Clans had all produced Great Emperors in recent years, and families allied with the Qin family had prospered even more — the Ye family, the Holy Sword Sect, the Fire Tribe, and even the formerly minor Chen family had skyrocketed in status.

Of course, these families and factions were self-aware. They understood that everything they had was thanks to the Qin family, and their loyalties reflected it. They were, in all but name, vassals.

On this particular day, Qin Jiang's grandfather — the Qin family patriarch, Qin Shanhe — was conducting his inspection tour of Qin Domain. A Supreme-level powerhouse, he represented the family's authority abroad.

At each Ancient Clan he visited, even Supremes and Great Emperors bowed and scraped before him, flattering him to an almost comical degree. The old man kept his expression cool and aloof, but inside, he was preening. He stood ramrod straight, gazing down at the assembled powerhouses with the haughty eyes of a man who owned the world.

Within the Qin family, most members were focused on serious cultivation. Only Grandpa Qin's talent was... somewhat lacking. Mountains of resources had pushed him to the Supreme Realm, but that was his ceiling. So the family's elders had sent him out to "inspect" Qin Domain — code for intimidating any restless clans. He was the advance guard. If someone's attitude was poor, well, they simply wouldn't need to exist anymore.

Not that anyone dared test the waters. Between the Qin family's new immortal-path cultivator and Qin Jiang's name dropping from the Grand Sovereign's own lips, every faction was on their best behavior. They practically wagged their tails.

This delighted the old man immensely. At each clan, he strutted with unabashed arrogance, not deigning to give anyone a second glance. His haul of tributary gifts was considerable. Some clans had even offered women — though he hadn't dared accept those. His wife had come out of seclusion recently and had broken through to Great Emperor. His domestic standing was precarious enough already; accepting women would get his legs broken.

His wife had, however, instructed him to keep an eye out for potential matches for Qin Jiang. The old man hadn't bothered. His grandson was a titan among the Nine Heavens — and apparently, even the Grand Sovereign's daughter was spoken for. What woman in little Qin Domain could possibly be worthy?

He wasn't impressed by any of them.

After finishing his rounds, the old man decided it was time to head home. "That should do it," he murmured. Every troublesome clan had been properly cowed.

Just as he turned to leave, an enormous airship blotted out the sky, barreling straight into Qin Domain from the outer regions. The old man was near the border and spotted it immediately, his brows furrowing. Someone with no respect for Qin Domain's sovereignty?

But before he could get angry, the airship vanished. In its place hovered a magnificent palace, pulled by a creature of staggering size.

Staring at the palace, the old man blinked. "That palace looks familiar. And is that a Void Beast out front? Huge one too — even bigger than Jiang'er's..."

He paused.

His eyes went wide. That was Jiang'er's Void Beast. And that gaudy palace — it was definitely Jiang'er's.

Jiang'er was home?

Joy surged through him. He launched into the air, streaking toward the palace — only to watch the Void Beast dive into a spatial rift. The palace vanished.

The old man froze mid-air, staring at the empty space. Several Qin family attendants appeared beside him.

"Patriarch, what was that just now...?"

Indeed — the old man had reclaimed the title of Qin family patriarch. Qin Hao had long since broken through to Great Emperor and couldn't be bothered with administrative duties, so the elders had unanimously decided to reinstall Grandpa Qin. After all, with his talent, losing some cultivation time was no great loss.

Snapping back to his senses, the old man barked: "Home! Now! As fast as possible!"

Meanwhile, aboard the palace, Qin Jiang and his entourage had noticed movement outside despite traveling through the void. At their cultivation levels, the spatial barrier was transparent.

"I think I saw someone rushing toward us," Qin Jiang muttered. He hadn't paid much attention, though the figure had seemed vaguely familiar.

"There was someone," the women confirmed. "Looked like an old man. He was definitely heading our way — seemed pretty urgent, too. Maybe a Qin Domain inspector trying to intercept us?"

"His cultivation was low. Just a Supreme — hardly what you'd call a powerhouse."

They gazed out at Qin Jiang's homeland with undisguised curiosity. But they didn't get to sightsee for long. The Void Beast burst out of the spatial rift, its Great Emperor-level speed covering the distance from the border to the Qin family estate in under an hour.

"Are we there?"

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile. He looked out at the family compound. Only a few years had passed, but it had changed dramatically — though traces of the familiar remained.

Coming home, the Void Beast was excited too. It let out a roar that shook the estate. Figures shot into the air, appearing before the massive creature.

At the fore stood a graceful woman — Qin Jiang's mother, Li Xueyi. The Qin family's immortal-path cultivator.

When she saw the Void Beast, her eyes lit up with joy. That was Jiang'er's mount.

Jiang'er was home!
