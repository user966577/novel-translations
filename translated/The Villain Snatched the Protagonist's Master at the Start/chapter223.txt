Nearby, Zi Fu had been watching Qin Jiang the entire time, and now she stood frozen in place.

"What's wrong, Zi Fu?" Lian'er asked.

Zi Fu snapped back to reality and pointed toward Qin Jiang, disbelief written across her face. "What he just gave away... I think that was an Immortal Path Law!"

The aura of the Immortal Path—she couldn't have been mistaken. But to just hand over an Immortal Path Law like that... She could barely process it. With an Immortal Path Law, one could break through to the Immortal Path in a fraction of the time. And he'd just given it away. Did this man have any idea what an Immortal Path Law was worth?

Lian'er blinked at her incredulous expression, confused. "Is there a problem?"

"There's no problem?!" Who just handed out Immortal Path Laws, even to their own woman?

"It's just one Immortal Path Law." Lian'er didn't see the issue, nor did she appreciate how precious such a thing was. After all, her brother had already given Immortal Path Laws to Jian Yao and Yan Shiya. And the gifts he'd given Lian'er herself were equally extraordinary—her divine body, a phoenix companion (currently in seclusion), and the Immortal Fire, which she considered the most precious gift of all. On top of that, there were countless smaller gifts she couldn't even count.

"Just?!" Zi Fu's jaw nearly dropped. She looked at the other women, and none of them seemed fazed either—as if this were perfectly normal. "Don't tell me this isn't the first time he's done this."

"Nope," Lian'er confirmed with a nod. "He's given out several already."

Zi Fu's heart lurched. She was on the cusp of the Immortal Path herself, but the time needed to break through would be considerable. With an Immortal Path Law, that timeline would shrink dramatically—and with the Space-Time Temple on top of that...

"Lian'er," she said in a low voice, "if I became your sister-in-law, do you think your brother would give me an Immortal Path Law?"

Lian'er stared. Just one Immortal Path Law, and the woman who'd been so adamant about not liking her brother was already offering herself up? "Probably not," Lian'er said, shaking her head.

Zi Fu bristled. "Why not? I'm not that bad, am I?"

"My brother cares about feelings. If you're only interested in him for the Immortal Path Law, he won't be interested in you."

Zi Fu gazed at Qin Jiang, chin in hand. "Feelings can be cultivated."

Lian'er pursed her lips. Getting on the train first and buying a ticket later—that did sound like her brother's playbook.

The two chatted idly, watching Qin Jiang's relocation. With the women helping enthusiastically, it didn't take long before his enormous house was settled inside the Space-Time Temple. Then, Qin Jiang was swept along by the crowd into the temple.

Liu Shuwan, who wasn't entering seclusion just yet, took charge of maintaining order. Time was plentiful inside the Space-Time Temple, so...

"One at a time," she announced.

Chen Ningbing was first—Qin Jiang had specifically arranged it. Before entering, she flashed Liu Shuwan a smile. "I'm going in first, Wan'er~"

Inside the Space-Time Temple, Qin Jiang was already waiting in his room. When Chen Ningbing appeared, he raised an eyebrow. "Just you?"

"Mhm." She grinned and threw herself into his arms. "Wan'er says you have plenty of time, so we're going one at a time."

Qin Jiang's lips twitched. He had a feeling the days ahead wouldn't be easy. Fortunately, he was built for this, and he'd prepared a generous supply of Kidney Treasure Pills. He should be able to manage.

"So right now, you have to give me your undivided attention," Chen Ningbing said, fire in her eyes. Opportunities to be alone with Qin Jiang were rare, and now she finally had him all to herself.

"All yours." He swept her up. Her teasing had already pushed him past his limits. What followed gave Chen Ningbing a firsthand demonstration of just how terrifying Qin Jiang's true capabilities were. She realized then that it wasn't that he hadn't wanted to be alone with her—she simply couldn't handle him by herself.

"Once I break through to the Immortal Path, I'll definitely overpower you!" She was still defiant.

Qin Jiang chuckled with a veteran's composure. "I'll be waiting for your challenge."

After spending more time with Chen Ningbing, she left to begin her seclusion—the Immortal Path Law needed refining first. After her, the women entered the Space-Time Temple one after another. Outside, Lian'er and Zi Fu watched with nothing better to do. One came out, the next went in, none of them staying very long.

A full day later, Qin Jiang finally emerged from the Space-Time Temple, his complexion slightly pale.

"Brother!" Lian'er called out.

He stretched his jaw and straightened his back, walking over to them.

"Are you alright?" Zi Fu looked at him with genuine concern. Start cultivating the feelings now.

"I'm fine, I'm fine." He waved it off.

Zi Fu had her doubts. The women had been filing in and out all day, each one positively glowing, clearly having enjoyed a wonderful experience. And Qin Jiang... He'd serviced how many in a single day? The fact that he was still walking was impressive enough. Wait—not one day. The time dilation inside the Space-Time Temple was different.

"How long were you in there?" she asked curiously.

"Three months."

Three months. Judging by the steady parade of women, he hadn't stopped the entire time. Zi Fu swallowed hard. The man was a machine.

Her eyes gleamed. That kind of stamina, plus Immortal Path Laws, plus good looks—feelings could definitely be cultivated.

She sidled up to him and took his arm. "You don't look so good. Let me take care of you."

"..."

He eyed her warmly, hesitated a beat, then said, "Alright. I can still keep going."

"???"

"Come on, let's head to the Space-Time Temple—my house is in there."

He moved to pull her along.

"Wait, wait!" Zi Fu panicked, yanking him back. She'd meant emotional care, not a one-way trip to the bedroom.

Qin Jiang turned back, puzzled. Wasn't this her idea? He'd gritted his teeth to soldier on, and now she was backing out?

"I meant I'd take care of you. As in, look after you."

"Sure, let's go to my room then."

They stared at each other. Zi Fu's face turned crimson as she struggled to compute.
