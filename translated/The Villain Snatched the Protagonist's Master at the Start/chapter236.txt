Amid the derision, Chen Changsheng's expression turned cold. His fists clenched. He understood now—the Azure Lotus Divine Palace had already been infiltrated by Qin Jiang, and they were deliberately humiliating him.

Without a word, he turned to leave.

"Wait!"

Ning Xue'er's voice stopped him. Chen Changsheng tensed. He'd already backed down—were they still not satisfied?

He turned to see Ning Xue'er holding up a jade vial, swirling it between her fingers. His Ancient Emperor Pill.

"Our Azure Lotus Divine Palace has a rule: when a courtship is declined, the gift is returned. Here's your Ancient Emperor Pill back."

She tossed the vial to him.

Catching it, Chen Changsheng's brow relaxed slightly. At least he hadn't lost too much. He looked at Ning Xue'er and said flatly, "May I go now?"

"Of course! But do keep that Ancient Emperor Pill safe—pills of this caliber are rare even in the Central Regions. Capable of pushing a Great Emperor to Ancient Emperor, or giving an Ancient Emperor a shot at the immortal path's threshold... if word got out, people would kill for it."

Ning Xue'er said all this with a pleasant smile, casually detailing the pill's effects in front of the entire crowd.

Chen Changsheng's face darkened. Every gaze around him turned scorching, hungry—as if they wanted to devour him alive.

The temptation of an Ancient Emperor Pill was more than enough to drive people to extremes. Especially since the pill's intended users were Great Emperors and Ancient Emperors—and Chen Changsheng was just a Supreme. For anyone at those levels, taking it from him wouldn't even qualify as risky.

Looking at Ning Xue'er's sweet smile, Chen Changsheng gritted his teeth. This woman was a venomous beauty—absolutely ruthless!

His one consolation was that they were still outside the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. The crowd was restless, but the palace's intimidating presence kept them in check. Yet he could feel invisible marks being placed on him—tracking signatures, dozens of them, landing in rapid succession. That told him exactly how vicious the pursuit would be once he left the palace's shadow.

Drawing a deep breath, Chen Changsheng stowed the vial, swept the crowd with a frigid glare, and walked away at an unhurried pace.

People scrambled to part for him, but their eyes never left his back. The moment he was out of the palace's sphere of influence, they would strike.

An Ancient Emperor Pill—even if they couldn't use it themselves, it could be traded for a fortune.

Many suitors abandoned their romantic pursuits entirely and followed Chen Changsheng out. Women? Hmph—they only slow down my sword arm!

The area outside the palace fell oddly quiet while the sounds of battle echoed from the distance.

"Uh... we didn't just get Chen Changsheng killed, did we?" Jian Yao glanced at Ning Xue'er. The Palace Master had sent him off with quite the parting gift.

Ning Xue'er blinked innocently. "If he does die, Qin Jiang won't blame me, will he?"

"..."

The women gave her sideways looks. That tone reeked of green tea—fragrant, fragrant green tea. Come to think of it, the Palace Master's favorite thing was tea. A natural-born talent, this one.

"Have someone keep an eye on things," Jian Yao said. "Rough him up all you want, just don't actually kill him."

Qin Jiang had been watching Chen Changsheng closely for a while now, with plans in the works. They could have their fun, but couldn't break the toy.

Ning Xue'er nodded. "Alright. I'll send someone to monitor. Oh—does anyone need this Ancient Emperor Pill?"

She flipped her palm, revealing a round pill sitting there.

"..."

The women were momentarily speechless. She really had swiped it. The pill hadn't actually been returned at all.

"You swapped it out?"

"Obviously. The pill is useless to me, but it's still valuable. Besides, Qin Jiang has a grudge against this Chen Changsheng—why give it back? I swapped it with an Explosive Pill."

Ning Xue'er's lovely face wore a beautiful smile that sent a chill down the spine.

A woman's heart is the most ruthless, and hers was the proof. She'd humiliated him publicly, set a mob of assassins on his tail, and then slipped a ticking time bomb into his pocket. An Explosive Pill was not for consumption—it literally exploded, violently. The highest-grade ones could even injure a Great Emperor.

Seeing their stunned silence, Ning Xue'er waved the pill. "Anyone want it?"

"Can I have it?" Hu Xian'er piped up, eyes wide and hopeful.

As a Great Emperor, the Ancient Emperor Pill's primary effect—breaking through to Ancient Emperor—was perfect for her. The secondary effect of touching the immortal threshold had negligible odds.

"Of course." Ning Xue'er handed it over with a smile. She hadn't interacted much with the little fox, but Hu Xian'er's genuine innocence was hard not to like. Even Jian Yao and the others doted on her, and Dan Yu always deferred to her.

"Thank you, big sister!" Hu Xian'er beamed, her soft voice sweet with gratitude.

Inside the cottage, Qin Jiang finished getting dressed and opened the door. He looked around—no one in sight.

"They're all gone?"

He closed the door behind Qing Chan and meandered along a path through the flower fields. Oddly, the palace seemed nearly deserted.

"Where is everyone? Did they all get married off?"

One of the Central Region's three hegemons, and there were barely any people inside?

Meanwhile, the palace's residents had noticed him. A grown man wandering freely through the Azure Lotus Divine Palace was a rare sight—possibly unprecedented. And this one was rather handsome.

Their eyes lit up. The bolder ones closed in immediately, and before long, a small crowd of pretty women had gathered around him, chattering with curiosity about his identity.

"Me? I was personally invited by your ancestor. I have special privileges in the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. Any of you girls I take a fancy to? Your ancestor will gift-wrap you for me."

"Liar!"

"Yeah right—our ancestor would never give us away! Though... if you want me, I'd happily go with you~"

"Get lost! The palace finally has a man—why would we let him leave? Stay with us, handsome!"

"Yeah, yeah! Stay, and we'll all take care of you~"

A flock of pretty women threw flirtatious glances his way.

Just as Qin Jiang was thoroughly enjoying himself, a group approached from the other direction.

"The Palace Master's coming—she's here to catch someone!"

"Oh no, she's definitely here for the handsome man! What do we do?"

"We'll protect you!"

"Quick, hide under my skirt..."

"Don't you all fight over him! Hehe, hide under mine—there's a surprise in store~"
