Looking at Yun Bao's pitiful expression, Qin Jiang felt the itch to bully someone again. The soft, pliable ones were the most fun to torment—especially when you made them cry. The downside was they took a while to console.

He cleared his throat and was about to tease her when An Xihe shoved him aside with an exasperated look. "Don't scare her."

"..."

Qin Jiang shook his head helplessly. They weren't even sisters yet and she was already being protective. Couldn't a man indulge his little hobbies?

An Xihe turned to Yun Bao. "Your name is Yun Bao?"

"Mm~"

Yun Bao nodded timidly. This older sister seemed a bit cold. And intimidating.

An Xihe was studying Yun Bao in return—her looks, her figure. With Qin Jiang's personality, there was no chance he'd let this one go. As for the treasure consumption, Huaxia had more than enough to feed a Pixiu. Beyond that, Pixiu weren't just treasure eaters—they could also find treasures and bring good fortune.

Of course, the treasure-hunting duties would probably fall to the other Pixiu. The girl would be... otherwise occupied. When it came to the treatment of men versus women, Qin Jiang's double standard was legendary—especially with one this exquisite.

"Don't be afraid. He won't hurt you. The worst he'll do is sleep with you."

Sensing Yun Bao's unease, An Xihe offered what she presumably considered comfort.

Yun Bao blinked, then looked at Qin Jiang. Her face turned scarlet. She lowered her head, small fingers twisting together, and spoke shyly. "As long as you don't kill my daddy... I can... I can let you."

"Good. Then come with us."

An Xihe said it like it was already settled.

Qin Jiang shrugged from the sidelines. He hadn't needed to lift a finger—his wife had recruited a beauty for him all on her own.

But Yun Bao wasn't the only reason he'd come. There was also Wu Tian. Qin Jiang glanced at the unconscious man lying nearby. "This guy's not dead, is he?"

He'd learned from Black Dragon about Wu Tian's near-death experience and subsequent disappearance. Based on the plot trajectory, Qin Jiang had deduced that Wu Tian most likely ended up with this Pixiu pair, so he'd come directly.

Looking at Wu Tian's wretched state, if the system hadn't stayed quiet, Qin Jiang might genuinely have thought the man had kicked the bucket.

"Uh... not dead, but badly injured."

The middle-aged man answered carefully. In truth, he'd rather not associate with humans at all, and he certainly didn't want his daughter becoming Qin Jiang's woman. His wife had been killed by humans. In his experience, there wasn't a single decent one among them—all of them coveted Pixiu bones.

But faced with the ruler of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, he didn't dare resist. More importantly, Yun Bao was clearly smitten. The man was unreasonably good-looking.

Even the middle-aged man had to admit that. He could hardly blame Yun Bao for being charmed.

All he could do was pray that Qin Jiang wouldn't be too despicable.

As for Wu Tian—the fact that Qin Jiang had asked about him was troubling. Was Qin Jiang the one who'd done this to him? In hindsight, they should have thrown him out immediately.

Qin Jiang walked over, frowned slightly, and gave Wu Tian a few kicks. "How'd he get this filthy? Dirt everywhere."

"This is Wu Tian?"

An Xihe approached as well. So wretched—was this really an Immortal Emperor who'd seized a body? Then again, surviving injuries this severe as a Saint Realm cultivator was extraordinary in itself.

Qin Jiang nodded. "It's him. And in all likelihood, just as I suspected, he's an Immortal Emperor who performed possession."

The truth was that Wu Tian had been reincarnated, not a body-snatcher—but that was information Qin Jiang would share with no one. Let the world believe it was possession. Wu Tian would never be able to prove otherwise.

Nearby, the middle-aged man's heart lurched. An Immortal Emperor? Possession? Was this the kind of secret someone at his level was supposed to hear?

More pressingly, thinking of what he'd done—burying the man twice—a chill ran through him. Would Wu Tian hold a grudge? An Immortal Emperor! There wasn't a being of that caliber in the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

"A few days ago, I tested him with a strike powerful enough to kill True Immortals, and he still escaped. Then, despite being severely wounded, Black Dragon and Little Xu went after him and nearly got counter-killed. A mere Saint's body couldn't have accomplished any of that."

Qin Jiang laid out his reasoning.

An Xihe nodded and probed Wu Tian's depths, but even with her Immortal King-level power, she couldn't detect his Primordial Spirit while he was this injured. Her expression grew solemn. She was now inclined to agree with Qin Jiang's assessment.

Her voice turned cold. "Should we kill him?"

"Leave him for now."

Qin Jiang waved the idea away. An Xihe looked puzzled—Qin Jiang usually struck first against threats like this.

He smiled without elaborating. "He's still useful alive."

"But Yingtao..."

"I'll help Yingtao grow stronger quickly. When the time comes, she'll take her revenge personally."

"That works."

An Xihe nodded, though her gaze on Wu Tian remained guarded. "Still, we should be careful. Keep him under control."

"Don't worry. I know what I'm doing."

The middle-aged man stood to the side, heart pounding. Then Qin Jiang's gaze swept toward him. "Tell me what happened these past few days."

"Well, nothing much, really. I just accidentally buried him twice."

"???"

Qin Jiang blinked. Buried twice? What?

Seeing Qin Jiang's confusion, the man scratched his head and gave a brief account of the past few days.

When he finished, Qin Jiang's expression turned peculiar. They'd actually buried Wu Tian alive. Twice. This man was a natural talent. He'd probably driven Wu Tian half-mad.

This needed to be weaponized.

After a moment's thought, Qin Jiang studied the middle-aged man and smiled. "From now on, you'll stick with Wu Tian."

"What?"

"Just stay by his side and keep causing chaos. Drive him to the brink."

Qin Jiang pointed at the unconscious figure on the ground.

The middle-aged man put on his most innocent face. "I wasn't causing chaos."

"..."

Looking at that guileless expression, Qin Jiang couldn't help but laugh. Wu Tian must have been beside himself.

He nodded. "Just act natural. Stay with him, and I'll feed you treasures. As for Yun Bao, she'll come with me. I'll take care of her."
