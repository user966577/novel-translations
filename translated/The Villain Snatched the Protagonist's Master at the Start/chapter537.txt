"Disciple, the three of us raised you. It's time you repaid that kindness. And you said it yourself—you're the one at fault for this predicament. Shouldn't you make amends?"

The three True Immortal remnant souls closed in, their decision made. Killing intent glinted in their eyes.

Li Yang's face was ashen, his heart filled with sorrow. How had it come to this? His fists clenched and he whirled toward Qin Jiang. It was all because of him. Everything—from the Li family to Huaxia Academy—had been orchestrated against him.

"Why?" He stared at Qin Jiang, eyes burning with hatred. "Why did you target me?"

"Why?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow and curled his lip dismissively. "I didn't like the look of you."

Li Yang's rage sputtered. Just because he didn't like the look of him? His anguish deepened, but he had no retort. In a world where the strong devoured the weak, a powerful man crushing someone he found distasteful was perfectly normal.

The fault lay in his own weakness.

The three remnant souls exchanged one final glance and struck in unison. Primordial Spirit power crashed down on Li Yang like a tidal wave.

"Aaagh!" Li Yang screamed, collapsing to his knees, face contorted. Their attack struck directly at the Primordial Spirit. The agony made his soul flicker in and out of visibility, as though being pulled from his body.

He struggled, but he was no match. In mere moments, his Primordial Spirit was ripped free. His physical body crumpled, lifeless. Only the soul remained, thrashing—until the three remnant souls' eyes hardened. They struck again, simultaneously, tearing Li Yang's Primordial Spirit to shreds.

The fragments dissipated into the air.

The deed done, they exhaled and turned to Qin Jiang, bowing. "My lord, Li Yang is dead."

"Is he now?" Qin Jiang drummed his fingers on the table, eyeing the corpse. A faint smile played at the corner of his mouth.

That expression made all three remnant souls' hearts pound with dread.

The silence stretched. Qin Jiang said nothing. The three remnant souls kept their heads bowed. Only Ye Xuan seemed unconcerned, watching Qin Jiang with quiet admiration.

At last, one of the remnant souls spoke again, tentative. "He is truly dead, my lord."

"Tsk. Seems like you weren't very responsible teachers." Qin Jiang shook his head and regarded them coolly. "Or perhaps you're deliberately trying to deceive me?"

His Immortal King pressure bore down on them. Their remnant souls convulsed violently, faces twisting with terror. They'd never faced an Immortal King before. A single whisper of his power had them trembling uncontrollably, and then—they were forced to their knees, unable even to lift their heads.

He ignored them, rose, and walked to Li Yang's corpse. He stepped on it. "A rather special physique—his body and Primordial Spirit are symbiotic. As long as one survives, he can be reborn. Li Yang should have reached that stage by now. As long as his body exists, he'll regenerate." He looked at the three remnant souls. "You deliberately tore apart his soul right in front of me—to keep me from paying attention to his body. Clever."

When Li Yang had been a weakling in the Li family, it was precisely this unusual physique that had suppressed his talent. Only after the three remnant souls spent years studying it did they find a solution. Only when body and soul were perfectly harmonized could his true potential emerge—along with several special abilities, including rebirth from either component.

Clearly, these three old fossils were still trying to save their disciple.

A Child of Destiny, after all. Even when his masters had every reason to abandon him, they'd shielded him at the critical moment.

Hearing Qin Jiang's analysis, the three remnant souls quaked. They hadn't expected Li Yang's physique to be seen through so easily. They'd spent years piecing it together, and they'd assumed that even an Immortal King wouldn't spot the anomaly so quickly.

They'd underestimated what it meant to face an Immortal King.

Despair washed over them. Li Yang's last path to survival had been sealed.

Qin Jiang lifted his foot and kicked the corpse in front of the three remnant souls—arranged as if they were kneeling in mourning.

Masters grieving their disciple. Truly a reversal of the natural order.

He returned to his seat and chuckled. "One more chance. Destroy his body."

The three looked up. Though Qin Jiang's face wore a smile, the coldness behind his eyes made them flinch. They looked at Li Yang's remains and shook their heads, weary. "My lord, please stop toying with us. Just give us a clean death."

They'd seen through it. Even if they destroyed Li Yang's body, Qin Jiang wouldn't spare them. This was entertainment—nothing more. A game, perhaps, to alleviate boredom.

Either way, they refused to suffer further humiliation. At the end, they chose to accept their fate.

Qin Jiang shook his head. "You really don't know how to seize an opportunity. If you'd put on a good enough show, I might genuinely have let you go."

They remained silent. Would he really have? Maybe. The Lord of Huaxia was famously capricious—please him enough, and he might actually spare them.

But what then? They were just three remnant souls, dependent on the Chaos Sword for survival. Once Li Yang was dead, the sword would belong to Qin Jiang. Would he let them remain inside it? Almost certainly not. He'd probably force them out.

Three rootless remnant souls with no anchor—what hope was there in that kind of existence?

Better to die. After all these years as fragments, they were tired.
