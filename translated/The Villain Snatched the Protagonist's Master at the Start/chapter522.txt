News of Huaxia Academy's expanded enrollment spread quickly. The academy's reputation preceded it—purpose-built to train the most talented youths for the Heavenly Domain. Word was that the first cohort had all reached Ancient Emperor at minimum within just over a decade, with many breaking through to the Immortal Path.

Granted, Immortal Path graduates had to leave the academy, but they could stay on as instructors and continue enjoying the benefits. Most chose to stay, naturally. After reaching the Immortal Path, further advancement was brutally difficult. On their own, they might toil for ages without progress. At the academy, all they had to do was teach, and the rewards were extraordinary.

The first wave of instructors had grown obscenely wealthy and powerful. Their students had seen it with their own eyes.

Easy work, incredible benefits—who wouldn't want to stay?

So when enrollment expansion was announced, factions across the land scrambled into action. Connections were called in, favors exchanged, all to secure spots for their brightest talents.

Some of those spots were, naturally, purchased through under-the-table deals. Qin Jiang had given orders to look the other way. As long as it was profitable, even a mediocrity could get in. You couldn't make the waters too clear, or the fish would scatter. An organization this large needed its share of human politics—otherwise, resentment would fester and undermine unity.

The enrollment drive raged for a full year. A hundred thousand students poured into Huaxia Academy, making it livelier than it had ever been.

Qin Jiang and his entourage relocated from Mystic Cloud Heaven to the academy. Surveying the bustling scene, a deep sense of accomplishment welled up in his chest. He spread his arms wide. "This is Huaxia."

The women rolled their eyes. Yes, this was Huaxia—but they were the ones who'd handled nearly all the work. As for Qin Jiang... well, he'd contributed in his own way. At the very least, he'd ensured they were all well-fed, well-rested, and thoroughly satisfied.

"This batch of students is a mixed bag," Liu Shuwan observed. "Teaching them won't be easy."

Qin Jiang shrugged. "We set the strategy. The teaching is the instructors' problem. Let them figure it out. They're not getting those lavish benefits for nothing."

As a leader, you had to know how to squeeze your subordinates. The harder you pushed, the more you drew out their potential. Sometimes they didn't even know what they were capable of until someone forced it out of them.

Right now, Qin Jiang was that someone.

The women all nodded in agreement.

"Heh, those headaches aren't our concern." Qin Jiang grinned, draping an arm around each side. "Now then, it's time we took a break. I've been missing the quarters here. Let's go reminisce, shall we?"

At the academy, the instructors had built Qin Jiang's private residence to his exact specifications. The room had everything—and then some.

Hearing this, the women's cheeks colored. That room really was something else. Especially those red silk drapes hanging from the ceiling—exquisite didn't begin to describe them. It had been ages since they'd experienced them, and they were definitely due for a revisit.

Some of them, however, had never been. Among them, Yun Bao piped up curiously, "What's so special about the room here?"

"Heh, you'll see when we get there."

Qin Jiang led the women to the restricted zone of Huaxia Academy—a sprawling estate accessible only to him and his inner circle. At its center stood an enormous chamber. When the newcomers—Yun Bao and the others—stepped inside, their eyes went wide.

Cascading from the ceiling were crimson silk drapes, and scattered around the room was an array of... equipment, each piece more suggestive than the last. Most items were self-explanatory at a glance, but the silk drapes...

"What are these drapes for?" Yun Bao asked.

Qin Jiang wrapped an arm around her waist. "Want to find out?"

"Mm." She studied the drapes, then studied his mischievous expression. Something told her this wasn't entirely innocent.

"Ahem, actually, there's a tutorial recording from when we first tried them. Want to watch?" Qin Jiang coughed. He glanced at Lian'er—she'd been the first to try, and they'd recorded the whole thing for instructional purposes.

Lian'er marched up and pinched his side, pouting. "Why watch a recording when you can just teach her yourself?"

"Heh, having the recording for reference makes teaching easier."

"How about," Qin Jiang grabbed Lian'er's hand and gave it a playful squeeze, "you help me demonstrate for Yun Bao?"

"No way~" Lian'er's face turned scarlet. But her eyes drifted to the silk drapes beside her, and a spark of anticipation flickered in them. They'd all grown close enough that a little demonstration wouldn't hurt. She just couldn't bring herself to volunteer after already saying no.

But Qin Jiang read her like an open book. He pulled her into his arms, kissed her forehead, and smiled. "Come on, Lian'er. As the senior, it's your duty to show the newer girls the ropes."

"Lian'er, please teach us~" Yun Bao and the others chimed in, their eyes sparkling.

After a theatrical display of reluctance, Lian'er finally nodded. "Fine. Just this once."
