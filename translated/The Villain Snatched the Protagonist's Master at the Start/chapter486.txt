On the airship, Qin Jiang made the rounds with his women before getting Murong Qing settled. The others gave her space—officially, she was still Xue Yue's mother.

Once that was done, Qin Jiang returned to his usual indulgences. Since they'd only been at the Blood Tribe for a day, the women weren't particularly pent up. Things stayed relatively tame—playful teasing, nothing too intense.

"Where to next?" Liu Shuwan asked from her spot in his arms.

He thought for a moment. "Let's wander. We've been in Mystic Cloud Heaven this long and haven't done any actual sightseeing. Oh, and we should swing past the True Immortal factions while we're at it. Give them a scare."

"Sightseeing?" She surveyed the deck—women of every shape and build, the 360 Songstresses performing their dances. "Is there a better view anywhere?"

"Heh. Fair point." He kissed her cheek and whispered, "The scenery right here is the best."

"Smooth talker." She rolled her eyes. She knew he said that to every woman. But it still made her happy.

Her gaze drifted to Murong Qing and Xue Yue in the corner. Murong Qing kept stealing glances in Qin Jiang's direction. "What's your plan with Yueyue's mother?"

He glanced over. Murong Qing happened to look at the same moment. He raised an eyebrow; she immediately averted her gaze. "You know me. She's all alone in the world—I can't leave her like that. It's the right thing to take care of her."

"Take care of her all the way to bed?"

"Comprehensive care."

"How very comprehensive of you."

Liu Shuwan pursed her lips. The man was truly assembling the complete set. She scanned the deck. At this point, every type was probably accounted for.

Though knowing him, he'd find new categories. Take the Immortal Fire living inside Lian'er—he checked on it regularly, and it could now take human form. Unfortunately, its temperature was far too high. Even a Human Immortal couldn't withstand it, and at certain critical moments, the output was literal fire. Qin Jiang couldn't handle that.

But in human form, the Immortal Fire was undeniably stunning. It had promised that someday it would stabilize to normal temperature. Qin Jiang was eagerly anticipating that day.

He was also wary. The fire had originally been Xiao Fan's fortune before Qin Jiang intercepted it. Its origins had never been revealed in the original storyline—Xiao Fan had died too early. Qin Jiang had assumed it was ordinary Immortal-grade fire, but its flames could burn even him. An Xihe, an Immortal King, had sensed something within it that made her uneasy. When questioned, the fire gave only vague answers, saying only that it wouldn't harm him.

Whatever it was, it wasn't simple. More importantly: Qin Jiang couldn't conquer it.

"Lost in thought?" He pinched Liu Shuwan's cheek.

She caught his hand. "It's nothing."

"Oh?" He pulled her closer. "Thinking about something fun?"

"Am not." She blushed and squirmed but held on tighter.

He tilted her chin up and kissed her, right there in front of everyone. The other women didn't bat an eye. They were all family. No need for modesty. Outside of guests, if the mood struck, anyone could simply pounce on Qin Jiang. They'd all been through large-scale battles together. No secrets among sisters.

But Murong Qing, watching from the corner, couldn't believe her eyes. Right there, in front of everyone?

Her cheeks burned. She looked away quickly. "Yueyue, I think I'll go to my room."

This was not the place for her right now. Xue Yue didn't mind—she was a veteran of these things. She studied her mother's flustered expression and got an idea. A demonstration might help ease her in. Plus, she was in the mood herself.

"Get some rest, Mother. I won't bother you."

"Alright."

Once Xue Yue left, Murong Qing dared to peek out the window. She saw Xue Yue dive in enthusiastically. Clearly not her first time.

Murong Qing's heart hammered. With that many people, if she joined, would anyone even notice?

She slapped her cheeks to cool them down. No. She couldn't.

But she couldn't look away, either. She stared out the window, then caught herself and retreated, face burning. "Yueyue, I think I'll--" She was already in her room. She was talking to no one.

Xue Yue, meanwhile, had seen her mother's retreat and made a mental note. 'She'll come around,' she thought, and dove back in. The show might do her good.
