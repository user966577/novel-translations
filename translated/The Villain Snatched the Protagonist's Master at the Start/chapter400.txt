Progress on the ice staircase was glacial. The biting cold sapped everyone's strength, making every step a battle.

After about an hour, Qin Jiang beckoned, and a second teacher stepped forward — a fire-attribute Human Immortal. He exchanged a nod with the ice specialist, then swept his palm outward. A massive fire dragon roared to life and surged toward the students, coiling above them like a living canopy.

Searing heat crashed down from above while the staircase still radiated freezing cold from below.

Ice and fire at once.

Within breaths, the students were drenched in sweat even as their feet went numb. And the fire dragon wasn't content to merely radiate heat — its enormous head swiveled toward the crowd and began lobbing fireballs.

"What the—"

The students cursed and scrambled to dodge, burning through spiritual energy at an alarming rate.

Ye Xuan and Li Yang were still together. When a fireball streaked toward them, Ye Xuan instinctively grabbed Li Yang's hand.

He froze — not from the cold. A fireball caught him square in the face, leaving him singed and soot-covered. Fortunately, the blasts weren't meant to injure, just to punish carelessness.

Ye Xuan suppressed a grimace. 'This guy really is useless.' She still couldn't fathom why Qin Jiang wanted her babysitting him.

Masking her irritation, she turned to him with concern. "Are you okay?"

"Just a cough — I'm fine." He hacked up a plume of black smoke.

She stared, her eye twitching. Deep breath. 'Qin Jiang's orders. Endure it.'

She produced a handkerchief. "Hold still. Let me clean you up."

She leaned in close, gently wiping the soot from his face. Li Yang could feel her breath on his skin. He stood rigid, not daring to move, until she stepped back. His tension eased slightly — but his eyes wouldn't leave her. His heart was pounding.

'I think I'm falling for this girl.'

"What are you staring at? Dummy." She poked his forehead.

He snapped out of it, laughed awkwardly, and looked away.

"You can let go of my hand now," she added, wiggling her fingers.

He turned scarlet and released her immediately. "S-sorry!"

Ye Xuan giggled, one hand covering her smile — and Li Yang went blank again. Then, with a coquettish roll of her eyes, she pressed the handkerchief into his palm.

"Keep it."

She turned and continued walking. Li Yang clutched the handkerchief, raised it to his nose, and inhaled deeply.

'It smells like her.'

A blissful smile spread across his face, and he hurried after her. Ye Xuan glanced at him sideways and kept walking.

'He's hooked. Time to pull back a little.'

She didn't need to stay warm and attentive — distance would make him want her more. Besides, she genuinely disliked being close to someone this pathetic. If not for Qin Jiang's assignment, she wouldn't have given Li Yang a second glance.

Ye Xuan had long since embraced her identity as a woman. She was selective about her companions — the men she chose were of far higher caliber than Li Yang.

From that point, the two still walked together and chatted easily enough, but Li Yang sensed a subtle distance that hadn't been there before. He couldn't put his finger on it.

The combined assault of ice and fire frayed everyone's nerves. Then, without warning, a pale mist rolled in. The cold and the flames vanished. Everyone blinked in surprise — had they arrived?

Joy spread through the crowd as they walked into what appeared to be Huaxia Academy. Teachers stood ready to receive them.

But Li Yang's attention wasn't on the welcoming committee. It was on one particular figure.

"Qingqiu..." he breathed.

His eyes lit up. She was here — just as he'd hoped.

"Who's 'Qingqiu'?" A quiet voice at his elbow made him jump.

Ye Xuan was right beside him. And in her eyes, he saw deep disappointment.

His chest tightened. This girl — he'd only just met her, but her kindness had already meant more to him than years of being ignored. He might even be in love with her.

"It's not what you think — Qingqiu is just my—"

She didn't let him finish. She turned and walked away.

Li Yang panicked. Ye Xuan was practically the only person who'd ever been genuinely kind to him. He started to chase her — but Li Qingqiu appeared in his path, a man at her side.

Qin Jiang.

"Trash." Qin Jiang looked him up and down with naked contempt. "A toad lusting after a swan. Pathetic."

He kicked Li Yang to the ground and stomped on him, vicious and gloating.

Li Qingqiu wrinkled her nose and pulled Qin Jiang back. "Don't step on him. He's filthy."

"Whatever you say, Qingqiu." Qin Jiang grinned, swept her into his arms, and kissed her hard. Then he turned to Li Yang with a triumphant leer.

Li Yang writhed on the ground, trying to rise, but couldn't.

"Li Yang! Are you okay? Who did this to you?"

Ye Xuan came rushing back. Relief flooded him. She knelt beside him, helped him up, then turned on Qin Jiang and Li Qingqiu with fury.

"You two did this?"

"I did." Qin Jiang was utterly brazen. "What — you want revenge for this piece of garbage?"

Under Li Yang's helpless gaze, Qin Jiang sized up Ye Xuan, then leered. "Pretty little thing. Why waste your time with trash when you could be with me?"

He reached out, tilted her chin up, and pinched her cheek. Ye Xuan struggled but couldn't match his strength. A pained moan escaped her lips.

"Let her go!" Li Yang screamed.
