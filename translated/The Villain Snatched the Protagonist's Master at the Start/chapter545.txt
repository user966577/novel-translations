They entered the Chaos and immediately sensed combat ripples—but they lasted only an instant before falling silent. Before long, Qin Jiang and Wu Yingtao caught up with An Xihe and the others.

Seeing Qin Jiang, the women gathered around. In An Xihe's palm, a sphere of light contained a thrashing figure—Wu Tian.

He'd split his Primordial Spirit in two. As long as one half escaped, he'd have a chance to start over. The hidden half had been his best hope, but Qin Jiang had found it immediately. The fleeing half carried some combat power, but against a true Immortal Emperor, his reincarnated self was completely helpless.

If An Xihe hadn't held back, one slap would have killed him. She'd only shown restraint so Wu Yingtao could deliver the final blow herself.

She tossed the sphere to Wu Yingtao. "All yours, Yingtao."

Then she turned to Qin Jiang and dusted off her hands. "That guy was nothing special. Didn't need all this fuss—I could've handled him at thirty percent."

"Better safe than sorry," Qin Jiang said with a smile. A Child of Destiny warranted thorough preparation.

An Xihe nodded and said nothing more. For them, extra caution was fine. Safety came first.

They both looked at Wu Yingtao. Inside the sphere, Wu Tian thrashed and howled, his expression savage. The destruction of his other soul fragment had been unmistakable—this was his last lifeline, and now it too was captured.

Truly facing death—even someone who'd died once before couldn't stay calm. His heart still burned with vengeance for his previous life. He refused to fall here.

But no matter how he struggled, escape was impossible. His howls couldn't even penetrate the barrier. To Qin Jiang and the others, he looked like nothing more than a clown.

"Yingtao, finish it. This soul is his last resort. Kill it, and your brother's debt is settled."

Wu Yingtao nodded. She looked at Wu Tian and crushed the sphere in her fist.

The light shattered. Wu Tian's Primordial Spirit shattered with it.

Wu Tian was dead. Truly, completely dead.

In Qin Jiang's mind, the system chimed. A string of rewards poured out. He didn't check them. Instead, he pulled Wu Yingtao into his arms.

"Yingtao. It's time to let it go."

"Mm."

She nestled against him, looking up. Her small hands wrapped around him. "Thank you."

To give her the chance to avenge her brother personally, Qin Jiang had spent years helping her grow stronger and orchestrating an elaborate plan to cripple Wu Tian first. Only because of all that could she deliver the killing blow with her own hands.

Twenty-some years had passed. It really was time to move on. Her brother would have wanted her to live well. And if he knew she'd avenged him personally, he'd be at peace.

With Wu Tian dealt with, the group didn't linger. Less than half a year remained before the Heavenly Domain passage opened. Huaxia's affairs needed to be handed off—who would ascend, who would stay behind. Qin Jiang selected trusted confidants among those remaining and dedicated the final stretch to intensive training. He also arranged safeguards for the Qin family's standing.

Time flew. Then one day, countless cultivators stared up at the sky. The Heavenly Domain passage that had hung above them finally stirred.

Three pulses of energy rippled across the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. A magnificent voice echoed from within the passage:

"The Heavenly Domain passage is now open. From this day forward, for one hundred years, all who qualify may enter the Heavenly Domain."

A seven-colored barrier materialized at the passage's entrance—some kind of test.

Qin Jiang already knew the requirements from the spoiler system. Immortal Kings and above could enter freely, no test required. Anyone below Immortal King had to strike the barrier. If five or more of the seven colors lit up, they earned passage.

For ordinary cultivators, three colors at full power was roughly the limit. Most geniuses couldn't reach five. Only the most exceptional among the exceptional would qualify.

With the passage open, no one dared go first. Huaxia hadn't given the word yet.

At Huaxia headquarters, nearly every powerhouse had assembled. Qin Jiang briefly explained the qualification rules. The crowd was eager—no one who could enter the Heavenly Domain wanted to be left behind. Every cultivator yearned for growth.

"Who wants to go first?" Qin Jiang swept his gaze across the assembly.

They exchanged glances and hesitated. Being first meant pressure—you had to make a good showing. None of them were confident enough to guarantee success in front of everyone.

As they wavered, a slender figure stepped forward. "Young Master Qin, I'd like to try."

Ye Xuan.

As a former Child of Destiny, Qin Jiang had confidence in her. He nodded. "Go ahead. Remember—give it everything. Each person gets three attempts."

"Yes."

She launched skyward toward the passage. It was impossibly far away, but a divine ability left by the Grand Sovereign allowed the barrier to appear before any challenger—and projected the attempt for all living beings to witness.

As Ye Xuan ascended, the barrier materialized before her. Seven colors flickered briefly, then dimmed, signaling her to strike.

Confidence blazed across her face. She was a true genius. In her estimation, if even she couldn't pass, then no one in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands could—except Qin Jiang himself.

She took a deep breath, clenched her fist, and channeled her power. Then, heeding Qin Jiang's instruction, she held nothing back.

Her punch slammed into the barrier. Under the gaze of countless onlookers, colors ignited one after another.

All seven lit up.

The radiance coalesced into a single seven-colored mote of light and settled into the center of her brow.
