Atop the Immortal Marrow pillar, Qin Jiang filled An Xihe to the brim. After several more days of final preparations, she began her seclusion at last.

Qin Jiang stepped off the pillar and issued his orders. Across the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, the formations he'd laid down in advance were activated one after another over the course of several days, ultimately merging into a single grand array. Nearly all available energy was drawn through the formation and redirected to An Xihe's seclusion site.

The energy levels everywhere plummeted. Countless cultivators panicked, having no idea what was happening. Unrest broke out in several regions. Huaxia's forces, prepared well in advance, moved to suppress the disturbances at once. Even the True Immortals showed themselves, standing sentinel across the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands to deter anyone with ill intentions.

At the same time, these True Immortals gazed toward the depths of the Chaos, expressions complicated. With their strength and position, they knew exactly what was happening.

That person was attempting Immortal Emperor.

Immortal Emperor! In the past, True Immortal had been the absolute ceiling in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Since Huaxia's founding, three Immortal Kings had already been born. Now they were pushing for Immortal Emperor. The sheer scale of transformation in just over twenty years felt almost dreamlike.

Each of them sighed to themselves—but inwardly, they hoped An Xihe would succeed. Only after she reached Immortal Emperor would they be allowed to attempt Immortal King themselves.

Immortal King—once an unreachable goal—was now within their grasp. Huaxia absolutely had the capacity to nurture Immortal Kings. Qing Chan and Ning Xue'er's breakthroughs had proven as much.

But they all understood they weren't part of Huaxia's true inner circle, and Qin Jiang didn't fully trust them. Until he had the ability to suppress them, he would never allow their breakthroughs. He'd even warned them, both directly and indirectly.

They could only wait—and this was the hope they'd been waiting for. Once An Xihe reached Immortal Emperor, their advancement to Immortal King would pose no threat and would only strengthen Huaxia. At that point, there would be no more obstacles.

The Huaxia powerhouses obeyed Qin Jiang's orders to the letter, ensuring An Xihe's success.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang stood deep in the Chaos, watching the Immortal Marrow pillar. That last ten percent of confidence—it wasn't going to come from his intimate sessions with An Xihe.

His Villain Points were spent, but they could be replenished.

With five years remaining, it was time to reap.

Over the years, several Children of Destiny had been identified and kept under surveillance. Compared to Li Yang, Nangong Yun, and Wu Tian, these other Children of Destiny provided far fewer Villain Points—there was no reason to keep them alive any longer.

Qin Jiang gave the order. Kill them all.

Those monitoring the Children of Destiny were people Qin Jiang trusted absolutely—Black Dragon, Little Xu, and the like. Upon his command, they sprang into action. These Children of Destiny had been causing trouble for Huaxia for years, and Black Dragon and the others had been itching to deal with them. Only Qin Jiang's orders had stayed their hand.

Now, finally, they could act. To leave nothing to chance, a True Immortal was dispatched against each Child of Destiny—ensuring no possibility of survival. Furthermore, to maximize the yield, everyone connected to a given Child of Destiny was to be eliminated first, so that not a single Villain Point was wasted.

Once operations began, reports and Villain Points streamed in continuously. He needed to stockpile enough points to backstop An Xihe's breakthrough—the true meaning of that "last ten percent."

The operation lasted a full half year and yielded a substantial reserve—more than enough to cover An Xihe. And he still had three big catches left untouched. If the need arose, killing them would generate a massive windfall.

Time crept onward. Qin Jiang and the women cultivated in the spirit stone ocean while guarding An Xihe. His own cultivation drew infinitely close to Immortal King. The women made significant progress as well.

Not far off, the immortal vessel drifted in the Chaos, housing several women still in seclusion.

About a year later, the vessel shook violently as an Immortal King aura erupted outward, sweeping in every direction. Qing Chan and Ning Xue'er moved simultaneously, blocking the wave to prevent it from disturbing An Xihe. The aura persisted for half a month before subsiding.

Mo Mo emerged from the vessel. She had broken through to Immortal King.

Everyone offered congratulations. Qin Jiang, naturally, celebrated privately with Mo Mo for a few days before they returned to the spirit stone ocean to resume guarding duty.

Three months later, Jian Yao broke through to Immortal King as well.

Another half year after that, Zi Fu made her breakthrough. Then Chen Baizhe and Xue Mei broke through in quick succession.

Together with Qing Chan and Ning Xue'er, that made seven Immortal Kings. With them standing guard, even if every force in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands united, no one could possibly disturb An Xihe's seclusion.

Qin Jiang breathed easier. After leaving final instructions, he too entered seclusion to attempt his own Immortal King breakthrough. He had no bottleneck to overcome—all he needed was enough energy, which he had in abundance. Three months inside the Space-Time Temple, and he'd absorbed sufficient energy to break through.

Nearly every target had been hit. Only An Xihe remained.

And she was close.

Qin Jiang stepped out of the vessel and gazed at the Heavenly Domain passage in the distance, murmuring to himself. "Three years left."

He turned toward An Xihe. Her aura was nearly imperceptible now, but a faint pressure radiated outward—subtle yet unmistakable, enough to make even Immortal Kings feel oppressed.

This meant An Xihe's realm was already crossing the threshold into Immortal Emperor. It wouldn't be long before the true breakthrough arrived.

A smile spread across Qin Jiang's face. There would be no surprises now. With an Immortal Emperor at his side, even in the Heavenly Domain, they could walk with impunity.
