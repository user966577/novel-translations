Over the following days, after several rounds of Qin Jiang's "treatment," the toxins in Yu Lan's bloodline were nearly purged. Her injuries were steadily mending as well. Qin Jiang was an Emperor-grade alchemist, after all—as long as a patient still drew breath, he could pull them back. And Yu Lan's most critical issue had always been the bloodline poison.

On this day, Yu Lan emerged from her room and found Qin Jiang. She glanced at Mo Mo and Xue Mei beside him—she'd already learned he had two Immortal-path powerhouses at his side, and that their relationship with him was far from professional.

After a brief look, she turned back to Qin Jiang. "Thank you for everything these past few days."

Her eyes held a complex warmth as she gazed at him. Before returning to the formation, she'd resigned herself to her bloodline's destruction—to never leading her people back to prominence. She hadn't expected to meet Qin Jiang. A man who'd given her a second chance.

Without realizing it, she'd grown... dependent on him.

Not that her personality would allow her to show it.

Qin Jiang smiled, stepped forward, and took her hand. With Mo Mo and Xue Mei watching, Yu Lan's cheeks colored—but she didn't pull away.

"Most of the poison in your bloodline is gone, but there may be trace amounts lingering. I'd recommend a few more sessions, just to be safe. A royal bloodline can't afford any lapses."

His tone was perfectly earnest.

Yu Lan nodded softly in agreement.

In truth, whatever trace toxins remained posed no threat at all. Her royal bloodline was potent enough to cleanse the residue on its own—and she knew that Qin Jiang knew.

But since he wanted a few more "sessions"... she wouldn't refuse. Call it his fee.

Besides, she'd developed something of a taste for it herself.

"Then... tonight. I'll be waiting."

Her voice was gentle.

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile.

After a moment, Yu Lan mustered her composure, gave Mo Mo and Xue Mei a polite nod, and withdrew.

"Is she really that pretty?"

A sour voice piped up from his side the moment Yu Lan was gone. Mo Mo, of course—the little loli—arms crossed, lips pouting, resentful eyes drilling into him. He'd been doting on the Yu sisters for days and all but ignoring her and Xue Mei.

"Is my little Mo Mo jealous?"

He scooped her up. The tiny devil weighed next to nothing; cradled in his arms, she looked like his daughter.

Mo Mo braced her small hands on his shoulders. "Tonight, after you're done with her treatment, come find me."

"Deal."

He agreed immediately.

Mo Mo was sensible enough not to compete for Yu Lan's time—not while the empress wasn't fully won over yet. All she asked was that Qin Jiang spare a little attention for her afterward. For a former supreme demon lord, that level of compromise was genuinely impressive.

It also showed just how deeply she'd come to care for him.

He leaned down and kissed her cheek. Mo Mo lingered in his arms for a while, humming contentedly, before finally letting go.

Xue Mei needed attention too, naturally. Women were easy to placate—provided they actually loved you. A bit of sweet-talking, and the jealousy simmering in Xue Mei's eyes gave way to a radiant smile. She even pulled Qin Jiang in for a kiss of her own.

Outside the formation, the mountain range was crawling with Snake Race soldiers searching day and night for Yu Lan. But beneath the Emperor-grade formation's concealment, anyone short of an Immortal—or the rival royal bloodline himself—had virtually no chance of finding her.

And alongside the Snake Race patrols, another figure had slipped into the mountains.

From the shadows, he watched a patrol pass overhead. The shadows rippled, and Chen Changsheng emerged. His expression was grim.

"I need to find out what's happened to Yu Lan."

He'd been gathering intelligence. Yu Lan was indeed the Snake Race Empress—and she was in dire straits.

"The Snake Race is still searching. She must be alive."

He murmured to himself, then licked his lips as a grin spread across his face. "This is an opportunity."

His relationship with Yu Lan was nothing like his history with the Female Emperor. They were barely acquaintances—and after tens of thousands of years, he wasn't even sure she'd remember him. But arriving now, when she was at her most vulnerable, as a knight in shining armor? That would leave an indelible impression. After that, a full display of his charm, and the Snake Race Empress was as good as his.

"The real challenge is finding her. All these soldiers and nothing to show for it... she must be well hidden."

His eyes narrowed. Ten lifetimes of reincarnation had made him a master of many disciplines. Finding one woman shouldn't be—

Just as he was thinking, a sharp voice split the air. "Someone's here!"

Chen Changsheng jolted. The surroundings erupted in chaos as Snake Race soldiers converged on his position.

"Damn!"

He cursed and bolted. He hadn't expected them to spot him so quickly. If the Snake Race pinned him down, breaking free would cost him dearly—and their ranks included Great Emperors he couldn't hope to match. So flight was the only option.

Inside the formation, Qin Jiang had just finished another "treatment." Looking at the spent Yu Lan, he felt a rare twinge of conscience. By now, she was simply indulging him.

She raised her eyes, gazing up at him. "Is there still poison left in my bloodline?"

Ostensibly about the toxin. Actually asking whether he wanted to continue.

"There's still... a little, maybe..."

He blinked uncertainly.

Yu Lan burst out laughing—a genuine, unguarded laugh. It was the first time she'd seen Qin Jiang look anything less than confident.

She nodded. "Then come treat me again next time."

In her mind, Qin Jiang's image remained thoroughly positive. And his current transparent fib? She chalked it up to her own irresistibility.

Which, honestly, made her happy. Knowing she held that kind of sway over him.

Yu Lan's laughter caught Qin Jiang off guard. He'd seen her smile over these past days, but never this openly—almost playful. For someone as cold and regal as Yu Lan, it was disarming.

It meant her acceptance of him was deepening.

He studied her, a thoughtful look crossing his face. Maybe it was time to come clean. Given her current attitude... she probably wouldn't hold it against him.
