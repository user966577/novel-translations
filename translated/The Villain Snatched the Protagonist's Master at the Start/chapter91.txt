Having botched the first task, Black Dragon was determined to redeem himself. He shot up to the spectator stands and headed straight for the black-robed figure, swiftly clearing a clean area around him. He knew that was Qin Jiang's target.

"Young Lord, this way!" Black Dragon flashed a toothy grin and opened a path.

This time, Qin Jiang was genuinely satisfied. Under the eyes of every remaining spectator, he and Qin Lian'er made their way to the black-robed man's side. Down below, the fighters and beasts in the cages were trembling. Qin Jiang waved his hand, and the pressure blanketing the arena dispersed instantly—but still, no one dared make a sound.

A figure hurried over to Qin Jiang's side, face full of anxiety. "Young Master Qin, I had no idea you were gracing us with your presence. Please forgive the poor reception—I beg your understanding."

The newcomer was a Supreme Realm powerhouse and the arena's manager. On any other day, he was the kind of man whose very name inspired dread—cruel, domineering, feared by countless people. But before Qin Jiang, he could only bow and scrape.

Qin Jiang glanced at him, then pointed down at the cages. "Let them keep fighting. Business as usual. Oh, and one more thing—my sister doesn't like noise. Tell these gamblers to keep it down."

"Yes, sir."

The manager answered as respectfully as if he were Qin Jiang's own subordinate. He immediately went to make arrangements. The fighters and beasts in the cages resumed their battles, but the wild roaring and screaming had vanished entirely. The spectators pressed their lips tight, not daring to utter a sound.

Once everything was settled, the manager returned to Qin Jiang's side. "Young Master Qin, I've specially prepared a private box for you. Excellent viewing position. Would you like—"

"No need."

In truth, the arena didn't have private boxes. Everyone who came here wanted the raw, visceral thrill of being in the crowd. The manager had actually cleared out his own office to offer Qin Jiang. But Qin Jiang's target was the black-robed man, so he had no intention of leaving.

The manager didn't dare press the matter and obediently stationed himself behind Qin Jiang.

Then Qin Jiang turned to the black-robed figure. "You placed a bet?"

The man stiffened. From the manager's form of address, he'd already guessed Qin Jiang's identity. More importantly, he'd recognized Qin Lian'er—the woman who'd stolen his Emperor Technique. Young Master Qin's sister. The Qin family's little princess. Someone he absolutely could not afford to provoke.

He tried his best to minimize his presence. But it was too late—he'd already been noticed.

In a deliberately hoarse voice, he replied, "I did."

Having been reborn, he knew the locations of many treasures. But his current strength was pitiful—he didn't dare venture into secret realms yet. So for now, he could only pick up scraps to gradually build his power. The problem was, he had no money. Three days ago, he'd spent his last spirit stones on that white jade, only for Qin Lian'er to snatch it away. So he'd come to the underground arena to make some cash. He knew this place well—he knew which future champions were still unknown rookies. Bet on them now, and you'd almost never lose. With money, he could grow powerful quickly.

"Which one did you bet on?" Qin Jiang asked.

The black-robed man's fists clenched, but he didn't dare resist. He could only answer honestly.

The manager chimed in, introducing the fighter the black-robed man had wagered on—a newcomer that few people were paying attention to. But the black-robed man knew this was a future king among fighters. Betting on him now meant enormous returns.

Qin Jiang smiled faintly and snapped his fingers. Down in the cage, the fighter the black-robed man had bet on suddenly seized up, and his opponent tore him apart.

The black-robed man's pupils contracted. He whipped his head toward Qin Jiang.

"Tough luck, it seems." Qin Jiang looked at him with a casual smile.

The black-robed man averted his gaze, eyes blazing with fury. Anyone could see that Qin Jiang had obviously interfered.

"Who else did you bet on?" Qin Jiang continued.

The black-robed man's expression turned ugly. "No one," he said flatly.

Nearby, Qin Lian'er studied the black-robed man with curiosity. She didn't know why her brother was targeting him, but this guy definitely wasn't anyone good.

The manager eyed the black-robed man with a peculiar expression. How had someone this weak managed to offend Young Master Qin? And judging by the young master's demeanor, he'd come to the arena specifically for this guy. What rotten luck! The manager had nearly been scared to death himself. He wanted nothing more than to kill the black-robed man on the spot, but without Qin Jiang's say-so, he didn't dare act. Even Qin Jiang's enemies weren't for just anyone to touch.

"Lian'er, remember a couple days ago when you broke someone's leg?" Qin Jiang turned to his sister, seemingly losing interest in the black-robed man—though in reality, he was twisting the knife.

Qin Lian'er nodded. "That guy was infuriating! Everything I had my eye on, he tried to grab!"

The black-robed man: "..."

Who grabbed whose stuff, exactly? The accused party felt deeply wronged.

Qin Jiang ruffled Qin Lian'er's hair. "I looked into him. His name is Chu Yuan. Both parents dead. Raised by his older sister."

"Is his sister pretty?" Qin Lian'er's eyes lit up.

Qin Jiang chuckled. "Want to go see?"

"Yes! If she's pretty, we can snatch her for you as a wife. Consider it his compensation to me." Qin Lian'er giggled.

The black-robed man—Chu Yuan—listened to their exchange with a face like iron. Not only were they slandering him, they were also eyeing his sister. No! He had to get his sister out of here immediately. Otherwise, she'd be walking straight into the tiger's den. He was quite confident in his sister's looks, and Qin Jiang's reputation as a womanizer preceded him—just days ago, he'd openly stolen the Fire Tribe clan leader's bride.

Chu Yuan didn't dare hesitate. He turned and made for the exit.

The manager moved to stop him, but Qin Jiang waved him off.

Chu Yuan left, and Qin Jiang followed at a leisurely pace, heading toward Chu Yuan's home.

Meanwhile, Chu Yuan was frantic, limping home as fast as he could manage. But people kept blocking his path along the way—some even picking fights outright—wasting precious time.

Over an hour later, Chu Yuan finally made it home, only to see from a distance that Qin Jiang and Qin Lian'er were already in the courtyard, chatting with his sister.

His expression darkened, but he didn't dare barge in. He could only hide in the shadows and watch.

The sudden appearance of two strangers had made Chu Hanyan nervous. A few days ago, Chu Yuan had come home dragging an injured leg, and she'd been worried ever since. Now, looking at Qin Jiang and Qin Lian'er, she could tell at a glance they were no ordinary people.

"Are you here for Yuan'er?" she asked carefully.

Qin Lian'er studied Chu Hanyan closely. Simple clothes, no makeup, her entire bearing radiating a delicate fragility. The hint of anxiety and timidity on her face made her seem all the more endearing.

She nodded approvingly, then turned to Qin Jiang. "Brother, she's quite nice. Though I have a feeling she might get bullied in your harem."
