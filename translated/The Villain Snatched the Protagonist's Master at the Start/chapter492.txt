"It's not that you lack talent—you just haven't found the right cultivation method."

Wu Yingtao looked confused. "But our Wu family's method is supposed to be the best fit for Wu family bloodlines."

"You're different." Qin Jiang smiled, pulling her closer by the hand. "I can sense a powerful force inside you. It's this force that's suppressing your Wu family bloodline, making their methods unsuitable. Hold still—let me examine you."

With that, he pulled her directly into his arms and held her tight.

She stiffened, face flushing instantly. She squirmed uncomfortably, head bowed, not daring to resist.

Qin Jiang's expression was completely serious as he looked her over, then began a thorough examination—hands moving up and down, left and right. Very thorough indeed.

In his arms, Wu Yingtao bit her lip. His "examination" sent warmth spreading through her entire body, an unfamiliar sensation blooming in her chest. This was the first time she'd ever been this close to a man.

She tilted her head, watching his focused expression, and her fingers curled. She knew perfectly well he was using this as an excuse to feel her up. But she didn't mind. His touch actually felt quite pleasant, and just looking at that handsome face put her in a good mood.

It was just that strange sensation, making her want to...

"Mm..." A soft sound escaped her before she could stop it, her body tensing.

Qin Jiang blinked, arm around her waist. "What's wrong? Uncomfortable?"

"N-no..."

She shook her head, face burning. It was the opposite—it felt too good, and she hadn't been able to hold back.

"Are you done examining?" she asked quietly.

He smiled and nodded. "Yep. You're developing quite nicely."

"Huh?"

"Ahem—I mean, I've identified your issue. Your talent is actually excellent. Like I said, the only reason you've been cultivating slowly is that you haven't found the right method."

"Really?" Wu Yingtao was skeptical. He'd just groped her all over. Could he really diagnose something from that? And her talent was actually good?

She had her doubts.

Qin Jiang nodded firmly and redeemed the appropriate cultivation method from the system: the Ancient God Scripture.

He'd only gotten the first three layers. The complete version was exorbitantly expensive, and he figured they could simply retrieve it from the Ancient God Race once they reached the Heavenly Domain. No point wasting resources. Besides, with Wu Yingtao's current bloodline density, just the first three layers would keep her occupied for a long time.

He produced the scripture and handed it to her. "Here. Try cultivating with this."

"The Ancient God Scripture..." She murmured as she accepted it.

Her blood began to boil. Her eyes locked onto the text, and a flash of gold flickered through her pupils. The scripture opened of its own accord. Characters appeared in mid-air, shimmering briefly before streaming into her mind.

Her body trembled, releasing a shockwave that knocked Qin Jiang back.

Standing aside, he raised an eyebrow. That force came from the Ancient God bloodline. Just a trace of it had been enough to push him away. Formidable indeed.

Wu Yingtao stood with her eyes closed, hair floating without wind, her aura climbing steadily. Merely learning the method was already increasing her cultivation.

A full two hours passed before her energy stabilized.

She opened her eyes, delight spreading across her face. He'd been telling the truth. She wasn't lacking in talent—she'd simply been using the wrong cultivation method. The Ancient God Scripture was the one meant for her.

Ancient God Race. Ancient God bloodline. She was one of them.

With the method in hand, her bloodline had been activated. It carried an inherited memory—sparse due to her diluted lineage, but enough for Wu Yingtao to understand that she possessed an extraordinarily powerful bloodline. One of the very strongest across all realms.

Qin Jiang watched the transformation. After cultivating the Ancient God Scripture, not only had her power grown, but even her bearing had shifted. The timid, nervous girl now carried a trace of confidence between her brows. The whole effect was captivating.

He stepped forward and, while she was still basking in excitement, wrapped his arm around her waist. "I wasn't lying, was I?"

"Oh!" She yelped, but relaxed immediately. Turning to look at him, face lightly flushed, she said, "Thank you."

"Do you really need to thank me?"

She blushed. Her temperament might have changed, but her shy personality wouldn't transform overnight.

"By the way, my bloodline told me I'm from the Ancient God Race. Is that true?"

Since he'd identified her cultivation problem and provided the right method, he must know about the Ancient God Race.

"You do have Ancient God bloodline," he confirmed. "Legend has it that long ago, a powerful member of the Ancient God Race traveled the myriad realms and visited the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, where he left behind a romantic connection. That connection became the ancestor of your Wu family. But without the proper cultivation method, the Ancient God bloodline gradually faded over the generations. Apart from you, it's probably extinct within the Wu family. You're a special case—a bloodline reversion. Even so, your Ancient God bloodline is very thin. However, cultivating the Ancient God Scripture will purify it. What I've given you is only the first three layers. Work with those for now. Later, I'll get you the complete version."

Wu Yingtao nodded in acknowledgment.

Qin Jiang grinned. "Oh, and the Ancient God Race resides in the Heavenly Domain. When the time comes, I'll take you there personally. Perhaps you'll find your destiny with them."

"Okay." She nodded again, warmth growing in her eyes. For as long as she could remember, she'd rarely experienced this kind of caring. Even her brother had mostly relied on her.

And before his transformation, he'd been in a state of near-constant malaise.
