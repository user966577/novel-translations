Half a month passed.

Liu Shuwan's indignant protests echoed from the dwelling at regular intervals, but through all the bickering and teasing, her resistance to Qin Jiang grew steadily weaker. She even began occasionally going on the offensive herself.

One day, Liu Shuwan sat brushing her hair, giving Qin Jiang a look of deep grievance. Between his constant presence and his schemes, she hadn't managed a single proper cultivation session in ages. Every time, she'd settle into meditation only to wake up in bed—clearly knocked out by whatever trick Qin Jiang had pulled while she was distracted. And she could only imagine what that rogue had done while she was unconscious. Nothing decent, certainly.

She ran her fingers through the tangles, wincing at the broken strands. "Qin Jiang, can you please stop lying on my hair? You've broken so much of it!"

"I'll try." Qin Jiang smiled, walked up behind her, and wrapped his arms around her.

Liu Shuwan squirmed briefly, then gave up. She was used to it.

"Want me to help you brush it?" He rested his chin on her shoulder, tilting his head to look at her.

Liu Shuwan shot him a disdainful glance. "Absolutely not."

With Qin Jiang's "help" doing more harm than good, it took quite a while before she managed to untangle and restyle her hair into its signature high ponytail. She studied herself in the mirror and nodded with satisfaction.

"Beautiful," Qin Jiang added.

Liu Shuwan huffed, but the compliment clearly pleased her. Being with Qin Jiang made her feel years younger.

"Let go now." She wriggled, signaling for him to release her. But instead, his arms tightened. She turned her head, puzzled. "What's wrong?"

"Just let me hold you a little longer."

Liu Shuwan sighed and leaned back into his embrace. It did feel wonderful. But they couldn't stay like this forever. Seeing Qin Jiang resting on her shoulder with his eyes closed, she reached up and pinched his cheek. "Haven't had enough yet?"

Qin Jiang opened his eyes, caught her hand, and said softly, "One more treatment today, and your injuries should be healed."

Liu Shuwan's heart skipped. Her voice came out gentler than she intended. "Are you leaving?"

She knew Qin Jiang couldn't stay forever. At first, she'd counted the days until he'd leave. But now... she found herself reluctant to see him go.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. "Come with me." His arms tightened around her.

Liu Shuwan fell silent. She'd been in Sword Valley for thousands of years—thousands of years where her world contained nothing but the sword. Then Qin Jiang had barged in. But the gulf between their eras was enormous. Here in Sword Valley, with no one else around, she didn't mind so much. But outside? Their relationship would invite endless gossip. Worse, Qin Jiang's elders might never accept her. In generational terms, most of the Qin family would be her juniors. Would they let Qin Jiang marry an "old woman"?

"Still worried about the age thing?" Qin Jiang asked.

Her concerns meant nothing to him. In this world, no one could interfere with his decisions. As for gossip—anyone who dared breathe a word would find their life significantly shortened. In a world of might makes right, a young patriarch of an ancient clan didn't tolerate dissent. He could silence the entire world if he had to.

"Remember what I told you on the first day?" he said gently.

Liu Shuwan looked at him. All she remembered was this rogue incessantly flirting with her.

"I said that in the future, we'll live as long as the heavens—that neither heaven could destroy us nor earth could bury us. You didn't think I was joking, did you?"

Hearing those words again, Liu Shuwan paused and countered, "Weren't you?"

Qin Jiang: "..."

He turned her to face him, his expression serious. "As a woman, you should believe in your man!"

"Who said I'm your woman?" Liu Shuwan blushed.

She clearly still didn't believe him—his claims were too fantastical. She knew her own talent; breaking through to Great Emperor would be hard enough. Anything beyond that was pure fantasy.

And yet... studying Qin Jiang, she had to admit that his talent might genuinely carry him to such heights. The problem was his lazy, carefree nature. A flicker of worry crossed her eyes—that laziness could seriously hold him back.

"Qin Jiang, I believe in your talent," she said.

He blinked. "You do?"

"If you could fix that personality of yours, I believe you could live as long as the heavens."

Qin Jiang: "..."

He shook his head. "Living as long as the heavens alone? That's a punishment, not a reward! What I want is for everyone I care about to transcend the bounds of heaven and earth! Trust me—I can lead you, all of you, beyond those limits."

His voice radiated unshakeable confidence—a charisma that left Liu Shuwan momentarily spellbound.

Qin Jiang smiled and continued, "In a few days, I might have a way to help you achieve Sword Heart."

"You're going to the bottom of Sword Valley?" Liu Shuwan knew the rumors about a treasure left by the sect's founder at the 30,000-foot depth. But they were just rumors—unverified—and no one had ever made it down there. With her own strength, the deepest she'd ever reached was about 28,500 feet before her body gave out—and she'd paid for it with injuries.

Qin Jiang nodded. His gut told him the treasure existed. The system's spoilers showed Lin Chen would break through to Sword Heart there. Now, Qin Jiang was going to snatch that opportunity first—and give it to Liu Shuwan.

"I have a feeling there's something down there that can push you to Sword Heart," he said.

But Liu Shuwan shook her head. "It's too dangerous. No one has ever been that deep. You don't know what's down there. You—"

"Relax. I'm the Sword Emperor, remember?" He cut her off. When she tried to continue, he took her hand. "Let me treat your injuries first."
