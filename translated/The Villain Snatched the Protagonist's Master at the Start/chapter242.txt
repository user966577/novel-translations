The Human Dao Sect. One of the Central Regions' three great powers, and the one with the largest number of disciples by far.

The sect was a melting pot—virtually anyone could join. There were no requirements. Even a talentless nobody could sign up: hand over some identification, receive an identity token, and just like that, you were a member.

However, leaving was another matter entirely. Departure was considered treason, punishable by sect-wide pursuit. So one had to think carefully before joining. Once in, always in.

Competition within the sect was cutthroat. Most outer disciples spent their entire lives in the outer ranks, where conditions were worse than those of an independent cultivator. But if someone managed to claw their way into the inner sect—the treatment was exceptional. The inner sect was the real Human Dao Sect.

After leaving the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, Chen Changsheng had headed straight here. Along the way, his injuries had healed somewhat—at least he looked human again, and his severed hand had been reattached.

Walking through Human Dao Sect territory, he noticed that practically everyone he passed wore a sect identity token—from beggars to merchants, barmaids to young ladies. Within the sect's sphere of influence, membership was borderline mandatory. With a token, you were safe. Without one... no guarantees.

"First step: get a token and join as an outer disciple."

Registration was simple. He didn't even need to visit the sect headquarters—any small town within their territory had a sect steward handling enrollment. He found one quickly. One person was ahead of him in line—a man in tattered clothes, clearly not well-off.

The steward, a middle-aged man, handed over a token. "Got any spirit stones?"

"I... I have one."

"This token costs one spirit stone. You're now an outer disciple of the Human Dao Sect. Every month, you'll receive one spirit stone."

"Thank you, sir!"

The man dug out a single spirit stone and traded it for the token, beaming. He had no talent himself, but he had a son. One spirit stone a month might be enough to raise the boy into something. If his son ever made inner sect... that would be the glory of a lifetime.

After profuse thanks, the man departed.

Chen Changsheng watched the scene and couldn't help a small sigh. The world was full of ordinary people. A single spirit stone could make their whole day. For them, the Human Dao Sect was a chance to change their fate—however small.

"You gonna stand there all day? You're up."

The steward looked at Chen Changsheng, who stepped forward.

"Name?"

"Chen... Chen Fan."

He used his old alias. With his current infamy, "Chen Changsheng" was a liability.

"Gender?"

"???"

"Male, got it. Age?"

"Can't remember exactly. Not yet a hundred, I think."

The steward nodded and moved on. "Cultivation level?"

"Divine Ab—uh, Heavenly Soul Realm."

The steward looked up, amused. "Not bad for your age, and you've kept yourself looking young. Good skincare routine."

"..."

Chen Changsheng shook his head and produced a spirit stone.

The steward's brow furrowed. He started to extend the token, then pulled it back.

"One thousand spirit stones."

"???"

Chen Changsheng's eyes bulged. "One thousand? The guy before me only paid one!"

"He paid one. You pay a thousand."

"Why?"

A thousand spirit stones was nothing to Chen Changsheng—but he wasn't about to swallow this lying down.

"He's a mortal. You're at the Heavenly Soul Realm. Hardly the same."

The steward rolled his eyes.

Chen Changsheng seethed. So the Human Dao Sect charged based on perceived ability. If he'd claimed a higher cultivation, they'd probably want millions.

"Hurry up. Don't waste my time."

He took a steadying breath and slapped a thousand spirit stones on the counter.

The steward's eyes glinted. That easy? Should've asked for more.

"Actually, it's ten thousand now."

"You—!"

Chen Changsheng's fury surged, but the steward merely looked at him, unimpressed. Heavenly Soul Realm versus his own Divine Ability Realm—the math wasn't complicated. 'Go ahead, get mad. I could take you with one hand tied behind my back.'

Chest heaving, Chen Changsheng weighed his options. In unfamiliar territory, with enemies on multiple fronts, he couldn't afford to make a scene. Ten thousand spirit stones wasn't much, all things considered.

"Ten thousand. Give me the token!"

He slammed down the payment.

The steward grinned, took the stones, and handed over the token. "Congratulations—you are now an outer disciple of the Human Dao Sect. Monthly dues: one hundred spirit stones."

"???"

A monthly fee? On top of the ten thousand?

"This is extortion!"

The steward shrugged. "Sect policy. Don't like it? Take it up with the Sect Master."

'And the more I can squeeze out of you, the bigger my bonus, and the better my shot at a promotion out of this backwater...'

In a flash of rage, Chen Changsheng slammed the token back on the counter. "I quit! Give me my stones back!"

"Sorry, no refunds. And..." The steward's smile turned sharp. "Our sect is easy to join, but leaving constitutes treason. You're already a member. So, Chen Fan—are you declaring yourself a traitor?"

The steward's aura flared. A spark of excitement danced in his eyes. Catching a defector was worth a bonus too.
