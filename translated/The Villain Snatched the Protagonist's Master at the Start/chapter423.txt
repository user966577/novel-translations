Of course it was a mess. Qin Jiang had personally ordered it.

In the few short years since the Chaos Plan launched, untold numbers of innocents had perished in the upheaval. Not that Qin Jiang concerned himself with that. He only cared about one thing — a Child of Destiny had actually appeared.

He reached out to Black Dragon first. Moments later, space itself tore open, and Black Dragon and the Void Beast stepped through the rift.

They approached Qin Jiang and bowed. "Greetings, Young Master. Greetings, Young Madams."

"Skip the formalities. You captured a woman — take me to see her."

"Yes, sir."

The Void Beast swept his arm, and in the next instant, spatial energy carried them all forward. In less than half an hour, they emerged before a walled courtyard.

"Young Master, the Young Madam is inside the courtyard. She's a female Emperor from Azure Cloud Heaven — we had one of our people bring her here."

Qin Jiang shot him a look. They hadn't even laid eyes on the woman yet, and Black Dragon was already calling her "Young Madam." Then again, the man did know him well.

He waved them off, pushed open the courtyard gate, and led the women inside.

Two figures occupied the yard. One was an old woman — a Great Emperor serving as a guard. She spotted Qin Jiang and immediately bowed. "This subordinate greets the Manor Lord."

"At ease."

Qin Jiang's gaze shifted to the second figure. She was already looking back at him. Features like a painting come to life — eyes that could topple kingdoms, skin like condensed jade, breathtakingly beautiful. A rare find, even by his standards.

Beside him, Liu Shuwan and the others appraised the woman and nodded to themselves. Another sister for the collection.

The old woman guard, reading the room, bowed again and quietly withdrew. Liu Shuwan exchanged glances with Lian'er, Jian Yao, and Mo Mo, then spoke up cheerfully. "Qin Jiang, we're going to take a little stroll!"

They linked hands and filed out, closing the courtyard gate behind them — then promptly pressed their ears to it, eavesdropping without the slightest attempt to mask their presence.

Qin Jiang glanced back, mildly exasperated. They weren't even bothering to conceal their auras? Still, he understood. They were creating space for him to operate freely. Not that their presence would have hampered his performance — but it might intimidate his future sister-in-law.

He walked over to the woman, offered a warm smile, and spoke. "Miss Weiwei, I presume? My subordinates acted out of line and frightened you. Rest assured, I'll see them punished."

The woman — Yue Weiwei — was taken aback. She studied Qin Jiang, completely unprepared for the fact that the master those uncouth brutes served was a refined, handsome young gentleman.

A spark of favorable impression ignited. She relaxed slightly. A man this handsome surely wasn't a bad person. And to think those ruffians had described their lord as some kind of lecherous demon, claiming she'd never escape his clutches. Looking at him now, it was obvious they harbored resentment toward their own master and were smearing his reputation. They might even be plotting to betray him.

She felt she ought to warn him.

"I'm quite alright, sir. But you... might want to keep a closer eye on your subordinates."

Her voice was soft and honeyed, the kind that made one's ears tingle.

"Oh?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "Did they wrong you?"

"No. But according to them, you're some great lecher, and no matter what I do, I'll end up as their 'Young Madam.' I think they may harbor resentment toward you and are deliberately sullying your reputation."

Qin Jiang smacked his lips and shook his head. "Those idiots, spouting the bald truth like that. They should be punished. Severely."

"???"

"Heh. Thank you for the warning, Miss Weiwei. I'll certainly discipline them. Each one will be required to consume ten thousand spirit stones and one Emperor Pill within a month."

"???"

Yue Weiwei stared, wondering if she'd misheard. Punishing them by... making them consume vast resources? That wasn't punishment — that was a reward.

"Sir, did you... mishear what I said?"

"Not at all. I heard you perfectly." Qin Jiang smiled. "They were telling the truth. Though their description of me was rather understated. But you're in luck — you'll get to experience the full depth of it firsthand."

"!!!"

Yue Weiwei's face went pale with alarm. But staring at his smiling face, the panic somehow subsided. Not a bad deal. Not a bad deal at all.

She took a steadying breath and composed herself. Whatever happened, she wouldn't be at a loss. So what was there to fear?

"What do you mean by that?" she asked.

"Would you like to find out?"

He stepped closer, smiling, and she reflexively stumbled backward. Seeing her retreat, he shook his head and sat down on a stone bench, then gestured to the one opposite. She hesitated before carefully taking a seat across from him.

"Scared?"

She shook her head. Scared wasn't quite the right word. Something about him made her uneasy, yet also... not afraid. The contradiction confused her. It probably had something to do with that face. If it were anyone else, she'd be terrified. But with someone this handsome, even the threat of danger didn't register the same way.

"You seem nervous. Is it because you have a sweetheart? Afraid I'll sully your virtue?" He was teasing now.

Yue Weiwei's heart skipped. A face flashed through her mind — but she dismissed it just as quickly. She shook her head. "No."

She had a junior brother who'd been attentive and earnest, and she'd been somewhat touched by his devotion. But he wasn't her sweetheart. Her sweetheart should be...

She glanced at Qin Jiang, and the outline of that ideal grew a little sharper. Her heart began to race, pounding like a startled deer.

"No sweetheart?"

She nodded, her voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "Not before."

"Not before?"

Qin Jiang smiled. He knew from the plotline that the Child of Destiny's pursuit of Yue Weiwei had only progressed to the courtship phase. Perhaps she'd developed a faint fondness for him by now. But with Qin Jiang's appearance in the picture, that fragile fondness didn't stand a chance.
