While Li Yang wallowed, Li Qingqiu found herself surrounded.

"Qingqiu, you're *freezing!* What's with this cold?"

"Qin Jiang, don't just stand there! Warm her up!"

"Little sister, this brute hasn't bullied you, has he?"

"If he has, just tell us. We'll get revenge in bed!"

An Xihe and the others descended on her in a whirlwind of warmth and sisterly affection. Li Qingqiu, who had never experienced anything remotely like this, was completely overwhelmed. Not a single word came out. Her ice-queen composure crumbled. Helpless, she cast a pleading look at Qin Jiang.

When the women had chattered for some time without a single response, he finally intervened. "All right, all right. Qingqiu's a mute. She can't talk."

"???"

Li Qingqiu shot him a furious look. This man could shatter her composure in a single sentence. Today had been nothing but anger.

"A mute?" The women blinked and turned to her with genuine surprise. Now that they thought about it, she really hadn't said a word this whole time.

"I am *not.*"

Finally — one sentence, squeezed out under the weight of all those stares. She was simply bad with words, not mute!

The women turned on Qin Jiang. "She can obviously talk! Stop making things up."

"She can talk, sure. But practically speaking, she might as well be mute." He shrugged.

Li Qingqiu glared. He'd been groping her the entire walk here, and now he was calling her a mute on top of it? Insufferable!

An Xihe lightly smacked Qin Jiang, then patted Li Qingqiu's shoulder. "Ignore him. Whatever he did to you today, remember it. When we get home, we'll rally the sisters and get you payback."

Rally the sisters? There were *more?*

Right. The ancestor had said this man was a colossal pervert. Of course there were more women. At least a dozen, probably.

As the women's enthusiasm tapered, Li Qingqiu managed a few words here and there — mostly nods, headshakes, and the occasional "mm." For her, that was remarkably sociable.

By evening, the others had retired to their rooms, leaving Qin Jiang and Li Qingqiu alone outside. They sat close together. She was rigid with tension.

Qin Jiang wrapped an arm around her. Like hugging a block of ice — but a wonderfully soft one. She shifted uneasily, stole a glance at him, and moistened her lips. "They said you like eating melons you have to twist off the vine. So... if I'm obedient, will you skip the potent remedy?"

"Oh?" His eyebrow rose, and a grin spread across his face. "That's creative logic. Want to... test the theory?"

"You really like forced melons?"

"I do, actually."

A strange look entered her eyes. "Pervert," she murmured.

From the women's chatter, she'd picked up quite a bit. Most memorably: many of the sisters had been "acquired" through force, then gradually fallen for him. He apparently enjoyed that dynamic. During roleplay, they'd even re-enact it.

Which meant her own resistance was hitting exactly the right buttons. Keep fighting and she'd probably be devoured tonight.

But if she went along — maybe he'd lose interest? The women had mentioned that one sister had offered herself willingly, only for Qin Jiang to insist she resist first. Still, compliance seemed safer overall.

Decision made, Li Qingqiu blushed faintly. Being obedient felt... embarrassing. But the alternative — the "remedy's" proportions — inspired genuine fear. She'd break. It would destroy her.

Better to comply and survive.

She steeled herself. Her rigid posture softened. She leaned into him, resting her head on his shoulder, close enough to hear his heartbeat. This counted as obedient, right?

Qin Jiang's lips quirked — then smoothed. He frowned and leaned away. "Li Qingqiu, what are you doing?"

It worked! Joy flared in her chest. She'd gone soft, and he'd flinched. If she kept this up, he'd want nothing to do with her.

Remembering the women's flirtatious moves, she began to copy them. A small hand on his chest. A honeyed voice: "Qin Jiang~"

He shivered. 'This girl,' he thought. 'Ice queen on the surface, total airhead underneath.' She'd actually believed submissiveness would work — and she'd announced her strategy to the target beforehand. Like telling the mark about the con before running it. But watching her bumble through it was entertaining, so he played along.

Sensing the shiver, Li Qingqiu doubled down. Just a little more and he'd be completely turned off.

She locked her arms around his neck and kissed him. Her first kiss was already gone — what was one more? As long as it made him let her go.

Their lips met. Her ice-attribute spiritual energy seemed to smolder. Qin Jiang's arms crushed her against him, nearly absorbing her into his body. The light kiss deepened fast.

Something felt wrong. Wasn't he supposed to be repulsed? Instead, she was losing ground by the second.

When he finally pulled back, she gasped for air. His face wore an unmistakable smirk.

Li Qingqiu stared. Then her cheeks flushed scarlet. "You lied to me!"
