The Myriad Pill Assembly's elimination rounds would take at least a month. Alchemists would be culled in waves until only a hundred remained.

Qin Jiang and the Pill Emperor dropped by to watch from time to time. He'd also locked onto his target—Chen Changsheng, the Child of Destiny—though he left him alone for now.

One afternoon, after a brief visit to the arena, Qin Jiang returned to the courtyard. All the women were lounging about except for Lian'er. He glanced at her closed door. She'd been holed up in there for days, sneaking around, doing god-knows-what. And the looks she'd been giving him lately were... odd.

He'd considered investigating, but after a moment's thought, decided to respect her privacy.

As long as she wasn't in danger, it was fine.

He settled into a chair beneath the vine canopy. A pleasant breeze drifted by. The Pill Emperor sat across from him, with Jian Yao and the others nearby.

The Pill Emperor rested her chin on her hand. "Qin Jiang, have you found my master yet?"

"No." He shook his head.

Disappointment flickered across her face. Qin Jiang shrugged. "Divination has its limits. Last time, I risked backlash from the Heavenly Dao just to divine those details about you. Your master isn't ordinary—he's extremely hard to track."

The Pill Emperor shot him a look. 'This man's greatest talents all get spent on women.'

Still, she understood. Chen Changsheng had been through multiple reincarnations—even an immortal-path cultivator might struggle to divine his whereabouts.

She sighed softly. Truth be told, finding Chen Changsheng didn't feel as urgent as before. Because of Qin Jiang, she'd even started thinking—maybe she should stop looking altogether. After all, reincarnation made him a different person. He wasn't the master she remembered.

More importantly, Qin Jiang seemed to dislike the idea of her old master.

But abandoning the search entirely felt ungrateful. The Pill Emperor's eyes swam with indecision, her mood restless.

Then she looked at Qin Jiang's warm smile, and the restlessness gradually melted away. Her heart, just like her body, had grown a deeper attachment to him.

The Myriad Pill Assembly raged on.

Several alchemists had already distinguished themselves. One young man, in particular, drew considerable attention.

In a viewing chamber, the Heavenly Pill Palace elders watched glowing orbs that displayed live feeds of each competitor's progress. They nodded approvingly.

"The quality this year is noticeably higher."

"Heh, some reclusive old masters came out of seclusion to compete. Of course the level is higher. But I didn't expect a young man to hold his own against those veterans."

Their gazes converged on a single orb.

Inside it: Chen Changsheng.

"According to his registration, this young man is only thirty years old," one elder said, impressed. "Yet he's already successfully refined Saint-grade pills during the trials. That talent surpasses even the Saintess."

"I've observed his technique. Saint-grade refinement looks effortless for him. I suspect he's a Supreme-grade alchemist."

"Supreme-grade? That's impossible. At thirty, producing Saint-grade pills is already extraordinary—"

"Heh, perhaps this Assembly's dark horse will prove us all wrong."

The elders debated. Some backed him, others were skeptical. But regardless, Chen Changsheng's performance had been genuinely impressive.

"We'll see. He'll make the final hundred for certain. The real test comes then."

At that moment, Chen Changsheng was inside one of the Assembly's secret realms—a trial designed to test soul strength. For alchemists, soul power was paramount. The stronger the soul, the higher the refinement ceiling.

With ten lifetimes of accumulated experience, Chen Changsheng's soul was formidable. He could only draw on this life's power—tapping into previous lives would undo his entire reincarnation cycle—but even so, his soul strength surpassed most competitors.

Then his brow furrowed.

He looked up. Something in the air felt wrong—a subtle, malicious presence watching him.

'Is it one of the Palace's elders?'

He'd felt observation before. The elders monitored all participants. But this particular gaze carried genuine hostility.

Outside the secret realm, a new figure had joined the elders at the viewing station.

Qin Jiang.

He scanned the orbs, lingering on Chen Changsheng's. Seeing the man's wary reaction, Qin Jiang chuckled.

'Ten reincarnations—no wonder his senses are sharp.'

The elders regarded Qin Jiang with open respect. Not because of the Pill Emperor—over the past weeks, Qin Jiang's extraordinary alchemy had won them over completely. In their estimation, his skills might even surpass the Pill Emperor's. With a bit more cultivation, refining immortal-grade pills was entirely within reach.

"Any standout alchemists?" Qin Jiang asked.

The elders spoke up in turn, highlighting the top performers. Chen Changsheng received special attention.

"Young Master Qin, based on Chen Changsheng's performance, he's likely a Supreme-grade alchemist. A Supreme-grade alchemist at thirty—aside from yourself, no one could surpass that!"

In their previous lives, some of these elders had actually known Chen Changsheng. Some had even benefited from his guidance. But reincarnation had changed his name and face beyond recognition.

Qin Jiang smirked at the praise. "That impressive, huh?"

"Extremely!"

"Well then—a genius like that shouldn't be tested the ordinary way. If I recall correctly, this secret realm's difficulty can be adjusted?"

The elders blinked, immediately catching his meaning. They hesitated. "Young Master Qin, wouldn't that be unfair to Chen Changsheng?"

"How is it unfair?" Qin Jiang gave them a casual look. "Geniuses deserve special treatment."

"But..."

"Raise the difficulty. Just make sure he still makes the top hundred."

The elders stopped protesting. As long as he qualified, it wasn't technically unfair. The preliminary rankings were meaningless anyway.

Only the final showdown mattered.
