In a hidden mountain forest.

A secluded valley ringed by mountains—a world unto itself.

Beneath the dense canopy, buildings stood half-concealed among the trees, with shadows flitting between the branches.

Before one such building, a young man stood with his head bowed. Before him, a middle-aged man regarded him with a dark expression.

"You failed?

You said it was a sure thing."

The middle-aged man's voice was a low growl.

Ye Xuan was the picture of dejection. The image of Yan Yun being carried upstairs by Qin Jiang still made his heart clench.

The woman he'd had his eye on—stolen by someone else!

"Father, I didn't expect Qin Jiang to show up at Rose Casino."

Ye Xuan said bitterly.

The man before him was Ye Qingtian. To evade the Ye family's search, he'd been hiding deep in the mountains.

"Qin Jiang! It's always Qin Jiang!"

Ye Qingtian's expression was thunderous.

He'd already contacted several ancient clans and secured their backing. The moment an opening appeared, he could have returned to seize the family head position.

But now...

Because of Qin Jiang, those clans had withdrawn their support entirely.

He'd been forced back into the shadows.

Ye Xuan's infiltration of Ye City to approach Yan Yun had been aimed at Yan Shiya's Shadow Pavilion. While the organization couldn't rival the ancient clans, an assassin network under his control could throw the Ye family into chaos.

And in chaos lay opportunity.

Instead, Ye Xuan had gone out brimming with confidence and returned in disgrace—because of Qin Jiang. Again.

"Father, the Ye family has the Qin family's backing now. If we want to go back, Qin Jiang has to be dealt with first!"

Ye Xuan declared, killing intent flickering in his eyes.

Ye Qingtian gave him a sidelong glance:

"Deal with Qin Jiang, and then what—let the Qin family wipe out the Ye family?

Think for once. Our goal isn't to destroy the Ye family—it's our home. We want to control it. If the family is destroyed, what am I supposed to control?"

Looking at Ye Xuan, Ye Qingtian suddenly realized his son wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.

Sending him to approach Yan Yun might have been a mistake from the start.

Under his father's rebuke, Ye Xuan lowered his head, though hatred still smoldered in his eyes.

Seeing his useless posture, Ye Qingtian waved him off:

"That's enough. Go rest."

"Yes, Father."

Ye Xuan withdrew—but instead of resting, he slipped quietly out of the valley.

Shortly after Ye Xuan left, another figure departed the valley in silence. By his build—Ye Qingtian.

He glanced in the direction his son had gone, shook his head slightly, then flickered away in the opposite direction.

About two hours later, he arrived at a small village. The villagers spared him a glance and nothing more. Ye Qingtian's face was expressionless.

As he walked through the village, figures materialized around him.

"What are you doing here? Our patriarch made it clear—no more help."

One of them spoke.

Ye Qingtian regarded him coolly:

"Get someone who actually matters. I want to talk."

"Dream on!

There's nothing to discuss. You know the Qin family's strength—none of us are willing to provoke them."

Ye Qingtian halted, a savage expression twisting his features:

"Fine. Then I'll step into the open and expose every last one of you!"

"You—!"

"I'll give you one more chance. Get someone with authority."

Their faces darkened. They glared at him:

"Wait here!"

Half an hour later.

Inside a building, several formidable auras locked onto Ye Qingtian.

He was perfectly calm:

"If I die, our partnership goes public immediately.

Care to guess whether the Ye family will ask the Qin family to pay you all a visit?"

He swept his gaze across the room with a cold smirk.

Rage flashed across their faces, but they reined in their auras:

"Ye Qingtian, what do you want?!"

"I just want to cooperate."

"Impossible. Even if you expose us, we won't help you again."

Their previous cooperation hadn't actually harmed the Ye family. At worst, they'd pay reparations—the Qin family probably wouldn't escalate.

But continued involvement was another story entirely.

Ye Qingtian didn't seem surprised. A manic gleam entered his eyes:

"This time, I'm not asking you to help me take over the Ye family. I want to destroy it. If I can't have it, I'll burn it to the ground!

And don't worry—I won't touch Ye Ling'er. As long as she's unharmed, the Qin family won't go to war.

Besides, every ancient clan has expendable warriors. Lend them to me. After the Ye family falls, you can carve up the Ye Domain among yourselves.

You have nothing to lose."

The men exchanged glances. If the Ye family could be destroyed at the cost of some expendable fighters, the math wasn't bad at all.

Interest flickered in their eyes.

"Expendable warriors alone can't bring down the Ye family."

The Ye family's greatest asset was its deep heritage—countless ancestors accumulated over millennia, each a towering figure of their era. As long as they lived, the family stood.

"Worried about those old fossils?"

Ye Qingtian sneered.

"You can handle them?"

They looked at him.

He shook his head:

"I'm no match for them. But...

Your clans have plenty of ancestors too."

"You want our ancestors to intervene?

Absolutely not!"

They balked.

Expendable warriors were one thing, but deploying actual ancestors would be tantamount to a public confession. More importantly, the Ye family's ancestors were no pushovers—the casualties required made the venture not worth the cost.

If it were that simple, they'd have destroyed the Ye family ages ago.

Ye Qingtian pursed his lips, a calculating glint in his eyes:

"What if I could poison them?"

"Poison?"

Eyes lit up around the room. Poisons capable of incapacitating a Supreme were rare, but ancient clans had their resources. The problem was always finding an opportunity to administer them.

"You could pull that off?"

They asked skeptically.

Ye Qingtian smiled with confidence:

"Don't forget—even though I lost the succession, I still have people inside the Ye family who support me."
