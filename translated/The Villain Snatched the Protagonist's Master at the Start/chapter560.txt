After exploring the Merfolk City for a while, Qin Jiang decided to head for the center—the Merfolk Royal City, where the royal-blooded Merfolk lived. They ruled the entire city.

Before he got there, a group of Merfolk came to greet them.

"My, my! Friends from Skyreach City, this old one apologizes for the late welcome." An elderly Merfolk swam up with a broad smile, sizing up Qin Jiang with a discreet glance before adopting an inviting posture. "Would the esteemed guests care to visit our Royal City?"

"And you are?"

"Heh heh, I'm Mo Li, Third Elder of the Merfolk tribe. Just call me Old Mo."

"Old Mo." Qin Jiang smiled and nodded, then waved casually. "Lead the way. I've heard the Royal City boasts stunning scenery."

Scenery? The Third Elder blinked. The Royal City was known for its opulence, not its scenery. Still, he simply smiled and nodded—he hadn't yet identified this visitor's rank, and given that Skyreach City Elders called him master, he wasn't about to argue.

With the Third Elder leading, the group proceeded at a leisurely pace. Whenever something caught Qin Jiang's eye, Mo Li offered an explanation, playing tour guide with practiced ease.

Before long, they arrived at the Royal City. Even Qin Jiang raised his eyebrows in surprise. The entire palace complex was built from crystals of every variety, each one inlaid with Immortal Marrow. The effect was dazzling.

"Young Master Qin, please." The gates swung open and Mo Li stepped aside with a smile. They'd introduced themselves along the way.

Inside the Royal City, Qin Jiang noticed with interest that there was no water. The Merfolk around him had all shifted into human form.

Mo Li noticed his surprise and explained, "We Merfolk are human at our core. The difference is that we possess a unique affinity for the ocean. But normally, we prefer human form—it's more suitable for cultivation. That's why we built this waterless Royal City."

"You can't shift to human form underwater?"

"We can. But maintaining human form in the ocean requires a constant expenditure of energy. In a waterless environment, the shift happens naturally."

Qin Jiang marveled at the biology. How that worked was anyone's guess.

Without asking further, he looked around as they walked. Everyone in the Royal City was Merfolk—no other sea creatures—and in human form, they looked identical to regular humans.

The residents all recognized the Third Elder and bowed respectfully as he passed. Mo Li responded with brief nods, most of his attention fixed on Qin Jiang. This visitor was a handful.

Seeing Qin Jiang's gaze drift constantly, Mo Li spoke up. "Young Master Qin, I'm afraid there isn't much in the way of unique scenery within our Royal City."

"What do you mean? There's plenty."

Qin Jiang smiled, his eyes following the Merfolk coming and going, nodding approvingly. Clearly, he was quite satisfied.

Mo Li followed his gaze and twitched. So that was the kind of scenery he meant.

"I'm glad it's to your liking."

"It certainly is." Qin Jiang nodded, then turned to the Third Elder. "These Merfolk—they're not of royal blood, are they?"

"They have royal blood, but not pure enough to be classified as royalty. They're considered nobles."

"And you're a royal?"

"I am." Mo Li straightened with a hint of pride. The Merfolk placed great importance on bloodline, and royal blood meant power.

"I've heard that only royal-blooded Merfolk are true beauties. Do you have a daughter, Third Elder? Or perhaps a granddaughter?"

Mo Li's face went rigid. He looked at Qin Jiang and immediately grasped his meaning. This brat was after his granddaughter?

"I see you do." Before he could even respond, Qin Jiang had read the answer in his expression. "Well then, Third Elder, let's pay your home a visit. I'd like to make friends with your daughter or granddaughter."

Mo Li's cheek twitched.

This was bad. The Royal City had just admitted a wolf—a lecherous one.

He wanted to refuse. But behind Qin Jiang, ten Immortal Kings fixed him with unblinking stares. Could he refuse?

No. Even with an Immortal Emperor protecting the Royal City, these were Skyreach City people. If they were crossed, the entire Merfolk tribe could be annihilated before tomorrow.

Under their watchful eyes, the Third Elder sighed and nodded. "Follow me, Young Master Qin. I do have a little granddaughter, though she's quite the handful. If she causes any offense, I hope you'll be understanding."

"A handful? You mean spirited. I love spirited girls."

Mo Li managed a smile but said nothing more. Shortly, they arrived at his estate—an impressive compound befitting his status. Servants bowed as they entered, though Mo Li was too preoccupied to acknowledge them.

He led Qin Jiang to a crystal garden. The moment they drew near, silvery laughter rang out—bright and clear.

Then a great white shark burst from the garden with a girl standing on its back. She spotted the Third Elder and her eyes lit up. She tapped the shark lightly with her foot, and it carried her over in an instant.

"Grandpa, you're back~"
