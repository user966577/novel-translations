He'd just finished pampering the little fox when a tremendous tremor shook the world. An overwhelming aura surged into existence.

"It's Xihe." Qin Jiang's face lit up. Was she breaking through?

Hu Xian'er was a considerate girl. She hopped up immediately and helped him dress. Qin Jiang ruffled her hair with a grin. "Come on. Let's go see."

"Mm~"

They stepped outside. Qing Chan and the others were already hovering in the sky, gazes locked on the seal's location. Qin Jiang and the little fox rose to join them.

A blinding pillar of light punched through to the highest heavens, its terrifying energy roiling and churning. Even a True Immortal would tremble at the sight.

"The seal broke," Qing Chan said as Qin Jiang arrived. The seal should have been strong enough to hold An Xihe, requiring a True Immortal's full power to shatter. But just now, Qing Chan had felt it disintegrate in an instant — and that had been merely the passive fluctuation of An Xihe's breakthrough.

Immortal King. Terrifying didn't begin to describe it.

Qin Jiang smiled at the pillar of light. "Looks like we don't need to worry about anyone interfering with Xihe's breakthrough."

At this point, even a True Immortal would struggle to get close.

Qing Chan nodded, then added cautiously, "Still, we should stay vigilant."

"Of course." Qin Jiang scanned the surroundings. Across the Chaos District, people had gathered to gawk. He channeled spiritual energy into his voice.

"Two hours. Everyone out of the Chaos District. Violators die."

The announcement thundered across every corner of the district. Stunned silence — and then Qing Chan and the women unleashed their combined aura, laced with lethal intent. Nobody dallied. Cultivators fled the district in droves.

Within two hours, even Dao Zhen and his people had withdrawn. Only Qin Jiang and his women remained. The Chaos District was a ghost town.

"Good. Nobody can disturb Xihe now," Qin Jiang said, satisfied.

They fanned out around the light pillar, forming a perimeter with no blind spots. Meanwhile, all of Azure Cloud Heaven was convulsing. Mountains crumbled. Spiritual veins collapsed. The cultivators outside understood why — that woman was draining Azure Cloud Heaven's origin energy.

But nobody dared complain. Five True Immortals and eighteen Human Immortals had perished in the Chaos District. Protest now, and your entire clan would be next.

Many powerhouses were already calculating. Once that woman became an Immortal King, Azure Cloud Heaven would undergo a seismic shift. When that happened, choices would have to be made.

Inside the Chaos District, the pillar of light grew ever larger, though its energy was clearly being absorbed. An Xihe's aura climbed relentlessly.

They pulled back further. The pressure was intense.

Time crawled. After two solid weeks, the pillar finally faded and An Xihe's aura drew inward.

"Did she make it?" Qin Jiang murmured.

Everything seemed calm. But where was she? Why hadn't she appeared?

Before the question fully formed, a flash of movement — and the next instant, warmth and softness filled his arms.

"Huh?"

"Husband~ Did you miss me?"

An Xihe beamed up at him, resplendent in a vivid red dress, one shoulder bare, long legs wrapped around his waist, skirt riding scandalously high. Her arms circled his neck, eyes dancing with joy.

Qin Jiang recovered quickly and caught her by the waist. The crimson dress made her porcelain skin glow even brighter. She looked good enough to devour.

"Husband~" When he didn't respond fast enough, she squirmed against him with a hint of displeasure.

He tore his gaze from the view and tightened his hold. "Xihe. You broke through?"

"Mm~" She nodded softly. One hand stayed hooked around his neck while the other traced his jawline. Her smile was radiant. "I'm an Immortal King now. From this moment on, in all of Azure Cloud Heaven — no, in all the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands — you are the most honored man alive. Anyone who disrespects you, I'll kill."

Her voice was gentle, because she was speaking to Qin Jiang. But beneath the tenderness lay absolute authority and killing intent. Her man would be treated as the most exalted being in existence.

Qin Jiang blinked, then broke into a grin. "Does this mean I've hit the ultimate sugar mama jackpot?"

"Haven't you always been on a sugar mama plan?"

"..."

"But now it's the biggest sugar mama plan in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. So, husband, how do you plan to thank me?"

She pressed her face close, lips nearly brushing his. The scent of her breath was intoxicating.

Qin Jiang grinned and kissed her.

She'd been in seclusion all this time. The moment she emerged, she'd come straight to him. He knew exactly what she needed.

He kissed An Xihe deeply. When they finally parted, his lips still grazed her cheek.

"Xihe. Let me take care of you."

"Mm~"

Her eyes went misty, and she nodded shyly.

Qin Jiang glanced around. They seemed to be inside a formation — just the two of them, with no one else in sight.

"This is my natal formation. It's reached Immortal King level now. Nobody can get in."

An Xihe spoke up, shifting her body with a not-so-subtle urgency. "I've already told Qing Chan and the others, so don't worry about them coming to look for you."

She really couldn't wait.

Looking into her eager eyes, Qin Jiang didn't hesitate. With a sweep of his hand, the red dress fluttered to the ground.

An Xihe gazed at him, eyes full of tenderness — and a glint of fighting spirit. She was an Immortal King now, vastly more powerful than before. Surely this time she could take him?

The surge in strength filled her with confidence. When Qin Jiang made his move, she launched her own counteroffensive.

Aggressive. Relentless.

But as the saying went — bold at the start, flagging in the middle, spent by the end. She'd underestimated him. Her initial blitz gave way to a grinding defensive. But Qin Jiang's assault was even fiercer than her opening, and her lines buckled.

By the end, she was seriously considering begging for mercy.
