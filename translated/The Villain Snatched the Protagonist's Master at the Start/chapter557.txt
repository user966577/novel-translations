The True Spirit Slave Seals had fully consumed their Primordial Spirits. Qin Jiang could feel it—the lives and deaths of eight Immortal Kings now rested in his hands.

He glanced at An Xihe and waved. "Xihe, that's enough."

"Okay~"

The Immortal Emperor pressure receded. The city lords staggered to their feet, gazes complicated as they looked at Qin Jiang. In the end, they could only sigh and bow respectfully. "Your servants greet the master."

"No need for formalities." Qin Jiang smiled. From this moment on, these eight Immortal Kings were his core subordinates. With the True Spirit Slave Seal, betrayal was impossible.

Looking at them, Qin Jiang's grin widened. Barely arrived in the Heavenly Domain and already building a solid foundation. Good start.

The city lords straightened. They had no choice but to accept reality—under the seal, even suicide required Qin Jiang's permission, let alone any notion of rebellion.

Just then, one of them glanced around, eyes calculating. "Master, do you need more people?"

"Hm?"

"I have some friends who are also Skyreach City lords. If you need them, I could trick—ahem, I could invite them over."

A sly grin spread across the city lord's face. The others looked thoughtful. Tieshan had tricked them here. They knew other city lords too—why not return the favor?

Misery loves company, after all. They'd been enslaved. As friends, shouldn't the others keep them company?

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

But Tieshan spoke up. "Young Master Qin, the forces behind Skyreach City aren't limited to the Grand Sovereign. If you enslave too many, and those powers find out, they may target you—even with the Grand Sovereign's protection."

The entire Heavenly Domain had been created by the Grand Sovereign in conjunction with a group of apex powerhouses. Skyreach City was their creation for governing the domain. Over time, the city's power had grown too significant for even those top figures to ignore. Enslave too many lords, and they might genuinely come looking for trouble.

"There are thousands of Skyreach Cities across the Heavenly Domain," the city lord who'd made the suggestion pressed on. "Enslaving a few more won't matter. Besides, the master is the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law—a hundred or so would be fine."

Qin Jiang nodded, then caught himself. Right. He wasn't actually the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law. Better not push his luck.

Against those apex powerhouses, things could go sideways fast.

He looked at the city lords. Eight was a bit thin, admittedly. Another ten or so should be safe.

"Go ahead and invite a few more. Not too many—ten or so will do."

"Yes! Rest assured, Master, we won't disappoint!"

"Alright, get on it."

Qin Jiang waved them off, then left with An Xihe and Mu Lan. The ruined hall stood silent, occupied only by the city lords.

As Qin Jiang's figure disappeared, they slowly turned—and fixed their collective gaze on Tieshan.

Tieshan's heart clenched. He eyed them warily. "What do you think you're doing?"

"Heh."

Cold smiles all around. They'd accepted their fate, but the man responsible still needed a beating.

They surrounded Tieshan, cracking their knuckles. He tensed, threatening, "Don't try anything—I'm Young Master Qin's confidant!"

"You're his confidant?" They scoffed. "We're his true confidants—the kind who can never betray him. You're just a tool."

They exchanged glances and attacked in unison, fists and feet raining down.

In fairness, within his own Skyreach City, Tieshan could easily handle them all. But guilt made him hold back, and since they were all Qin Jiang's people now, he couldn't go all out. So he simply defended, letting them vent.

After a thorough thrashing, the others had mostly cooled off. Tieshan stood, dusting himself off with a resigned sigh. "Had enough?"

Cold snorts answered him. Clearly they hadn't, but since they all worked for Qin Jiang now, they couldn't go further—though given the chance, they'd have happily killed him.

Taking deep breaths to suppress their lingering resentment, they turned to business. "Is the master truly the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law?"

"Of course." Tieshan nodded firmly. "I may have tricked you into coming, but that much is beyond question."

"How can you be so sure?"

Tieshan snorted, looking pleased with himself. "Young Master Qin possesses a Heaven-Suppressing Seal. And go check the Myriad Realms Tower rankings—see who holds the number-one spot."

"A Heaven-Suppressing Seal? Number one in the Myriad Realms Tower?"

They all knew the Grand Sovereign's supreme treasure was the Heaven-Suppressing Divine Seal, and that the Heaven-Suppressing Seal—the Immortal King Seal—was its miniature counterpart. Possessing one meant the Grand Sovereign's personal endorsement. To date, fewer than ten such seals had been given out.

Holding the seal and claiming to be the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law? That was actually convincing.

"The master is the Myriad Realms Tower's number one?" they asked, astonished.

They kept tabs on the tower rankings, but only checked every few decades or centuries. Qin Jiang wasn't even a hundred years old and had only claimed the top spot about thirty years ago—a window they'd all missed during their seclusion.

Tieshan nodded solemnly. "That's right. Young Master Qin is the Myriad Realms Tower's number one."

Number one in the Myriad Realms Tower. No wonder the Grand Sovereign had given him a Heaven-Suppressing Seal. And with that standing, the master had no reason to lie about being the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law—someone of that caliber wouldn't fabricate such a thing.

Belief settled across their faces, followed by visible relief. Serving someone like Qin Jiang? Perhaps it wasn't such a bad deal after all.
