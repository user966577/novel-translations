The four ancestors exchanged glances. One of them — the one who wasn't Zi Fu's teacher — took it in stride. He'd actually suggested introducing Zi Fu to Qin Jiang early on.

The other three, however, looked stricken. They'd raised Zi Fu from childhood. She was as good as their own daughter — always spoiled rotten. When she'd wanted to be clan chief, the three of them had personally backed her claim. When she'd gotten bored of ruling, they'd handled the paperwork for her. Practically anything she'd ever wanted, she'd gotten.

They eyed Qin Jiang. The young man checked every box, admittedly. But he was far too much of a philanderer. Between Yu Lan, Yu Ru, and whoever else he kept on the outside, there'd be no shortage of drama. Their sweet, simple-hearted little disciple — would she be bullied?

Meanwhile, the fourth ancestor looked toward the entrance. "The former clan chief didn't come back with you?"

All three teachers turned hopeful eyes on Qin Jiang.

He shook his head. "Zi Fu stayed behind. She's in closed cultivation, pushing for the immortal path. Shouldn't take more than a few months."

Disappointment — but the mention of the immortal path brought relief. Then confusion.

"A few months? Advancing to the immortal path takes only a few months?"

"Zi Fu had some fortunate encounters. Don't worry."

Azure Cloud Heaven's spiritual energy had thinned drastically after An Xihe's breakthrough, but the Space-Time Temple was unaffected. Zi Fu had already nearly comprehended her immortal-path law. All she needed was to refine it — a few months was generous.

The three teachers relaxed, their expressions brightening. Another Human Immortal for the Snake Race. Then they realized: did Zi Fu even count as Snake Race anymore? They looked at Qin Jiang, then at Yu Lan and Yu Ru. Did the Snake Race even count as the Snake Race anymore?

Probably.

"Qin Jiang," Yu Lan spoke up, "I heard from Wan'er that you're establishing your own faction. The Snake Race has considerable strength — could we join?"

The four ancestors' mouths twitched. The Snake Race had already been infiltrated!

They coughed, about to voice an objection, when Qin Jiang simply said, "Of course."

He turned to the four ancestors with a smile. "I trust the seniors have no objections?"

Behind him, An Xihe materialized silently, her gaze cool as it swept over the four Human Immortals. A whisper of pressure escaped — enough to lock their joints and set them trembling.

Immortal King.

The rumors were true. Qin Jiang had the newly ascended Immortal King on his side.

They swallowed hard and managed stiff smiles. "Of course... no objections."

After introductions, Yu Lan and Yu Ru greeted An Xihe warmly — there was genuine admiration in their eyes. An Immortal King, the strongest in Azure Cloud Heaven, and a legendary figure who'd once fought all of Azure Cloud Heaven's immortals single-handedly. And now she was their sister.

Qin Jiang was really something. He'd even claimed their idol.

An Xihe smiled. "The Snake Race joining Qin Jiang's faction won't be a bad deal. You won't be mistreated."

"We believe in Qin Jiang," Yu Lan nodded.

As for the four ancestors — they had no say. They just needed to listen. Their opinions didn't matter.

And just like that, the Snake Race's fate was decided.

Five days later, Xue Mei's message arrived. Preparations were complete. The Horse Tribe's location was confirmed, and the Eagle Immortal's whereabouts had been pinned down.

"Is that from Xue Mei?" Yu Lan murmured, nestled against Qin Jiang. On his other side, Yu Ru was still fast asleep. He'd been spending his days with the two sisters.

He nodded. "I'm planning to elevate the Celestial Rabbit Tribe to one of the Demon Domain's three great powers. Xue Mei's been making preparations."

Yu Lan's brow furrowed. The three great powers weren't merely titles — they controlled the choicest resource-rich territories in the Demon Domain. Without real strength, holding that position would invite constant attacks from rival clans, even if they were too afraid to act openly with Qin Jiang around.

Unless Xue Mei alone had the power to cow every other clan.

She looked at Qin Jiang. If he'd already set things in motion, he must have a plan. "Does the Snake Race need to help?"

He shook his head, stroking her hair. "It's handled."

She nodded, curious but trusting. "How? Will you have An Xihe step forward to intimidate the other clans?"

"She'll intervene, but won't show herself. Remember the two Human Immortals who escaped when we killed the Black Serpent? The Horse Tribe's ancestor and the Eagle Immortal?"

"I remember. I've had people tracking them."

Warmth flooded his chest. He pulled her close and kissed her. His women, always thinking of him.

"Both of them will die by Xue Mei's hand."
