Qin Jiang stared at the person before him, puzzled. "You are..."

She was a tall woman in a pale green dress that showed off slender white calves above black high heels. Dark hair fell to her waist. Her face was alight with delight, and something sly and alluring danced in her eyes. The features looked both familiar and foreign at the same time.

"Ye Xuan?" Ye Ling'er ventured.

Qin Jiang's expression froze. His eyes went wide. This was Ye Xuan?

The person smiled and nodded. "Cousin Ling'er, it's been a while."

It really was.

Qin Jiang instinctively took two steps back. Ye Ling'er was equally stunned. The transformation was staggering. The old Ye Xuan had carried a certain femininity, but anyone could tell at a glance that she was biologically male. Every gesture had been a deliberate imitation — uncomfortable to watch.

Now, even without a trace of makeup, she looked entirely female. Every smile, every gesture carried a natural grace. She was genuinely pretty. You could still make out her original features, but they'd been softened, refined — more delicate, more alluring.

"Young Master Qin, we meet again~" She waved cheerfully, her gaze roaming over him with open admiration and a hint of wistfulness.

Qin Jiang took a steadying breath and offered a stiff nod. Unfazed by the cool reception, she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Are you and Cousin Ling'er here to see Uncle and Auntie? I know the way — the estate's changed quite a bit. Let me guide you."

After a moment's hesitation, Qin Jiang agreed. She walked alongside them, pointing out changes to the Ye estate, unbothered by whether Qin Jiang responded. Before long, they reached a quiet courtyard.

"This is Uncle and Auntie's home. You two go ahead — I won't intrude."

She glanced at Qin Jiang one last time and turned to leave. But he called out. "Wait."

"Yes, Young Master Qin?"

"This is a Body Restoration Pill. Emperor-grade. It can heal nearly any injury for those below Great Emperor cultivation." He produced a pill. "Including your... situation."

Over the years, the Ye family had been a loyal vassal. Ye Qingtian had performed well, and Ye Xuan had contributed too. Her destiny aura had faded long ago — helping her was no great cost.

But she simply smiled and shook her head. "Young Master Qin, I like who I am now."

Fair enough. She'd done it to herself, after all. It hadn't been forced.

Still, knowing what he knew, the whole thing was deeply unsettling. She looked like any other woman, but the backstory made it impossible not to squirm.

Seeing his furrowed brow, she laughed softly, her eyes tracing over him one last time. "Don't worry, Young Master Qin. Xuan'er does like you — just a tiny bit. But Xuan'er also knows that this body is too tainted for someone like you. I won't sully you."

She'd long since changed her written name to reflect who she'd become.

With a wistful sigh, she turned and walked away.

Qin Jiang stood rigid, goosebumps erupting across his skin. A chill ran through him. He turned to Ye Ling'er — he needed purification. Immediately.

Ye Ling'er obligingly pressed close, laying a gentle hand on his chest, a smile playing at her lips. This was a rare state for him.

After several moments, Qin Jiang dipped his head and kissed her deeply. When he came up for air, the tension had eased. "Much better. My Ling'er is the best."

She smiled warmly, rose on tiptoe, and kissed his lips. "How about now?"

"Almost there."

He grinned, leaning toward her with pursed lips. She gave him a playful swat, then kissed him again. The chill finally dissipated.

Hand in hand, they approached the courtyard and knocked. The door opened moments later.

"Mother." "Auntie."

Ye Ling'er's mother stood in the doorway. Surprise flashed across her face, followed by delight. "Ling'er! Little Jiang! Come in, come in."

She ushered them inside eagerly. Ye Ling'er looked around. "Where's Father?"

"Oh, him. Busy as always — hasn't been home in days." The Ye family's rapid expansion kept its entire leadership swamped. Ye Lingtian going months between visits home wasn't unusual, though Ye Ling'er's mother helped where she could.

"But since you two are here, I'll send for him right away."

Qin Jiang waved her off. "Auntie, if he's busy, there's no need to disturb him. Ling'er and I will be staying in Qin Domain for a while — there'll be plenty of chances to meet."

"Mother, you can always visit me at the Qin estate," Ye Ling'er added.

Ye's mother settled across from them. "These past years, the Ye family has grown so much thanks to your family's support."

"Auntie, we're all family. It's only natural."

"Ha, yes — we are family." She was clearly pleased with her son-in-law.

After a few pleasantries, the conversation shifted to mother-daughter catching up. Eventually, the topic drifted to a certain someone.

"By the way, do you remember Ye Xuan?"

Qin Jiang stiffened. Ye Ling'er hid a smile. "Actually, Cousin Xuan led us here."

"You've already seen her?"

"Mm. I really didn't expect such a dramatic change."

"Right? These days, she's indistinguishable from any other woman — more feminine than most, honestly." She turned a teasing eye on Qin Jiang. "I hear Ye Xuan has always been rather fond of you, Little Jiang."
