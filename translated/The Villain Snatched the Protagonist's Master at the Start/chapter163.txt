Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

His Taotie Divine Body activated, and every particle of powder was sucked into his body before it could settle.

Lian'er stared at him, eyes wide with anticipation.

But...

She blinked. Qin Jiang looked down at her. They stared at each other.

"Bro... are you okay?" she stammered.

Qin Jiang spread his hands. He'd figured it out the moment the powder hit—this was all Lian'er's doing.

As for the purpose...

That powder was a knockout drug. No, wait—not just a knockout drug. There was something else mixed in.

His brow twitched. He looked at Lian'er. This girl's intentions were getting very questionable.

"I'm fine." He smiled. "Looks like someone booby-trapped your courtyard."

Lian'er: "..."

Plan failed. She trudged back to the Heavenly Pill Palace, the picture of deflation.

The instant she was in her room, she huddled with the Immortal Fire to analyze what went wrong.

'Summarize, regroup, try again.'

Her brother hadn't noticed, after all. And even if he had—what was he going to do about it? He'd probably just hand himself over on a silver platter.

But Lian'er had her pride. She wanted to pull this off on her own terms.

"Immortal Fire, we keep going. I refuse to believe there's nothing that can get past him!"

The Immortal Fire bobbed in the air, flickering thoughtfully as it too brainstormed their next move.

The elimination rounds concluded.

Over a hundred thousand alchemists had been whittled down to just one hundred.

What followed was the Grand Refinement—the final competition. No complex rules, no gimmicks. Pure alchemy, head to head. Whoever produced the best pill won.

The champion would earn the title of Pill King, along with a single chance at the Pill Fire Tempering.

This Pill Fire was condensed from the dying flames of countless Heavenly Pill Palace ancestors—accumulated over millennia. The Pill Fire Tempering could shatter an alchemist's bottleneck, dramatically enhance their affinity with flames, and even grant access to the legacies of ancient masters.

Only one slot was available. The cost of each Tempering was enormous.

The final showdown took place in the Heavenly Pill Palace's Myriad Pill Plaza.

A hundred alchemists had already chosen their stations, seated cross-legged and adjusting their states for peak performance. The Palace elders watched from the elevated platform, with spectators filling the seats beyond.

A collective gasp swept through the crowd as two figures emerged and made their way toward the platform.

"The Pill Emperor! That's the Pill Emperor!"

The crowd erupted. Since her brief appearance on opening day, the Pill Emperor had been completely absent. Everyone had been hoping she'd show up for the finale.

She didn't disappoint.

But—

"Who's the man beside her?"

"He's so young—and she's smiling at him. Their relationship seems... unusual."

"I've seen that young man! He's the one with the immortal-path bodyguards who forced the Heavenly Pill Palace to back down before the Assembly started."

"Immortal-path bodyguards? Must be some great family's genius."

"Even so, the Pill Emperor wouldn't act like that just because of bodyguards..."

The spectators watched Qin Jiang and the Pill Emperor ascend the platform together, chatting and laughing. The looks they exchanged were unmistakable.

Especially the Pill Emperor's gaze—it practically had hearts in it.

The elders glanced once and immediately averted their eyes. They were well aware of the relationship by now. No one dared comment.

Besides, Qin Jiang's alchemy had earned their genuine respect. They approved of him.

"Pill Emperor, Young Master Qin." The elders bowed.

The Pill Emperor acknowledged them with a nod, then surveyed the hundred competitors in the plaza. Most were renowned alchemists. A few dark horses had emerged—Chen Changsheng among them.
