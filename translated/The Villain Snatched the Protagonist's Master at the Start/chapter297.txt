Chen Qi'er's lips trembled. From the sound of it, these two had come specifically to provoke him. And Chen Baizhe had played along without hesitation—even looked up at Qin Jiang afterward, eagerly seeking praise.

Qin Jiang couldn't resist. He dipped his head and kissed her deeply.

This wife was too precious.

Chen Baizhe wasn't a natural provocateur. She simply spoke the truth—and every honest word cut deeper than any insult could have.

As the saying goes, it's not lies that wound; it's the truth that kills.

Her words had lodged themselves in Chen Qi'er's chest like daggers. And now, watching Qin Jiang kiss her, Human Immortal-level perception let him observe every detail in agonizing clarity.

How shameless. Kissing like that in public.

Chen Baizhe pushed gently at him after a moment, her body softening against his. "Not here," she breathed, glancing back at Chen Qi'er. "When we get home."

That tender, yielding side of her—the side she showed only to Qin Jiang—was a blade aimed squarely at Chen Qi'er. The most beautiful version of her was reserved exclusively for his enemy.

She took a steadying breath, turned to Chen Qi'er, and her expression hardened into pure disgust. "What are you staring at? Disgusting."

She hadn't forgotten her mission. Any opening, and she took a shot.

Something snapped inside Chen Qi'er.

Before today, he'd imagined killing Qin Jiang and taking Chen Baizhe back. He'd have overlooked the past. He wouldn't have held it against her.

But the woman standing before him now—was this even someone worth saving?

She'd fallen. Completely.

Was there still any point in getting her back?

A dark thought surged, one he'd buried before but could no longer contain.

Destroy her. If he couldn't have her, no one would. She was a stain on his existence, and he would erase it.

The madness in his eyes grew, his aura swelling dangerously.

Chen Baizhe noticed. But before she could act, Qin Jiang took her hand and spoke mildly. "No need. Brother Dao Zhen, stop spectating—this one's gone unhinged."

Dao Zhen materialized between them, wearing an expression of weary resignation. This boy really had nothing better to do than come here and poke a hornet's nest. Using Chen Baizhe, no less.

He glanced at Chen Qi'er with genuine pity. The poor bastard didn't deserve this.

But allegiances were what they were. And Dao Zhen knew exactly how much firepower stood behind Qin Jiang. Chen Qi'er didn't have a prayer.

"Stand down," Dao Zhen said flatly. "You won't be causing trouble with me here."

From behind him, Qin Jiang called out, "Brother Dao Zhen—just talking isn't enough. Give him a proper beating. He went after my dear brother Changsheng, remember? Payback is in order!"

"..."

Dao Zhen's mouth twitched. "My dear brother Changsheng"—sure. Once this man was done playing, that "dear brother" would be the first to get a knife in the back.

But Qin Jiang had spoken, and Chen Qi'er was already on the defensive. The gap between Human Immortal and True Immortal was not something willpower could bridge.

Chen Qi'er couldn't land a single blow.

Qin Jiang and Chen Baizhe settled onto a nearby bench to watch, offering commentary and ratings like ringside judges. Chen Baizhe's enthusiastic cheering at every hit was the cruelest part—laughter on one side, screams of pain on the other.

After a thorough thrashing, Dao Zhen dropped Chen Qi'er's limp body at Chen Wuming's feet. He hadn't held back—Qin Jiang's orders. The beating served a practical purpose beyond humiliation: it narrowed the power gap between Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng. At full strength, the fight between them was too one-sided to be interesting.

"Get lost," Dao Zhen waved.

Only then did Chen Wuming dare gather his master and flee.

Dao Zhen turned around. Qin Jiang and Chen Baizhe were already at a food stall, snacking happily—entertainment and refreshments, all while he did the dirty work.

Unbelievable.

He walked over. One look at Chen Baizhe confirmed his suspicion: his grand-disciple had been thoroughly corrupted by Qin Jiang. Then again, for the Human Dao Sect, that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. They'd never exactly been paragons of virtue.

"Anything else you need from me?"

Qin Jiang smiled. "Actually, yes."

"What?"

A jade bottle appeared. Qin Jiang plucked out a single pill and held it up. "Give this to Chen Changsheng."

"..."

Dao Zhen accepted it without asking questions. Whatever it was, it wasn't good for Chen Changsheng. He'd just slip it in with the other medicines.

"Anything else?"

Qin Jiang shook his head, and Dao Zhen departed to deliver the pill.

After he left, Chen Baizhe leaned in curiously. "What kind of pill was that?"

"Oh, it's a fun little thing," Qin Jiang grinned. "Works between a man and a woman..."

He explained. The pill had come from the system—specifically prompted by Qing Chan's offhand suggestion about drugging An Xihe back during the restaurant date. Curious, Qin Jiang had asked the system if such a thing existed for immortal-path cultivators, whose bodies were immune to most drugs.

It did. System-formulated, with a twist: it didn't activate immediately. It needed a trigger.

He hadn't had occasion to use it until now. Chen Changsheng would get one dose, and Chen Qi'er would get another. One man and one "woman"—the possibilities were delightful.

Hearing the explanation, Chen Baizhe blushed. Then, with a note of curiosity she couldn't quite suppress: "Do you... have more of those?"

"Sure."

"Could we use one? When we're together?"

"..."

Qin Jiang shook his head. "Not this kind. It's toxic—designed to overpower immortal-level resistance. Side effects include physical damage and what amounts to mind control. Not exactly a good time."

In the old days, when his women were weaker, mild aphrodisiacs had been harmless fun. But now, at their cultivation levels, anything potent enough to have an effect came with serious drawbacks. Even his own Kidney Treasure Pills had been reformulated multiple times as his power grew, each version requiring increasingly rare ingredients.

Chen Baizhe looked disappointed. She'd been hoping to gain an edge—just once, she wanted to turn the tables on him.

Seeing her expression, Qin Jiang laughed and pulled her close. "You've already got plenty of backup. Still not satisfied?"

"Hmph." She gave him a look. If she could, she'd rather have him all to herself. It would be tiring, certainly—but the exclusivity would be worth it. Unfortunately, with a husband this exceptional, exclusivity was a fantasy. That face alone had women lining up. Even the other wives had admitted as much during their girl talks: most of them had been smitten from the very first look. Propriety and pride had kept them composed, but Qin Jiang's aggressive pursuit had given them the excuse to surrender.

In truth, he coveted beauty, and they coveted him right back. The only difference was that he was shameless about it while they were consummate actresses—all of them except Qing Chan, who had never bothered pretending. An Xihe wasn't much better, having essentially abducted him outright.

Chen Baizhe smiled to herself. Her own first meeting with Qin Jiang had made her eyes light up. She hadn't shown it, of course—but the very next day, he'd gotten her drunk. If not for that face, she'd never have given him the chance.

She gazed at him, fondness welling up. So handsome.

Leaning in, she kissed his cheek. A face this good was made for kissing. And when one set of lips wasn't enough, well—there were alternatives.

"Why are you staring at me like that?" Qin Jiang shifted uncomfortably.

Chen Baizhe smiled. "Because my husband is gorgeous, and I like looking."

Qin Jiang blinked. Baizhe being this forward was a first. He gathered her up, voice dropping low. "How about we continue the looking at home?"

"Mm. But be gentle this time, okay?"

"Deal."
