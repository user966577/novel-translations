Dragon Nest. Outside the Myriad Realms Tower.

Qin Jiang had been unceremoniously ejected. On the Record Stone beside him, his name blazed at the very top, its radiance lingering long after his exit.

Everyone was stunned beyond words. Even Long Yu stared in open disbelief.

Number one on the Myriad Realms Tower.

"How is that possible?" he muttered. A spoiled young lord who relied on family power—how could he have talent like that?

His confidence had been battered again and again. The fight had drained from him entirely.

Qin Jiang spared the Record Stone a glance and clicked his tongue. Evicted, just like that!

He'd been hoping to sneak back in later and siphon off a small amount of energy—surely that would go unnoticed. But now the door was shut entirely.

"Cheapskate," he grumbled.

Back among the women, Qin Lian'er's eyes sparkled. "Bro, you're amazing! Number one on the Myriad Realms Tower! You're the greatest genius in all the myriad realms!"

The others were beaming too. They'd always known Qin Jiang was gifted, but exactly how gifted had been hard to quantify. Now they had their answer: the myriad realms' number one genius. Concrete and undeniable.

Surrounded by the group, Qin Jiang swept his arm out. Streams of pure energy flowed toward each woman.

"Is this..."

"Myriad Realms Tower energy?"

"So much!"

Their eyes went wide as they turned to Qin Jiang, baffled at how he'd managed it. He'd devoured so much energy that even the tower's creator had intervened—that spoke volumes about the sheer quantity he'd taken. What he shared now was only a fraction. The bulk remained sealed inside him.

He'd let them digest this first, then share more later. Or, in a crisis, the stored energy could fuel a devastating burst of power. Not that a crisis was likely. Liu Shuwan was always at his side, Fourth Ancestor and the others were a shout away, and now he had the Immortal King Seal—a weapon capable of killing immortal-path powerhouses. Its only limitation was the element of surprise; if an immortal-path cultivator sensed it coming, Qin Jiang might not get the chance to use it.

After Qin Jiang's ejection, the tower slowly recovered. Liu Shuwan was still inside—anyone who'd achieved Sword Heart wasn't lacking in talent, and her name soon appeared on the rankings.

Qin Jiang's speed had been so absurd that she hadn't even made the list by the time he came out. Compared to anyone else, though, she was anything but slow. It just looked that way next to a freak like Qin Jiang.

He waited about four hours. Liu Shuwan climbed straight into the top hundred, settling near Little Red's rank before exiting. Her realm hadn't changed much, but her aura was noticeably deeper and more substantial.

"Qin Jiang, you reached first?" She stared at the summit of the Record Stone, where his name still blazed—every other name paling beside it.

He shrugged. First place? Easy.

Of course, he'd cheated. Apart from Little Red and Qin Lian'er, he'd devoured every other opponent before they even materialized. But the ability to cheat was a form of strength in itself. Not everyone could pull that off.

Over the following days, Qin Jiang's group visited several more fortune sites. With him bulldozing a path, the rewards piled up. Nearly every site brought a run-in with Long Yu, and Qin Jiang swiped his fortunes each time. Long Yu seethed but never dared speak up.

In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed inside the Dragon Nest. Twenty days remained to exit—anyone who didn't make it out in time would be stuck until the nest reopened a century later. And in all of history, no one had ever survived a hundred years inside.

On this particular day, Qin Jiang's group came upon a palace. Before it stretched stairs of gleaming jade, step after step, and the palace itself was awash in gold and splendor. Opulence dripped from every surface.

"This is the Dragon Palace," Long Xin'er said. "We also call it the Immortal Palace. Legend says it was left by the founding ancestor of the Divine Dragon Empire—the most precious thing in this entire Dragon Nest."

According to tradition, the empire's founder had been a true divine dragon. The current royal family all carried dragon bloodline—the purer the blood, the greater the achievement. This Dragon Palace was the founder's legacy.

The founder had been an immortal-path powerhouse, long since fallen. Inside the palace rested a Dragon Pearl she'd left behind—the crystallization of an immortal's entire cultivation. It was the Divine Dragon Empire's final inheritance.

And it was Long Yu's greatest fortune.

Beside Qin Jiang, Long Xin'er gazed at the Dragon Palace with burning eyes.

"Xin'er, want what's inside?" Qin Jiang asked.

She nodded without hesitation. The legacy of an immortal-path founder—who wouldn't?

"But the Dragon Palace can only be entered by members of the imperial bloodline."

If Qin Jiang could set foot inside, the treasures would be his for the taking. But apart from those with the royal bloodline, no one could even step onto the stairs.

Or rather, the stairs were the test. Ninety-nine steps in total, and to this day, no one had ever walked them all. Only those with exceptional talent and pure bloodline could ascend higher.

Long Xin'er wasn't confident she could complete all ninety-nine.

And she had a rival to contend with.

"Not necessarily," Qin Jiang replied with a smile.

Any rule crumbled before absolute power. His own power wasn't quite sufficient—but the Immortal King Seal was.

On the stairs, imperial scions had already begun climbing. Long Yu was among them, in the lead by a wide margin.

Liu Shuwan and the others, hearing Long Xin'er's explanation, pressed forward curiously to test the first step. A tremendous force repelled them instantly. Only Liu Shuwan, leveraging her Great Emperor cultivation, managed to force her way onto a single stair. She retreated quickly, shaking her head.

"The repulsion is too strong. Even with my cultivation, I couldn't get far if I brute-forced it."

Awe flickered in her eyes. So this was an immortal's power—fallen for eons, yet the rules they'd left behind could still give a Great Emperor pause.

Long Xin'er stepped onto the first stair. There was pressure, but far less than what Liu Shuwan had endured. She turned back to speak: "This part I'll have to do alone—"

Before she could finish, Qin Jiang stepped up beside her, casual as could be. He stood level with her, showing no strain whatsoever.

He took a moment to feel for the pressure. Nothing. He smiled at Long Xin'er.

"I'll keep you company."
