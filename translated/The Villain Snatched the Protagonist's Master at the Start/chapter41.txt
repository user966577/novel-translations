"Qin Jiang, these little towns have such a cozy atmosphere."

Ye Ling'er clung to Qin Jiang's arm, bouncing along, her bright eyes darting everywhere with curiosity.

"You like it?"

Qin Jiang wrapped an arm around her waist and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead.

Ye Ling'er blushed slightly. Noticing that no one around them was paying attention, she relaxed and stood on tiptoe to peck his lips.

Qin Jiang's mouth curved:

"If you like it, once you're carrying our child, we'll find a little town like this to stay in for a while."

"Mm, okay~"

Ye Ling'er's cheeks turned pink, but she nodded sweetly, instinctively touching her belly with what looked like anticipation.

What she didn't know was that a pair of eyes in the shadows was tracking her every move.

Xiao Fan's fists were clenched so tight his knuckles cracked. Looking like this was entirely their doing. Over these past days, his hatred for the two of them had reached its breaking point.

But now that they stood before him, cowardice crept back into his heart.

"Hey, Qin Jiang, look at that weird guy. It's this hot out and he's wrapped head-to-toe in black cloth."

Ye Ling'er's gaze happened to sweep across the peculiar figure.

Qin Jiang smiled knowingly. He knew perfectly well this was Xiao Fan:

"Maybe...

He's just really ugly."

"Nobody wraps themselves up like that just because they're ugly. I think he must have done something terrible and is afraid of being recognized."

"Ha, you might be right, Ling'er."

The couple chatted softly. Ordinary people couldn't have heard them, but Xiao Fan—though his Fire Divine Body was half-destroyed and cultivation was beyond him—still retained enough of his former strength to catch every word.

The flames of rage inside him burned higher.

And then—

Two cultivators near Xiao Fan got into some dispute and started fighting in the middle of the street. A stray shockwave caught Xiao Fan.

Riiip~

The black cloth hiding his face was torn to shreds, exposing a wrinkled, ruined countenance to the open air. His features were barely discernible.

The street fell deathly silent.

"AHHH! A ghost!"

The beggars closest to Xiao Fan screamed first, scrambling and tumbling over each other to get away.

Passersby, seeing the face, recoiled in alarm.

"What the hell is that?!"

"Scared the life out of me. Thought I was seeing a ghost in broad daylight."

"Damn, looking like that, maybe don't go out for a stroll? You'll scare people to death."

"Right? In broad daylight, no less."

"Imagine at night."

Each taunt landed like a knife. Xiao Fan stood frozen. Sunlight fell on his face, but all he felt was a deep, bone-chilling cold.

Ye Ling'er gasped at the sight and buried her face in Qin Jiang's chest. Peeking out, she whispered:

"So he really is ugly."

Qin Jiang had seen Xiao Fan's appearance through the system before, but seeing it up close was still jarring. The man was truly pitiful.

Without the system's prompt, he genuinely wouldn't have recognized this as Xiao Fan.

Neither could Ye Ling'er.

Finally, Xiao Fan snapped. His body convulsed, on the brink of collapse:

"Shut up!

All of you, shut up!!!"

He screamed, and his wild-eyed desperation only frightened onlookers further.

Qin Jiang blinked and looked down at Ye Ling'er:

"Ling'er, does that voice seem familiar to you?"

"Huh?"

Ye Ling'er was startled.

Xiao Fan's throat had been burned too, slightly altering his voice. But if you listened carefully, you could still recognize it. Only, Ye Ling'er's heart was so full of Qin Jiang now that she could barely register anything else.

Besides, who would ever imagine Xiao Fan looking like this?

"That voice—doesn't it sound a bit like... Xiao Fan?"

Qin Jiang guided her.

Ye Ling'er's eyes widened. She studied Xiao Fan again. His appearance told her nothing; even his build had been distorted by the burns.

His voice, though...

She frowned, thinking back:

"It does seem..."

BOOM!!!

Xiao Fan finally lost control. His frenzied aura erupted, but with his damaged meridians, the outburst immediately wrecked his body. Blood poured from his mouth.

Ye Ling'er's eyes went wide—that aura...

"Qin Jiang, it really is Xiao Fan!"

"Kill you! I'll kill you both!"

Xiao Fan howled, eyes bloodshot, looking every bit the demon.

Qin Jiang shouted:

"Xiao Fan!"

Xiao Fan flinched. He turned to face Qin Jiang and Ye Ling'er, and their reaction confirmed everything. Ye Ling'er was certain now. This truly was Xiao Fan.

But how had he ended up like this?

She didn't know what to feel.

Xiao Fan stared at them. Then, suddenly, a twisted grin split his ruined face:

"Adulterers! I'll kill you both!"

He charged at them with a scream.

Qin Jiang frowned and swatted him aside with a single palm. Glancing around, he swept Xiao Fan up with a wave of spiritual force and carried him away from the crowd.

In a narrow alley, Qin Jiang dropped Xiao Fan on the ground.

"Damn you!

Qin Jiang, you deserve to die! And you, Ye Ling'er, you faithless whore—you deserve it even more!

I'll kill you both!"

Xiao Fan had gone completely unhinged—or rather, the pressure he'd been bottling up for so long had finally erupted.

Hearing those words, Ye Ling'er's lips parted in disbelief. She couldn't fathom that Xiao Fan would speak to her this way.

"Shut your mouth!"

Qin Jiang barked.

He backhanded Xiao Fan across the face, sending every tooth flying.

His other hand was clasped tight around Ye Ling'er's.

"Qin Jiang..."

Ye Ling'er squeezed his hand. Seeing the cold fury on his face, warmth bloomed in her chest. She knew his anger was on her behalf.

"Qin Jiang, don't be angry. He's not worth it~"

She said gently.

Qin Jiang took a deep breath. Xiao Fan lay on the ground like a dead dog, unconscious.

"Ling'er, let me kill him."

Qin Jiang's voice was flat and cold.

Ye Ling'er hesitated. Qin Jiang had already spared Xiao Fan many times. If she pleaded for mercy again now...

She bit her lip and looked away from Xiao Fan:

"You... decide for yourself."

Qin Jiang's expression softened. He took her hand:

"Fine. I'll let it go, for my Ling'er's sake."

He shook his head and led Ye Ling'er out of the alley. Only, she didn't see the throat-slitting gesture he made behind his back.

After that, neither of them felt like shopping. They returned to the Void Palace.

Before long, Black Dragon appeared at Qin Jiang's side:

"Young Lord, it's been taken care of."

"Good. Don't let Ling'er find out.

And send someone to deal with the Xiao family as well."
