The Grand Elder staggered, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. A mere flare of her aura had injured him—even in her compromised state. The power of an Immortal Emperor was no joke.

His eyes burned with desire. Once he took her, he'd become the new Immortal Emperor. But caution reasserted itself. The prize was within reach—no need to be reckless.

He wiped the blood away and retreated to a safe distance. All he had to do was wait. Once the drug fully consumed her, she'd come to him willingly.

And it was working. The Empress was losing ground. The drug was devastatingly potent—refined from the yin essence of ten thousand Merfolk maidens who shared her bloodline. Even an Immortal Emperor couldn't endure it.

Wave after wave of desire crashed against her willpower. Each one she suppressed came back stronger. She clenched her jaw, glaring at the Grand Elder cowering in the corner.

'I won't let him win.'

She bit down hard on her tongue. The sharp pain bought her a moment of clarity. Power surged, and she struck—a single palm that shattered the entire audience chamber.

The Grand Elder's face went white. He hadn't expected her to still be capable of fighting back. He barely managed to block, and the impact sent him hurtling out of the palace, crashing outside.

Spitting blood, he hauled himself upright. He'd underestimated an Immortal Emperor's strength. No matter—he had contingencies. After that attack, she'd be on the verge of losing control entirely. Once he retrieved her and absorbed her cultivation, nothing else would matter.

He took a steadying breath and charged back in.

By now, the palace guards had been roused. They surrounded the palace in defensive formations, but the Grand Elder paid them no mind. His people would deal with them.

Except—where were his people?

He'd arranged for allies to move the moment trouble started. Some were supposed to intercept the other Elders; others were supposed to help him deal with the guards. But no one had appeared.

Within the ruined chamber, an Immortal King-level woman knelt beside the Empress.

"Your Majesty!"

Mengqian—the Empress's guard captain, chosen and trained by the Empress herself since childhood. Her loyalty was absolute.

She helped the Empress up, alarm written across her face. "Your Majesty, what happened to you?"

The Empress could barely support herself, but a thread of rationality remained. "Get me out of here."

She knew the Grand Elder wouldn't have acted alone. His faction was formidable—five of the Ten Elders were his people. In her current state, the outcome of a direct confrontation was uncertain.

She had to escape, recover, then return to settle things.

"Your Majesty..."

"Go."

Mengqian gritted her teeth. She was about to carry the Empress out when the Grand Elder burst back in.

"Heh heh. Where do you think you're going, Captain Mengqian?"

His smile was cold. His people still hadn't shown—something had gone wrong—so he'd come himself.

"You did this to her?" Mengqian's eyes blazed as she positioned herself between him and the Empress.

"Mengqian, we're both Immortal Kings, but do you honestly think you can beat me? Hand her over. Perhaps I'll let you go."

"Never!"

"Heh. Keep dreaming. Of the Ten Elders, five are mine. They're already intercepting the others. No one is coming to save you."

Even as he said it, doubt gnawed at him. He'd assigned four of his five allies to contain the loyal Elders, with the fifth supposed to assist here. That person hadn't shown. And in his gut, he knew—those Skyreach City visitors had something to do with it.

But the pink droplet couldn't be preserved for long. He'd had no choice but to act now.

Regardless, seizing the Empress was all that mattered. With her cultivation absorbed, he'd be unstoppable.

"You have five seconds. Give her to me."

Mengqian's aura surged as she held her ground. Behind her, the Empress was fading—barely conscious, fighting to stay upright.

"Your Majesty, you go first. I'll hold him off."

If the Grand Elder had more allies lurking, she might not be able to protect the Empress and fight at the same time.

The Empress bit down and nodded. She was a liability right now. She turned to leave—

And found a man lounging on her shattered throne, smiling at her.
