Looking at Qin Lian'er, Qin Jiang rubbed his forehead. As the Qin family's little princess, she might not command the same spotlight as Qin Jiang himself, but she was just as closely watched by the other ancient clans.

And while the Qin family's power was undeniable—no one dared openly oppose them—there was no telling which ancient clan harbored secret grudges behind the scenes.

After all, at the Qin family's level, they'd offended more than a few people.

These enemies wouldn't dare challenge the Qin family head-on, but someone like Qin Lian'er sneaking out on her own? They wouldn't show an ounce of mercy.

Still, the girl wasn't completely reckless. She'd had the sense to bring guards along instead of running off alone—unlike certain fortune heroines who loved to ditch their escorts and wander off by themselves, only to be conveniently rescued by a Child of Destiny...

"Brother, are you angry?"

Qin Lian'er asked quietly, looking a bit guilty.

Qin Jiang shook his head.

"Fine. From now on, if you want to go out, just tell me. I'll arrange guards for you."

"Really?"

Qin Lian'er's eyes lit up. She grabbed Qin Jiang's arm tightly.

"Can you take me with you next time you go out?"

Seeing her hopeful expression, Qin Jiang considered it briefly. He'd actually been thinking about bringing Lian'er along, because he had a feeling she was some kind of magnet for Children of Destiny.

First Xiao Fan, now Lin Chen.

They'd encountered three Children of Destiny so far, and two of them had been connected to Qin Jiang through Lian'er.

With that thought, his eyes gleamed. He nodded.

"Sure. Next time I head out, I'll bring you along."

"Yay! Love you, brother!"

Qin Lian'er was overjoyed, bouncing up and down while clinging to his arm.

"Now tell me—how did you run into Bai Susu?"

Seeing her excitement, Qin Jiang smiled and brought the conversation back on track.

Qin Lian'er thought for a moment, then began:

"A while back, I snuck out and ended up in Holy Sword City. Before long, I spotted Susu. She was so pretty, and I figured you'd like her. So I grabbed her and brought her back."

"Just like that?"

"Yep."

Qin Lian'er nodded.

Qin Jiang asked, puzzled:

"What about the process?"

"Hm?"

Qin Lian'er scrunched up her face.

"There wasn't really a process. I went up and started chatting, told her I got separated from my family and was scared being alone, and asked if she could walk me home. She came with me, and once we reached a quiet spot, I had my people grab her. Honestly, Susu is actually a really nice person."

She even threw in a character assessment at the end.

Hearing that, Qin Jiang nearly lost his composure. Bai Susu was indeed kind-hearted—which was precisely why she'd been duped by this little villain.

But still...

"She didn't have any guards with her?"

Qin Jiang asked, confused.

Qin Lian'er shook her head.

"Nope. Susu was all by herself. I didn't even know she was the Holy Sword Sect Master's daughter until after I caught her. I was worried the sect might send people to get her back, so I rushed straight home. And I had my people erase all traces of us. Hehe—I bet even now, the Holy Sword Sect still has no idea who took her."

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. Appearances were deceiving—Lian'er was thorough.

As for Bai Susu, going out without a single guard? Tsk, she was bound to run into trouble sooner or later.

Running into him during that trouble was honestly her good fortune.

"Brother, wasn't I awesome?"

Qin Lian'er beamed with pride.

Qin Jiang reached out and lightly flicked her forehead.

"You were lucky Bai Susu didn't have guards. If a fight had broken out on the Holy Sword Sect's home turf, wouldn't you have been in serious trouble?"

Being scolded, Qin Lian'er pouted but offered no rebuttal, gazing at him with pitiful eyes instead.

Qin Jiang: "..."

He could never resist that look. Relenting with a helpless smile:

"Fine, you're the best."

At his praise, Qin Lian'er's face immediately broke into a grin, not caring one bit whether he was being sincere.

Looking at how easily his sister was mollified, Qin Jiang affectionately ruffled her hair, then suddenly remembered the Phoenix Egg he'd just received.

"Lian'er, I have a present for you."

He produced the Phoenix Egg. It was enormous—half the size of a person. Qin Jiang hefted it, surprised by its weight.

Qin Lian'er's face went blank. She'd never seen an egg this massive. But her astonishment quickly turned to excitement.

"Brother, are we going to boil it?"

An egg this big would be delicious!

Qin Jiang's expression darkened.

"This is a Phoenix Egg. There's a baby phoenix inside—a genuine divine beast!"

At that moment, a clear ring echoed from within Qin Lian'er's body as the Phoenix Sword flew out on its own, circling the egg excitedly.

Watching the sword, Qin Jiang nodded slightly. This Emperor weapon already possessed considerable combat power, and now that it had accepted Qin Lian'er as its master, it served as a bodyguard of sorts.

"A Phoenix Egg?"

Qin Lian'er's mouth hung open.

She reached out with her small hand and placed it on the egg. The instant she made contact, the spiritual energy within her body seemed to come alive, growing markedly more active. At the same time, the egg trembled slightly.

As though the little phoenix inside was responding to Qin Lian'er.

Qin Lian'er's face lit up. With a pulse of spiritual energy, she conjured flames that engulfed the entire egg.

"What the—!"

Qin Jiang jumped. Was Lian'er going to roast it?

"Don't worry, brother. The little phoenix inside needs enough fire-attribute energy to hatch successfully."

Qin Lian'er didn't forget to explain.

Hearing that, Qin Jiang relaxed. This was a Phoenix Egg, after all—born with an affinity for fire. It shouldn't be afraid of flames.

"Lian'er, how did you know that?"

He was curious.

Qin Lian'er controlled the flames with one hand while pointing at the egg with the other.

"She told me."

Watching the Phoenix Egg tumble around in the flames of its own accord, Qin Jiang grinned. He was glad the egg had accepted Lian'er.

"Fire attribute..."

An idea struck him. The next moment, a pearl appeared in his palm.

The Fire Spirit Pearl—one of Xiao Fan's lucky encounters that Qin Jiang had intercepted.

"Ooh?"

The moment the pearl emerged, Lian'er's attention snapped to it, eyes filled with wonder.

"Brother, what is that? The fire energy is so rich!"

"Like it? Here—it's yours."

Qin Jiang smiled and handed it over.

Her Nirvana Divine Body was also fire-attributed. The Fire Spirit Pearl should benefit her considerably.

Sure enough, the moment Qin Lian'er touched the pearl, the object that had been completely inert in Qin Jiang's possession suddenly radiated a soft glow.

Then it transformed into a streak of light and shot into Qin Lian'er's forehead.

Seeing this, Qin Jiang felt no alarm. In the spoiler, Xiao Fan had experienced the same thing.

It meant the Fire Spirit Pearl had chosen Qin Lian'er.

And as a natal treasure worthy of a Child of Destiny, the Fire Spirit Pearl had enormous potential for growth—possibly even more valuable than the Phoenix Egg.
