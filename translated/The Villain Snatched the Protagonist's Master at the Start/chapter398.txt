In the Chaos, a fleet of ships cut through the void toward Huaxia Academy. Three carried the students — one each from Qin Domain, Azure Cloud Heaven, and Grey Cloud Heaven. Flanking them flew escort vessels crewed by former Demon Hall operatives.

These men had gone through quite the career arc. Recruited by the Demon Hall, then absorbed by Qin Jiang and rebranded as Chaos Marauders — and now, with Qin Jiang on the verge of unifying the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, they'd been reformed once more into the Chaos Guardians. Their current mission: protecting Huaxia's people. Once unification was complete, they'd patrol the Chaos itself, maintaining order across the void. Proper soldiers at last.

The three student ships flew abreast. Their passengers spanned every imaginable range — from Qi-Blood Realm to Great Emperor, from seven-year-old children to millennia-old veterans. But regardless of cultivation or age, every single one of them was a genius. Hand-picked, battle-tested, and fiercely competitive.

Standing at the prows, they could already see Huaxia Academy's silhouette. A ripple of excitement ran through the crowd. They'd fought tooth and nail for these spots — cleared trial after trial, outlasted thousands of competitors. Now, at last, the academy was right in front of them.

On campus, the teaching staff had assembled. They'd seen the ships approaching. At the fore stood Qin Jiang, An Xihe, Qing Chan, and Mo Mo — watching the incoming fleet with interest.

Qin Jiang glanced back. "Begin the welcome ceremony."

"Yes, sir."

A teacher stepped forward and extended a finger toward the ships. Biting cold erupted outward — a Human Immortal specializing in ice. Under his control, a staircase of crystalline ice stretched from the academy all the way to the fleet. The ships halted.

Aboard, the escorts grinned at the students. "The rest of the way is on foot."

The students stared at the ice staircase. The message was clear — if they wanted in, they'd have to earn it. But they were the pride of their respective heavens, every one of them arrogant and fearless. They stepped onto the ice without hesitation.

Snowflakes began to drift down around them. The cold was savage — enough to freeze blood in their veins. They channeled spiritual energy and pushed forward.

Qin Jiang's gaze swept across the student body. Unfortunately, aside from Li Yang, there wasn't a single Child of Destiny among them.

Disappointing. Maybe he should've used Lian'er as bait and made her dean instead?

He shook off the thought. Fine — no new targets. He'd just have to milk Li Yang harder and longer. In hindsight, he'd been too efficient about killing previous Children of Destiny. If he'd kept a few around, Villain Points wouldn't be such a headache.

He sighed and focused on Li Yang.

Might as well start now. Every bit counts.

Li Yang's talent had fully awakened, and his cultivation had surged to the Yin-Yang Realm. His combat power was formidable. But even the three ancient sword spirits housed inside the Chaos Sword couldn't identify his physique. All they knew was that a character for "Dao" had manifested in his mind — one that radiated an aura capable of inducing epiphanies. That was why his realm had climbed so quickly.

The Dao character required activation, though, and activation required enormous energy. The sword spirits had determined that Li Yang's painfully slow early cultivation was caused by this very character — it had been siphoning most of his energy to feed itself. Now that it was active, using its power still demanded significant resources. The Li family wouldn't provide them — a thirty-something Yin-Yang Realm cultivator wasn't worth their investment, especially given Qin Jiang's prior instructions.

Without family support, Li Yang had set his sights on Huaxia Academy. It would satisfy his cultivation needs and — more importantly — give him a chance to see Li Qingqiu.

He'd earned his spot through the selection trials, fair and square. And now, the old Li Yang was gone. He was a genius — a supreme prodigy, even. He was confident that one day, he'd stand at the very peak. And when that day came, Qingqiu would finally see him for what he was.

On the ice staircase, Li Yang strode forward with a smile, anticipation warming his chest. The cold couldn't touch his determination.

Then his foot caught. In the space of a heartbeat, ice devoured him — freezing him solid into a sculpture.

The other students glanced over and sneered. This level of weakness, and he'd made it into Huaxia Academy? Must have pulled strings.

The ice staircase adjusted its severity based on each student's strength. It was harsh, but any true genius could endure it. Getting frozen solid meant your foundations were lacking. The crowd shook their heads and moved on. A charity case like him wasn't worth their attention.

Behind Li Yang, a striking young woman paused mid-stride. Her eyes flickered toward the academy, then back to Li Yang. She walked over, tapped the ice encasing him, and channeled warmth until he broke free.

He was deathly pale and shivering violently. He'd genuinely thought he was going to die. Thank heavens for the good samaritan — otherwise he'd have had to rely on the three old monsters in the Chaos Sword, and using their power inside Huaxia Academy risked exposing the blade's existence.

He looked at the young woman and forced a grateful smile. "Thank you for saving me, miss."

"We're all about to be classmates. Helping each other is only natural." She beamed at him, then extended her hand. "Hi there! I'm Ye Xuan. And you?"

"H-hello. I'm... I'm Li Yang."

He shook her hand, face burning. This was his first time being this close to a girl — and such a beautiful one at that. Almost as pretty as Qingqiu.
