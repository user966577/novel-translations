Meanwhile, Chen Changsheng had been in the Central Regions for over two weeks with nothing to show for it. His primary goal was to leverage the Central Regions' powerhouses against Qin Jiang, which meant getting their attention first.

At just the Supreme Realm, that wouldn't be easy. Small-time exploits wouldn't cut it. "I need to make a name for myself—and not just any name," he muttered, poring over a map of the Central Regions' major factions. Only those with at least one Immortal-level cultivator made the list. Thirty-eight in total, from which he needed to pick his target.

"Limitless Holy Land, Human Dao Sect, Azure Lotus Divine Palace..."

These three stood above the rest, each home to a True Immortal. If he could get a True Immortal on his side, could Qin Jiang's forces withstand that? He smirked. But the smile faded quickly—all three factions were formidable. Borrowing their strength meant risking disaster, like what had happened with the Black Water Serpent. His cheek twitched at the memory—he'd taken quite the beating.

"The Limitless Holy Land is too aggressive—hard to approach. The Human Dao Sect is too calculating—they might not take the bait. The Azure Lotus Divine Palace..."

His gaze settled there. An all-female organization. Women were supposed to be gentler, right? At least they probably wouldn't beat him up.

"You're the one." His finger tapped the Azure Lotus Divine Palace on the map. He touched his cheek and allowed himself a confident smile. With his charm, winning over a few of their leaders should be no problem.

Qin Jiang's group, meanwhile, had settled into the Chaos District. Despite the lawless atmosphere, there were few truly elite fighters in the area. Mo Mo's display had been effective—no one dared disturb them. Black Dragon, emboldened by Qin Jiang's arrival, went on a rampage across the district. Old grudges, past losses—he settled every score.

One arrow through the clouds, and a thousand soldiers come running—with the Young Master backing him, Black Dragon hit like a freight train. Anyone who dared fight back quickly learned that behind Black Dragon stood something far worse. Under his campaign of violence, vast swaths of territory fell under his control. He gathered tens of thousands of followers and established himself as a major gang boss within the Chaos District.

Maintaining that status, of course, required results. The Young Master's greatest weakness was beautiful women—unfortunately, the Chaos District's residents skewed toward the rough-around-the-edges variety. At his underlings' suggestion, Black Dragon turned his attention to the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. Tens of thousands of scouts fanned out, swarming the area around the palace.

At the same time, Black Dragon discovered something: Chen Changsheng—the person the Young Master had specifically told him to monitor—was also eyeing the Azure Lotus Divine Palace.

Was this bastard trying to steal the Young Master's women?

Black Dragon reported immediately.

"Chen Changsheng? The Azure Lotus Divine Palace?" Qin Jiang's brow rose.

"Young Master," Black Dragon added helpfully, "the Azure Lotus Divine Palace is composed entirely of women. Beautiful women."

"Oh?"

Linglong and Dan Yu were nearby. Hearing Black Dragon, Linglong snorted. Bootlicker. Always pandering to his boss. Didn't he know the competition in Qin Jiang's inner circle was fierce enough already? She was not pleased with Black Dragon's performance.

But as Qin Jiang's most loyal hound, Black Dragon served his master's interests above all else. He shot a guilty glance at Linglong and pressed on. "The Azure Lotus Divine Palace has strict recruitment standards—the primary requirement is beauty, with talent being secondary. Rumor has it their ancestor is a total face-lover. Additionally, none of the palace's women have dao companions—not because of any rule, but because any woman who takes a partner must leave the palace. Of course, the Azure Lotus Divine Palace always remains their home. This has created an enormously wide network of connections, mostly with major families. After all, the palace's women come with a quality guarantee and are prime marriage candidates for prominent clans' heirs."

Black Dragon laid out everything his investigation had uncovered.

Hearing this, Qin Jiang stroked his chin. "You think if I showed up at the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, they'd just dissolve the whole organization?"

"..."

Black Dragon blinked. Was he really planning to take them all? Granted, every woman in the Azure Lotus Divine Palace was a feast for the eyes, but claiming them all would make him an enemy of half of Azure Cloud Heaven.

"Ahem, Young Master... there are quite a lot of them..." Black Dragon coughed diplomatically.

He then produced a stack of portraits and handed them over. "Young Master, these are the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's senior leaders. And these documents detail their preferences and habits—might be useful. Furthermore, based on our analysis, the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's ancestor may be the ideal target..."

Black Dragon's professionalism caught even Qin Jiang off guard. He'd prepared full dossiers—complete with a strategic conquest plan.

"You did all this yourself?"

"Hehe, Young Master, the Chaos District has no shortage of talent. They did the research. But I discovered and recruited them!"

Qin Jiang was impressed. "True talent." He produced some pills and tossed them to Black Dragon. "Reward everyone who contributed."

"Will do!"

Only Linglong was fuming—those were her Heavenly Pill Palace's pills, being used to reward people who helped Qin Jiang chase women!

He dismissed Black Dragon with a wave, then turned to the bristling little emperor. He pulled her into his arms—the key to handling women was providing enough security. I may have other women, but I still love you plenty. Linglong was susceptible to exactly this approach. A few practiced moves and her anger melted into a crimson blush.

"Yu'er is still here—behave yourself," she murmured.

He glanced at Dan Yu and promptly swept her up too, grinning. "Yu'er's cultivation is low. I'd worry about her safety if she weren't right beside me."

"Teacher, I'm fine~" Dan Yu said, blushing, stealing a glance at Qin Jiang. "I can... support from the sideline."

Linglong was speechless.
