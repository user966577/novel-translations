With the True Phoenix Plume delivered to Lian'er, Little Red stood nearby, watching with puppy eyes.

She stepped forward and tilted her head at Qin Jiang, studying him.

Having spent all her time with Lian'er, she knew the girl's designs inside and out. Even before taking human form, Lian'er had constantly whispered about giving her to Qin Jiang as a wife. After transforming, Lian'er had doubled down on the propaganda.

Over time, Little Red had accepted the idea completely. She was just waiting for Qin Jiang to come pluck the fruit.

Of course, she'd prefer it if he genuinely liked her.

This was her first time meeting him in human form, and she was a little nervous — especially since he'd just given Lian'er a gift. They'd always gotten along well... surely she'd get one too?

She blinked hopefully. Right?

Qin Jiang turned to Little Red. He loosened his hold on Lian'er with a pat on her rear that set her on her feet, though she still clung to his arm, pressed against his side.

Seeing his attention shift to Little Red, Lian'er grinned. "Brother, this is Little Red~ Isn't she pretty?"

She winked at Little Red. But in human form, Little Red found it hard to act natural around Qin Jiang. Before her transformation, they'd roughhoused freely. Now, though... things would get real.

Qin Jiang reached out and tousled Little Red's hair. "All refined and ladylike now that you've got a human body, huh?"

"I've always been ladylike!" Little Red's eyes flared, cheeks reddening. She swatted his hand away. He was messing up her hair.

Qin Jiang laughed. "Ladylike? Before you transformed, you used to yank my hair. You even tried to set me on fire."

"That was because you bullied me!"

"That's true. Brother did bully Little Red a lot," Lian'er chimed in with a sage nod.

"Alright, alright. My fault." Qin Jiang chuckled, then flipped his palm to reveal the Crimson Blaze. "Here. A present. Consider it an apology for all the bullying."

A present! Little Red's eyes lit up. The instant the flame appeared, she sensed its extraordinary nature. She accepted it, trying to maintain a haughty front but failing to suppress the smile tugging at her lips.

"Hmph. I'm magnanimous, so I won't hold it against you~"

Her attempted poise crumbled under barely contained delight.

What a little tsundere.

"This is Crimson Blaze — fire born from a phoenix's nirvana. Extremely potent. It can even burn the Primordial Spirit. Cultivating with it can forge an indestructible golden body, but the process is painful. My suggestion: refine it for combat use only. Don't bother with the golden body training. I'll keep you safe regardless."

Originally, he'd bought it thinking the pain would build character. But now, looking at Little Red's face, he couldn't bring himself to let her suffer either. A reduced return on investment was fine. The Crimson Blaze was devastating in battle even without the golden body training. Three hundred thousand Villain Points well spent.

Little Red nodded, warmth spreading through her chest. Was he... worried about her?

"Fire from a phoenix's nirvana? This Crimson Blaze is perfect for Little Red," Lian'er observed.

Qin Jiang nodded and pinched her cheek. "Your True Phoenix Plume suits you too. And there's phoenix blood essence inside — but you'll only get it after the plume recognizes you as its master."

"Give the blood essence to Little Red," Lian'er said without hesitation, glancing at her companion.

In truth, both items suited either of them — their bloodlines were practically intertwined. But Qin Jiang hadn't wanted to play favorites, so he'd given them one each. The True Phoenix Plume was clearly the more valuable gift, which did tilt things in Lian'er's favor. But if the blood essence went to Little Red, the overall value evened out — maybe even tipped in Little Red's favor.

"Hehe, Little Red and I are practically one person. What's good for her is good for me." Lian'er beamed.

Qin Jiang shook his head. "Actually, you can share the blood essence. It's from an Immortal King-level phoenix — the energy alone is enough to push you both to Great Emperor. More importantly, the essence likely contains a legacy. You can comprehend it together."

The two girls exchanged a look, then nodded.

"No problem. Once I extract the blood essence, Little Red and I will study the legacy together," Lian'er agreed.

Gifts delivered and plans settled, Qin Jiang wanted to linger a bit longer, but Lian'er promptly shooed him out. She had training to do. Refine the True Phoenix Plume, extract the blood essence, absorb it, break through to Great Emperor...

And then, armed with an Immortal King treasure and Great Emperor cultivation, taking down one measly big brother would be child's play.

"Heheheh~ Brother, just you wait~"

She clenched her fist, eyes blazing with determination, body thrumming with motivation.

"Red, back to training!"

She turned to Little Red, who was still gazing wistfully in the direction Qin Jiang had gone. She'd wanted more time with him.

"Oh~" Little Red answered listlessly.

Lian'er blinked. Had Little Red already fallen this hard? She'd been fine before transforming.

Was the human form really that big a change?

She walked over and waved a hand in front of Little Red's face. "Hey. Snap out of it."

"..."

"It's not like you'll never see him again. Once we hit Great Emperor, I'll take you to him. And then... heheheh..."

The thought of what came after sent Lian'er into a fit of scheming giggles. Fist clenched, face alight with confidence.

Brother, you can't escape~
