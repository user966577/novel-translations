The women glanced at Lian'er and nodded, filing out with parting teases: "Enjoy yourself, Lian'er~"

"With me here, she absolutely will," Qin Jiang said with a grin.

Once the door closed, he looked down at Lian'er and drew her into his arms. "Let me take good care of my little Lian'er."

"Who's taking care of whom?" She swatted his chest, eyes bright, nestling against him. "Come on, big brother. Teach me."

"Gladly."

He guided her through the motions, positioning her hands on the ribbons, correcting her posture. Once she had the basics down, he joined in — and didn't forget to set up a recording crystal.

"A little high," he directed.

She nodded, understanding, and loosened her grip just slightly. A muffled gasp escaped her lips.

She glanced down, cheeks coloring. He steadied her waist and smiled. "That's the sweet spot. Now try..."

"Mm~"

She bit her lip and followed his guidance. Qin Jiang kept his hands on her waist, assisting her movements.

"You're doing great. How does it feel, Lian'er?"

"I... I don't know~" Her head tilted back, her voice trembling.

He chuckled. They'd barely begun and she was already like this. The ribbons were clearly a hit.

"Then let's keep going."

"Mm~"

They moved together like dancers in an intimate waltz — beautiful, rhythmic, suspended in air. But Lian'er's stamina proved insufficient. After barely an hour, she collapsed into his arms.

He caught her, brushed the hair from her face, and kissed her cheek. "Tired?"

"No, it's just..." She pressed herself against him, flushed crimson, and he felt exactly why she'd fallen.

His eyebrows rose. 'That fast?'

He held her still, letting her catch her breath. Only when she loosened her grip did he continue — after all, she hadn't actually eaten yet. Couldn't leave her hungry.

Two more hours, and Lian'er was finally sated. She draped herself across his chest, boneless and content.

Qin Jiang held her and retrieved the recording crystal. "Want to watch it together, Lian'er?"

He activated the playback. Lian'er's face turned scarlet the instant her image appeared.

"No! I'm not watching!" She buried her face in his chest — but kept sneaking glances. Each peek deepened the flush. On screen, the way she looked was... rather... 'So embarrassing!'

And this recording was going to Liu Shuwan and the others for "educational purposes." The thought filled her with an intoxicating mixture of mortification and excitement.

"Not bad at all." Qin Jiang nodded in professional satisfaction. Their coordination had produced an excellent instructional recording.

He patted her rear. "Ready for me to call the others in?"

"Mm~"

She nodded but didn't budge from his arms. Still carrying her, Qin Jiang opened the door and waved the women inside.

"All done?"

"Judging by the sounds, it must be good — we could hear Lian'er from out here."

"Let us see the crystal!"

They crowded in, demanding answers. Qin Jiang glanced at Lian'er — she was blushing furiously but didn't object — and activated the playback.

Every pair of eyes locked onto the projection. As the demonstration progressed, faces reddened one by one. Glances kept darting to Qin Jiang.

"Looks amazing."

"I wonder how it feels. Must be incredible."

"Obviously — look at Lian'er's expression."

"Hehe, I've got it. My turn next!"

"Ooh, right at that part — Lian'er just went completely limp."

The recording wasn't even finished before every woman had turned to stare at Qin Jiang with unmistakable hunger.

"Got the gist?" he asked.

They all nodded. With their cultivation levels, picking up new techniques took no time at all.

"Then... shall we?"

"Yes!"

"Who's first?"

This time, they all surged forward, each insisting on going next. Not an inch of ground yielded.

In the end, they settled it the only fair way — drawing lots.

Order determined, the practicals began.

This round, no one left the room. They stayed to observe, critique, and — most importantly — brainstorm new variations. Their creativity left even Qin Jiang stunned.

Half a month vanished in a blur.

Qin Jiang's satisfaction levels were through the roof. The women offered equally glowing reviews of his performance.

"Today's the day students arrive, isn't it?" Qin Jiang asked suddenly. He was still using Xue Mei's thighs as a pillow — warm, soft, and heavenly. She gazed down at him, gently massaging his scalp. He loved resting on her lap, and he loved burying his face against her chest even more.

Beside them, Liu Shuwan nodded. "That's right. The selected students are nearly at the academy. Want to go greet them?"

"Might as well."

He patted Xue Mei's hand, rose from her lap, and kissed her cheek before turning to An Xihe, Qing Chan, and Mo Mo. "You three, come with me."

"Sure~"

As dean and vice deans, they needed to make an appearance for something this important. Qin Jiang, meanwhile, wanted to scan the incoming class for Children of Destiny. He needed more Villain Points — badly. His women were all bottomless pits, especially An Xihe. Pushing her to Immortal Emperor would devour resources at an obscene rate. Every point counted.

The four of them dressed and headed out. Qin Jiang looked radiant — the picture of vitality. An Xihe, Qing Chan, and Mo Mo, while flushed and lovely, seemed noticeably drained.

He blinked at them. "Why do you three look so tired?"

"Whose fault is that?" they snapped in unison.

Then they grabbed him and marched out, ready for the opening ceremony.
