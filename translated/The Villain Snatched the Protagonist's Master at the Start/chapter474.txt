Under the Zhou family's relentless pursuit, the targeted branch stood no chance. Within a single day, their holdings ran red with blood.

But some branch members hadn't been present at the compound. Using the genealogy and a bloodline-sensing technique, the patriarch could detect which ones still lived. He immediately ordered the hunt to continue. Qin Jiang's rule was clear: one survivor meant a hundred replacements from the other branches. And if he was in a bad mood, the consequences could be far worse.

Better to exterminate the branch completely. Fulfill the mission and eliminate any chance of future complications.

The patriarch personally took command while Black Dragon arrived for a status report. Everything checked out—the patriarch hadn't lied.

"Continue hunting the survivors," Black Dragon said.

"Understood."

The patriarch smiled bitterly. Slaughtering his own people had taken something out of him—a piece of his fighting spirit. But for the whole family's sake, he'd had no choice. Huaxia's power was beyond anything the Zhou family could resist, and its leader was unpredictable. Displease him, and the entire family could be next. Sacrifice the few to save the many—the only rational choice.

"One day, you'll be grateful you made this decision," Black Dragon said.

"I hope so."

The patriarch stared at the blood-soaked ruins, then steeled his expression. The family's interests came first. A leader couldn't afford sentimentality. One moment of weakness and everything could be lost.

"I'll personally oversee the remaining cleanup," the patriarch said. "Please convey my regards to the Manor Lord. Perhaps a good word on our behalf?"

"Good words from me are worthless. The Manor Lord only cares about results."

Black Dragon turned and left. The patriarch's fists clenched, then slowly released. Nothing more to be done. He set about directing the pursuit in person.

Back on the airship, Qin Jiang was thoroughly enjoying himself. Soft warmth surrounded him on all sides, though rolling over carelessly meant tumbling into a hole. And once you fell in, it could be hours before you climbed out.

Like right now. He'd been stuck in a hole for an hour, repeatedly scrambling up only to slide back down, until a final burst of effort freed him. He took a deep breath and glanced back. "Way too slippery in there. Good thing I'm powerful enough—otherwise I might never have made it out."

Beside him, Ye Ling'er blushed. She was the one whose water-attribute cultivation made things especially treacherous. Still, Qin Jiang was clearly exaggerating. With his strength, no hole could truly trap him.

He stretched, pulled her into his arms, and grinned. "Ling'er's gotten stronger."

"Do you like this kind of strength, husband?" she asked shyly.

He kissed her. "Of course. Keep it up—I look forward to the day your trap can actually hold me."

"That's impossible." She pouted. She knew his capabilities. No matter how strong she became, she'd never match him. He chuckled and rubbed her head. "Just keep improving."

"Mm, okay~"

They spent a while longer together before Qin Jiang carefully navigated his way out of the trap zone. Three days on the airship now. He'd sensed Black Dragon's return on the first day, but Black Dragon—ever tactful—had waited outside without disturbing him. This was exactly why Black Dragon was his most trusted confidant.

Dressed and presentable, Qin Jiang flashed outside to where Black Dragon sat meditating in mid-air—not only waiting patiently, but standing guard.

"How did things go?"

"Young Master." Black Dragon rose and bowed, then delivered his full report.

Qin Jiang nodded. "The old man's quite pragmatic."

"Young Master, could he be biding his time? Waiting to betray us at a critical moment?"

"Oh, he's definitely biding his time. But betrayal? Never. As long as the Zhou family exists, he has something to lose. He'd never risk it. Besides, not every branch follows the main lineage blindly. Find an ambitious branch and start grooming them."

"Yes."

Qin Jiang looked Black Dragon over. "Your strength needs a boost too."

Black Dragon was at peak Ancient Emperor—one step from the Human Immortal realm. He just hadn't had time to seclude himself.

"Don't worry, Young Master. Give me six months of seclusion and I'll break through to the Immortal Path."

"Good. Once I've secured Mystic Cloud Heaven, pick out whatever resources you need and go back to Huaxia's Space-Time Temple for seclusion—on the house."

"Thank you, Young Master."

Qin Jiang waved it off. "Keep supervising. Report back once the branch is fully eliminated."

"Yes."

Qin Jiang returned to the airship. It was nearly time to visit the Blood Tribe. With Xue Yue's connection and Huaxia's might, the Blood Tribe had no reason to resist. That would give him two of Mystic Cloud Heaven's major factions. The rest wouldn't be far behind.
