"Next—Chen Fan!"

Dao Kun called out the name, and a smile crept across Qin Jiang's face. Chen Fan? He couldn't even be bothered to pick a better alias. Besides, he'd used that exact name back in the Snake Race territory. Qin Jiang had spotted it while scanning the lists and deliberately kept it.

In the crowd, Chen Changsheng's expression stiffened. He wanted to join the Human Dao Sect's inner sect, but not through this kind of test. Survive a single strike from Qin Jiang? He was confident he could—but he was worried Qin Jiang would see through his disguise.

"Chen Fan! Are you here or not!" Dao Kun's patience was wearing thin. The lack of response made his voice sharp.

Chen Changsheng took a deep breath. All or nothing. "Present!"

He pushed through the crowd and walked toward Qin Jiang. Dao Kun frowned and snapped, "Hurry it up! Stop dawdling, or I'll revoke your eligibility on the spot!"

At the moment, Chen Changsheng had concealed his cultivation. Dao Kun, a Human Immortal of considerable power, hadn't noticed anything unusual. But Qin Jiang watched him approach and thought, 'That Reincarnation Law really is versatile.'

Chen Changsheng's concealment relied on the Reincarnation Law. Even True Immortals wouldn't detect the discrepancy, let alone Human Immortals. The only problem was that the law wasn't yet perfected. Qin Jiang couldn't be bothered cultivating it himself, so he'd left it deposited inside Chen Changsheng to ripen. Once it reached perfection, he'd reclaim it. But after all this time, he was getting impatient. Chen Changsheng had definitely been slacking.

'Time to crank up the intensity.'

The corner of his mouth curled upward.

Chen Changsheng stopped across from Qin Jiang and clasped his hands in a bow, masking the killing intent in his eyes. Qin Jiang smiled. "Ready?"

"Ready."

Qin Jiang cracked his neck. He wanted to see just how much destruction he could unleash at full power. "Heaven and Earth Manifestation!"

The words thundered silently in his mind. A colossal dharma manifestation blazed to life behind him, enveloping his form. It towered over thirty thousand feet, radiating overwhelming power that shattered space itself. The visiting sect leaders went pale with shock. Even Great Emperors felt an incomparable sense of crisis beneath that manifestation. Dao Kun was stunned. In his perception, the manifestation's power exceeded that of ordinary Great Emperors—it could even hold its own against an Ancient Emperor. And Qin Jiang's opponent? A mere Divine Ability Realm cultivator. Was he trying to obliterate the man from existence?

The manifestation lowered its gaze upon the tiny figure of Chen Changsheng. "Are you... really ready?"

Chen Changsheng cursed silently. Ready my ass! Against everyone else, Qin Jiang had dispatched them with a lazy wave. But for him, he'd pulled out a full dharma manifestation? Qin Jiang had obviously recognized him. If he were actually at the Divine Ability Realm, this single strike would leave nothing behind—not even ash.

His expression flickered between dark emotions. Joining the Human Dao Sect seemed unrealistic now. More importantly, the question was whether he could even escape alive.

Qin Jiang raised his fist, channeling every ounce of his strength, and brought it crashing down.

Dao Kun's face changed. In a flash, he appeared before the outer disciples and flung up a massive barrier, shielding them all—except Chen Changsheng, who stood alone against the descending blow.

The shriek of splitting air filled his ears. Chen Changsheng's face twisted. No point hiding anymore. Supreme Realm aura erupted from his body. He stomped the ground and launched skyward, meeting Qin Jiang's fist with his own.

A deafening boom. Chen Changsheng's body hurtled downward like a cannonball. An instant later, Qin Jiang's fist followed, smashing a colossal imprint into the earth. Chen Changsheng was embedded in the crater, bones shattered beyond counting, barely clinging to life. He'd lost consciousness entirely.

Qin Jiang scoffed. 'A Child of Destiny, and that's all he's got? Must've been relying on borrowed power instead of putting in the work. No wonder he's this weak.'

The manifestation receded. Qin Jiang swept his gaze across the stunned crowd and waved over a few inner sect disciples. "Carry him away."

"Uh... yes, sir."

Several disciples scrambled into the crater and dug Chen Changsheng out. His body felt like a bag of loose bones. They winced. Was this guy even alive?

Qin Jiang wasn't worried. Children of Destiny were built for near-death recoveries. This brush with mortality would force a massive leap in Chen Changsheng's Reincarnation Law. Besides, after this beating, surely he'd realize that personal strength was the only thing that mattered and stop trying to piggyback off others.

Qin Jiang smiled to himself in quiet satisfaction. 'Come on, my Reincarnation Law. Hurry up and ripen. I can barely wait.'

As Chen Changsheng was carried off, the crowd fell silent. Dao Kun returned to Qin Jiang's side, frowning at the retreating figure. That disciple had been a Supreme—and had completely hidden his aura from detection.

He turned to Qin Jiang. "You knew his real cultivation all along?"

"Mm." Qin Jiang nodded. "A Supreme masquerading as a Divine Ability Realm cultivator. I suspected he was up to no good, so I gave him a little lesson."

"A little lesson?" Dao Kun's cheek twitched. Those injuries might kill even a Supreme.

Qin Jiang looked at Dao Kun and smiled. "Sect Master Dao Kun, I just pulled a thorn out of your sect for you. Shouldn't the Human Dao Sect show some... appreciation?"

His eyes drifted toward the pile of gifts from visiting sects. Dao Kun's face went white. He sidestepped to block Qin Jiang's line of sight and forced a laugh. "Heh, rest assured, Young Master Qin. We'll prepare some of our specialty products for you."

"The Human Dao Sect has specialties?"

Dao Kun's face darkened. They might be poor, but they had specialties, thank you very much.

"Young Master Qin, our Human Dao Tea is famous across all of Azure Cloud Heaven. How can you say we have no specialties?"

"Oh? You mean the legendary Human Dao Tea? One cup grants ten years of cultivation, and there's even a chance of triggering an epiphany? Heh, if the Sect Master can produce such a gift, I certainly won't refuse."

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up.

Dao Kun stiffened. Seeing Qin Jiang's radiant smile, his stomach dropped. He'd been played. The brat had baited him into it!
