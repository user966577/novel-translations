Outside the Azure Lotus Divine Palace stood a grand hall where a steady stream of men waited in line, each bearing gifts.

The women of Azure Lotus were renowned throughout Azure Cloud Heaven. Countless men dreamed of marrying one of them. But the palace was a sovereign power—if they let every suitor waltz in, the whole place would descend into chaos. So men were forbidden from entering the palace grounds.

Instead, this hall had been erected outside. Any man wishing to court someone could bring gifts and letters to be handed off by the hall's attendants. If the woman was interested, she'd come out to meet him. If not... the palace didn't keep guests waiting.

Over the ages, the hall had facilitated more than a few happy unions, earning it the nickname "Matchmaking Temple." Nearly every day, a flood of men came to pursue their beloved. Most left disappointed.

"No—why was I rejected? Am I not handsome enough? Were my flowers not beautiful enough? My goddess, please, just one look at me!"

"Buddy, stop wailing. Cause a scene here and they'll snap your little friend off and toss you out."

"???"

The man's cries cut off instantly. A shudder ran through him as he recalled what had happened to the last troublemaker, and he fled without another word.

Beyond him, as far as the eye could see, the area was filled with similarly lovelorn souls—sighing at the heavens, faces etched with melancholy, unable to fathom why someone as exceptional as themselves had been turned down. Meanwhile, those still in line wore expressions of supreme confidence, casting disdainful looks at the failures.

Among them, a familiar figure: Chen Changsheng.

He wore an easy smile, just as confident as the rest. In his hands, he cradled a jade vial. Glancing at the others' gifts, a flicker of contempt crossed his eyes.

'What gives them the right to stand in the same line as me?'

Several pretty young women were stationed outside the hall, managing the queue, collecting gifts, and ferrying them inside.

"Next," the lead woman called.

Chen Changsheng stepped forward. Seeing the attendants, he silently marveled—the Azure Lotus Divine Palace lived up to its reputation. Even their lowest-ranked disciples were strikingly beautiful.

"Set your gift down. Who's it for?"

Chen Changsheng smiled and, with some reluctance, placed the jade vial on the table. Inside was an Ancient Emperor Pill—a pill that could help a Great Emperor rapidly break through to Ancient Emperor, and even give an Ancient Emperor a chance at touching the threshold of the immortal path. Extraordinarily precious. He had only one.

But fortune favors the bold. Gritting his teeth, he'd brought it out. After all, he was courting the Palace Master herself. An ordinary gift wouldn't even register.

"Please deliver this to your Palace Master."

"To the Palace Mas—"

The woman was about to jot it down when the words registered. She looked up, startled. "Who did you say?"

"You heard right. Your Azure Lotus Divine Palace's Palace Master."

The attendants exchanged peculiar looks. The men in line, however, erupted in laughter.

"Did you hear that? He wants to court the Palace Master!"

"Bloody hell, the audacity!"

"A measly Supreme trying to court the Palace Master? Delusional!"

"Is he out of his mind? Has he looked in a mirror? As if he's worthy!"

The mockery crashed over Chen Changsheng in waves. He merely swept an indifferent glance across the crowd, his smile unchanged, and looked back at the attendant.

"Is that not allowed?"

"It's... it's allowed." The woman suppressed a laugh, shook her head, and offered a word of warning: "But you should prepare yourself for rejection."

"I understand."

She took the vial. "I'll deliver it personally."

"Thank you."

The woman hurried back into the palace, a gaggle of attendants chasing after her, giggling. Someone courting the Palace Master? That was a first. Every last one of them abandoned their posts to go watch the show.

The men left in line stared at each other. Who was going to take their gifts now?

Not that anyone left. The spectacle of someone courting the Palace Master was far too interesting. Some even started calling friends to come watch.

Inside the palace, the Azure Lotus leadership and Jian Yao's group were still together, though they could no longer get near the cottage—Qing Chan had put up a barrier.

The women were rather disappointed. From the sounds, their ancestor had clearly been "educated." A shame they'd only heard audio without video. But even so, it had been plenty exciting.

Jian Yao and the others had anticipated this the moment they'd learned of Qing Chan's intentions. They knew Qin Jiang's capabilities better than anyone.

Beyond that, when Jian Yao's group looked at Ning Xue'er and the others, a glint of something knowing crossed their eyes. They were intimately familiar with Qin Jiang's nature. Releasing him into the Azure Lotus Divine Palace was like dropping a tiger into a flock of sheep—a free buffet.

Snatching them all in one go might be a stretch, but these leaders would be hard-pressed to escape his clutches. And the best part? They'd brought this disaster upon themselves.

Ning Xue'er was busy making tea for everyone when a commotion broke out.

"Palace Master! Palace Master!"

A group of women came running toward them.

"Palace Master, I finally found you!" The one in front was practically glowing with excitement. The others all looked at Ning Xue'er with undisguised glee.

The Azure Lotus Divine Palace had a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere—virtually no hierarchy, with everyone addressing each other as sisters.

"Lin Lin, aren't you supposed to be running the Matchmaking Temple? What are you doing here?" Ning Xue'er asked, surprised.

Lin Lin grinned and set Chen Changsheng's gift before her. "Palace Master, someone sent you a gift!"

"Hm?" Ning Xue'er blinked. Before becoming Palace Master, she'd received plenty of gifts, but afterward, they'd stopped entirely. Everyone had the self-awareness to know they weren't worthy.

Now someone was sending gifts? "Who sent it?"

"Uh..." Lin Lin scratched her head. She'd forgotten to ask his name. "No idea. But he's a Supreme."

Ning Xue'er was unimpressed. The jade vial she'd just opened snapped shut. "A Supreme? Send him away."
