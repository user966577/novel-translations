Meanwhile, Nangong Yun drifted back toward the Anti-Huaxia Alliance in a daze, exhausted in body and spirit. He rubbed his temples and exhaled. "Everything will get better."

He took a deep breath — and frowned. The air tasted like iron. He sniffed again. Blood. The metallic tang was unmistakable. His face changed. The only people nearby were Alliance members. This much blood meant one thing: the Alliance was under attack.

He rushed forward at full speed. Before he arrived, the sounds of battle reached him — crashes, screams, each cry a familiar voice. The Alliance was losing badly.

When he finally reached the base, standing atop a tree and surveying the carnage, his eyes nearly split from rage. This wasn't losing. This was slaughter. His people had no capacity to resist. Bodies littered the ground, blood pooling into streams.

"Stop! All of you, stop!" He launched himself into the fight, his Supreme-level cultivation surging as he hurled an attack at the nearest enemy.

His brothers saw him and screamed. "Boss, run! Run!" They knew these enemies were beyond them. Running was the only option. But Nangong Yun, seeing so many of his brothers lying in blood, was nearly beyond reason. His eyes were crimson, locked on the invaders.

They turned to him with gleaming eyes. "Boss? So you're the Anti-Huaxia Alliance's leader, Nangong Yun?" They saw an opportunity — the biggest prize.

But Nangong Yun, half-mad with grief and fury, didn't answer. He roared and charged. He'd truly lost his mind. His beloved senior sister — taken. Xue Yue, who'd loved him — taken. His master who'd sheltered him — taken. The contempt in their eyes would haunt him forever.

Those wounds alone, he could barely endure. But in his heart, one conviction had held firm: once the Alliance grew strong, he'd prove himself and win them all back. Clinging to that belief, he'd forced himself upright and returned. What greeted him was catastrophe. Fewer than a tenth of his brothers survived, and the survivors were all gravely wounded — finished. His conviction shattered. Grief and rage flooded in, drowning his reason.

He fought wildly, recklessly, hurling attacks at every enemy in sight. They watched him like a circus act. A Supreme's attacks couldn't scratch a Great Emperor. One casually raised a palm, and the blow landed harmlessly.

"Enough playing around. Kill him and take his head back to the Zhou family for the bounty."

A single palm strike sent Nangong Yun flying. Blood sprayed from his mouth, mixed with fragments of organs. The searing pain jolted a sliver of clarity back into him.

"The Zhou family?" The name ignited fresh fury. The Alliance's two Great Emperors had been killed by the Zhou family, and now they'd come to finish the job. He struggled upright, murder in his eyes — but with reason returning, he knew the truth. He couldn't hurt a single person here. He was simply too weak.

He had to run. But how could he abandon his brothers?

While he wavered, another attack came hurtling toward him. He braced himself — but a figure darted in front of him at the last instant.

A muffled impact. The man exploded into a cloud of red mist. Blood and chunks of flesh splattered across Nangong Yun.

He stared blankly. He'd been thinking of running, and his brother had given his life to protect him. Guilt flooded every fiber of his being.

More Alliance members gathered around him. "Boss, go! We'll hold them!" Others joined them, faces set with grim resolve.

Nangong Yun's eyes burned. His fists trembled. "You..."

"Boss, don't waste time! We can't hold them long. Go!"

"We'll all go together!"

Someone slapped him across the face. "Wake up! Look at them — they're all Great Emperors. We can't escape. Every second our brothers buy with their lives, you waste standing here. Go!"

The slap and the shout finally cut through the haze. And of course, deep down, he didn't want to die either.

Tears streaming down his face, he watched his brothers fall one by one. It felt like a blade through his heart. Each time someone died, he seemed to hear their voice telling him to run.

"Go!" they screamed again.

He wiped his tears, took a shaking breath, swept one last look across his brothers, and clenched his jaw. Without another word, he turned and fled.

"After him! Don't let him escape!" His pursuers shouted, but Nangong Yun didn't look back. Behind him, every remaining Alliance member threw themselves at the enemy, buying him those final seconds with their lives.

Minutes later, every last one of them lay in a pool of blood.

The pursuers glanced in Nangong Yun's direction but made no move to follow. A figure emerged from the dense forest — Black Dragon.

"Greetings, Lord Black Dragon." The group bowed in unison.

Black Dragon waved them off. "Well done. Now go stage a fake pursuit. You may wound him, but do not take his life. Understood?"

"Understood."

"The Manor Lord says that once this is over, your Zhou family may continue to exist."

"Thank you, my lord. Please convey our gratitude to the Manor Lord. The Zhou family is willing to follow Huaxia's every command."

"Good. Get to it."

"Yes, sir."
