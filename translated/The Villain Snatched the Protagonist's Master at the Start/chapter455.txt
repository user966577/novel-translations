Liu Shuwan, Lian'er, Jian Yao, Mo Mo, and Xue Yue all came over to welcome the new sisters.

Watching the harmonious scene, Qin Jiang nodded with satisfaction. It had to be him. Anyone else's women would have been at each other's throats by now. But then again, not everyone had his stamina.

While the women were introducing themselves, someone knocked on the courtyard gate. Mu Yunxiao was startled — deep in the mountains like this, no one should be visiting besides Yue Weiwei.

Weiwei glanced at Qin Jiang. "It's Nangong Yun. He's back."

"Nangong Yun..." Mu Yunxiao blinked, only now remembering she still had a disciple.

She didn't open the gate. Instead, she looked nervously at Qin Jiang. Nangong Yun had founded the Anti-Huaxia Alliance, and Qin Jiang was Huaxia's lord. In bed, he'd even threatened her with it — said Nangong Yun's actions could implicate both her and Weiwei. He'd claimed he was joking, but Mu Yunxiao didn't quite believe him. To Qin Jiang, Nangong Yun was a rebel — someone who should be killed.

If it were only Nangong Yun, she could live with it. But if Weiwei got dragged in... Her small hands clenched. Her bond with Nangong Yun was purely nominal — she'd taken him as a disciple out of pity, and now he'd brought this on himself. If Qin Jiang killed him, she'd feel a flicker of sadness at most. But Weiwei was different. She'd raised that girl like her own daughter. Weiwei absolutely could not be implicated.

Mu Yunxiao bit her lip and glanced toward the bedroom. Should she go... bribe him? No, that wasn't the right word. Given who benefited, it was hardly a bribe.

While she was still debating, Xue Yue looked at the gate with undisguised disgust. "Just leave him outside. He'll make everyone nauseous if he comes in."

"Agreed — the sight of him turns my stomach." Weiwei nodded emphatically.

Liu Shuwan and the others chimed in without hesitation, backing their sisters. Mu Yunxiao was confused. Why did they all despise Nangong Yun so much? Even Weiwei, his own senior sister, couldn't stand him. What had he done?

Sensing her confusion, Weiwei took her arm. "Master, Nangong Yun is an absolute creep. You should expel him."

"What did he do?"

Weiwei and Xue Yue exchanged a glance, then took turns recounting everything. As Mu Yunxiao listened, her brow furrowed deeper and deeper — especially the part about Nangong Yun asking Xue Yue to "share Weiwei's burden." Genuine disgust crossed her face. She'd never imagined that her moment of compassion would produce a disciple like this.

Now she wanted Qin Jiang to kill him outright. She wouldn't feel an ounce of grief.

"He truly is revolting," Mu Yunxiao declared, then turned to Qin Jiang with a cautious tone. "Can I let him in, just to expel him formally?"

"Of course. It's your decision."

"And once I expel him, his actions won't implicate Weiwei?"

Weiwei blinked. Nangong Yun's actions could implicate her? She shot Qin Jiang a suspicious look. This scoundrel must have used that to scare her master.

Noticing the accusation in Weiwei's eyes, Qin Jiang cleared his throat. "I told you before — no matter what, Nangong Yun's affairs won't affect either of you."

Mu Yunxiao tilted her head. Had he actually said that? She didn't think so. He'd only promised to be "gentle with beauties," which was... close enough, she supposed. She nodded and pointed at the gate. "Then... let him in?"

"Go ahead."

Qin Jiang waved a hand and the gate swung open, revealing Nangong Yun. His eyes found Mu Yunxiao first, and the flush on her cheeks sent a stab through his heart. So even his master had been... The pain was sharp.

Taking a deep breath, he entered the courtyard and bowed. "Your disciple Nangong Yun greets his master."

"No need for formalities." Mu Yunxiao flicked her wrist, and a pulse of energy lifted him upright.

He straightened. "Thank you, Mas—"

She cut him off, her voice flat. "From this moment forward, our master-disciple bond is severed."

Nangong Yun went rigid. He stared at her in disbelief, his voice trembling. "M-Master, what did you say?"

"I said our master-disciple bond is severed. Did you hear me?"

His face went white. He swayed on his feet, grief flooding his eyes. "Master, I—"

"I am not your master." She gave him no room to speak. Pitiful as he looked, she felt not a shred of sympathy. After hearing what Weiwei and Xue Yue had told her, she would never pity this man again. Just as Weiwei had said — he was a creep. Disgusting.

The revulsion in her eyes chilled Nangong Yun to the bone. In a single day, even his master had turned against him. He couldn't deceive himself any longer. His master, his senior sister, and Xue Yue had all truly left him and gone to that man's side.

He looked at Qin Jiang, who wore a faint smile and regarded him without a trace of emotion, like a god gazing down at an ant. Nangong Yun couldn't hold the eye contact. He lowered his head.

Qin Jiang smiled, pulled Mu Yunxiao close with one arm and Weiwei with the other, and looked at Nangong Yun. "There's no place for you here. Go back to your Anti-Huaxia Alliance."

Nangong Yun raised his head, fists clenched. He wasn't empty-handed — he still had his brothers in the Alliance. As for his master, senior sister, and Xue Yue, no matter what, one day he'd bring them back. They were merely deceived, temporarily led astray. He would show them who the right choice truly was.
