While Qin Jiang was enjoying life aboard the airship, the powerful factions of Mystic Cloud Heaven were anything but relaxed. Every faction with True Immortals was watching the airship's movements with dread.

They knew that only they posed any obstacle to Huaxia, which meant Huaxia's gaze would fall on them next.

The precedents were clear. The Nangong family had merely spread some "rumors" and been annihilated. The Zhou family had been forced to purge an entire branch. The Blood Tribe had lost a Human Immortal and, according to the gossip, their chief's wife had been stolen.

That last detail haunted every clan leader. They looked at their own wives and worried. Their dao companions were beautiful women. If that man took a liking to one of them, could they resist? Obviously not.

Perhaps the best they could do was stand guard at the bedroom door and ensure His Lordship's enjoyment went uninterrupted.

The thought made them sick, but for the sake of their clans, they could only endure. Several leaders had already warned their wives to "prepare." The resulting domestic chaos was spectacular—screaming matches, physical altercations, and all-out warfare within their own households.

All this, because Qin Jiang was aimlessly drifting around in his airship.

This was the power of his name. Before he'd so much as set foot in their territory, his reputation alone had thrown True Immortal factions into disarray. No one else in the world could achieve that.

He drifted through Mystic Cloud Heaven for a full half-month, visiting nearly every corner.

One morning, Qin Jiang emerged from Murong Qing's room looking thoroughly satisfied. He stretched and yawned. The first person he spotted was Xue Yue.

He sidled up and put an arm around her, dropping his voice. "What are you doing here? Don't let your mom see us."

She rolled her eyes. He and her mother were the ones sneaking around. She was the one pretending not to know.

"So what if she sees?" she muttered. "I don't mind."

"You don't, but she does." He took her hand, pulling her away from the door. "Besides, the secrecy makes it more exciting."

"Pervert."

She glanced back. "Can she handle you alone?"

Xue Yue knew firsthand what he was like. Going solo was rough.

He laughed and pinched her cheek. "I'm nothing if not gentle. Trust me—I held back."

"So when are you going to be open about it? You can't sneak around forever."

"When she's ready. Right now, the main issue is... she can't accept you."

"Me?"

"It's a mother-daughter thing. Sharing the same man isn't easy to process." He flashed a mischievous grin. "But I've been working on desensitization."

"Desensitization?"

"I keep mentioning your name during... you know. At first, she'd panic. Now she barely flinches. Give it a little more time and she'll be comfortable."

Xue Yue blinked. "That sounds less like desensitization and more like your personal fetish."

He coughed and flicked her forehead. "Don't say the quiet part loud."

"Hmph." She was secretly looking forward to the day all three of them could be together openly.

"She's actually starting to enjoy the whole sneaking-around aspect. And the part where I bring up your name."

Perhaps everyone craved a little danger. The thrill of the forbidden, of pushing boundaries. Within reason, of course.

They were chatting when the other women gathered around. Liu Shuwan and An Xihe approached together.

"Your aimless wandering has actually been surprisingly effective," Liu Shuwan said.

"How so?"

"Our cruising past every major faction has thrown the entire region into chaos. The True Immortal factions are terrified. They've been tracking the airship nonstop. Some have had internal splits—parts of their leadership want to join Huaxia while the old guard refuses. Several have already declared willingness to submit."

Qin Jiang scratched his head. He'd been wandering purely because he was bored, not as psychological warfare. But apparently his every move carried outsized weight.

'These factions are way too skittish.'

He coughed. "Clearly, everything is proceeding according to plan."

"So what's next?"

"Among those True Immortal factions—have any fully committed to joining us?"

"Some have. But it's only certain factions within them, not the whole leadership. That's what's causing the infighting. Every clan has its share of diehards who won't bend until they're forced."

Qin Jiang rubbed his chin. "Going in directly doesn't feel right."

The women exchanged glances. With his reputation, "going in directly" wouldn't change much.

"We should find a proper justification. Can't damage Huaxia's image."

The women were privately amused. Huaxia's image among the powerful was already beyond repair, thanks to its Manor Lord. Among ordinary people, the marketing was impeccable—Qin Jiang was practically a guardian deity. But anyone at a certain level of power knew exactly what he was.

Pretext or no pretext, the outcome would be the same. But if he wanted to play the game, they'd play along.
