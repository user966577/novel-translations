Lian'er finally emerged from seclusion.

She'd pushed herself hard, breaking through to Great Emperor and then Ancient Emperor in one continuous surge, stopping just one step short of Human Immortal. She'd fully expected to have caught up to her brother.

Then she found him and her jaw dropped. He was already a Human Immortal.

After a quick self-assessment, she concluded that overpowering him by force was... not going to happen.

The wind left her sails. Her little face crumpled. She genuinely did not want to go back into seclusion — it was miserable, exhausting, boring, and she didn't get to see her brother. Worst of all, she could see no realistic path to surpassing Qin Jiang's cultivation speed.

But just as dejection set in, the Immortal Fire at her brow flickered softly, as if encouraging her. After a moment, determination returned to her eyes.

"I can't give up!"

If she couldn't beat him in a straight fight, she'd use strategy.

Her gaze slid to Little Red — her beloved companion, her best friend. She'd send her in as an advance agent.

"Hehe, Red, we're besties, right?"

Little Red's eyes narrowed with suspicion. "What do you want me to do?"

"Hehe, just be my inside woman."

Lian'er pulled Little Red close and laid out her plan in a conspiratorial whisper. Little Red already knew about Lian'er's feelings — there was no point hiding them.

And Little Red understood. A man this exceptional wasn't one you let slip away. Besides, in yao culture, there really weren't as many taboos about this sort of thing...

The plan's first phase was simple: Little Red would seduce Qin Jiang, embed herself at his side, and serve as Lian'er's inside agent for the eventual operation.

She didn't object to the concept, but execution was another matter. "I don't know how to seduce anyone."

"Oh, seducing my brother is easy. With your looks, just take your clothes off. He'll bite."

Lian'er patted her shoulder confidently.

After some thought, Little Red nodded. Fair point. That man never refused. His philosophy was simple — never miss a good girl, never pass on a bad girl, and as long as she was pretty, she was his.

Little Red glanced down at herself. With her assets? He definitely wouldn't say no.

"Should I go try?"

"Mm-hmm!" Lian'er nodded eagerly, then added a cautionary note: "But don't defect."

"We're besties!" Little Red thumped her chest.

The resulting bounce made even Lian'er a bit envious. She looked down at herself. Not bad either! She drew herself up and measured against Little Red. Perfectly competitive.

With Huaxia Manor running smoothly, Qin Jiang had settled into a life of leisure. The women weren't particularly busy either — they cultivated occasionally, but mostly stayed by his side. The cultivation wasn't neglected, of course, since being with Qin Jiang boosted their progress at a rather impressive rate.

The Void Divine Temple was a picture of warmth and harmony.

"Brother!"

Lian'er emerged from the Space-Time Temple with Little Red in tow, making a beeline for Qin Jiang, who was surrounded by his women. She greeted him first, then flashed her most dazzling smile at the assembly: "Hello, sisters-in-law!"

"Lian'er, you're out of seclusion!" The women responded warmly. As Qin Jiang's one and only little sister, she was the group's undisputed darling. They immediately swarmed her, chatting and laughing and pressing little gifts into her hands.

Lian'er accepted everything without a second thought. She was used to it.

"All right, all right," Liu Shuwan interjected. "She just got out. Let her spend some time alone with Qin Jiang." She winked at Lian'er, then led the others away.

Lian'er froze, staring at Liu Shuwan's retreating figure. Had her sister-in-law noticed something? But it seemed like... she was helping?

While she was still processing, Qin Jiang pinched her cheek and turned her face toward him. "What are you staring at? Your sister-in-law's already gone."

"Ow! That hurts!" She wriggled free, glaring at him.

He grinned and released her, then poked the spot he'd just pinched. Soft. Nice.

"Brother, looks like you've added a few new sisters-in-law," Lian'er remarked, glancing back at the group. Some of those women she'd never seen before.

"An Xihe, Qing Chan, and a few others," he said. "You haven't met them yet. I'll introduce you later."

"Okay!" She sidled up and hugged his arm, pressing close. "Hey, Brother — let me introduce you to a wife."

"Oh?"

"You've been in seclusion this whole time. Where'd you find me a wife?"

"Right there — Little Red!" She pointed.

Nearby, Little Red hadn't left. At the mention of her name, her cheeks colored. Then, with surprising boldness, she tossed Qin Jiang a flirtatious look and struck a pose, showing off her... considerable assets.

Qin Jiang looked, smiled, and beckoned her over. She hesitated for a heartbeat, then approached. Before she could say a word, he pulled her into his arms.

"Little Red's been reserved for me since forever. I don't need your introduction." He looked at Lian'er. "You still owe me a wife."

Lian'er stared up at him, wheels turning.

'Owe him a wife? What if I offer myself? Would you dare accept?'

She'd already offered herself several times and he'd pretended nothing happened every single time. She pouted.

"Fine, I owe you one. Just don't be too scared to accept her when I deliver."

"Scared? Me?" Qin Jiang scoffed. "There's no woman in this world I wouldn't dare accept. Well — no ugly ones."

"Hmph."

Lian'er rolled her eyes. She definitely wasn't ugly. But would he really dare?

He'd been offered multiple times already and chickened out every time!

Meanwhile, Little Red, who'd been quiet in his arms, looked up at him. "I don't recall agreeing to be your wife."

"Oh?" Interest sparked in his eyes. Symbolic resistance? He grinned and tightened his hold on her waist. "You don't want to be my wife?"

She glanced away without answering. She did want to, but giving herself away for nothing felt... beneath her dignity. The least he could do was put in some effort.

Lian'er watched the exchange without comment. When it came to her brother, token resistance was less of a deterrent and more of a spice.
