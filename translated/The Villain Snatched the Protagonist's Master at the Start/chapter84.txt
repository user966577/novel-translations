Back at the Qin family estate, the ancestors promptly summoned Qin Jiang. Nothing urgent—they just wanted to check in and ask whether he'd dreamed of any treasures lately.

As it happened, altering various minor plot points had earned him a decent haul of system rewards—pills, spirit artifacts, and the like. Nothing he personally needed. He dumped it all out in one go.

"That's it?" The ancestors picked through the pile, clearly disappointed. Nothing impressive.

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. They'd been spoiled rotten. These treasures might be unremarkable to him, but most of them were genuinely useful for Supreme Realm cultivators.

"Don't want them? Toss them, then. No use to me either." He shrugged. Junk—just taking up space.

The ancestors' mouths twitched. They weren't interested, true, but the items were still valuable. Best not to be wasteful.

After unloading the "garbage," Qin Jiang left the ancestors to their rummaging and headed back to his residence. Qin Lian'er and Bai Susu had taken Liu Shuwan into the Void Divine Temple. Upon seeing the veritable army of women inside—all shapes and sizes—Liu Shuwan's mind went blank.

"Hehe, Wan'er, all of these are my sisters-in-law," Qin Lian'er announced helpfully.

Liu Shuwan was speechless. She suddenly recalled asking Qin Jiang how many women he had. He hadn't been joking. The man was honest after all. Several hundred of them!

Her fists clenched and her jaw tightened, but in the end, she took a deep breath and let it out with a resigned sigh. What could she do? Her man had his preferences, and she could only indulge him. Besides, she was his favorite.

"Can I pick any room?" she asked.

Qin Lian'er nodded with a grin and pointed at the largest building. "Wan'er, why not take that one?"

"It's enormous..." Liu Shuwan gaped. The structure looked like it could house a thousand people. What was Qin Jiang planning to do with it?

"Does Qin Jiang live there?"

"Yep! Brother spends most of his time there. The other sisters told me he doesn't even close the door when he sleeps..."

Liu Shuwan was silent. In this Void Divine Temple, Qin Jiang probably went to bed only to wake up surrounded by—well, maybe not hundreds. But a few dozen, surely?

The excess was staggering. And at his age, his body could still handle it, but at this rate, could he really keep it up?

No—she needed to get him some proper tonics!

"Fine. I'll move in with Qin Jiang," she decided, and settled into the grand residence.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang didn't enter the Void Divine Temple right away. He made his way to the Fortune-Sealing Stele first.

After a moment's consideration, he flipped his palm. A milky-white crystal taller than a man materialized before him. The ambient spiritual energy immediately surged.

"So this is the Immortal Marrow."

Qin Jiang ran his hand along the crystal. This was the system's reward—a genuine immortal-grade substance capable of generating Immortal Qi and enhancing the density and quality of spiritual energy. Plant it within the Qin family estate, and over time, the entire compound might become a miniature immortal realm.

"I'll bury it beneath the Fortune-Sealing Stele."

He hefted the stele aside, revealing a hollow underneath, and dropped the Immortal Marrow in before replacing the stele. Almost immediately, the surrounding spiritual energy felt noticeably denser. As for Immortal Qi—that he couldn't sense yet.

"At this rate, the Marrow's effects will spread beyond the estate before long." He frowned. He didn't intend to share a single drop of benefit with outsiders.

【The host may use the Fortune-Sealing Stele to control the Immortal Marrow's effective range.】

The system's reminder came right on time.

Qin Jiang perked up—the stele had hidden functions? He reached out to it mentally, and sure enough, through the stele, he could control the distribution of all energy.

He got to work. His own residence received the lion's share, with the bulk channeled into the Void Divine Temple. His parents' quarters got a generous portion. The ancestors' cultivation chambers needed a decent amount too. The younger generation represented the family's future—allocate accordingly. As for Reflection Cliff, where offenders were sent as punishment? Cut the spiritual energy there entirely.

After a while, he was satisfied with the distribution.

Across the estate, cultivators suddenly noticed a dramatic spike in ambient spiritual energy. And on Reflection Cliff, a certain elder in seclusion felt his brow furrow as the energy around him inexplicably dropped.

Just as Qin Jiang was about to enter the Void Divine Temple, something caught his attention. He pulled out the Seven Beauties Painting, which was trembling in his hands. He unfurled it. The Holy Sword Sect founder's once-blurry silhouette had become crystal clear.

"It worked?"

Delighted, he poked at the figure.

The painting shuddered, and the founder materialized before him. "Stop poking me!"

She glared at him.

Qin Jiang blinked. "You came out on your own?"

"Hmph!" She snorted. "You lied to me, you little brat! You didn't tell me about the Seven Beauties Painting's restrictions!"

Now that she was one of the Seven Beauties, she understood the painting's mechanics fully. It was supposed to make her obey Qin Jiang unconditionally.

Qin Jiang fell silent. The painting's effect clearly hadn't worked on her.

He studied her, baffled.

Seeing his confusion, the founder straightened up proudly. "Don't bother looking. Your painting is powerful, but it's not strong enough yet. Forcing it to resurrect me drained too much of its energy. Right now, it can't control me. I'm a Great Emperor, after all!"

Qin Jiang's eyes went wide. He'd gotten the short end of the stick.

"But," she continued with a sigh, "even though it can't control me, there are limitations. My power is too much for it—I can only manifest for about two hours a day. Any longer and the painting might collapse, and I'd vanish. Along with that little wife of yours."

She paused thoughtfully. "So you'll need to strengthen quickly and upgrade the painting. I know you tricked me, but I'm magnanimous—I won't hold it against you. And I made you a promise: resurrect me, and I'm yours. I don't go back on my word. But... two hours. Is that enough?"

She batted her eyes at him.

Qin Jiang considered it, then shook his head. "Two hours is a bit rushed."

"Exactly, my dear little husband~ So hurry up and upgrade the painting so I can come out longer. Trust me—you won't be disappointed."

The founder smiled coyly, her confidence clearly well-founded.
