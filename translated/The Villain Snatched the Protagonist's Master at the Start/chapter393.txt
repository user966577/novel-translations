Amid a grand send-off, Qin Jiang and his party left Grey Cloud Heaven.

Within a few days, they were back in Qin Domain. An Xihe and the other women who'd traveled with him returned to the Void Divine Temple first, while Qin Jiang brought Li Qingqiu to meet the family.

When the introductions were done, a new jade bracelet adorned Li Qingqiu's wrist — identical to the ones An Xihe and the rest wore.

She turned it over in her fingers, a small smile warming her face. Xihe had explained that these bracelets signified the elders' acceptance. Every one of Qin Jiang's women had one.

Now, so did she. That meant she was officially part of the Qin family.

Qin Jiang took her hand and led her back to the Void Divine Temple. A crowd of women was already waiting. The moment he appeared, they swarmed him.

They hadn't ignored Li Qingqiu — An Xihe's group had already spread the word about the new sister.

"Welcome, Qingqiu." Liu Shuwan was the first to approach, smiling warmly and linking arms.

She guided Li Qingqiu through the introductions while the others greeted her with easy warmth. But so many new faces at once left Li Qingqiu slightly overwhelmed. She was naturally reserved — at ease only around Qin Jiang. Facing this many sisters simultaneously, she didn't know where to look. When the enthusiastic welcomes became too much, she sent Qin Jiang a desperate glance.

He smiled, shook his head, and waded in to extract her. Then he handled the introductions himself, holding her hand the whole time to keep her grounded. She'd been nervous meeting his parents, and she was nervous now — an ice queen on the surface, a social disaster underneath.

Once rescued, she relaxed slightly as the women's attention shifted to Qin Jiang instead.

He gave her hand a reassuring squeeze, scanned the room, and changed the subject. "Where's Lian'er?"

"After you left, she went into seclusion to break through to Human Immortal. Should be close to done by now."

With the Space-Time Temple's accelerated flow, Qin Jiang's month away equaled over a decade inside. Lian'er's foundation was solid enough for the attempt. Dan Yu, Xiao Jiu, and Little Red were also in seclusion, pushing for Human Immortal. Meanwhile, Xue Mei, Ning Xue'er, and Chen Baizhe were targeting True Immortal.

Everyone else was out and accounted for.

"Also," Liu Shuwan continued, "while you were gone, we held a tournament in Qin Domain. Selected a hundred students for Huaxia Academy, plus thirty from our own family. About a hundred and thirty total."

"That fast?"

"We were bored." She smiled. "Nothing to do while you were away, so we organized it ourselves."

He nodded. "Numbers sound right. I'll trust your judgment on the roster."

"Great, then it's settled."

Liu Shuwan stepped forward and took his arm, eyes glinting. "Now that business is out of the way... shall we get to the real agenda?"

Every woman in the room fixed their gaze on Qin Jiang. The hunger was palpable.

He coughed. "Space-Time Temple?"

"Mm~"

She nodded and steered him toward the temple. Her free hand waved the sisters forward. "Let's go, everyone! To the Space-Time Temple~"

"Meat time~!"

"Can I go first? I've been starving for over a month..."

"No! Me first!"

"I want first too!"

Before they'd even arrived, the bickering had begun — though their pace didn't slow a fraction.

Li Qingqiu hung back, unsure whether to follow. Mo Mo appeared at her side, smiling, and linked arms. "Come on, Qingqiu. Let's join the fun."

Over the past month, the women who'd traveled with Qin Jiang hadn't gone hungry. But a proper feast was a proper feast, and besides, Qin Jiang owed them for weeks of one-sided torment. With the full sisterhood assembled, it was time to settle that debt.

The stay-at-home sisters had been starving for over a month. Surely, with these numbers, they could overwhelm a single Qin Jiang?

For insurance, An Xihe recruited Hu Xian'er and her White Fox Tribe. Several mature foxes would join the battle — green as they were, even cannon fodder counted.

Hu Xian'er agreed. She'd brought the entire tribe along precisely so they could help.

And so, under Hu Xian'er's command, a detachment of white foxes filed into the Space-Time Temple.

Surrounded, Qin Jiang could feel the storm gathering. His opponents had been resting for over a month — a full month of pent-up battle lust.

This fight would shake the heavens.

Even he wasn't guaranteed victory. But fear? Never. Because Qin Jiang had never lost. And even now, he could proudly declare: 'My little brother is undefeated!'

The two sides faced off. The atmosphere thickened. Then Qin Jiang flared his aura and his robes disintegrated.

The gauntlet had been thrown. Every woman locked onto him. A heartbeat of frozen silence — then they pounced, a wolf pack descending on a lone stag.

He vanished beneath the tide. Chaos erupted. Until a triumphant shriek cut through the melee:

"I win! I'm first~!"

Yan Shiya, crowing with delight, clutched her prize in one hand and waved it at the others.

The rest pouted. "This rule isn't fair — it always favors Shiya!"

"Yeah! Way too unfair!"

"We should compete on cuteness instead."

"Just draw lots."

The bickering escalated. Yan Shiya, already nestled against Qin Jiang and clinging tight, shot back: "What's unfair about it? Fastest hand wins. I grabbed it first, so I eat first."

The infighting had begun before the real battle even started. In the end, it took the enemy commander himself to broker peace:

"Shiya wins this time. Going forward — we draw lots."
