Chen Changsheng looked at Chen Qi'er. The man was in terrible shape — had he been strung along the same way?

Very likely.

"Qin Jiang!" Chen Qi'er snapped back to reality, eyes blazing with fury. "What more do you want? If you've got the guts, just kill me!"

One humiliation after another — he felt like he was on the verge of breaking. And now Qin Jiang had dragged him here, no doubt for another round. Then there was Chen Changsheng. Was this his idea? In Chen Qi'er's mind, Chen Changsheng was still Qin Jiang's closest friend. Just days ago, Qin Jiang had said he was avenging Chen Changsheng and beaten him up because of it. Now they'd brought him here to be humiliated again?

He seethed with hatred. A Human Immortal — someone who should command reverence — yet here he was, enduring degradation after degradation. His gaze turned predatory. This time, if Qin Jiang tried to humiliate him again, he'd drag someone down with him even if it killed him.

His eyes settled on Chen Changsheng. Qin Jiang had Dao Zhen guarding him, but Chen Changsheng was alone. Chen Qi'er's eyes narrowed. His form flickered, and in an instant he materialized behind Chen Changsheng. A brutal grip locked the man in place, one hand clamped over his skull. He turned to Qin Jiang with a savage grin.

"Ha ha ha! Qin Jiang — you wouldn't want to watch your best friend die, would you?"

After all, his original reason for hunting Chen Changsheng was to torture him in front of Qin Jiang. He'd failed to capture him before, but now, the man had been delivered right to his doorstep. The memory of every humiliation fueled his rage. Power surged through his palm, crushing down on Chen Changsheng until the man's body went rigid.

Chen Changsheng's face darkened. Between Chen Qi'er's words and the situation, the picture was clear — this idiot had been completely played. 'Best friends?' How had Qin Jiang even said that with a straight face?

Fighting through the splitting pain in his skull, Chen Changsheng was about to explain when he saw Qin Jiang's face contort with panic.

"Chen Qi'er, calm down — don't do anything rash!"

Chen Changsheng's expression went black. Right on cue, he felt the killing intent pouring off Chen Qi'er intensify.

He didn't hesitate. "Qin Jiang, you bastard! Who's your best friend? I want to eat your flesh and drink your blood! This man — don't be impulsive — Qin Jiang played you! I'm not his friend at all. He and I are enemies — bitter, blood-deep enemies!"

He cursed Qin Jiang with one breath and explained to Chen Qi'er with the next. Chen Qi'er frowned. From the other side, Qin Jiang seemed to falter, then quickly nodded.

"Right, right, right. Ha ha ha! Chen Qi'er, you moron — I fooled you and you didn't even realize. Chen Chang— ahem. Chen Changsheng and I are mortal enemies!"

Chen Changsheng's face was a thundercloud. He glared at Qin Jiang, a bitter ache in his chest. He was simply too weak. Anyone could push him around. Qin Jiang only had to dupe one fool, and suddenly he was a plaything.

Sure enough, hearing Qin Jiang's words, Chen Qi'er sneered. "Heh. Qin Jiang, do you really take me for an idiot?"

Ha — 'mortal enemies,' he says. He'd slipped and said 'Chen Chang— brother' before catching himself. Did he think I didn't notice?

Chen Qi'er smirked. 'You're trying to use reverse psychology to save your best friend? Not a chance. I'm far too clever for that.'

Watching Chen Qi'er's self-satisfied expression, Qin Jiang shook his head helplessly. "What would it take for you to believe me?"

"Believe you?" Chen Qi'er scoffed. He would never believe Qin Jiang — this man had no shame whatsoever. Believe him? He'd sooner believe a courtesan was in love with him.

Seeing that, Qin Jiang smacked his lips and looked at Chen Qi'er. "How about this: I'll humiliate Chen Changsheng right in front of you. That should convince you."

Chen Changsheng's face changed. Humiliate him?

Chen Qi'er frowned but kept his grip on Chen Changsheng, making no move to release him.

A strange smile crept across Qin Jiang's face. He studied the two of them — the distance was just right. His grin widened. "Should be about time," he murmured.

The moment the words left his mouth, Chen Changsheng's complexion shifted. His body was growing warm. He'd actually felt something off since the beginning, but with Chen Qi'er restraining him, he'd assumed the discomfort came from the pressure. Now, looking at Qin Jiang's eerie smile, dread coiled in his stomach.

Then his body went stiff. Chen Qi'er was pressing closer — and closer still. Squirming slightly.

"You..." He craned his neck with difficulty. Chen Qi'er's face was flushed a deep crimson, heat radiating off his entire body. And Chen Changsheng himself felt the same rising warmth.

The pills had activated.

The system-formulated drug lay dormant in the body until triggered. During the conversation, Qin Jiang had released the catalyst — colorless, odorless, harmless to anyone who hadn't taken the pill, but a violent accelerant for those who had.

Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng's states deteriorated rapidly. Qin Jiang's grin turned positively deranged. But this particular show wasn't one he cared to watch. He let out a bark of laughter.

"A little gift I prepared for you two. Enjoy."

He turned and strode out of the courtyard, Dao Zhen scrambling after him. Behind them, a formation snapped into place, sealing the courtyard shut.
