In the residence, Liu Shuwan's brows were tightly knit, her eyes clouded with frustration. She hadn't expected those persistent pests from thousands of years ago to still come crawling back.

Beside her, Qin Jiang appeared calm, but a cold light flickered in his gaze. 'My woman—you don't even get to think about her.'

"Qin Jiang, I really didn't expect those people to still—"

"No need to explain." Qin Jiang cut her off with a gentle smile and took her hand. "Leave this to me."

"But..." Liu Shuwan hesitated. "They were all prodigies six thousand years ago. At minimum, they're Supreme Realm cultivators. Some are even half-Emperors..."

"Relax." He waved dismissively. "I'll make sure they behave. None of them will bother you again."

"Maybe I should handle it instead?" Liu Shuwan's hand drifted to the sword at her waist. "If they show up one by one, I'll cut them down one by one. I guarantee they'll stop coming."

Clearly, she was just as sick of these relentless suitors. They'd been insufferable back then, and now they had the gall to pursue her again. What if Qin Jiang got the wrong idea? She was furious.

Seeing his wife this fired up gave Qin Jiang a deep sense of security. Still, this was better handled by him.

"This is between men. Let me deal with it."

He pulled Liu Shuwan into his arms. Wrapped in his warmth, her body relaxed completely against him. She gave a small nod. "Fine, you handle it. But if anything goes wrong, tell me—I'll cut them down for you."

"Done."

Just then, a booming laugh echoed across the entire Holy Sword Sect. "Hahahaha! Wan'er, congratulations on achieving Sword Heart! How about gracing me with a meeting?"

The voice reverberated, laced with overwhelming spiritual power.

Inside the residence, Liu Shuwan's expression turned icy. Her hand gripped her sword. But Qin Jiang caught her wrist first.

"I'll handle it."

He pressed a kiss to her forehead, then looked skyward, his eyes going cold. He stomped the ground and rocketed upward.

An instant later, he appeared before the man. Before the intruder could even speak, Qin Jiang's voice rang out, fury barely contained.

"'Wan'er'? You think you can call her that? Fourth Ancestor—kill him!"

A massive hand descended from the heavens, giving the man no chance to resist. It closed around him, and in a burst of crimson mist, he was gone.

Everyone froze.

The man had been recognized by many—a half-Emperor, one of the most powerful beings on Heavenly Mystery Continent. And he'd been obliterated in a single strike.

Even Liu Shuwan was momentarily stunned. "A Great Emperor..." she murmured, eyes wide with shock. The Qin family had a Great Emperor? And one that served as Qin Jiang's personal protector?

High above, the kill hadn't satisfied Qin Jiang. Some ancient fossil daring to address her so intimately—

"Fourth Ancestor, you knew him?"

"I did."

"Then wipe out his entire clan."

The Fourth Ancestor paused. Exterminate a clan over a form of address? He considered offering counsel, but one look at the ice in Qin Jiang's eyes made him think better of it. He knew his young master—once a decision was made, it was final.

"No problem."

Qin Jiang's expression eased slightly, but knowing that Liu Shuwan had even more suitors out there soured his mood again. These old fossils were all insufferably bold. Letting them come here was revolting.

"Black Dragon!"

Black Dragon appeared instantly.

"You have one day. Find out every person who pursued Wan'er six thousand years ago. Hunt them down, every last one. As for anyone headed toward the Holy Sword Sect—intercept and kill them. I don't want to see a single one."

"Young Master, these individuals all have powerful factions behind them. If they resist—"

"Exterminate their clans." Qin Jiang's gaze was glacial. "Do I need to spell it out? Go back and tell the ancestors—this is my decision. The Qin family's strength doesn't need to stay hidden anymore."

"Yes."

Black Dragon acknowledged the order and vanished.

Qin Jiang rubbed his forehead. At that moment, Liu Shuwan appeared before him and took his hand.

He gave a self-deprecating laugh. "Am I being too petty?"

"Not at all." She shook her head, a glimmer of delight in her eyes. "I like it—this feeling of being claimed. As for the others, as long as you're happy, kill them all."

She was no gentle flower. In her previous life, the sword was everything. Interrupt her training, and she'd cut you down without a second thought. Now Qin Jiang occupied that same sacred space in her heart. Anyone who upset him deserved death.

When that half-Emperor had shown up, she'd felt Qin Jiang's rage and wanted to draw her sword immediately. He'd simply beaten her to it—and been even more ruthless.

But that was fine. As long as Qin Jiang was happy.

Everyone else could go to hell for all she cared. She only wanted to be with Qin Jiang.

Back at the residence, Qin Jiang smiled. "No one will bother us again."

"Mm." Liu Shuwan nodded. She'd heard the orders he'd given—assassins dispatched to hunt down every last one.

She was curious, though, about the true extent of the Qin family's power. Her suitors were all formidable, backed by top-tier factions—some rivaling the Qin family's own ancient clans. Yet in Qin Jiang's eyes, they posed no threat whatsoever.

Even a single Great Emperor couldn't afford to ignore that many major powers at once... unless the Qin family had more than one.

If Qin Jiang had a Great Emperor as a personal guard, surely the family itself had Great Emperors stationed at home?

She was curious but didn't ask. That would be the Qin family's deepest secret.

Just then, Qin Lian'er came bounding over. "Brother! Brother! Is our Qin family finally going to rule Heavenly Mystery Continent?"

She was practically shouting while she ran, voice brimming with excitement.

Bai Susu was at her side, staring in bewilderment. Rule the continent? Was she serious?

The two reached Qin Jiang. Qin Lian'er was buzzing with excitement; Bai Susu looked at him quizzically.

Qin Jiang waved them off. "Not yet. For now, we're just giving the continent a small taste of Great Emperor power. As for ruling it..."

He thought for a moment, then said earnestly, "That should only take a little more time."
