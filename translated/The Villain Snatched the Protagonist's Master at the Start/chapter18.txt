Over the next several days, Qin Jiang remained in Azure City Town, cultivating his relationships with Ye Ling'er and Chen Ningbing.

Progress was good.

Then one day, Black Dragon sought him out.

"Young Patriarch, the location you asked me to investigate—I've found it."

"Oh?"

Qin Jiang stood, intrigued.

Beside him, Ye Ling'er perked up.

"What location?"

By now, she'd gradually warmed to Qin Jiang. She was still shy as ever—and still frequently teased to the point of tears.

Qin Jiang smiled.

"A treasure trove.

"I happened to learn about it and sent people to track it down."

Ye Ling'er grew more curious. Anything that warranted this much attention from Qin Jiang had to be extraordinary.

"Young Patriarch, shall we go now?"

Black Dragon spoke up—and gave Qin Jiang a meaningful wink. Through their private mental link, he added:

"Young Patriarch, the Xiao kid has been sniffing around that area."

Qin Jiang's eyes flashed. The Child of Destiny indeed.

Lose one opportunity, and the next was already on its way. If he hadn't known the plotline in advance and simply let Xiao Fan grow unchecked, the protagonist might genuinely have surpassed him someday.

But because of his interference, the storyline had accelerated dramatically. What should have taken a year had nearly played out in a single month.

To learn future plot points, he'd need to spend Villain Points.

"System, how many Villain Points to unlock one year of spoilers?"

Qin Jiang queried silently.

The system responded promptly:

[Costs vary by the Child of Destiny's level. One year of spoilers for Xiao Fan requires 10,000 Villain Points.]

'Only ten thousand?'

Qin Jiang relaxed. A single minor plot change earned him tens of thousands.

A mere ten thousand was pocket change.

After some thought, he decided to hold off on the spoilers. For all he knew, Xiao Fan might annoy him enough to warrant being killed outright, rendering the investment pointless.

Besides, Qin Jiang wanted for nothing. He could get anything from his family or exchange Villain Points for it. Why bother hunting down opportunities the hard way?

He looked at Ye Ling'er.

"Come along, Ling'er."

"Okay~"

---

Dense, verdant forest teemed with hidden demon beasts. Qin Jiang's destination was the Myriad Demon Forest—home to a loose confederation of wild beasts.

Their bloodlines were generally unremarkable. Though some powerful ones lurked in the depths, the overall threat was manageable.

Black Dragon followed behind Qin Jiang. The subtle pressure of his bloodline kept every beast at bay. As a true dragon, his bloodline was already noble—and after absorbing the Ancestral Dragon Blood Essence, it had elevated further.

In the Myriad Demon Forest, perhaps only the beast kings in the deepest reaches could match his bloodline's purity.

Shortly after entering the forest, Black Dragon halted near the outskirts.

"Young Patriarch, the place you're looking for is inside this peak."

He pointed ahead. Faintly visible halfway up the mountainside was a cave opening.

"That obvious?"

Qin Jiang was surprised.

From the air, a cave like that would be spotted instantly. How had it survived this long?

"Ahem. There was a boulder covering it. I... pushed it aside."

Black Dragon scratched his head sheepishly.

Through their mental link, he added:

"The Xiao kid is inside the cave right now."

Qin Jiang shot him a look.

"Why didn't you just flatten the entire mountain while you were at it? You exposed the treasure trove for the whole world to see—what, were you worried nobody would find it?"

Black Dragon seemed embarrassed, grinning awkwardly.

"I'll flatten it right now!"

With a roar, he transformed into an enormous black dragon. His massive body coiled around the peak.

Scales gleaming like cold steel, he squeezed. The mountaintop exploded. Then he launched skyward, his tail whipping down.

BOOM!

Everything above the treasure trove was sheared clean away.

Ye Ling'er's mouth fell open. She looked at Qin Jiang, amusement dancing in her eyes.

"Qin Jiang, Black Dragon really does everything you say."

Anyone could tell Qin Jiang had been joking about flattening the mountain. But Black Dragon had taken it literally.

His earnest devotion was enough to make even Ye Ling'er smile.

Of course, she didn't realize this master-servant pair was in on it together.

When Qin Jiang had said "flatten the mountain," he'd meant it.

Black Dragon reverted to human form, appearing at Qin Jiang's side with a foolish grin.

"Young Patriarch, it's done."

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. His exasperated expression drew another laugh from Ye Ling'er.

Meanwhile...

Inside the cave, Xiao Fan—who had only just entered—was utterly bewildered.

Though this was a treasure trove, its riches weren't easily claimed. He'd fought through several obstacles and had just laid eyes on the prizes within.

Then the entire mountain began shaking violently.

An ear-splitting crash followed. Within moments, he realized the stone ceiling had vanished.

He could see clear sky.

Xiao Fan was stupefied.

"Huh? There's someone in the treasure trove?"

A voice drifted down.

He looked up—and his whole body went cold. The one person he never wanted to see again.

Right there, staring down at him.

"Qin Jiang?"

Xiao Fan rubbed his eyes in disbelief. How was this even possible?

"Oh? Xiao Fan?"

Qin Jiang put on a convincing look of surprise.

Ye Ling'er was equally baffled. What was Xiao Fan doing in the treasure trove?

Qin Jiang's face turned cold. He looked at Black Dragon.

"Black Dragon, what's going on?"

"Young Patriarch, I—"

Black Dragon wore an equally convincing look of shock, as if caught completely off guard.

Inwardly, Qin Jiang gave him full marks. Oscar-worthy performance.

Finally, Black Dragon gritted his teeth and dropped to one knee.

"Young Patriarch, this is my failure!

"I'll eliminate the intruder at once."

He rose, fixing Xiao Fan with a frigid stare. His overwhelming aura slammed down, pinning Xiao Fan to the ground.

Xiao Fan's face twisted as he shouted:

"Qin Jiang, what is this?

"The great Young Patriarch of the Qin family—resorting to stealing other people's opportunities?"

"This treasure trove was discovered by me first. Where's the theft?"

Qin Jiang replied with a cool smile.

"Liar!

"Stealing opportunities and calling it righteous? Hah—is that what the Qin family's Young Patriarch is all about?"

Xiao Fan spat.

Off to the side, Ye Ling'er looked at Xiao Fan sprawled on the ground. A pang of sympathy stirred—but hearing him slander Qin Jiang sparked her anger.

"Qin Jiang has been searching for this place for days.

"Besides, Black Dragon cleared the area around it—that's how you even found the cave. By rights, this belongs to Qin Jiang."

Xiao Fan glared at her.

"You... you're siding with Qin Jiang? Don't forget—the Xiao family raised you!"

"I..."

Ye Ling'er was momentarily tongue-tied.

Qin Jiang pulled her close.

"Ling'er is my wife. Siding with me is perfectly natural.

"Or should she be siding with a thief?"
