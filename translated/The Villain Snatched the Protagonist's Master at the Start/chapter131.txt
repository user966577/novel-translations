The succession was settled. That very day, Long Yu departed the Imperial City for the frontier. His post happened to be the same border Qin Jiang had originally crashed through—the one where he'd killed a few generals, leaving convenient vacancies.

Qin Jiang and Long Xin'er didn't linger long at the palace. The Dragon Emperor had been broadcasting goodwill toward Qin Jiang at every opportunity, both openly and subtly. Qin Jiang acknowledged it with minimal reciprocation.

Back at the Third Princess's mansion, Black Dragon approached and bowed.

"Young Lord, Long Yu has left the Imperial City."

"And?"

"Before leaving, he made a covert stop—met with a contact. We looked into it. The contact belongs to an organization called the Demon Hall. They're a persistent nuisance in the Divine Dragon Empire, something of a tumor. The Dragon Emperor has launched multiple campaigns against them, but with limited success."

Qin Jiang's expression lit with interest. He knew the Demon Hall well. In the original story, they were Long Yu's enemy—eventually destroyed by him as a stepping stone to power. And now the two were cooperating?

Well, that was a significant plot deviation. Was Long Yu really going to turn to the dark side?

"Young Lord, should we wipe them out?" Black Dragon asked, a dangerous gleam in his eyes.

Qin Jiang shook his head. "Why would we destroy a perfectly good organization?"

The Demon Hall was powerful. Their only problem was being demonic cultivators, which made them social outcasts. But who defined what was righteous and what was demonic? In this empire, Qin Jiang was the one who set the rules. If he called them demons, demons they were. If he declared them saints, they could be nothing but virtuous.

"Go conscript them," Qin Jiang decided. "Give them a few airships and send them into the Chaos as marauders. They keep ten percent of everything they plunder; the rest goes to the Qin family."

The Qin family was expanding rapidly. The Heavenly Mystery Continent alone couldn't sustain everyone, and since the entire continent was now Qin territory, they needed to let other families scrape by too. Resources were tight.

Qin Jiang had been planning to cultivate a bandit force for Chaos raiding for a while. Many major clans did the same. The Demon Hall was a ready-made operation—it'd be wasteful not to use them.

Black Dragon acknowledged the order and set off immediately.

In a secluded corner of the city stood a dingy noodle shop that most people gave a wide berth. The place radiated an unsettling chill.

A hunchbacked old man covered in pockmarks stood at the entrance, wearing a grin that his unfortunate features rendered terrifying. Passersby averted their eyes in disgust.

Then a squad marched straight toward him. Before anyone could speak, the lead man—a hulking figure in black armor—backhanded the old man to the ground.

"Pin him down!"

The brute was Black Dragon.

Long Yu had visited this very man before departing. To take down the Demon Hall, this was the starting point.

One slap had left the old man dazed. By the time he realized he was being restrained, he thrashed and shouted: "Who are you people? Why are you hitting me? This is the Imperial City! Under the Emperor's own jurisdiction! You can't—release me!"

Black Dragon sneered. "Start the interrogation."

Hard bones or soft—everyone got the full treatment first.

"AAAGH!"

Under duress, the old man screamed himself hoarse. A crowd gathered, watching the succession of punishments with ashen faces and prickling scalps.

By the end, the old man was barely clinging to consciousness. Black Dragon said flatly, "Heal him."

No one dared interfere. Even the Imperial City guard took one look at Black Dragon and quietly walked away, refusing to touch this mess.

After being patched up, the old man was a broken wreck—spirit nearly shattered, eyes full of terror.

"You—"

"I ask. You answer."

He nodded frantically, not daring to hesitate for fear of another round.

Black Dragon was satisfied with the compliance. "You're Demon Hall?"

"Yes."

"Know where their headquarters is?"

"No. But I know over a dozen Demon Hall members hiding in the city. I can lead you to them."

The old man spilled everything without reservation.

Soon enough, following his leads, Black Dragon nabbed over a dozen more. Several killed themselves on the spot. The rest received the same treatment—simple, brutal, and effective.

Over the next three days, the dragnet widened. Inevitably, some innocents were caught in the sweep, but Black Dragon wasn't from the Divine Dragon Empire. He didn't care. His mission was to locate Demon Hall headquarters and conscript them. The Dragon Emperor could clean up the collateral.

Qin Jiang monitored Black Dragon's progress throughout. He knew exactly where the Demon Hall's base was—he'd seen it in the spoilers—but didn't tell Black Dragon. As one of his most trusted subordinates, Black Dragon needed the field experience. What was the point of maintaining such a large retinue if he had to do everything himself?

So far, Qin Jiang was satisfied. Black Dragon's methods were crude, but results were results.

Five days later, Black Dragon confirmed the location of Demon Hall headquarters. He reported to Qin Jiang immediately, who dispatched Fourth Ancestor and the other Great Emperors.

The Demon Hall was formidable. Without Great Emperor-level firepower, taking them would be difficult.

Deep in the mountains, perpetual fog blanketed everything, reducing visibility to less than 30 feet. Countless people over the centuries had wandered in and vanished. Eventually, no one dared enter at all.

What no one knew was that the fog wasn't natural. And the people who'd gone missing hadn't simply gotten lost—they'd stumbled upon the Demon Hall.

The Demon Hall lurked within these mountains like a predator, consuming every cultivator who entered. The place had earned a fearful name: the Ghost Fog Forest.

Today, Black Dragon and his team arrived at its edge. The squad was small but elite, with four Great Emperors in tow.

Fourth Ancestor stood in the void, peering into the forest's depths, eyes narrowing. "Quite a few of them in there."

He glanced at Black Dragon with a grin. "Little Black, I'll suppress them. You handle the negotiations."

"Yes, sir."

Fourth Ancestor grabbed Black Dragon by the collar and leapt, plunging into the Ghost Fog Forest.
