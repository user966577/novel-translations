Qin Jiang helped Chen Baizhe sit on the edge of the bed. "I should go. Get some rest. I'll have someone bring you something restorative. After all... you were injured, in a manner of speaking."

He turned to leave, but she caught his arm. He looked back. Her voice came out soft, almost fragile. "Stay a little longer? Please?"

He studied her pale face, and a flicker of tenderness passed through his eyes—just enough for her to catch it. He nodded. "Alright. But if there's no love between us, I won't do... that again."

"I know. I understand your principle."

He seemed to relax slightly, sitting nearby—though at a careful distance. "Is there something else?"

"Can't I just want your company for a while?" A note of reproach crept into her voice. "It was my first time."

His expression softened further, the look he gave her warmer. She noticed, of course. Qin Jiang's technique was honed through hundreds of performances—art elevated to its highest form. The trick was showing just enough emotion to be noticed while hiding the fact that every bit of it was calculated.

He moved closer and took her hand. "I'm sorry. I was being selfish just now."

The apology cracked something inside her. All the vulnerability she'd been holding back came flooding out, and her eyes reddened with unshed tears.

Qin Jiang scrambled to wipe them away, clumsy in a way that seemed entirely genuine. Watching him fumble, Chen Baizhe couldn't help but laugh through her tears. She sniffled and leaned her head against his shoulder. For the first time in longer than she could remember, she felt... safe.

She tilted her head, studying his profile. When she'd been crying, his panic had seemed real. He truly cared.

"Do you like me?" she asked.

Qin Jiang hesitated, then nodded. Every beauty, he liked. Without exception.

"I said so two days ago."

"Two days ago..." She frowned, then shook her head. "My impression of you two days ago was terrible."

"That's because I liked you."

"But just now, you—"

"I liked you, but you didn't like me. That's not love—that's one-sided. No love, no crossing the line. That's my principle."

She fell quiet, then asked, "Two days ago, you said if I had feelings for another man, you'd kill him?"

"Yes."

"You'd kill him, even knowing I might hate you forever? That we'd never be together?"

"I believe my love can make you love me back."

The certainty in his voice made her smile. "Right now, I have to admit—you're rather charming."

"So you've fallen for me?"

Qin Jiang's face showed the perfect amount of barely-restrained hope.

She thought about it, then shook her head. "Love might be too strong a word. But... you've moved me. I think we could try being together."

"Just try?"

In answer, she slid her arms around his neck and pressed her lips to his cheek. "Is that enough?"

He touched the spot, a blush coloring his face. She laughed. "You can blush too?"

"In front of someone I like, of course I blush."

He extended his arm tentatively, encircling her waist, drawing her onto his lap. She let him, settling her cheek against his chest. She could hear his heartbeat—strong and steady.

They held each other for a long while. Then Qin Jiang spoke. "If your brother came back someday... would you leave me?"

Silence.

She looked up at him. "Are you worried?"

"Yes."

Seeing his sincerity, a smile bloomed across her face. She lifted a hand to his cheek. "Before you came along, I might have left—gone with him without a second thought. But what you said two days ago... I couldn't accept it at first, but it's the truth. If he's alive and hasn't come to see me in tens of thousands of years, then clearly I'm not that important to him. I won't give up someone who loves me for someone who doesn't."

She paused. "And if he's already gone... then he's never coming back. He was my brother. You're my husband. So either way—I won't leave you. Feel better?"

Qin Jiang nodded and pulled her closer, settling her more comfortably in his arms. "So what you're saying is... you do love me now?"

"What do you think?"

She knew only that she didn't resist him. After what had happened between them, combined with how thoroughly his words had dismantled her old beliefs, she was willing to give this a chance. Whether it was love... she wasn't sure. She'd always imagined love as something grand and dramatic. This felt quieter. More ordinary. If anything, she suspected she was drawn most of all to his face. Looks really did matter. His appearance alone generated goodwill. If he'd been ugly, they never would have shared a drink, let alone anything else.

"Your body will teach you what love feels like," he said.

He leaned down and kissed her, soft at first. She responded clumsily, instinctively.

As the kiss deepened, her breathing quickened. He pulled back. "How does it feel?"

"It feels like..." Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes half-lidded. Was this love? During that kiss, she'd wanted nothing more than to dissolve into him entirely—a feeling she'd never experienced before. Was her body telling her what her mind hadn't yet accepted?

Did she truly love him? After only three days?

She looked at Qin Jiang, still disbelieving. How could she have fallen so quickly? Something felt off. But her body told her, unmistakably, that she wanted to be with him.

"I can tell," he murmured, lips curving into a smile. "You've fallen for me."

He gathered her close, his mouth at her ear. "Feel it."
