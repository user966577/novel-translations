On the arena, Qin Jiang swept his arm. Every strand of Sword Force in the air bent to his will, their razor edges turning as one to point at Lin Chen. The biting cold locked Lin Chen's body rigid.

Qin Jiang's lips curved. Without a shred of hesitation, he drove the full weight of that redirected Sword Force straight at Lin Chen—Lin Chen's own power, turned against him.

Lin Chen's face contorted. He knew exactly how devastating his own attacks were. Gritting his teeth, he slammed a palm into his own chest and spat out a mist of blood that stained the sword energy crimson. "Stop!" he growled, seizing control of the rogue energy through sheer force—then immediately clenched his fist, detonating it all.

Lin Chen grunted as the backlash hit. His complexion went ashen. Forcibly destroying his own attack had cost him dearly, weakening his aura noticeably.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, mildly impressed. This guy really had been a Great Emperor in his past life—his bag of tricks ran deep.

Panting heavily, Lin Chen eyed Qin Jiang with growing dread. He had no doubt that if he'd failed to neutralize that attack, Qin Jiang wouldn't have held back. That single strike would have obliterated his body.

"Not bad—some real skill there. Come on, keep going." Qin Jiang clearly had no intention of letting Lin Chen off easy. He beckoned with a crooked finger, the provocation unmistakable.

Lin Chen seethed, but he knew he was outmatched. Swallowing his fury, he forced out the words: "I concede. You win."

"Concede?" Qin Jiang's brow arched. Then he shook his head. "No. You need my permission to surrender."

Lin Chen: "..."

For a moment, his mind went blank. This was supposed to be a friendly spar. Once he conceded, the match should be over. But Qin Jiang, evidently, was not a man who played by conventional rules. His rules were the only rules that mattered—especially on Qin family territory.

"Once you've entertained me enough, then you can concede," Qin Jiang said with a grin.

No one in the Qin family was about to object. As for Bai Jingyun, he wanted to speak up for Lin Chen, but the thought of Qin Jiang's Sword Heart gave him pause. He opened his mouth, then closed it again. If he annoyed his son-in-law, the loss would outweigh the gain. Besides, Qin Jiang wouldn't actually kill Lin Chen. A little roughhousing never hurt anyone.

Lin Chen scanned the crowd. Not a single person was willing to advocate for him. He drew a deep breath and fixed Qin Jiang with a stare. "Fine. If you want to play, let's play!"

Across two lifetimes, he'd never been humiliated this badly. Perhaps Qin Jiang was also a reincarnated powerhouse—possibly even stronger than he'd been. But in an all-out fight, Lin Chen was confident Qin Jiang wouldn't walk away unscathed either.

He adjusted his condition. With cold, vicious eyes locked on Qin Jiang, he activated some hidden technique. In just a few breaths, not only had he recovered to his peak—his power was still climbing.

"Is that... Primordial Spirit Power?" Qin Jiang recognized the technique instantly. The system had already spoiled Lin Chen's full dossier for him, and this was supposed to be one of Lin Chen's life-saving trump cards. He hadn't expected it to be used against him. Judging by the power increase, Lin Chen was only tapping a small portion—but even that small portion carried the pressure of a Great Emperor, enough to suppress any cultivator below that level.

Not that it mattered. Against Qin Jiang's dual divine bodies, Emperor's pressure was about as threatening as a stiff breeze.

Qin Jiang didn't immediately attack. He simply watched Lin Chen power up. Before long, Lin Chen's aura plateaued. A flash of reluctance crossed his eyes—the Primordial Spirit Power he'd stored before ascending to Emperor in his past life was irreplaceable. Every drop spent was a drop gone forever.

"Keep going. That little boost isn't enough to give anyone a good time," Qin Jiang called out.

Lin Chen's cheek twitched. Then he sneered: "This is plenty!"

But before the words had fully left his mouth, Qin Jiang was already in front of him. A vicious backhand swung toward his face. Lin Chen's eyes widened. He raised his hands to counter, simultaneously launching a burst of energy at Qin Jiang's chest.

Every bit of power that touched Qin Jiang vanished on contact, as if devoured—and Qin Jiang's own strike seemed to grow stronger for it. A crisp smack echoed across the arena. A handprint bloomed on Lin Chen's cheek, and he stood frozen in place, ears ringing.

"Was that enough?" Qin Jiang curled his lip in disdain. "Keep powering up, or I'll beat you to death."

"You—" Lin Chen's face contorted with rage when his senses returned. You don't slap a man's face!

The humiliation was beyond words.

"'You' what? Want another slap?" Qin Jiang raised his hand, and Lin Chen instinctively scrambled backward.

He steeled himself. His power surged again. His hatred for Qin Jiang grew with every passing second—this encounter had cost him far too much of his precious reserves. And yet, on Qin family turf, he couldn't truly retaliate. Not that he was confident he could even if he tried.

The onlookers felt Lin Chen's aura climbing once more and murmured in surprise.

"This Lin Chen has quite a few hidden cards."

"Heh, it won't matter what cards he has. He's no match for Jiang'er."

"Lin Chen really is a prodigy. It's just his misfortune to have run into Jiang'er. Defeat was always inevitable."

As they commented, Lin Chen launched another offensive—only to realize he still fell short. So he burned more Primordial Spirit Power. And again. And again. Each time, his expression grew darker.

He was starting to regret this. Wasting so much irreplaceable power... he might as well have just let Qin Jiang hit him a few times. It wasn't like Qin Jiang would actually kill him. He was the Holy Sword Sect's Holy Son, for heaven's sake.

After yet another boost, he did the math on his losses and said through gritted teeth, "This is my limit. If I still can't beat you, I hope you'll allow me to... allow me to concede."

The words came out in halting chunks. The humiliation was suffocating—having to ask your opponent for permission to surrender. It was absurd.

Qin Jiang knew this wasn't actually Lin Chen's limit, but the man had clearly given up trying. With a magnanimous nod: "Fine. If you still can't beat me, I'll graciously allow you to concede."

Lin Chen's cheek twitched. Inside, he was screaming. This was the most disgraceful battle of his entire existence—both lives included.

Then Qin Jiang went on the offensive. Lin Chen's attacks barely registered. The entire fight looked less like a duel and more like Qin Jiang using a punching bag. Lin Chen was the punching bag—ragdolled across the arena without an ounce of resistance, until he finally blacked out.
