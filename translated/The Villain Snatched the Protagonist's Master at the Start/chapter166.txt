"The Myriad Pill Assembly? Heh—I suggest you cancel it."

The voice rolled like thunder. Heaven and earth trembled, and every person present felt their bodies shudder involuntarily.

Down in the Myriad Pill Plaza, all hundred alchemists—without exception—had their refinements disrupted. A wave of fury swept through the crowd.

Chen Changsheng was especially livid. This was his third failure. Three consecutive botched attempts—an unprecedented humiliation.

A hunched figure materialized in the sky, leaning on a gnarled cane. He looked unremarkable, but the suffocating pressure radiating from him weighed on every soul below.

The Pill Emperor shot to her feet, expression darkening.

Qin Jiang, meanwhile, remained perfectly calm. He'd already seen this coming from the spoiler. The old man was an immortal-path cultivator—not exactly a demonic cultivator, but not righteous either. More of a sinister, reclusive type.

No friends. Just one grandson.

Said grandson was a worthless degenerate who used his grandfather's fearsome reputation to bully and assault women. Recently, he'd caused trouble in Pill City, and the Heavenly Pill Palace's enforcers had beaten him half to death. He was now clinging to life by a thread.

The old man was here for revenge.

In the original storyline, Chen Changsheng had saved the grandson, then helped the useless boy reconstruct his foundation—turning trash into talent. The old man had been so grateful that they'd become lifelong allies.

But now—

"The Heavenly Pill Palace injured my grandson! Don't you think you owe me an explanation?!"

The old man's voice was frigid, dripping with killing intent. A single sentence was enough to make several onlookers go pale, their chests tight.

Among the spectators, representatives from various major factions recognized him instantly.

"The Ghost Immortal!"

"The Heavenly Pill Palace managed to offend him? This is trouble."

"Heh, a fight would be entertaining. If they smash the Palace apart, that's fewer alchemists they can hoard."

"The Ghost Immortal dotes on that grandson of his. The Palace really stepped in it this time."

Whispers rippled through the crowd. Factions allied with the Palace frowned and began contacting their headquarters—but against an immortal-path cultivator, no one wanted to get involved.

The Pill Emperor's face was taut. She knew about the grandson incident—the man had been in the wrong. It had been self-defense.

She hadn't given it much thought at the time.

She was about to explain when Qin Jiang caught her hand, rose to his feet with casual ease, and looked up at the Ghost Immortal. He cracked his neck.

"Yao-yao, Mo-mo—knock this old fossil out of the sky for me, would you? I'm getting a crick in my neck looking up."

Two silhouettes appeared flanking the Ghost Immortal—Jian Yao and Mo Mo. One shouldered a greatsword; the other hefted a war hammer.

"Get down there!"

BOOM!

Both women struck simultaneously. The Ghost Immortal's face contorted in shock—he hadn't sensed two immortal-path cultivators hiding in the wings.

Caught completely off guard, he was blasted out of the sky.

The crowd gaped.

"Two immortals..."

"Wait—isn't that the same one who suppressed the Palace before the Assembly?"

"Two? I thought there was only one."

"One showed herself last time. The other stayed hidden."

"Two immortal-path bodyguards for that young man? Who the hell is he?"

"Doesn't matter. The Ghost Immortal just kicked a steel wall."

Smashed to the ground by a single combined strike, the Ghost Immortal's face twisted with rage. He was about to take flight again when Jian Yao's cold voice cut through: "Stay on the ground. Try that again and you'll get a sword through the chest."

The Ghost Immortal froze.

Both women flickered and appeared at Qin Jiang's side, nodding to the Pill Emperor. She exhaled in relief, smiling gratefully. Without Qin Jiang, dealing with an immortal would have been a nightmare.

The Ghost Immortal stood in the plaza, glaring up at the platform. Against either immortal alone, he could hold his own. Against both? No chance.

What puzzled him was the power dynamic—both immortals appeared to defer to the young man. A mere Saint Realm cultivator?

Some reclusive family's young lord, most likely. If so, this was someone he truly couldn't afford to provoke.

Qin Jiang looked down at him. "The Heavenly Pill Palace is under my protection. What kind of 'explanation' are you after?"

The Pill Emperor side-eyed Qin Jiang. 'Under his protection? He makes it sound like a gang turf war.'

The Ghost Immortal's gaze darkened. "Your people nearly killed my grandson. Am I not owed an answer?"

"Fair enough." Qin Jiang nodded. "Where's your grandson? Let me see how bad it is."

The Ghost Immortal relaxed slightly. At least this young lord seemed reasonable. He clapped his hands, and attendants rushed forward carrying an unconscious young man into the plaza.

The Ghost Immortal's expression softened with heartache. "This is my grandson. Beaten within an inch of his life. If I hadn't been sustaining him with my own energy, he'd already be gone. At minimum, the Heavenly Pill Palace must save him!"

His martial prowess was formidable, but when it came to healing, the Palace was far more qualified.

"Still breathing, huh." Qin Jiang frowned.

He turned to the Pill Emperor. "Linglong, what exactly did this grandson of his do?"

"He tried to abduct women from the Heavenly Pill Palace. When the enforcers intervened, he attacked them. The Palace acted in self-defense."

The Pill Emperor's voice was flat.

Qin Jiang scratched his head. That behavior sounded... uncomfortably familiar. Almost like a discount version of himself.

Still, it was hardly a capital offense.

But then again, this guy had the audacity to copy his style and do it badly? That was an insult to Qin Jiang's personal brand.

Unforgivable.

He flicked a dark pill downward. "Feed him this."

The Ghost Immortal caught it and studied the pitch-black pellet with suspicion. "This will save my grandson?"

"It'll end his suffering. Look at him—isn't watching him suffer painful for you?"

That struck a chord. The Ghost Immortal knelt beside his grandson and gently placed the pill in his mouth. "Eat this, my boy. The pain will stop."

The pill dissolved instantly, its energy flooding the young man's body.

Qin Jiang's lips curved upward.

The suffering was about to end. Permanently.

The Ghost Immortal watched his grandson—then the young man's eyes flew open.

"AAAAAGHH!"

The agonized scream made the Ghost Immortal jolt. He was about to round on Qin Jiang when he saw, to his absolute horror, that his grandson's body was dissolving. In seconds, more than half of him had melted away.

He slammed his palm onto the boy's torso, pouring his immortal energy in. Immediately, he detected a destructive force rampaging through his grandson's system—annihilating everything it touched.

The Ghost Immortal's face went white. He whipped his head up, eyes bloodshot and bulging.

"YOU MURDERED MY GRANDSON!"
