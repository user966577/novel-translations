"Are you... are you telling the truth?" Xue Yue's voice trembled.

Qin Jiang smiled. "What do you think? In Azure Cloud Heaven, several True Immortal-level powers were uprooted. In Grey Cloud Heaven, the Zhao family was slaughtered until their bloodline was severed. Do you think every single person in those destroyed factions had personally offended Huaxia? No — in some cases, only a few people, or even just one, crossed Huaxia. But because of those few, everyone connected to them had to die. That's Huaxia. Cut the weeds and pull the roots, or they'll grow back in spring."

Those few examples made Xue Yue sway on her feet, panic spreading across her face.

"What I really don't understand," Qin Jiang continued, studying her with apparent confusion, "is where you found the courage to follow Nangong Yun and create the Anti-Huaxia Alliance. His family was destroyed — he has nothing left to lose. Most people in this alliance are the same: desperate souls with nowhere to turn. But you have the Blood Tribe behind you. A million clansmen. Did it never once occur to you to think about them? Or did you honestly believe this ragtag alliance could topple Huaxia?"

His words struck home. She stared blankly as the horror dawned. He was right. Everyone else here had lost everything — destroyed families, nowhere to go, nothing to live for except revenge. But she had a million clansmen depending on her, and when she'd helped create the alliance, she hadn't considered for a single moment that she might be dragging them all down with her.

As for toppling Huaxia? Pure delusion. As Blood Tribe royalty, she knew their strength intimately: one Immortal King alone could suppress the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, to say nothing of Huaxia's two Heavens' worth of territory, dozens of True Immortals, over a hundred Human Immortals, and countless other powerhouses. Huaxia was the true sovereign of all.

Pain twisted her features. 'How did I dare? What possessed me to follow Nangong Yun into this madness? I knew how powerful Huaxia was. I knew how ruthless they were. And yet I chose him anyway — and threw a million lives behind me like they didn't matter.'

She clutched her head, anguished. A million clansmen, and she'd personally marched them into the fire. She could already picture the Blood Tribe's annihilation.

At that moment, Yue Weiwei stepped forward and gently embraced her, patting her back. She exchanged a glance with Qin Jiang — a quick blink of her beautiful eyes — before saying, "Husband, isn't there truly no way to save the Blood Tribe?"

Xue Yue looked up immediately, hope flickering in her eyes. This man's family had connections to Huaxia — perhaps he really could help.

Conflict crossed Qin Jiang's face. He gave a bitter smile. "Weiwei, you know how much it's already going to cost my family just to protect you. Saving an entire tribe..."

He shook his head with a helpless look and trailed off.

Xue Yue understood, but she still clung to hope. "There's truly nothing?"

"Well..." He considered for a moment, then looked at her with careful hesitation. "There might be one way."

"What way?" she asked urgently, eyes shining.

"Every time Huaxia acts, they work from a kill list, eliminating targets one by one. Your name is almost certainly on it. If we can get it removed, you can avoid the purge."

Her eyes lit up. The crisis stemmed from her — if she was safe, so was the tribe. "But the kill list must be extremely important. Can it really be done?"

"The list is important, yes. But the one deployed this time is in the hands of a particular True Immortal, and one of my family's elders happens to have some history with him."

"Really?" Excitement flooded her face. "Whatever it costs to erase my name, the Blood Tribe will bear it!"

But Qin Jiang shook his head. "It's not as simple as paying a price."

His constant push and pull had sent her emotions on a roller coaster. She'd nearly lost the ability to distinguish truth from manipulation, instinctively following his lead, treating his every word as her lifeline.

"What else?" she asked.

"Because of your status, the fact that you could implicate the Blood Tribe is probably already known to Huaxia's upper leadership. Simply erasing your name from the kill list won't be enough. We'd need to put your name on a different list at the same time."

"What list?"

"The undercover agent registry."

"Huh?"

Qin Jiang explained patiently. "What I mean is, we change your identity. Right now, you're a member of the Anti-Huaxia Alliance. But with some maneuvering, we can make it look like you've been a Huaxia plant all along — an undercover agent embedded within the alliance."

Xue Yue's eyes widened. With her identity flipped like that, she'd become a Huaxia operative. They'd have no reason to move against her, and the Blood Tribe would be safe.

But what about Nangong Yun? She bit her lip. She couldn't sacrifice the entire tribe for one person. As for Nangong Yun... she could only apologize.

She looked at Qin Jiang, hoping he might also have a way to save Nangong Yun. Then she realized that her original goal had somehow shifted from protecting Nangong Yun to protecting the Blood Tribe. She shook her head, feeling muddled. Regardless, the tribe came first.

She took a steadying breath and met his eyes. "What do I need to do?"

"Simple." He stepped forward, closing the distance, and tilted her chin up with one finger. "From this moment on — you're my woman."

"???"
