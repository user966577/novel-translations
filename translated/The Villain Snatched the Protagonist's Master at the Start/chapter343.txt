Qin Jiang's face was so close to hers that his breath ghosted across her skin. Little Red's cheeks flushed instantly, her body tensing.

Since taking human form, this was the first time she'd been this intimate with him. It felt strange — unfamiliar — her body reacting in ways she didn't fully understand. She shifted slightly, and with his face filling her entire field of vision, she whispered:

"Don't get so close—"

His lips swallowed the rest of the sentence. Little Red's eyes went wide, her entire body going rigid.

Off to the side, Lian'er pursed her lips and turned away, a flicker of envy in her eyes. She wanted kisses too.

It was a long moment before Qin Jiang pulled back. Little Red's gaze had gone hazy, her body melting against him. When awareness returned, her face burned with shyness — though part of her lingered on the sensation.

No wonder Lian'er was so desperate to get her hands on Qin Jiang. So that's what it felt like. One kiss and she was already on the verge of falling completely.

"Kissing you in human form is definitely different," Qin Jiang murmured.

Little Red shot him a look. Before she'd transformed, he'd had a habit of pecking her whenever her plumage was looking particularly glossy. The difference was real — feathers versus skin was an entirely different experience.

He was eyeing her lips again with obvious intent. Her heart fluttered, and beneath the shyness, a trace of anticipation surfaced. She wouldn't mind trying that again.

But she caught Lian'er sulking in her periphery and flushed deeper. "Lian'er's still here."

She felt a pang of sympathy for her friend. They were besties — eating meat in front of a starving friend didn't sit right.

Qin Jiang didn't particularly care. Lian'er had witnessed him being affectionate with his women more times than he could count. She was used to it. And in his heart, he didn't guard himself much around Lian'er. There were just... lingering reservations.

"Hmph, I'm going to find the sisters-in-law!" Lian'er announced with a huff and marched off.

Qin Jiang had planned to spend time with her, but she'd left of her own accord.

For the sake of the grand plan, Lian'er was exercising restraint. Phase one needed to happen as soon as possible. So she was giving Qin Jiang and Little Red space to bond.

Once phase one was solidified, phase two would begin.

Anticipation practically sparkled in her eyes.

With Lian'er gone, only Qin Jiang and Little Red remained. Their eyes met. Little Red felt a nervous flutter — was this it?

"Shall we go to the Space-Time Temple?"

"Mm." She nodded, cheeks pink.

Three days passed inside the temple. Little Red lay against his chest, shy as a new bride.

She was normally fierce-tempered and bold, but in matters like these, she'd turned unexpectedly bashful. Her delicate face wore a permanent blush, and even now she kept the blanket firmly pulled up, refusing to let him look — despite the fact that he'd already seen everything there was to see.

Sensing her shyness, Qin Jiang got a mischievous idea. Can't look? Fine. He could touch.

"Hey— don't— stop that!"

She yelped and grabbed his wandering hand, but the strength gap was laughable. She couldn't stop him. All she could do was plead with her eyes, looking pitifully up at him.

He chuckled. "I'll stop touching if you let me look properly."

"I... I'm too embarrassed."

Her face reddened further, eyes averted — but the hand clutching the blanket loosened, just slightly. An invitation she couldn't bring herself to voice.

Qin Jiang noticed but didn't take the bait. Instead, his hand resumed its expedition, drawing one startled squeak after another.

Finally, she couldn't take it anymore. She bit her lip and whispered, "Just one look, okay?"

"Deal."

She let go of the blanket. He dove under it.

Her hands clenched. After a while, she asked: "Done yet?"

"Let me look a bit longer."

"Fine..."

More time passed. "Finished?"

"Nope."

"You—" She puffed her cheeks. He'd said one look. It had been ages!

"Are you done?"

"No."

"You said just one look!"

"And I've been looking without blinking. That's still one look."

She felt heat everywhere — from his gaze, she was sure. Her whole body tingled.

"Stop being a cheater!" she protested.

But he didn't respond, and it was a good while longer before he reluctantly resurfaced. Seeing her pouting, he grinned and kissed her.

The simplest, most effective way to soothe a girl.

When they finally pulled apart, Little Red nestled against him. Her thoughts drifted to Lian'er's plan.

Should she go through with it? The plan was awfully embarrassing.

She stole a glance at him, bit her lip, and steeled herself. For her bestie — she'd try it once. And honestly... she was a little curious. It sounded exciting.

"Qin Jiang, could we maybe... play a game? Something fun?"

His eyebrow rose. This shy little phoenix was suggesting something adventurous? He was intrigued. "What kind of game?"

"Well..." She couldn't quite bring herself to say it. Instead, she produced a length of rope. "Can I... tie you up?"

Qin Jiang stared. Then his eyes went wide.

She was into that?

Under his gaze, Little Red squirmed with embarrassment. "I just thought—"

"Absolutely."

Before she could explain, he'd already agreed, snatching the rope with a wicked grin. Bondage? Qin Jiang was a fan.

He tested the rope. Not very strong — easily breakable — but perfect for games.

Then he tied up Little Red.

"Wait — it's supposed to be me tying you!"

She wriggled, though not very hard. From the look in her eyes, she was enjoying this development rather more than she'd expected. If she'd truly objected, she could have snapped the rope herself.

Qin Jiang smirked. "Same difference."

"It's not the same at all," she muttered.

According to the plan, she was supposed to tie him up, and then Lian'er would swoop in for the kill. This was supposed to be a rehearsal.

But the rehearsal had gone sideways. The person tied up was Little Red, not Qin Jiang. If they ran the real plan like this, Lian'er would burst in and find her bound instead.

Then what? Tie herself up too?

Actually... that idea wasn't terrible.

Little Red's mind wandered. Meanwhile, Lian'er's plan had suffered a critical setback — but that was a problem for later.
