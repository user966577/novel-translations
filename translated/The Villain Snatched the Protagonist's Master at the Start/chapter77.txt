Several days later, Qin Jiang finally stopped clinging to Liu Shuwan. They'd been in Sword Valley for far too long—it was time to leave.

Liu Shuwan looked faintly melancholy. "Then I'll start refining the Sword Heart."

Qin Jiang held her gently. "Out there, you'll still be my little Wan'er."

"Mm~"

With that soft acknowledgment, she settled cross-legged on the stone bed. The Sword Heart hovered before her. Qin Jiang stepped outside to stand guard.

He could feel Sword Valley's power already fading—without the Sword Heart anchoring it, the valley would eventually become an ordinary gorge.

"I've been down here too long," he murmured. The plan had been two weeks. It had been a month.

He glanced back at the dwelling and sighed. Not entirely his fault—Liu Shuwan was irresistible. And the lifestyle had been ideal. In his previous life, this would have been his dream. But in this world, such leisure could only be enjoyed in brief doses. Other women were waiting.

Refining the Sword Heart took time. Three days later, Qin Jiang sensed Sword Heart pressure enveloping the dwelling—unstable at first, then gradually steadying, spreading outward. His eyebrow twitched when the pressure reached him.

"Qin Jiang, payback time!"

Liu Shuwan burst out of the dwelling, triumph written all over her face. "I've achieved Sword Heart too! Now—surrender quietly and let me have my turn, or else..." Her sword pressure bore down on him, though it was carefully restrained—she clearly didn't want to actually hurt him.

Qin Jiang smiled and raised his hand. The pressure froze instantly. In a flash, he appeared before her and swept her up by the waist. "Little Wan'er, you're really going through with this mutiny?"

She stared at him, stunned. She was Sword Heart now—so why was she still no match for him? Had she broken through to a fake Sword Heart?

Seeing his smug expression, her face fell. "You're bullying me again."

"Excuse me?" He gave her backside a swat, drawing a yelp. "Where are you hitting?!"

"Little Wan'er, wasn't it you who wanted to bully me?"

"I... that's because I didn't succeed!" she said, dropping her gaze with visible frustration.

Qin Jiang found this adorable. "How about I let you try?"

"Really?" Her eyes lit up, and she nodded eagerly.

He was amused—she really was dead set on getting one over on him. He released her. Liu Shuwan blinked, poked him experimentally a few times, and when he didn't react, her expression brightened.

"Qin Jiang, I want you to..."

She trailed off, brows knitting. She didn't actually know how to bully someone.

"What do you want me to do?"

She thought hard. "Give me a minute."

"Want a suggestion?"

"What?"

He leaned close and whispered something in her ear. Liu Shuwan glanced downward, and her face erupted in flame. "Absolutely not!"

This rogue's mind was a sewer! She backed away and eyed him warily.

"Then how about—"

"No." She shook her head firmly. "Forget it. I'm not bullying you."

She'd realized the fundamental problem: nothing she did actually bothered Qin Jiang. Light teasing he treated as a treat. Anything more serious... she couldn't bring herself to do.

"Hehe, then it's my turn." He grinned.

Liu Shuwan's eyes widened as he lunged. She tried to run but he caught her easily. "Little Wan'er, you're in for it now."

"You—!" She glared. "Wait—let me try again."

"I thought you gave up?"

"I changed my mind. My turn."

She was determined. Even if he enjoyed it, she'd have her moment of being in charge.

Qin Jiang hesitated, then agreed. A decision he wouldn't regret—Liu Shuwan's version of "bullying" turned out to be the best kind of punishment. Three days later, Qin Jiang was practically addicted.

"Little Wan'er, want to keep going?" he asked.

She shook her head and put distance between them. The more she "bullied" him, the more excited he got. Her attempts at dominance somehow left her feeling like the one who'd been manhandled. Zero sense of control.

"Let's leave," she said.

Qin Jiang blinked—he hadn't expected her to suggest it.

"Leave Sword Valley?"

"Yes."

"Your Sword Heart—is it fully integrated?"

She shook her head. "Not completely. But it's mostly done—the rest will merge naturally without active effort. And I have a feeling that once it's fully integrated... I might break through to Great Emperor."

"You definitely will." Qin Jiang had no doubts. "That Sword Heart contains the founder's entire power and comprehension. Full integration should make Great Emperor very achievable. But are you sure about leaving now?"

He knew she'd been reluctant. He'd stayed this long precisely because he understood her desire to remain—and he'd wanted to keep her company.

Liu Shuwan nodded firmly. "Yes—we're leaving. Absolutely leaving!"
