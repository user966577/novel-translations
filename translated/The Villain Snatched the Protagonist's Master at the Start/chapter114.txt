A torrent of power swept toward the airship like a hurricane.

A Supreme-level cultivator could move mountains and overturn seas, but the Emperor-grade airship wasn't just large—its defenses and offensive capabilities were equally terrifying.

The instant his attack struck the hull, a barrier materialized. The raging energy halted dead, then ricocheted back at its caster.

The commander's face changed. He tried to retreat but couldn't outrun his own reflected attack. Arms raised in a desperate guard, the force punched straight through, slamming into his chest. A Supreme-level powerhouse, beaten bloody by his own technique.

He tumbled back nearly two miles before steadying himself, his expression black as thunder. To be humiliated like this in front of his own troops—a disgrace.

On deck, Qin Jiang nodded approvingly. That had been nothing but the ship's automated defense. A Supreme's full-power strike hadn't even ruffled the paint. He doubted even a Great Emperor could break through.

As for the ship's offensive systems, he hadn't tested those yet—the energy cost was steep. Easier to just let Fourth Ancestor handle things.

The commander, buzzing with fury, charged again.

Qin Jiang called out the magic words: "Fourth Ancestor!"

Fourth Ancestor's response was already muscle memory. His palm shot out before he'd even processed the command. A mere Supreme was nothing.

Under the watch of countless eyes, a massive hand materialized and swatted the garrison commander like a fly, reducing him to a burst of crimson mist.

A Supreme-level powerhouse—gone, just like that.

Fourth Ancestor retracted his hand and muttered, "The kid's conditioned me into a reflex."

He was turning into Qin Jiang's personal attack dog. One shout of "Fourth Ancestor!" and his hand moved on its own, like an involuntary martial technique.

The Fourth Ancestor Summoning Technique.

As long as Fourth Ancestor was nearby, Qin Jiang effectively wielded an additional Emperor Technique—at zero cost.

The commander's death threw the soldiers into a panic. The surviving generals didn't dare intercept.

The airship entered the Divine Dragon Continent unopposed and, under Long Xin'er's guidance, headed for the imperial palace.

They didn't make it that far. A Great Emperor appeared, blocking their path. He glanced at Long Xin'er's trailing vessel with a slight frown, then studied the Emperor-grade airship.

"Might I ask which fellow Daoist is aboard? Would you be willing to come out for a word?"

His use of "fellow Daoist" made it clear—he'd deduced that the ship carried Emperor-level cultivators.

Long Xin'er quietly identified him: "That's the Fourth Imperial Patron—a Great Emperor."

"Fourth Patron..."

Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed. The entire Divine Dragon Continent had only nine Great Emperors, and he had seven on his side. If the other party turned hostile, the numbers weren't quite comfortable enough.

He licked his lips and bellowed: "Fourth Ancestor—grab him!"

A lone Emperor daring to approach? Gift-wrapped.

Fourth Ancestor's hand was already swinging when he caught himself, exchanged looks with the other five ancestors, and nodded in unison.

In a flash, six Great Emperors burst from the ship and encircled the Fourth Patron.

The man's guard went up instantly. Then he felt their cultivation levels, and his face froze.

"Great Emperors? Six of them?"

Fourth Ancestor eyed the man, excitement flickering in his gaze. He'd spent his entire Emperor career beating up weaklings. He'd never actually fought another Emperor.

"You lot back me up. Let me test him."

The other ancestors nodded and widened the circle slightly.

Fourth Ancestor cracked a grin. No windup, no warning—he charged. The Fourth Patron barely got a word out before he was forced to defend.

They traded a blow and both retreated. Fourth Ancestor dusted his robes. This one was about his equal.

Then he waved an arm. "All together—get him!"

The Fourth Patron stared in disbelief.

Six Great Emperors closed in, and the Fourth Patron shrank, trembling, in the center.

"Wait—I am the Divine Dragon Empire's Fourth Patron—"

His words were drowned out as all six piled on. Emperors fighting like back-alley thugs.

Outnumbered and overwhelmed, the Fourth Patron was reduced to screaming.

"Stop! Stop hitting me! STOP!"

He curled into a ball, arms over his head. Not a single opening to counterattack.

Fourth Ancestor and company only stopped when they'd had their fill, then dragged the man back to the ship.

"Here you go, Xiao Jiang. Caught him for you."

The Fourth Patron winced with every breath. Being a Great Emperor hadn't spared him the pain—his assailants were also Great Emperors.

At least they hadn't tried to kill him.

He spotted Qin Jiang and blinked. These six Emperors followed this young man's orders? What kind of family produced children with six Emperor bodyguards?

Then his gaze shifted. A familiar face—

"Third Princess?"

The Fourth Patron gaped. Third Princess was here? So that imperial vessel belonged to her? His eyes ping-ponged between Qin Jiang and Long Xin'er. Their relationship was clearly... intimate.

Had the Third Princess found herself a husband?

If so, they were all family!

"Ahem—"

He was about to speak when Qin Jiang cut in: "The Divine Dragon Continent has more Emperors than we do. For safety, we should eliminate a few first."

The Fourth Patron's heart nearly stopped.

Eliminate me?

The smile he'd been forming froze on his face. Fourth Ancestor and the others turned predatory gazes his way. Their first priority was always Qin Jiang's safety.

The Fourth Patron's neck retracted like a turtle's. "Wait! We're family!"

"Who's family with you?" Fourth Ancestor scoffed.

The Fourth Patron jabbed a finger at Long Xin'er. "That's our Third Princess! This young man's relationship with her is obviously special! That makes us family!"

"Tch. I hear my granddaughter-in-law isn't exactly favored in your empire."

The Fourth Patron fell silent. Unfavored royals were a dime a dozen—the Emperor had so many consorts that he couldn't even name all his children. At least Third Princess had some standing.

Long Xin'er nodded. "It's true. I'm not favored."

The Fourth Patron's face crumpled. This directly concerned his survival. He turned to Long Xin'er with a desperate, mournful look.

"Third Princess—did you bring them back to take revenge on the Empire?"
