Days of teasing, watching but never tasting — Li Qingqiu was, in truth, a little hungry.

But asking for it outright was beyond her. She kept her head down, said nothing, though her hand remained in his, unresisting. The message was clear enough. If he wanted to, she wouldn't refuse. She might even put up a token struggle — just to keep things interesting.

Beside them, Qing Chan read the coy reluctance for what it was. She reached out and shoved Li Qingqiu straight into Qin Jiang's arms. "Mo Mo and I are still sorting through her revenge list. Qin Jiang, why don't you and Qingqiu go rest for a bit?"

The first time deserved some consideration, after all. And frankly, these past few days, Qin Jiang had worn them all ragged. Sending him off with Li Qingqiu wasn't charity — it was self-preservation.

Qin Jiang smiled, cradling Li Qingqiu in his arms. He glanced toward Mo Mo. "Mo Mo, once you've finished the list, wait for me. I'll go with you."

"Sure~" Mo Mo waved a small hand. "Go rest with Qingqiu first. I'll have it done soon."

These past few days hadn't been idle. Qin Jiang had ordered the Li Family Ancestor to compile a roster of every cultivator above Human Immortal in Grey Cloud Heaven, complete with their locations. Mo Mo was cross-referencing that roster against her memory — identifying every enemy who'd once hunted her.

A million years had thinned their ranks considerably. Many of those who'd participated in that ancient pursuit had long since perished, especially during the battle at the Sword Sect. Mo Mo was mildly annoyed that she couldn't kill them herself. But the dead had descendants, and ancestral debts had a way of rolling downhill. This time, she intended to kill until she was satisfied. She returned to the list.

Qin Jiang carried Li Qingqiu into the room. The door closed.

Li Qingqiu's heart clenched. Her fingers dug into his robes, face buried in his chest, too embarrassed to look up. He set her down, tilted her chin up with one finger, and brushed a light kiss across her lips.

"Qingqiu, you still haven't answered me. Are you hungry?"

"I... I'm not hungry!"

She glared at him, then turned away, muttering, "I reached Inedia ages ago."

"But your little mouth is telling me you're starving and need to eat."

He pressed close. His hands, operating with a will of their own, found their marks with devastating precision. Before long, he held his palm in front of her scarlet face.

"See, Qingqiu? You're drooling."

"You—!"

She snatched his hand and frantically wiped it clean. Destroying the evidence! But he raised his other hand, equally damning.

Evidence was not in short supply.

She smacked him in mortified fury, wiped that hand too, then retreated a step, on guard against further evidence-gathering. Qin Jiang shrugged, caught her hand again, and led her to the bed.

"Alright, alright. No more teasing."

"What... what are you doing?"

She was nervous, but compliant, sitting down beside him without resistance. He leaned in and kissed her earlobe.

"Feeding my Qingqiu, of course."

And being a man of action, he got straight to it.

As for Li Qingqiu — she'd never cooked a day in her life, so this first meal was entirely under Qin Jiang's direction. She merely assisted. But even assisting left her exhausted. Several times she tried to flee; each time he pulled her back.

"Mm, I'm not hungry, I don't want any more..."

She struggled. But Qin Jiang, supreme chef that he was, had absolute confidence in his craft. A feast this fine deserved to be savored.

He held her close, murmuring reassurances, dropping soft kisses. "Qingqiu, be good. It's delicious."

"I don't want to!"

"Just try a bite. Really — it's delicious."

Coaxed and soothed, she finally began to taste. Or perhaps, from the very beginning, her resistance had been nothing more than indulging his particular preferences. And sure enough, under these circumstances, his performance improved noticeably.

For a first time, one shouldn't overdo it. Qin Jiang knew when to stop.

Li Qingqiu was slightly dazed. His skill was genuinely staggering.

"Full?" he asked.

She blinked back to awareness, cheeks pink, and nodded shyly. She looked down at herself. She'd actually managed to take it all. She'd been worried she couldn't, but it seemed those fears were unfounded.

Though she had to admit — she'd eaten a bit too much. He'd been generous, and he didn't believe in waste. Every last bit had gone to her. She felt uncomfortably full.

Sensing her discomfort, Qin Jiang gently massaged her abdomen, helping her digest. The tenderness made her study his face, and she found herself nestled against his chest. This wasn't so bad, actually.

Except his hands inevitably began to wander.

She looked up at him. Her own hand caught his, though the strength gap was laughable — she couldn't stop him at all.

"Mm~" She frowned slightly, lips parting. "I'm full."

"I know."

"Then what are you doing?"

"Just a massage. You ate so much — must be sore, right?"

She felt helpless. Her hand retreated to his chest, clenching into a small fist, occasionally thumping him in protest. But the massage did make her feel better. Much better, in fact. So much better that the food seemed to digest suspiciously fast, and before she knew it...

She was hungry again.

The question was how to tell him. She stole a glance. He was still massaging with single-minded focus, eyes unblinking.

"Enjoying the view?" she asked.

"Very much."

He answered without thinking, then looked at her in surprise. Since when did this girl ask questions like that?
