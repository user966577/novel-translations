Another harvest in the bag. Only Wu Tian remained.

As a reincarnated Immortal Emperor, dealing with Wu Tian called for extra caution. And Wu Yingtao was to have her revenge personally.

Under Qin Jiang's generous cultivation, Wu Yingtao had reached True Immortal. Combined with her Ancient God bloodline, she was formidable—far beyond her nominal realm. Wu Tian, meanwhile, had only made it to Human Immortal.

Of course, Wu Tian's combat prowess far exceeded that level. Pushed to the brink, he might unleash a flicker of his former Immortal Emperor power—something even an Immortal King would need to respect.

So the full lineup was deployed against him: An Xihe personally, all seven Immortal Kings, plus Qin Jiang. One Immortal Emperor and eight Immortal Kings to deal with a reincarnated Immortal Emperor.

Overkill? Absolutely. But absolutely foolproof.

Meanwhile, in a dense forest, Wu Tian was digging holes, dirt-streaked and disheveled. Nearby, a middle-aged man lounged on a boulder, occasionally calling out directions.

The man was Yun Bao's father. Over the past two decades, he'd been at Wu Tian's side, constantly scheming and pilfering treasures. Without him, Wu Tian would have broken through to True Immortal long ago.

Yet Wu Tian bore no grudge. Quite the opposite—he'd been faithfully taking care of the man. In his view, despite the man's mischief, his luck had genuinely improved since the Pixiu showed up. Before that encounter, he'd hit the most miserable stretch of his entire existence. By comparison, everything after felt manageable.

"Old Yun, are you sure there's treasure here?" Wu Tian looked over at him. He'd already excavated everything within a hundred miles—three layers deep—and found nothing.

But the middle-aged man was insistent. He claimed a great treasure lay here, and any treasure a Pixiu was this certain about had to be extraordinary.

"Wu, treasures of this caliber have their own spiritual awareness. It's hiding from you," the man explained.

Wu Tian considered this, then nodded. That was plausible. He frowned. "Then how do we find it?"

"Heh, just because you can't find it doesn't mean I can't. Nothing escapes a Pixiu's senses." He hopped off the rock, dusted himself off, and beckoned. "Follow me."

He walked with an unhurried swagger, Wu Tian trailing behind. After a while, the man frowned. "It keeps running!"

"How do we catch it?"

The man mulled it over, then reluctantly produced a golden pearl. "This is our Pixiu race's greatest treasure—the Treasure-Seeking Pearl. Each Pixiu can only use it nine times in their entire life. This will be my eighth."

"Treasure-Seeking Pearl?" Wu Tian was surprised. He'd never heard of such a thing, though in his previous life he'd never encountered a Pixiu either.

"If I didn't think this treasure was extraordinary, I'd never waste a use," the man said solemnly. He held out the pearl. "You need to channel spiritual energy into it. Since this treasure is exceptional, it'll need a massive amount of power. You're stronger than me—you do it."

Wu Tian accepted the pearl and nodded gravely. After twenty-plus years together, they trusted each other implicitly. Being entrusted with such a precious artifact only proved the depth of that trust.

"Just channel energy directly?"

"Yes. The more energy you feed it, the longer it can lock onto the treasure, making it easier to capture."

Wu Tian poured spiritual energy in steadily. Golden light radiated from the pearl. The middle-aged man, without drawing attention, took two steps back.

Wu Tian, focused on the pearl, didn't notice. After a while, he asked, "Any luck? Has it locked on?"

"Not yet." The man shook his head. "But I'm getting a stronger read. Stay put and keep channeling—I'll look around."

"Alright."

"And whatever you do, don't stop the flow. If the energy cuts off, this use is wasted."

"Got it."

The man wandered off, making a show of searching, moving farther and farther from Wu Tian. Explosions and rumbling sounds ensued, as if something were being chased. Dust clouds billowed, and Wu Tian could only sense the man changing positions rapidly.

He kept channeling. His face was growing pale. The pearl's capacity was staggering—it had already consumed more than half his reserves.

He marveled at it while continuing to feed it energy. Gradually, patterns appeared on the pearl's surface. Wu Tian examined them closely. "These look like formation markings. Is that how it tracks treasures?"

He studied them, thinking he might learn enough to replicate the effect someday. As the patterns grew clearer, the pearl began to vibrate, energy pulses leaking from it.

Wu Tian frowned. "Is it reaching its limit?"

Given its small size, absorbing this much power was already astonishing. Reaching capacity was expected. Should he stop?

He looked ahead—the sounds were coming from far away now. Whatever was out there could really move.

After a brief hesitation, he decided to find the man. He slowed his energy input to avoid rupturing the pearl.

And then, without warning, the pearl swelled in his palm—rapidly, violently. In an instant, it shifted from radiant gold to a sinister, annihilating black. An explosion ripped through the air. Formation lines cascaded outward, trapping Wu Tian at the epicenter.
