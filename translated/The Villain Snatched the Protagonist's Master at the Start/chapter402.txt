As the students emerged from the illusion one by one, the mist began to thin. Huaxia Academy stood before them in full view.

The ice and the fire dragon were gone. In their place was a stone staircase — one final trial.

A powerfully built figure materialized at its summit. He swept his gaze across the crowd and spoke with authority.

"This is your final test. Climb this staircase — as high as you can. Based on your performance, the academy will award opening-day bonuses. Additionally, your standing will be determined here: elite students, regular students, and remedial students. The three tiers carry very different privileges. Begin."

He sat cross-legged at the top, several Human Immortals arrayed behind him. The staircase itself was ordinary stone — the resistance came entirely from the cultivators above, manually calibrated for each climber. Maximum control.

The students buzzed with competitive energy. Every one of them was a prodigy — proud, ambitious, unwilling to accept anything less than the top. The thought of being labeled "remedial" was unbearable.

Even Li Yang — twenty-odd years a reject — refused to carry that mark.

Some students were already climbing. It didn't look too hard at first. The rest followed suit.

Li Yang turned to Ye Xuan. "Shall we?"

"Sure."

They moved toward the staircase together. At that moment, the arrogant young man from the ice bridge appeared beside them, sneering at Li Yang. "Well, well — it's the human ice sculpture. You actually made it this far? Must've been hiding behind your girlfriend the whole time."

Li Yang's jaw tightened. This guy again.

The young man ignored him and turned his smile on Ye Xuan. "Miss, I'm Zhao Juncai of the Zhao family, Azure Cloud Heaven. And you are—?"

"Get lost."

Before he could finish, Ye Xuan cut him off with a sharp glare. Zhao Juncai's smile froze.

He saw her move to leave and stepped into her path, a thin smile plastered on. "How about a contest, miss?"

"Not interested."

Li Yang clenched his fists. His girl was being harassed, and he was useless as always. But when he heard the word "contest," something stirred.

"I'll take you on," he said, stepping forward. "What's the challenge?"

Zhao Juncai blinked. "You want to compete with me?"

Li Yang planted himself between Zhao Juncai and Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan's words echoed in his mind: even if he was weak, she wanted a man with the courage to stand up for her.

This was his chance.

"What's the matter — afraid?" Li Yang pressed.

Zhao Juncai's lip curled. "Afraid? Of a waste who got frozen into an ice cube? Fine. Let's see who climbs higher and faster. Deal?"

"Deal."

Li Yang agreed without hesitation. His cultivation might be low, but his talent was real. This staircase clearly wasn't a test of raw power.

Ye Xuan didn't bother watching their posturing. She walked past both of them and started climbing.

Li Yang and Zhao Juncai scrambled to follow, each positioning himself at her side.

Back at the top, Qin Jiang and his entourage observed the drama below.

"That's Ye Xuan?" An Xihe asked, curiosity piqued. They'd all heard the story — she was quite interested to see this "girl" in person.

Qin Jiang nodded ruefully. He hadn't expected that a single impulsive decision back then would produce... this. Awkward as it was, Ye Xuan was genuinely capable. Far more useful than the original Ye Xuan had ever been.

"She really does look like a girl. Pretty, too."

"And those two boys are both chasing her?"

Qing Chan and Mo Mo chimed in. Qin Jiang watched them closely. Ye Xuan's approach to Li Yang was his doing — a whispered instruction to get close, win his trust, and then systematically shatter him. And it was working beautifully. The ice, the fireballs, the nightmare illusion — all of it had been Qin Jiang's deliberate targeting, and each humiliation had generated a healthy stream of Villain Points.

The final test would be no different.

On the staircase, Li Yang kept pace at first. But as the pressure mounted, he began to slow. He glanced at Zhao Juncai — the other man was struggling too, but visibly less so.

"Damn. Am I going to lose?"

He gritted his teeth. He was supposed to be a genius. But from the ice bridge to the fireballs to the illusion, everything had gone wrong. Now he was falling behind again. Was he really that worthless?

"You okay?" Ye Xuan's voice cut through his spiral.

He forced a smile. "I'm fine."

"Really?"

"Yeah."

She hesitated, then slowed her pace to match his. Her hand found his and squeezed gently. "It's okay if you lose."

His legs locked. The softness of her palm, the warmth of her voice — his face burned.

"I won't lose!"

"Then—" She raised a tiny fist and pumped it. "Go get 'em!"

Then she leaned in close to his ear and whispered: "Even if you lose, I'll be on your side. We're friends..."

Her cheeks tinted pink. She pulled away quickly and didn't look back — seemingly embarrassed.

Li Yang stood dumbstruck, staring at her faintly blushing profile. 'Is she... hinting at something?'
