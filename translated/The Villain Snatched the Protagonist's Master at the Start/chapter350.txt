Betraying nothing, Li Xueyi smiled warmly and took both their hands, chatting with them like any mother catching up with her children.

Qin Jiang kept the account casual. Lian'er, however, couldn't resist interjecting at every opportunity — invariably to praise Qin Jiang. How amazing he was, how talented, how exceptional...

She gazed at him the whole time, her eyes practically sparkling with little stars.

"Right now, the most powerful faction in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands is the Huaxia Manor that Brother created," she said, her eyes curved into happy crescents. Her mood was evidently excellent.

Qin Hao and Li Xueyi were genuinely impressed. After leaving home, Qin Jiang would contact them occasionally, but he never shared details — mostly just to report he was safe, and oh, he had a few more wives. He'd never mentioned Huaxia Manor.

The most powerful faction in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands? They couldn't fathom the scale, having never set foot in the Nine Heavens themselves. But building an empire of that magnitude clearly required enormous effort.

Their son must have worked so hard.

They looked at him with pride and no small amount of heartache. And they weren't wrong — building Huaxia Manor had taken tremendous effort. From the very beginning, Qin Jiang had poured his energy into cultivating its foundation, starting with An Xihe, Qing Chan, and the other women. After its establishment, nearly every day demanded his attention, all to ensure his women stayed happy and in peak condition so they could manage affairs and keep the manor stable.

The manor's greatest unsung hero was Qin Jiang himself. He seemed to do little on the surface, but behind the scenes, his contributions were immense. His women understood this better than anyone.

Lian'er continued gushing, animatedly singing Qin Jiang's praises. The way she carried on, a stranger might have thought she was bragging about her husband rather than her brother.

Qin Hao and Li Xueyi exchanged a quiet glance. Their daughter was truly far gone. Her heart was entirely fixed on Qin Jiang — every other sentence circled back to him.

They talked late into the night before the account of Qin Jiang's years abroad was more or less complete. Most of the details had come from Lian'er's embellishments — and what a dramatization it was. In her telling, Qin Jiang was practically omnipotent.

"You've both grown up," Qin Hao and Li Xueyi said, gazing at their children with emotion.

It had only been a few years, but the change was staggering. A Human Immortal and an Ancient Emperor — their children were already as powerful as they were.

The son and daughter who'd once needed their protection had truly come into their own. It was gratifying.

And yet...

They looked at Lian'er. Her gaze was fixed on Qin Jiang's face. Throughout the entire conversation, her eyes had been on him more than half the time. Whenever he spoke, she watched him with an intensity that was almost tangible — as if invisible threads connected her gaze to his every word.

Her smile, when it appeared, was genuine and involuntary. Simply looking at him seemed to make her happy.

The verdict was clear. Lian'er was beyond saving.

They chatted a while longer before Qin Jiang and Lian'er prepared to leave. That was when Li Xueyi hesitated, then looked at Lian'er.

"Lian'er, there's something I want to ask you."

"Hm? What is it?"

Lian'er blinked. Her mother's expression looked... serious. She scooted closer to Qin Jiang, drawing comfort from his proximity.

Li Xueyi's gaze locked onto Lian'er. After a long silence, she spoke.

"Lian'er — do you... like your brother?"

Lian'er's body went rigid. Her face drained of color. Mom had found out.

She swayed, nearly losing her balance, and Qin Jiang caught her, pulling her into his arms. She ducked her head, biting her lip, tears pricking at her eyes.

She didn't know what her mother would do.

The room went heavy with silence. Lian'er said nothing. She didn't want to deny it, but she couldn't bring herself to admit it in front of her parents.

Her silence was its own answer.

In the thick quiet, Qin Jiang looked between his parents and then down at Lian'er. He sighed inwardly. He'd never expected his mother to bring it out into the open like this.

Now there was no more avoiding it. He had to make a choice: distance himself from Lian'er and find her a husband, or hold on to her and keep her by his side forever.

Was that even a question?

He looked down at her — panic in her expression, but also a stubborn resolve. Their eyes met.

"Brother..." Her voice trembled.

"It's okay. Don't be scared."

Qin Jiang smiled gently and lowered his head, pressing a soft kiss to her forehead.

Lian'er went still.

Then the tears came, streaming down her cheeks. In front of their parents — he'd chosen her?

"Be good. Don't cry."

His voice was tender. He wiped away her tears, and when he saw her trembling lips, he leaned down and brushed his own against them — just a touch.

Then he folded her tightly into his arms, nestling her head against his shoulder, and looked up at his parents.

"Dad. Mom. I liked Lian'er first."

Qin Hao and Li Xueyi stared. Then exchanged a look.

So it went both ways.

In Qin Jiang's arms, Lian'er heard those words and the tears she'd just stopped spilled over again. He liked her too.

She clung to him, her small fingers pinching his back — a wordless reproach. How dare he wait this long to tell her?

All this time, she'd been terrified. And now, being exposed by their parents had nearly given her a heart attack.

But one sentence from Qin Jiang, and her world steadied.

She could ignore everyone else's opinion. But she could never ignore his.

All this time, deep down, she'd been afraid. But now, with those words, the fear was gone.

Drying her tears against his shoulder, Lian'er raised her head. Together with Qin Jiang, she faced their parents.

She took a deep breath.

"I like my brother. I just do."
