If one jar wouldn't do the trick, then two. Three. Four.

The wine was Qing Chan's personal brew—potent enough to knock even herself senseless with her cultivation sealed. Chen Baizhe, who had never touched alcohol in her life, stood no chance.

Under Qin Jiang's encouragement, two jars in and she was already swaying. Her body wobbled, unable to keep itself upright. Qin Jiang slid closer and caught her. Her head lolled against his shoulder.

"You're drunk," he said.

She shook her head, pushing him away with a weak hand. "Nonsense! I'm not drunk at all!"

She grabbed another jar, thrust it toward him, and slurred, "Drink!"

Glug, glug, glug. She kept pouring it down, her eyes growing hazier by the second. Her head bobbed, her eyelids drooped. She was thoroughly, completely drunk—but to make absolutely sure, Qin Jiang produced yet another jar and placed it before her. Her eyes brightened, and she snatched it up immediately.

Meanwhile, he played the reluctant companion with practiced precision. "You should stop. You're really drunk."

Drunk people were contrary creatures. Nine times out of ten, the more you told them to stop, the more they'd drink.

"I'm not drunk!" she huffed.

Her face was flushed crimson, and she hugged the jar, guzzling defiantly. Her body had gone completely limp. Without Qin Jiang propping her up, she'd have collapsed long ago.

She set down the jar, looked up at him through bleary eyes, and murmured, "You know... looking at you like this, you really are quite handsome."

"Do you like what you see?"

She shook her head, resting a hand on his chest. Her words came out dreamy and disconnected. "If you'd shown up earlier, maybe I really would have fallen for you. But you came too late..."

"Too late?"

"Much later than my brother."

Qin Jiang smiled. The fact that she could say this meant he'd already edged his way into her thoughts. Progress.

"If only you were my brother..." she mumbled.

He drew her onto his lap, cradling her against him. "I can be your brother too."

"No. You're not like him."

"I understand you better."

She pouted, her foggy mind struggling to process. If Qin Jiang were her brother, his talent would have allowed them to stay together forever. And he truly did understand her. But he wasn't her brother.

She squirmed free of his embrace, stumbled to her feet, and grabbed another jar. "You... drink with me."

She lurched forward, tumbling right back into his arms—one hand clutching his shirt, the other gripping the jar. Her wine-flushed lips breathed warmth and alcohol.

Qin Jiang licked his own lips. She still hadn't fully lost consciousness. More was needed.

He produced jar after jar, feigning reluctance each time. "One more. Last one."

"Hehe..." She giggled, her usual reserve dissolved entirely. "Drink!"

Jar after jar. With each one, Qin Jiang tested her limits—a touch of the hand, a gentle brush, a soft kiss.

She went slack in his arms, eyes barely open, breathing shallow and slow. She was out.

"Better safe than sorry," he murmured.

He took a mouthful of wine, lowered his lips to hers, and let it flow through. Had to make absolutely sure.

After a while, he confirmed she wouldn't be waking up anytime soon. He lifted her and carried her inside.

Chen Qi'er was close to returning. Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary measures. Though, in fairness, Qin Jiang's measures had always been rather extraordinary.

While Chen Qi'er admired the stars, Qin Jiang was admiring something else entirely.

"Big Brother Chen, you like looking at stars too?" the young man asked.

Chen Qi'er nodded with a gentle smile, his eyes full of reminiscence. "My sister used to love the stars. So I love them too. We used to watch them together all the time."

"You have a sister?"

"Mm."

"Where is she now?"

The thought of her brought an even deeper warmth to his face. But the image in his mind was still her as a little girl—he'd barely seen her after she grew up.

"She's doing well now. She should be."

He'd followed her reputation over the years. Baizhe Immortal's name carried weight. As a senior figure of the Human Dao Sect, his sister's life would be comfortable. Maybe even wonderful.

He wondered if she still remembered him.

Tens of thousands of years of relentless cultivation, without a single visit home. Looking back, he felt a pang of regret. But he'd accomplished something. When they met, she'd be so proud.

He looked at the young man. A few more days of testing, and then he'd go find her.

'Sister, wait for me just a little longer.'

"You haven't seen her in a long time?" the young man asked.

"A very long time."

His tone softened, and he continued with a smile. "But it won't be much longer now."

"Is she coming here?"

"No. I'll go to her."

"You're leaving?" The young man looked disappointed. They hadn't known each other long, but this big brother was his only friend.

Chen Qi'er sighed. "My sister isn't good at making friends. If I don't go back, she'll be lonely."

Before, he'd stayed away out of necessity—he had to train. Now that he'd made something of himself, it was time to go home and keep her company.

He imagined their reunion. She'd be so surprised, so happy.

The young man's disappointment faded, replaced by a knowing grin. "Big Brother Chen... you like your sister, don't you?"

"Ahem..." Chen Qi'er coughed, his weathered face reddening.

The young man snickered. "I bet she's beautiful."

"She is." On this, Chen Qi'er spoke with certainty. "I know she's had plenty of suitors. She turned them all down."

"Oh? She's waiting for you?"

Chen Qi'er wasn't sure how to answer questions about romance—in that department, he was still an awkward teenager. "Maybe... she is waiting for me."

"Definitely waiting for you, Big Brother. But you should hurry back. If your sister's that beautiful, someone might steal her away while you're gone."
