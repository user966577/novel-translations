Xue Mei: "..."

Hearing Xiao Jiu's account, irritation flashed across her face. So all this trouble really had been brought on by that Tang Yin. And she couldn't even handle it herself—she'd had to sacrifice her own body, and now it looked like Xiao Jiu would be dragged into it too.

Qin Jiang walked over to Xiao Jiu and placed a hand on her shoulder. She stiffened. No man had ever touched her before. Qin Jiang's voice was gentle, reassuring.

"Relax. I just want to check your physique."

She nodded, his calm tone easing her tension.

A pulse of energy flowed into her body. After a moment, Qin Jiang's brows knit together. Seeing his expression, Xiao Jiu grew nervous.

"Is something wrong?"

He withdrew his hand and turned to Xue Mei. "You might want to examine her yourself."

"Hm?"

Xue Mei frowned. She usually spent her time in seclusion and had only intervened a few times to suppress Xiao Jiu's bloodline eruptions. She hadn't paid close attention lately.

She moved to Xiao Jiu's side and swept her Primordial Spirit Power through the girl's body. Her expression darkened immediately.

"Her bloodline has been degraded?"

She knew Xiao Jiu's bloodline intimately. It was noticeably weaker than before.

"Who tampered with your bloodline?" she demanded.

"Huh?" Xiao Jiu looked bewildered, then flustered under Xue Mei's intensity. "Nobody did. But... lately the pressure on my body has eased a bit. It seems like it started after... after Tang Yin treated me..."

"Tang Yin!"

Xue Mei's teeth clenched. Xiao Jiu's bloodline was still formidable, but before the damage, her path to the Immortal realm had been virtually guaranteed once her body caught up. Now? She might be stuck below Immortal forever.

"There's a significant amount of residual medicine in her system," Qin Jiang said. "That Tang Yin is a half-baked amateur—not even a real alchemist—and he had the nerve to concoct drugs on the fly. He didn't suppress her bloodline eruption. He dissolved the bloodline itself. Luckily his mixture was weak, or Xiao Jiu would have been reduced to an ordinary rabbit."

With every word, Xue Mei's expression grew darker. They'd nearly lost a future Immortal.

Xiao Jiu stood frozen, her face blank with shock. All this time, she'd felt grateful to Tang Yin for saving her life. To learn that he'd actually ruined her bloodline...

She'd always been proud of it. Even when the pressure was agonizing, even when every day brought pain, she'd persevered—because she believed that once her body grew strong enough, her bloodline would carry her to the Immortal path.

Now all that perseverance had been for nothing.

Her legs buckled. Qin Jiang caught her before she hit the ground.

Looking down, he saw the light drain from her eyes as tears spilled silently down her cheeks. For her, the sky had just caved in.

Xue Mei said nothing. Her mood was just as bleak.

After a moment's thought, Qin Jiang spoke softly. "Actually, there is a way to fix this."

Xiao Jiu's head snapped up. Hope kindled on her stricken face. "You... you can restore my bloodline?"

Xue Mei's gaze locked onto him, a flicker of expectation breaking through her cold exterior.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Restoration isn't difficult. But..."

His eyes moved between Xiao Jiu and Xue Mei.

"What do you want?" Xue Mei asked. She knew he wouldn't help for free.

He smiled. "The only two people in the Celestial Rabbit Tribe worth my attention... are the two of you."

Understanding dawned on Xue Mei's face immediately. She looked at Xiao Jiu.

She herself had already agreed to Qin Jiang's proposal. But Xiao Jiu...

The girl seemed confused at first, not grasping his meaning. Nearby, Hu Xian'er studied Xiao Jiu with a furrowed brow, then pouted and whispered to Jian Yao.

"So the immortal herb I gave up... Qin Jiang's going to use it on another woman."

"It's not yours anymore," Jian Yao said flatly.

That only made Hu Xian'er more aggrieved. She watched Qin Jiang with wounded eyes. He gave other girls gifts, but from her, he'd taken a gift—and was now re-gifting it to someone else.

'Not fair!'

She made a silent vow: Qin Jiang owed her compensation. That immortal herb had to be worth at least several hundred billion. He was paying up.

In Qin Jiang's arms, Xiao Jiu finally decoded his meaning. Her cheeks flushed. She stole a glance at Xue Mei. 'Does he mean that I and the Ancestor would both...'

'How embarrassing.'

"Do you want my help or not?" Qin Jiang asked.

Xiao Jiu hesitated. Agreeing meant... sharing a man with her Ancestor. She could accept that for herself, but what about...

She looked at Xue Mei, who met her gaze. "It's your decision."

"Huh?"

Xiao Jiu stared. Then she noticed the faint blush coloring the Ancestor's cheeks.

'She already agreed?'

Well, if the Ancestor had made her peace with it, what was Xiao Jiu waiting for?

She turned to Qin Jiang, eyes resolute. "I want my bloodline restored!"

"Good."

He smiled and produced the Three Dawn Miracle Bloom. "First, we strengthen your body. Once your physique can handle your bloodline's power, I'll work on restoring it."

"Is that..." Xiao Jiu's eyes widened at the shimmering three-colored flower. Her body seemed to resonate with it, yearning.

Xue Mei stared. "An immortal herb?"

Despite being an Immortal cultivator herself, she'd never laid eyes on one before. The fact that Qin Jiang not only possessed one but was willing to give it away...

'Generous' was an understatement.

A warmth she hadn't expected spread through her chest. Handsome, wealthy, and backed by tremendous power—what woman wouldn't be drawn to a man like that?

"The Three Dawn Miracle Bloom," Qin Jiang explained. "Specifically designed to enhance physique. And as a bonus, it grants eternal youth."

Xiao Jiu's face glowed. When he placed it in her palm, she couldn't contain herself. One hand clutching the Bloom, she threw her other arm around Qin Jiang's neck, rose on her toes, and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.
