In the restaurant.

Panic flashed across Ye Ling'er's pretty face.

"You... don't do anything rash~"

Qin Jiang's gaze drifted downward, and he chuckled.

"Rash?

"You're the one who did something rash."

Noticing where his eyes had gone, Ye Ling'er's face turned scarlet.

'Too embarrassing!'

Qin Jiang leaned close and whispered.

"I never imagined that in front of Xiao Fan, you would actually..."

"No—that's not who I am!"

Ye Ling'er shook her head frantically.

But deep down, she trembled. She was shocked by her own reaction...

Could it be that Qin Jiang was right? Was this her true nature?

By evening, Qin Jiang stepped out of the room. On the bed, Ye Ling'er finally opened her eyes.

She watched his retreating figure, emotions warring in her gaze. Then her eyes fell on the neatly tucked blanket, and an involuntary warmth rose in her chest.

But hadn't that scoundrel been the one who'd forced her...

She was left with only one choice now.

A soft sigh escaped her. Bone-deep exhaustion crashed over her, and Ye Ling'er closed her eyes, sinking into a deep sleep.

"Black Dragon, take me to Chen Ningbing."

Spotting Black Dragon, Qin Jiang gave the order.

Black Dragon acknowledged and led him to the Chen estate.

The Chen family was Azure City Town's preeminent clan, and its patriarch served as city lord. But now, the entire estate was surrounded.

Every member of the Chen family wore an expression of utter bewilderment.

They had no idea who they'd provoked.

Chen Lie, the family patriarch and Chen Ningbing's father, paced before the main gate. He kept glancing at the men surrounding his home, worry etched across his face.

Any one of these soldiers, pulled at random, could destroy the Chen family.

Yet here, they were mere guards.

He'd cautiously inquired about their origins, but no one had deigned to answer. All Chen Lie could do was speculate while quietly reaching out to friends and allies.

He hoped someone could help.

Just then, his eyes lit up. He spotted a young man approaching the estate, flanked by what appeared to be the leader of these soldiers.

It seemed...

They all answered to this young man.

Chen Lie swallowed hard. Seeing Qin Jiang reach the gate, he rushed forward.

"Young sir, I am the Chen family patriarch. May I ask—"

"Save it. I've taken a liking to your daughter. This doesn't concern you."

Qin Jiang waved him off.

As though he owned the place, he strolled right through the gate.

Chen Lie: ???

He stared blankly at Qin Jiang's retreating back, mumbling:

"Taken a liking to my daughter? Doesn't concern me?"

The corner of his mouth twitched. 'You fancy my daughter, and you have the nerve to treat your future father-in-law like this?'

His eyes widened in indignation—then he immediately deflated.

There was nothing he could do. Qin Jiang was overwhelmingly powerful.

Besides, Qin Jiang's identity was clearly extraordinary. Having someone like this take an interest in his daughter was a good thing.

After all, he'd been trying to marry her into a powerful family anyway.

Once he'd worked this out, Chen Lie eagerly trotted after him.

"Young sir, let me show you the way."

"Young sir, my daughter has a fiery temperament. Your approach might not—"

"Young sir, that... is there a bride price?"

Chen Lie chattered away like a mother hen, endlessly yapping at Qin Jiang's ear.

"Will you shut up!"

Qin Jiang glared at him.

Chen Lie pouted, wounded. Gazing skyward, he sighed. He was the father-in-law here!

What kind of son-in-law treated his father-in-law like this?

Wounded as he was, he still closed his mouth.

'Fine. A father-in-law should indulge his son-in-law. Especially one with this kind of background.'

Most importantly, he'd tested the waters. His prospective son-in-law, while forceful, was clearly no degenerate wastrel. Otherwise, his barrage of questions would've earned him a broken leg.

Now, he felt reassured.

His daughter could be entrusted to this man.

With a personality like this son-in-law's, as long as his daughter stayed in his good graces, she'd never be mistreated.

The three of them arrived at a quiet courtyard.

Black Dragon stopped at the entrance.

"Young Patriarch, Miss Chen is inside."

Qin Jiang nodded and walked in. Chen Lie tried to follow, but Black Dragon blocked his path.

He could only wait outside, fidgeting, muttering to himself:

'Daughter, you must seize this opportunity. This son-in-law may not treat me well, but if you can keep him wrapped around your finger, you'll soar to the heavens!'

Creak~

The courtyard gate swung open, and Qin Jiang stepped inside. He scanned the yard, spotting Chen Ningbing standing beneath a climbing vine.

She wore a white gown with a sword slung at her waist. Silky hair cascaded down her back. Her serene expression coolly appraised Qin Jiang.

His arrival seemed to come as no surprise.

"Well, well, Ningbing. We meet again."

Qin Jiang smiled.

Chen Ningbing's brow furrowed. 'Ningbing?' This was only their second meeting.

And quite possibly their first conversation.

The man had no shame.

Still, she wasn't repulsed. She'd witnessed Qin Jiang's power firsthand—Xiao Fan, who'd been overwhelming her, couldn't even withstand a single soundwave from this man.

With that kind of strength, he was more than qualified to be her husband. Moreover, she rather liked his domineering style.

Without a word, he'd torn down the stage, blockaded the Chen family, and publicly declared he was claiming her. Such audacity stirred something in her heart.

So all day, she'd been waiting for him.

Looking at Qin Jiang, Chen Ningbing parted her lips:

"You want to be my husband...

"Is it because you like me, or because you want to bed me?"
