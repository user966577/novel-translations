Time flew, and in the blink of an eye, several years had passed.

Huaxia's name had spread to every corner of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Even ordinary mortals knew that the future ruler of this world would be Huaxia. The Ten Lands had already been fully absorbed into Huaxia's territory. As for the Nine Heavens — aside from Azure Cloud Heaven and Mystic Cloud Heaven, the other seven had plunged into total chaos. Countless lives hung in the balance, and not a day passed without suffering.

The major factions in those seven Heavens made no attempt to restore order. Huaxia, however, periodically dispatched forces to "rescue" the afflicted masses, earning deep gratitude from the common people. Before long, Huaxia had cultivated loyal supporters across all seven Heavens.

Of course, the ruling powers weren't entirely passive. With their resources, they'd pieced together the truth that ordinary people couldn't see — the chaos originated from Huaxia itself. Some factions began quietly spreading this information. But within days, Huaxia's agents would descend under the banner of salvation, annihilate whoever was spreading the truth, and pin every atrocity on the destroyed faction. The accused, being dead, never disputed the charges.

After that, while rumors about Huaxia's role still circulated, they'd grown far quieter. What replaced them was the narrative of Huaxia the savior — one that nearly everyone believed. Huaxia's influence grew stronger by the day.

Meanwhile, the lord of Huaxia himself was troubled.

Over the past several years, Qin Jiang's cultivation had reached the peak of Human Immortal. One more step, and he'd break through to True Immortal. The women at his side had also made enormous strides — every one of them had reached Human Immortal at minimum. Several of the veterans had broken through to True Immortal entirely. Qing Chan's realm was infinitely close to Immortal King, and An Xihe had advanced significantly along the Immortal King path. Today's An Xihe could easily crush the version of herself from just a few years ago.

But these massive improvements had come at a staggering cost in Villain Points. In just a few years, Qin Jiang had burned through half his reserves. Worse, as the women grew stronger, the cost of each upgrade rose exponentially. He could barely keep up.

His sole Villain Point supplier — Li Yang — was being squeezed dry. To compensate for the deficit, Qin Jiang had ordered Ye Xuan to torment Li Yang multiple times, nearly driving the poor bastard insane. But the income still couldn't match the expenditures.

The Chaos Plan had been running for years now. It had yielded substantial benefits for Huaxia's development, but not a single new Child of Destiny had surfaced. That was a mild disappointment.

Still, Huaxia's expansion did offset some costs. Any resource Huaxia already possessed meant one fewer thing to buy with Villain Points. And Qin Jiang himself, with his Taotie Divine Body, could devour virtually any form of energy to fuel his own advancement — he didn't need purchased treasures. He could even absorb the residual energy the women released, converting it directly into cultivation gains. So his personal Villain Point spending was modest.

His biggest personal expense was... custom orders. Stockings, garters, that sort of thing. The women burned through them at an alarming rate. They were, after all, essentially single-use items around Qin Jiang — torn to shreds before long.

He was just about to place another order when a petite figure came bounding toward him.

"Hehe, Brother Qin Jiang, I broke through to Unity Realm!" Chen Ningshuang landed in his arms like a little octopus, clinging tight, her small face beaming with pride.

"Unity Realm already? Shuang'er is so impressive!" Qin Jiang chuckled and ruffled her hair, his expression one of pure indulgence.

Chen Ningshuang was Chen Ningbing's little sister. Though only ten years old, under Qin Jiang's cultivation regimen, she was already a Unity Realm powerhouse. When Qin Jiang was ten, he'd only been at Meridian Condensation. Of course, the resources he'd given her were incomparably better — the finest the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands had to offer, including treasures that could directly elevate realms while stabilizing foundations and improving innate talent. She'd consumed more than a few of them. That was a level of investment young Qin Jiang could only have dreamed of.

Hearing his praise, Ningshuang's face lit up. Her features bore at least a seventy percent resemblance to her older sister, though her personality was far warmer and more outgoing. As she'd grown, she'd become increasingly attached to Qin Jiang — even sneaking into his room at night to crawl into his bed. Most of the time she couldn't actually get in, since his bed was already far too crowded.

Looking at her now, Qin Jiang's thoughts stirred. She was only ten, but accounting for time spent in the Space-Time Temple, she was roughly twelve or thirteen. With her cultivation accelerating her development, she was maturing quickly. Nearly there. Holding her close, he could already sense the distance between potential and readiness narrowing. A bit more time, and she might even surpass her sister. When that day came, he'd invite Ningbing for a side-by-side comparison.

His gaze drifted as he assessed her. Ningshuang noticed where he was looking, and a faint blush touched her cheeks — but she made no effort to hide, instead presenting herself openly. Her heart raced with secret delight. Now wouldn't be bad either, she thought. She wasn't that little anymore.

But after a moment, Qin Jiang looked away. No further action.

Ningshuang felt a flicker of disappointment, though not discouragement. A bit more growing, and things might be even better. She was still a touch too young.

Her small hands clasped around his neck, and a sly gleam entered her eyes. "Brother Qin Jiang, what were you staring at just now? You looked totally entranced."

Qin Jiang's face reddened, but he recovered instantly, putting on a perfectly serious expression. "Shuang'er, your cultivation is advancing so quickly. I was worried it might affect your development, so I was just... running a quick examination."

"An examination?"

Ningshuang blinked, then continued: "Did you finish the examination, Brother Qin Jiang? How's my development? Do I need a more thorough checkup?"
