"Young Master Qin, this residence was newly built by the clan leader for the wedding. It hasn't been... occupied yet. I hope you find it satisfactory. Enjoy yourself." Without Huo Lie hovering nearby, the attendant spoke a bit more freely. In the end, keeping Qin Jiang happy was all that mattered.

Qin Jiang waved him off. "That'll be all."

He led the bride inside. The bridal chamber was tastefully decorated—Huo Lie had clearly put real effort into it. Qin Jiang recognized the romantic touches immediately.

Inside the chamber, the bride sat on the edge of the bed. Qin Jiang studied her. Nice figure.

As for her face... he reached for the veil and slowly lifted it.

A breathtaking beauty stared back at him. His expression, however, barely changed—his standards had been raised considerably.

The bride looked at him, and when she saw his muted reaction, a small frown creased her brow. "You're not satisfied with me?"

"Not at all." Qin Jiang shook his head. "I've just seen a lot of beautiful women. Every one of them is at least your equal. To me, a face like yours is... fairly ordinary."

The bride's expression stiffened. Her looks were her greatest source of pride, yet in Qin Jiang's eyes, they were commonplace.

When she didn't respond, Qin Jiang took the initiative. "You've always clashed with Huo Lie. You despise him. So this marriage—it wasn't your idea, was it?"

"It was," she said.

"Oh?"

The Fire Tribe was split into two divisions—the Alchemy Division and the Martial Division. Huo Lie was the clan leader and head of the Alchemy Division. The bride—Huo Ying'er—led the Martial Division. Three hundred years ago, Huo Lie had pursued her and been rejected. After Huo Qing'er's disappearance, he'd seized the position of clan leader, and his relationship with Huo Ying'er had turned openly hostile.

Perhaps Huo Ying'er had suspected something all along.

"But I had my own reasons," she continued, meeting his gaze and gritting her teeth. "You snatched me from Huo Lie's wedding—clearly, you want something from me. Help me, and from now on, I'm yours."

"Help you with what?" Qin Jiang's eyes gleamed. He had a fair idea of what she was after.

"Kill Huo Lie?"

Huo Ying'er's eyes widened in surprise, then she nodded, grief crossing her face. "He doesn't deserve to be clan leader. The true leader is someone else, but..."

She trailed off with a sigh, her gaze heavy with loss and longing.

Hearing her words, Qin Jiang felt a pang. A true friend, this one. Meanwhile, Huo Qing'er was out there scheming about how to drug her best friend into compliance.

Just then, the system's notification chimed in his mind.

【Ding! A Child of Destiny has been detected in proximity to the host. One spoiler is available. The host may view the Child of Destiny's trajectory for the next year. View now?】

A Child of Destiny? He was in the middle of a wedding night—how had he triggered a connection with a Child of Destiny?

Huo Ying'er? No—the system would have flagged it sooner.

Elsewhere, Qin Lian'er had slipped away from the palace after Qin Jiang entered the bridal chamber.

"The Fire Domain is pretty interesting," she mused, browsing the stalls with wide-eyed curiosity, occasionally buying a trinket that caught her eye.

Then she stopped. A tingle pulsed from the mark between her brows. Her eyes lit up, scanning the crowd until they landed on a young man—or more precisely, on the white jade in his hands.

The youth was haggling with a vendor, clearly desperate for the jade but short on funds.

In a flash, a gust of energy ripped the white jade from his grip. Before he could react, Qin Lian'er had plucked it neatly from the air.

She examined it, beaming. "I'll take this!" She tossed down a pouch of spirit stones. The vendor scrambled to catch it and, seeing the amount, broke into a delighted grin.

The youth's face, however, had gone dark. Seeing that Qin Lian'er paid him no attention, he darted in front of her.

"Miss, I saw that jade first."

"And?" She glanced at him, turning the jade over in her hand without a care.

"Buyers should respect first come, first served. I was here first—that jade should be mine!"

"Did you pay for it?"

"Uh..." His face fell. He cursed himself silently. With a treasure like this in front of him, why had he wasted time haggling? He should have bought it immediately.

"Miss, I was about to pay."

Refusing to give up, he produced his spirit stones and handed them to the vendor, who instinctively accepted them.

Qin Lian'er blinked, mulled it over briefly, then reclaimed her own spirit stones and tossed the jade to the youth. "Fine. Consider it yours."

His face brightened. She was actually giving it back? What a kind—

"Now hand over what you just bought."

Qin Lian'er pocketed her stones, and with a wave of her hand, guards appeared from nowhere, encircling the youth.

He gaped at her, then his expression twisted with fury. "In broad daylight—you'd rob me?"

"Quick learner," Qin Lian'er said with a grin, baring two adorable little canines. She flicked her wrist. "Break his legs. Take the jade."

A blur of motion. Before the youth could even see who'd moved, blinding pain shot through him and his body crumpled. The white jade was snatched from his hand.

"AHHH!" His scream of agony tore through the street.

Qin Lian'er looked down at him with a frown. "Quit screaming. If my brother hadn't told me to keep a low profile since we're visitors, I'd have killed you already. Honestly, you should be grateful. Thank my brother, got it?"

With that, she strolled off, jade in hand, guards in tow.

The youth was left on the ground, surrounded by terrified onlookers. No one dared help him. He glared at Qin Lian'er's retreating figure, hatred blazing in his eyes.

Revenge. He would have his revenge. And that white jade—he'd get it back. Inside it was an Emperor Technique!

After a long while, with no one offering aid, the youth dragged himself to his feet and limped away.

Back at the Fire Tribe's bridal chamber, Qin Jiang had already pulled up the spoiler. He skimmed through the trajectory and raised an eyebrow, thinking: 'A reborn Child of Destiny this time. Though from the looks of it, he just returned—he hasn't even started developing yet.'
