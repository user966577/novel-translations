"Sister, you're finally here!"

Before Qin Jiang could speak, Yu Ru appeared at her sister's side and threw her arms around her. Seeing Yu Lan's ashen face, her eyes reddened. "Sister, I thought you..."

She began to sniffle.

The sight of Yu Ru softened Yu Lan's expression instantly, and relief washed through her. Things weren't as dire as she'd feared. She raised a slender hand to wipe the tears from Yu Ru's cheeks. "It's all right. I'm back now, aren't I?"

Yu Ru nodded, a smile returning to her face. Then she took Yu Lan's hand and turned toward Qin Jiang. "Sister, let me introduce you. This is—"

But before she could finish, Yu Lan's body swayed. The moment she'd seen Yu Ru, every last shred of tension had drained away. Combined with the strain of forcing herself awake moments ago, the exhaustion became overwhelming. She collapsed into Yu Ru's arms, unconscious.

Yu Ru: "???"

She blinked, staring at Qin Jiang in bewilderment. "You drugged her already?"

Qin Jiang gave her a flat look, flicked her forehead, and scooped Yu Lan out of her arms. "Her injuries are severe. How did you not notice?"

"Oh!"

Yu Ru glanced at her sister, worry flooding her face. She reached out to examine Yu Lan, but Qin Jiang swatted her hand aside. "I'll handle this."

Yu Ru blinked, read his intent, and nodded.

Together they descended into a room that had been prepared in advance for Yu Lan. As Qin Jiang carried her inside, Yu Ru hovered at the doorway and whispered, "Her injuries are this bad—you'd better not try anything."

"Am I really that desperate?"

"You tell me."

Yu Ru shot him a withering look. He'd known her for less than ten minutes before he'd already... If that wasn't desperate, what was?

"Anyway, you can't touch my sister right now. If you can't control yourself, I... I can let you..."

Her cheeks flushed pink. 'This is to protect my sister,' she told herself. 'Not because I want to...'

Qin Jiang glanced at her, licked his lips, then produced a medicinal pill and fed it to Yu Lan. In one smooth motion, he swept Yu Ru into his arms.

"Your sister will wake in about two hours. We'd better hurry."

"What? What are you doing?"

"What do you think?"

He grinned wickedly.

Yu Ru's face was burning. She stole a glance at the unconscious Yu Lan. "Here?"

"Obviously. Your sister's injuries aren't light—someone needs to keep an eye on her."

"But..."

"Stop hesitating. If we don't finish before she wakes up..."

In the haze of unconsciousness, Yu Lan thought she could hear strange sounds drifting around her—muffled, rhythmic, persistent. She was too exhausted to fully wake, but even in her half-aware state, the noises irritated her.

Time slipped by. As consciousness gradually returned, she could make out her sister's voice—and it sounded very wrong. Almost as if...

Her brow furrowed.

Yu Ru had been keeping anxious watch over Yu Lan the entire time, terrified she might wake up at any moment.

After a pause to collect herself, she turned to Qin Jiang and whispered, "She's waking up."

Her voice trembled.

More time passed. Yu Lan's lashes fluttered, and Yu Ru's heart leaped into her throat. Finally, Yu Lan's eyes drifted open. She lay still for a moment, disoriented, then turned her head. Her sister and the unfamiliar young man were both watching her with concern.

Only... why did her sister's expression look so odd? And were those tear tracks on her cheeks?

'She must be worried about me.'

Warmth filled Yu Lan's chest. She lifted a hand and gently stroked Yu Ru's face, brushing away the traces of tears. "Ru'er, don't worry. I'm fine."

"Mm~"

Yu Ru nodded, her voice slightly off.

She sat on the edge of the bed...

Then Yu Lan turned to Qin Jiang. "And you are...?"

"Qin Jiang. I've long heard of the empress's legendary beauty. Seeing you today, the rumors do you no justice."

He smiled easily.

With her sister's attention redirected, Yu Ru breathed a quiet sigh of relief.

Only...

Yu Lan was about to respond when she wrinkled her nose. "What's that smell?"

"Huh?"

Yu Ru's face went scarlet, panic flashing through her eyes. "What smell? I don't smell anything."

"You don't?"

Yu Ru nodded firmly. "Nope. Nothing at all. Oh—Sister, let me introduce you properly..."

She steered the conversation away, gesturing at Qin Jiang. "You have no idea—we'd be in serious trouble if not for him. Yesterday, Snake Race soldiers found this place. Qin Jiang killed them all before they could report back. Otherwise, we'd have been captured and our hiding spot exposed..."

"Snake Race soldiers found us?"

Yu Lan's eyes widened in alarm. The mysterious smell was instantly forgotten. She frowned. "Tell me everything."

Yu Ru nodded and launched into a meticulously crafted story, painting Qin Jiang as their savior.

When she finished, Yu Lan's gaze settled on Qin Jiang with noticeably warmer eyes. "Young Master Qin, thank you for saving my people."

"I just couldn't stand watching them bully the weak."

Qin Jiang flashed a carefree grin.

Yu Ru piled on. "Sister, after you fainted, it was Qin Jiang who took care of you. Without him, I wouldn't have known what to do."

"Ahem. It was nothing."

Qin Jiang coughed lightly. The girl was laying it on thick—building him up while making herself sound completely useless.

Yu Lan's brow creased. She looked between Qin Jiang and Yu Ru. Something felt off.

Unbidden, her mind drifted back to those strange sounds she'd heard while unconscious...

"Sister, Qin Jiang is also an alchemist—an Emperor-grade alchemist, actually. You should let him examine your injuries."

Yu Ru punctuated the suggestion with a conspiratorial wink at Qin Jiang.

Yu Lan blinked in surprise. An Emperor-grade alchemist—that was a status even an Ancient Emperor like herself had to respect.

"Then I'll trouble you, Young Master Qin."

"No trouble at all."

Qin Jiang shook his head, then glanced at Yu Ru. Her face was flushed, and he'd caught a whiff of something telltale. After a moment's thought, he said, "I'll need a quiet environment. Could you..."

"I'll step out right now!"

Yu Ru blurted before Yu Lan could say a word. She bolted for the door—and as she brushed past Qin Jiang, something seemed to flick onto his clothes.
