"What's there to be afraid of? Let's do it!"

Fourth Ancestor's confidence surged instantly. With nine more Great Emperors, the Qin family would be truly invincible. Even if the entire continent united against them, the Qin family could wipe them all out. When that happened, the whole continent would be theirs. The thought alone was exhilarating.

He rubbed his hands together, eyed Thousand Year Mountain, and vanished from the traveling palace in a flash. His Emperor aura erupted with overwhelming force. The Great Emperor Ruins on Thousand Year Mountain began to tremble violently, cracks spiderwebbing across the protective barrier.

No one cheered. Instead, they stared at Fourth Ancestor in abject terror. A Great Emperor! The Qin family's Great Emperor had made his move!

Fourth Ancestor ignored the crowd's horror and shattered the barrier with a single palm strike. Then his immense power enveloped the entire ruins.

"Rise!" he roared.

Space itself shuddered. The cultivators nearest the ruins scrambled backward in panic as wild energy surged outward, sending countless people flying. The unlucky ones were killed outright.

The ruins trembled, nearly torn from the earth. By now, everyone understood what Fourth Ancestor intended. He was going to take the entire ruins—mountain and all. Not even leaving them scraps of soup.

Outrageous! Fists clenched, eyes burning with fury—but even a Great Emperor couldn't stand against the whole continent... could he?

Lin Chen lurked among the crowd, eyes fixed on Fourth Ancestor. Over the past weeks, he'd encountered setback after setback and had long since realized someone was targeting him. The only person he'd offended with that kind of power was Qin Jiang. Countless opportunities had been snatched away. And now, just when he'd finally stumbled upon a Great Emperor Ruins—even securing the key to its greatest treasure—was the Qin family going to ruin this for him too?

'Strength! I need strength!' he screamed inwardly. If he had his power from ten thousand years ago, even six Great Emperors wouldn't dare touch him.

But now—

"He who disturbs this Emperor's slumber shall perish!" A majestic voice boomed from within the ruins. An enormous phantom materialized above the site, blotting out the sky with its Emperor aura. Nearly everyone present could only tremble beneath its pressure.

Fourth Ancestor paused, glanced at the phantom, and sneered. "A phantom, and you're putting on airs?"

He flicked his wrist. A colossal palm descended from the heavens. With a thunderous boom, the Emperor phantom shuddered once and dissolved into nothing.

Every jaw in the crowd dropped. That entrance had been so dramatic—and the phantom turned out to be a complete pushover? They'd been hoping it might stop Fourth Ancestor, but the gap in power was absurd.

"Up!" Fourth Ancestor bellowed.

The ground lurched. Before the horrified eyes of every spectator, the entirety of Thousand Year Mountain was ripped from the earth. Fourth Ancestor heaved it overhead with a single sweep of his arm and slung it across his shoulders. The sight left everyone speechless—the visual impact was staggering beyond belief.

"This mountain belongs to the Qin family now," he announced, surveying the crowd with supreme authority.

Without waiting for a response, he took off toward Qin family territory, the mountain riding his shoulders.

Inside the traveling palace, even Qin Jiang was stunned. The spectacle that old man would create carrying an entire mountain range across the continent... Still, Qin Jiang had other business to attend to and didn't follow.

The crowd stood frozen, watching Fourth Ancestor carry Thousand Year Mountain into the distance until its massive silhouette vanished beyond the horizon. Only then did they slowly regain their senses.

Several ancient clan powerhouses rushed to where Thousand Year Mountain had stood. The crater left behind was hundreds of feet deep. Their faces twitched at the sight. This was worse than digging up three feet of earth—he'd taken the mountain, the ruins, and probably even the mice underground.

"The Qin family has gone too far!" one ancient clan elder declared.

The others wore equally dark expressions. They shot a glance at Qin Jiang's traveling palace, still hovering in the air, and shook their heads. With Qin family members still present, it was best to say nothing more.

Exchanging bitter looks, the ancient clan powerhouses departed one by one. The remaining cultivators stared at the massive crater and clicked their tongues in disbelief. Resentment simmered beneath the surface—many had come with dreams of soaring to greatness, and the Qin family hadn't even left them the chance to dream.

Most cursed the Qin family in their hearts.

Atop the traveling palace, Huo Qing'er and the other women stood beside Qin Jiang. Though the Qin family had drawn the ire of the masses, none of them were the least bit worried. The Qin family's power had already surpassed what anyone on the Heavenly Mystery Continent could challenge.

Qin Jiang's gaze locked onto one figure in the crowd—Lin Chen, hiding among the common cultivators. Unfortunately for him, the Qin family had people monitoring him at all times. Before Qin Jiang, he had nowhere to hide.

As the crowd thinned and Lin Chen drifted away with the departing masses, Qin Jiang didn't pursue immediately.

"Let's rest for now," he said, turning to Huo Qing'er and the others with a smile.

The women trembled, looking at him with wide, pitiful eyes—knowing exactly what "rest" meant. Qin Jiang grinned, waved his hand, and sealed off the entire traveling palace. Qin Lian'er rolled her eyes, retreated to her room, and left him plenty of space.
