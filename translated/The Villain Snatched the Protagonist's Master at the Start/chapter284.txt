The next morning, An Xihe was surprised to find that seeing Qing Chan filled her with something close to elation. She was genuinely exhausted. Even having been enemies once, the sight of Qing Chan brought tears of relief. A savior had arrived. 'Quick—join forces and put this animal down!'

"Chan'er, what are you doing here?" Qin Jiang rose and appeared at Qing Chan's side, pulling her straight to the bed.

Qing Chan blushed, shooting him a look before glancing at the limp form of An Xihe. She'd been worried about his safety and had come as soon as she recovered. Clearly, Qin Jiang had been his usual devastating self.

And now it was her turn to suffer. He couldn't possibly be satisfied yet.

She'd rested well enough, but one-on-one with Qin Jiang still made her nervous. An Xihe was clearly in no condition to help. This being her first time, Qing Chan could sympathize.

Gritting her teeth under An Xihe's pleading gaze, she slipped beneath the covers and wrapped herself around Qin Jiang. From now on, they were sisters. And given their history, taking one for the team now would settle old scores nicely.

One turn stretched into an entire day. Qing Chan was no match either, and An Xihe's presence seemed to energize the beast rather than tire it.

Afterward, both women lay draped over him, utterly spent. They looked at each other. Neither had imagined ending up in this position. Absurd didn't begin to cover it.

Qin Jiang looked from one to the other. Two True Immortals—and together, they still couldn't beat him. He preened.

His smug expression did not go unnoticed. Two hands shot out simultaneously, twisting the soft flesh at his waist.

"Hss!" He winced. But looking down at their flushed, exquisite faces, he couldn't muster any annoyance. The view was simply too good.

"Brute. Not an ounce of tenderness in you," Qing Chan huffed.

An Xihe nodded emphatically. The brute had made her cry. And instead of consoling her, he'd gone harder, making her cry more. She didn't know it was possible to shed that many tears.

Qing Chan had cried too—even worse, by the look of it. Though she seemed accustomed to it, punctuating her sobs with shouts and declarations that made An Xihe's ears burn. She couldn't imagine saying such things herself.

Faced with their accusations, Qin Jiang felt aggrieved. He'd been holding back. Besides, the whole point had been to resolve their tension. And now, after sharing this experience, whatever grudge existed between them was surely laid to rest. Not quite a bond forged in the fires of battle, perhaps, but close enough—they'd both nearly been done in by the same weapon.

He shook his head, offering no defense. The two women were united against a common foe, which was exactly the outcome he'd hoped for. His biggest worry had been that the rivalry between Qing Chan and An Xihe would prove irreconcilable.

Fortunately, both were big-hearted about it. Qing Chan had never been at a real disadvantage, so she wasn't inclined to hold a grudge. An Xihe's sealing had been her own choice, and her enemies at the time included far more than just Qing Chan. With Qin Jiang in her life, old resentments could be set aside. Besides, she had other scores to settle. And today, Qing Chan's sacrifice on her behalf drew a definitive line under their past.

Meanwhile, as Qin Jiang enjoyed the best of both worlds, Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming were deep in the mountains, wallowing in misery.

Their manhood—both literally and figuratively—was in ruins.

Qing Chan's crushing blow had carried True Immortal power. Even Chen Qi'er lacked the ability to regenerate. In just a few days, his beard had fallen out entirely. His voice had changed, going higher and thinner.

"Master..." Chen Wuming gazed at Chen Qi'er with imploring eyes. His voice had taken on a distinctly coquettish quality, making Chen Qi'er shudder.

Without his manhood, Chen Wuming had undergone a certain... transformation. His formerly resolute features had softened. His voice was honeyed. He even walked with a swaying, mincing gait, legs pressed close together. If not for the obvious deficiency, Chen Qi'er might have actually felt something.

"Master, is there really no way to fix this?" Chen Wuming sidled up, hugging Chen Qi'er's arm, practically purring.

Chen Qi'er suppressed a wave of revulsion. He cleared his throat, extracting his arm. "Once I break through to True Immortal, I can purge Qing Chan's power. Then regeneration will be simple."

That, however, would take considerable time.

Chen Wuming was thinking along different lines entirely. Black Dragon's boss wanted beauties. Finding one had proved impossible. But what if he became one himself? He touched his own face. Decent bone structure, wasn't it? With the right outfit and some cosmetics, he might make a passable woman.

What if Black Dragon's boss took a liking to him?

Chen Qi'er caught the look in Chen Wuming's eyes—the way the boy was studying his own face, then studying Chen Qi'er—and felt a chill run down his spine. His apprentice wasn't developing feelings, was he?

Then he remembered: neither of them had anything left. Even if the boy did have ideas, execution was impossible. That was reassuring, at least. But to nip any misconceptions in the bud, he patted Chen Wuming's shoulder firmly.

"Don't worry. I will restore you."

"Mm!" Chen Wuming nodded, but his thoughts were already elsewhere—shopping lists forming in his mind. Women's clothing. Rouge and powder. A proper makeover.

If Qin Jiang ever learned of this plan, he'd exterminate the boy on the spot. Between this and that Ye Xuan business, the nausea would be unbearable.

Chen Wuming trailed after his master, scheming quietly. Chen Qi'er, meanwhile, was fixated on one thing: revenge against Qin Jiang. Direct confrontation was out of the question, so he'd strike through someone close. He'd already picked up Chen Changsheng's trail. A few more days, and he'd find him.

'Just wait, Qin Jiang. When I bring your precious friend to your doorstep, you'll know what it feels like to lose what matters most.'
