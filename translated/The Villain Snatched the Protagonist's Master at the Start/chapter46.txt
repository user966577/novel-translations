Back at Qin Jiang's side, the excitement still hadn't faded from Qin Lian'er's little face.

The 360 Songstresses had been dodging her questions the entire time.

But as everyone knows, avoiding a question is itself an answer. She was practically certain now—these 360 women were definitely her future sisters-in-law!

"Brother, you're seriously amazing!"

Qin Lian'er exclaimed.

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. He couldn't be bothered explaining anymore. Besides, given the right opportunity, Lian'er's misunderstanding might very well become reality.

"Oh right, brother! The woman I snatched for you—want to go take a look?"

Qin Lian'er blinked, her eyes bright with anticipation.

"Sure, sure, let's go see her."

Seeing her eager expression, Qin Jiang ruffled her hair affectionately.

The siblings left their parents' residence along with the 360 Songstresses. After briefly getting the Songstresses settled in, they followed a path toward a small courtyard beside Qin Lian'er's quarters.

"Brother, she's right inside. I'm telling you, this sister-in-law is really beautiful—no less than the others."

Qin Lian'er whispered.

Just then, Qin Jiang stopped in his tracks, his expression turning strange.

【Detected: A Child of Destiny has formed a connection with the Host. One spoiler is available. Host may view the Child of Destiny's trajectory for the next year. View?】

Another Child of Destiny?

Could it be someone inside the courtyard? Someone Lian'er had brought back?

Wait, that didn't add up. She'd brought back a woman. Even if this person bore destiny's favor, shouldn't she be called a Daughter of Destiny?

Or had Lian'er brought back a fortune heroine?

That was entirely possible!

"What's wrong?"

Noticing Qin Jiang's expression, Qin Lian'er asked curiously.

Qin Jiang shook his head with a smile.

"Nothing."

As he answered, he split his attention and began reviewing the spoiler.

Qin Lian'er pulled him into the courtyard.

"Susu, I'm back again!"

Qin Lian'er called out like they were old friends. Qin Jiang looked up and saw a refined woman sitting in the courtyard, wearing a pristine white dress that reached her ankles, an air of quiet elegance about her.

Her expression was cold, tinged with a trace of melancholy. When she heard Qin Lian'er's voice, Qin Jiang clearly noticed her body tense, a flash of wariness entering her eyes.

After all, she'd been kidnapped and dragged here by Qin Lian'er.

"Bai Susu."

Seeing the woman, Qin Jiang spoke softly.

The spoiler had barely opened when this woman's figure appeared—she was indeed a fortune heroine.

He gave Lian'er a peculiar look. This girl had a touch of villain energy herself. Every time she went out, she either bumped into a Child of Destiny or stumbled across a fortune heroine.

Tsk. Was this fate?

"Huh? Brother, you know her?"

Qin Lian'er was somewhat surprised.

Qin Jiang shook his head.

"I don't."

Qin Lian'er furrowed her brows. He didn't know her? Then how did he know her name?

She couldn't be bothered to think too hard about it. Turning to Bai Susu:

"Susu, this is my brother! I told you ages ago—my brother is super handsome, and strong, and gentle, and he knows how to treat a woman right. Absolutely the best husband material. Hehe, Susu, get yourself ready—you and my brother can consummate the marriage tonight!"

"Absolutely not!"

Bai Susu's face went pale as she refused outright.

She'd been watching Qin Jiang since the moment he walked in. She had to admit—just as Qin Lian'er had said, he was handsome enough to make her heart flutter ever so slightly.

But still...

"Lian'er, I love your gift."

Just then, Qin Jiang spoke with a smile, then turned toward Bai Susu and began slowly closing the distance.

Bai Susu's heart lurched.

"You... what are you going to do?"

She retreated several steps, her face full of alarm, spiritual energy already surging through her body.

Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed slightly. He stopped and turned to look at Qin Lian'er, who was watching the whole thing with innocent curiosity.

"Lian'er, step outside for a moment. I need to talk to her alone."

"Oh~"

Qin Lian'er nodded obediently and skipped out of the courtyard, not forgetting to add one last reminder:

"Brother, she's my gift to you. Don't let her escape!"

"Don't worry."

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile.

Their exchange left Bai Susu feeling deeply humiliated—she was being passed around like merchandise.

After Qin Lian'er left, Qin Jiang turned his gaze on Bai Susu, looking her over without the slightest restraint. The heat in his eyes made her feel like ants were crawling across her skin.

"Young Master Qin, with your status, you certainly don't lack for women. Surely you wouldn't stoop to forcing yourself on one. After all, your reputation is at stake."

Bai Susu forced herself to appear calm.

Her words carried a subtle challenge—sons of great families always cared about their reputations. The Qin family, as an ancient clan, should be the same... right?

She wasn't entirely confident.

Qin Jiang gave a faint smile.

"What a coincidence. What this young master enjoys most are stolen melons—not only do they quench your thirst, but the sense of achievement is unmatched. I wonder, Miss Bai... can you satisfy me?"

Hearing this, Bai Susu's pretty face stiffened, going slightly pale.

She clenched her fists tightly, still grasping at straws.

"Actually, I'm already—"

"Married?"

Qin Jiang cut her off, guessing exactly what she was about to say. Women always resorted to the same two tricks, not realizing it only made men more interested.

Bai Susu: "..."

Qin Jiang advanced step by step. Bai Susu retreated step by step, until her back was pressed against the wall and she had nowhere left to go. Her whole body was trembling.

Qin Jiang crouched slightly, tilting her chin upward with one finger.

"Sigh, you don't realize that this young master's only weakness is little Lian'er. I'd never refuse any request of hers, and she wants us in the bridal chamber tonight... So I'm afraid you'll just have to bear with it."

"No... please don't."

Bai Susu's voice caught in her throat.

"Please, don't touch me. I have someone I love. Please..."

She raised her head, eyes brimming with tears.

Qin Jiang was somewhat surprised—this fortune heroine had remarkably poor mental fortitude.

What he'd forgotten was that Bai Susu had been forcibly abducted by Qin Lian'er. Before his return, Lian'er had been pestering her every single day, keeping her nerves wound impossibly tight.

She hadn't dared let her guard down for even a moment.

And now, the instant Qin Jiang came home, he wanted to consummate the marriage.

Bai Susu had long since been worn to the breaking point, and the last thread holding her together had finally snapped.

Looking at her, Qin Jiang let out a sigh.

"I don't want to make Lian'er sad, so I'm afraid you'll have to be the one who's sad instead."

"No!"

Bai Susu cried out.

But Qin Jiang was unmoved. Consummate first, feelings later—it would go more smoothly that way.

After all, time breeds affection.

"Please don't, I'm begging you. I... I can help you another way. As long as you don't touch me there, I'll do anything you want. I can—"

"Oh?"

"...I can..."

"Anything else?"

"As long as it's not there... everything else... is fine..."

Hearing this, Qin Jiang took a deep breath, fell silent for a moment, then said:

"We'll see how you perform."
