Five days later, under Bai Susu's reluctant gaze, Qin Jiang left her cultivation chamber.

Only Chu Hanyan's side remained — he needed to deliver some corpses.

But before he could even turn toward her light orb, a fragrant breeze washed over him and a supple figure threw itself into his arms.

He caught her reflexively and looked down. "Yan'er, you emerged from seclusion?"

The beauty in his arms was indeed Chu Hanyan. She hooked her arms around his neck, grinning. "I came out just now and heard from the sisters that you were back, so I came to wait for you. Qin Jiang, I missed you so much~"

She pressed a kiss to his lips without waiting for a response.

This was Qin Jiang's private room — long since relocated into the Space-Time Temple. Before, there was almost always someone here. But these past few days, the others had tactfully cleared out — temporarily ceded him, so to speak.

Chu Hanyan had only just emerged from seclusion when she'd heard the news. She'd rushed here at once.

Qin Jiang carried her to the bed. With just the two of them, the enormous bed felt almost excessive — though it did provide more room to maneuver.

That was when Chu Hanyan's nose twitched. "Smells like Susu. You just came from her place?"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. She could tell by smell?

He nodded. "This trip, I picked up some things. I gave Ling'er and Susu each an immortal-path law."

"An immortal-path law..." Chu Hanyan blinked eagerly. "Do I get one too?"

"No law for you."

She hadn't even had time to feel disappointed before he waved his arm. Corpses spilled across the floor.

He gestured at the collection. "Five True Immortals, plus a dozen-odd Human Immortals. Refine them into puppets, and your own cultivation should break through to the immortal path, right?"

Chu Hanyan's cultivation was already at the Great Emperor level — Qin Jiang had killed enough Great Emperors previously that she'd been able to refine some of their corpses.

Looking at the pile, her face was one of pure astonishment. "True Immortals... Human Immortals... this many?"

She stared at him. "What exactly did you do out there?"

Five True Immortals and over a dozen Human Immortals — had he cleaned out every powerhouse in Azure Cloud Heaven?

Qin Jiang shrugged. "Nothing much. Just wandered around, spread some warmth. As for these people, they brought it on themselves. Sigh, Yan'er, you know I'm a compassionate person. Killing them weighs heavily on my conscience. If you refine them into puppets, at least they'll be resurrected in some form — eases my guilt a little."

Chu Hanyan's eyelid twitched. She shook her head at his nonsense, but seeing his pained expression, she reached up and patted his head soothingly. "If they brought it on themselves, then they deserved it. They should be thanking us for turning them into puppets."

"True."

They shared a look and burst out laughing. "Store them for now," Qin Jiang said.

Chu Hanyan waved her hand and swept the corpses into her dedicated puppet storage space.

"How many puppets have you refined in total?" he asked, curious.

"Not that many. Back in the Qin Domain, aside from the ones I inherited from my parents, I mostly refined weak ones — absorbed their cultivation and destroyed the shells. After joining you, I gradually made more. All told, a few thousand. But most of them will need to be retired now."

She did the math as she spoke. Below Great Emperor, puppets offered negligible cultivation gains at her level. She planned to drain and destroy them all. And with True Immortal and Human Immortal corpses now available, even the Great Emperor puppets were obsolete. She'd keep only Human Immortal-tier and above.

"A few thousand? That's all?"

"I only wanted to protect myself at first, so I didn't make many. But now I want to build up my numbers. The more puppets I have, the faster I can grow." She hesitated, brow creasing. "The thing is... it tends to offend people. And most consider it wicked sorcery."

"Offend people? Don't worry about that." Qin Jiang ruffled her hair, his voice gentle. "From now on, when we refine puppets, we'll just refine their entire clan too. Can't offend anyone if there's no one left to take offense. As for wicked sorcery — heh, Yan'er, we run Azure Cloud Heaven now."

She blinked.

Refine their entire clan?

Right. If you wiped out the whole bloodline, who was going to come seeking justice? No unrelated bystander was going to champion their cause.

"Azure Cloud Heaven... is ours?"

Qin Jiang nodded. "The strongest power in Azure Cloud Heaven is now an Immortal King. And she's one of your sisters."

That told her everything. She knew his strength well — in his own words, his second-in-command was invincible. Chu Hanyan agreed wholeheartedly.

So he'd conquered yet another sister. An Immortal King, no less. Which meant his own power had grown yet again.

The thought made her eyes shine. She wanted to experience the upgrade firsthand. "Qin Jiang~" She draped herself around his neck, body pressing close, voice honeyed and inviting. Her gaze hooked into his, rippling like autumn water, almost hypnotic.

He understood her meaning immediately. She needed the light of the sun cast into the abyss.

At this, Qin Jiang was an expert. Naturally, he was obliged to help.

"Yan'er~"

A soft call. She answered in kind. Their eyes met, faces drifting closer, and their lips found each other. Qin Jiang's hands, guided by autopilot, reached their destinations with practiced precision. Chu Hanyan's cheeks bloomed scarlet.

When they finally parted, her gaze was slightly unfocused. She leaned against his shoulder and whispered, "Husband, you've been away so long. Every debt you owe — you're paying it all back tonight~"

"As long as you can handle it."

He kissed her cheek, then nipped her earlobe. "Now then — I'm starting the repayment. Ready, Yan'er?"

"Mm~"
