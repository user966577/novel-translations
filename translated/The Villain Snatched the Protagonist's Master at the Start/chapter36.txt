One month later.

Ye Qingtian sent word that he was about to make his move, and inquired about any signs of Ye Xuan's whereabouts.

Reading the message, Qin Jiang smiled and murmured:

"Taking down several ancient clans at once... tsk, won't that make the Qin family look like terrorists?"

Along with the message, Ye Qingtian had sent an assortment of poisons—all prepared for the Ye family's ancestral elders. They wouldn't kill outright, but would leave the elders temporarily weakened.

The question was: how to make the Ye family elders take them?

Coming clean? Too risky—the elders might not believe him.

Slipping them poison secretly was also tricky.

Rubbing his temples, Qin Jiang wrestled with the problem before finally slamming his palm on the table:

"Screw it—flip the table and force-feed them!

Fourth Ancestor, time to earn your keep!"

Qin Jiang called out, and the Fourth Ancestor's figure materialized silently.

Qin Jiang studied him and couldn't help clicking his tongue in admiration. Before, the Fourth Ancestor had looked youthful but couldn't hide the weight of ages clinging to him. Now, though...

Returning to the origin!

He genuinely looked like a frail scholar.

But who could have guessed that this frail scholar was now the most powerful being on the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent?

Great Emperor!!!

The Fourth Ancestor had successfully refined the Great Emperor law and ascended to the Great Emperor realm.

Under the Qin family's concealment, this news hadn't leaked. According to the ancestral elders, the Qin family now possessed sufficient strength to hold the entire continent in check.

One Great Emperor hidden in the shadows—when the moment came, he could deliver a devastating surprise to any enemy.

But to Qin Jiang, this approach just made his elders a bunch of sneaky rats.

Still, though the news of the Fourth Ancestor's breakthrough hadn't been released, the ancestral elders had issued a decree: from now on, Qin family members could afford to be even more brazen in their dealings!

It was only now that Qin Jiang finally understood the Qin family's villain credentials.

No wonder he'd been labeled a villain.

Turns out his whole family had been dragging him down.

Qin Jiang and the Fourth Ancestor slipped undetected into the Ye family's restricted grounds, where the Ye family's ancestral elders were all in seclusion.

Under normal circumstances, Ye Qingtian would have sent Ye Xuan to persuade the elders to cooperate with his scheme—a plan that genuinely benefited the Ye family.

So the Ye family elders had all agreed.

But with Qin Jiang involved, there was no need for such hassle. Cut the knot clean and fast—if you're going to act, make it convincing. Real poison meant real performances. Now that was dedication.

As for the cleanup, the Fourth Ancestor alone was more than enough.

"Fourth Ancestor, get to work."

Qin Jiang said.

The Fourth Ancestor shot him a glare. 'Why does it always feel like I've become this brat's subordinate?'

His gaze swept across the Ye family elders, locking onto every last one. With a wave of his arm—

BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!

A rapid chain of explosions. One by one, soot-covered figures appeared before the Fourth Ancestor, dazed and utterly bewildered.

"Open your mouths!"

The Fourth Ancestor commanded.

The Ye family elders gradually came to their senses and turned toward him:

"You..."

"Qin Fengliu? What are you doing in our Ye family?"

"Wait—your strength..."

Some among the Ye family actually recognized the Fourth Ancestor.

He couldn't be bothered with explanations. He simply immobilized them all, walked up, pried their mouths open one by one, and shoved the poison in.

"Cough cough cough..."

"Qin Fengliu, what are you doing? What did you feed us?"

"Is the Qin family declaring war on the Ye family?"

"Stop this!"

They struggled and thrashed, but against a Great Emperor, their resistance was futile.

Before long, the deed was done.

"Bait's ready."

The Fourth Ancestor looked thoroughly pleased with himself.

Being a Great Emperor was truly something—these Supremes were like baby chicks to him.

"Heh heh, you're amazing, Fourth Ancestor!"

Qin Jiang laid on the flattery.

At the same time, he sent Ye Qingtian a message signaling that it was time to begin.

---

In the dense forest.

Ye Qingtian concealed his presence. All around him, shadowy figures lurked—impossible to tell how many.

He frowned, turning to the commander beside him:

"Where are your ancestral elders?"

"Heh heh, the elders are ready. The moment we confirm the Ye family's ancestral elders are truly poisoned, they'll strike immediately."

The commander chuckled.

The ancient clans' ancestral elders were virtually all Supreme-level powerhouses—each one a treasure.

Naturally, caution was warranted.

Ye Qingtian's brow furrowed, but he held his tongue.

Just then, his message stone glowed faintly. Joy flashed across Ye Qingtian's face as he read Qin Jiang's message:

"Move out!"

The commander glanced at him, then nodded and immediately issued the order.

Wave after wave of dark shadows surged toward Ye City like a black tide.

"What? Ye Qingtian is attacking?"

Ye Lingtian shot to his feet, staring at Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang nodded:

"Get ready. We're catching them in a trap."

"How did you get this information?"

"Oh, I've been in contact with Ye Qingtian. This whole operation is our plan."

Ye Lingtian: "???"

He stared at Qin Jiang in total disbelief:

"What did you just say?"

"Ye Qingtian and I are working together. Got it?"

Ye Lingtian's aura trembled involuntarily. He pointed at Qin Jiang:

"You... you you you..."

"Enough with the stuttering. Any more delays and Ye Qingtian will be inside the city!"

Qin Jiang was somewhat exasperated.

'And this guy is the family head? Can't even sort out his priorities.'

In his view, Ye Lingtian really couldn't compare to Ye Qingtian. He had no idea why the Ye family elders had chosen him.

Taking a deep breath, Ye Lingtian nodded at Qin Jiang. He didn't dare hesitate further and immediately began preparations. Otherwise, Ye Qingtian's assault would cause incalculable damage to the Ye family.

And now, with advance warning, they might actually catch the enemy in a trap.

About an hour later.

The Ye family finally detected the enemy's approach. Ye Lingtian exhaled in relief—preparations were nearly complete. With Ye Qingtian arriving now, they would make sure he never left!

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtian and his forces crept to the outskirts of Ye City. He looked up. The city was almost certainly a death trap by now.

After all, between Qin Jiang's intel and the traces he'd deliberately left, if Ye Lingtian still hadn't reacted, he'd be tempted to beat the man to death himself.

"Infiltrate Ye City. Begin the slaughter!"

Ye Qingtian ordered.

The commander glanced at him. Ye Qingtian's cold, ruthless expression sent a chill through his heart.

Most of the people in that city were Ye family members.

And this man had ordered a massacre of his own kin without a moment's hesitation.

'After we destroy the Ye family, this one can't be left alive either.'

Soon, the black flood poured into Ye City. After Ye Qingtian and the commander entered last, the slaughter officially began.

Only...

What awaited them wasn't a flock of sheep, but a pack of hungry wolves. The slaughter was of them!
