Xue Yue rested against him, content but tired. After a while, she remembered Nangong Yun — she hadn't finished telling him.

She looked up, hand on his chest. "Nangong Yun also said that Weiwei only became your woman for his sake. And that she's been living in 'misery.' That's all his own imagination, by the way. Then came the compensation offer — he offered himself." She made a face. "As if that's a prize."

Qin Jiang shook his head. 'What a clown.' Well, let him be. His delusions didn't affect anything — and kept the Villain Points flowing.

"The worst part," Xue Yue continued, "is that he thought letting me sleep with him was some kind of favor. Disgusting!"

He snorted dismissively. "He thinks too highly of himself."

"Right? I hope you told me to hit him."

"I didn't need to — you already did?"

"Sure did." Her eyes gleamed with satisfaction. "I took a stick to his manhood."

"You went straight for that?"

She blushed and glanced downward. He followed her gaze and winced internally.

"Did you... completely destroy it?" he asked.

"Not sure. I swung pretty hard. He dropped straight to his knees. There might have been blood." She shrugged. "I didn't check — too dirty."

"If you just used brute force, a Supreme can recover from it. Even if it's pulverized, the right pills can regrow it."

"Probably pulverized, not severed," she said thoughtfully.

He raised an eyebrow. "Then it'd need to be amputated first and regrown from scratch. The medicine for that is expensive — and the Anti-Huaxia Alliance definitely can't afford it."

Xue Yue considered for a moment. "Could you destroy it permanently?"

"Easy."

"Then do it." She grinned. "Actually — no. Let him heal first. Then destroy it for real. Give him hope, then take it away. That's worse."

"Now that's cruel." He pinched her cheek approvingly.

She warmed to the idea, her eyes sparkling. "We should play along with his delusions too. Have Weiwei act mistreated. I'll pretend I was heartbroken by him and fled to your arms. He'll be torn up on both sides."

"I could play the villain," Qin Jiang offered. "Act rough with you two in front of him."

"But what about your image?"

"What image?"

"Didn't you just say you were 'refined, magnanimous, graceful, and dashing'?"

"..."

He kissed her cheek. "I'm a veteran actor, you know. After all this time together, have you figured out who I actually am?"

Her expression shifted to longing. She still didn't know his name — Weiwei and the others had carefully avoided using it around her. His identity was clearly significant, and she hadn't wanted to pry. But now he seemed ready to tell her.

She looked at him expectantly.

He ruffled her hair and smiled. "My name is Qin Jiang."

"Qin Jiang?" The color drained from her face.

Qin Jiang — the name everyone in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands knew. The lord of Huaxia. The true sovereign of all.

As Blood Tribe royalty, she'd heard of him, but she'd never imagined he'd be standing in front of her — as her lover. 'The lord of Huaxia... inside the Anti-Huaxia Alliance? Is he here as an undercover agent? Is this a game to him?'
