A desolate graveyard shrouded in spatial turbulence. Even a Great Emperor caught in those chaotic currents would be lucky to survive.

Yet deep within this lethal terrain sat a young man, suspended in midair above nine massive tombs. These were his nine previous lives—graves he had dug and filled himself.

The young man was Chen Changsheng.

After fleeing the Human Dao Sect, he had dragged his battered body to this burial ground of his first nine incarnations. Drawing on the power stored within those past lives, he'd finally healed his injuries completely. The ordeal had even pushed him further—a breakthrough born from the ashes of near-destruction. His Reincarnation Law was approaching completion. One final step remained: break through to Great Emperor, fuse with his nine previous selves, and the law would be fully mastered.

"Three months. At most three months."

Chen Changsheng opened his eyes, hatred saturating his voice. His gaze seemed to pierce through the void, fixing on a figure seared into his memory. "Qin Jiang. Wait for me."

But just then, his head snapped upward. The spatial turbulence around him had begun to churn violently. Chen Changsheng shot to his feet. A powerful aura was hurtling toward him.

Could it be Qin Jiang's people? Come to finish him off?

He drew a deep breath. The approaching aura was terrifyingly strong—definitely an immortal-path cultivator. And he was merely a Supreme. His brow furrowed, expression darkening. All he could do was hope the newcomer didn't harbor lethal intent. Otherwise, escape would be nearly impossible.

That hope died quickly. The intruder hadn't even breached the spatial turbulence yet, and Chen Changsheng could already feel an intense killing intent—directed squarely at him.

Then the turbulence rippled, and two figures appeared before him. One radiated the overwhelming aura of an immortal-path cultivator, eyes fixed on him with murderous focus. The other was... well.

Neither male nor female, face painted in ghoulish makeup, pinching the air with a dainty orchid hand gesture.

Chen Changsheng quickly averted his gaze. That one's weak cultivation was its own form of psychological attack.

"Chen Changsheng?" Chen Qi'er spoke up. The voice was thin and reedy, making Chen Changsheng shudder. No wonder an androgynous creature followed at this person's side—the master was cut from the same cloth.

None of that mattered, though. He studied Chen Qi'er with grim focus. This person knew his name and had come looking for him specifically. There was a very high chance Qin Jiang had sent them. His mind was already racing through escape plans.

Chen Qi'er was sizing him up in return. Seeing only a Supreme cultivator, a contemptuous smile crossed those features. "Looks like your training isn't quite finished. Too bad—you've run out of time. Come quietly and meet Qin Jiang. You might suffer less that way. Otherwise..."

Qin Jiang! Just as he'd feared!

But this person had called Qin Jiang by name directly, without a shred of deference. Not a subordinate, then—a friend, perhaps? Chen Changsheng filed that away, but regardless, going to see Qin Jiang was out of the question. He gave a cold snort. "You want to take me? Let's see if you've got what it takes."

"A mere Supreme dares resist?" Chen Qi'er scoffed. Were it not for the fact that this man was supposedly Qin Jiang's best friend, dealing with a Supreme wouldn't even be worth the effort.

Chen Changsheng's eyes narrowed. The other's contempt might be his only chance at survival. Beneath him, the nine tombs began to tremble, and nine distinct auras bloomed from their depths.

Chen Qi'er's expression shifted to surprise. The auras rising from below were each approaching Human Immortal level, and they were intertwined as if originating from a single source.

At the same moment, Chen Changsheng's own aura surged.

Then the nine tombs exploded.

Coffin lids flew open to reveal not corpses, but nine concentrated orbs of origin power. They erupted from their caskets and slammed into Chen Changsheng in rapid succession.

Under normal circumstances, he would have fused with these origin essences only after reaching Great Emperor. But survival took priority. He'd have to risk his body exploding to force the merger now.

The nine essences flooded into him, and his aura detonated upward. The Great Emperor bottleneck shattered instantly—but the raw power rampaging through his body was far more than he could absorb. His skin split, his flesh tore, blood spraying in all directions.

Watching this, Chen Qi'er blinked in confusion. The fight hadn't even started, and this man had already half-destroyed himself?

Half-destroyed or not, his aura was skyrocketing.

"AHHH!"

The excruciating pain ripped a scream from Chen Changsheng's throat, blood leaking from his eyes. He locked his gaze on Chen Qi'er. All that violent energy needed an outlet. With a roar, he hurled himself forward, unleashing a devastating wave of power.

Chen Qi'er raised one hand and flicked it casually.

Chen Changsheng went flying, his already crumbling body now a shattered ruin, drenched head to toe in his own blood.

Chen Qi'er frowned. At this rate, Chen Changsheng would die before they could deliver him to Qin Jiang for a proper reckoning. That wouldn't do—he needed to be alive for the torment.

A pulse of energy surged out, forcibly stabilizing Chen Changsheng's body.

Chen Changsheng blinked in surprise, then understood. This person needed to bring him to Qin Jiang alive. A cold smile crept onto his face, and he charged again.

This time, he didn't forget about Chen Wuming. That androgynous creature was pathetically weak but clearly important to the immortal-path cultivator. If the two were lovers, capturing Chen Wuming could be the leverage he needed to escape.

His attacks targeted Chen Qi'er while deliberately sending shockwaves toward Chen Wuming.

Chen Qi'er caught on immediately. Anger flashed in those eyes. No wonder this man and Qin Jiang were supposedly best friends—both fought just as dirty.

Forced to protect Chen Wuming, Chen Qi'er could still overwhelm Chen Changsheng, but the edge was dulled. Chen Changsheng fought and retreated simultaneously. Each blow battered him further, but the origin essences within kept repairing the damage.

He backed all the way to the edge of the spatial turbulence.

His eyes hardened.

He plunged straight in, unleashing all that chaotic power, sending the entire region of turbulence into a frenzy.

Chen Qi'er stopped short. The destabilized spatial currents were dangerous even for an immortal-path cultivator—and protecting Chen Wuming through that maelstrom was another matter entirely. A single stray ripple could kill the boy.

'Should've left this deadweight behind,' Chen Qi'er thought bitterly.

Inside the turbulence, Chen Changsheng fared no better. His barely stabilized body was tearing apart again as spatial forces ripped at his flesh. In many places, only bone remained.

A thin shroud of Reincarnation Law power wrapped around him, keeping him alive as he struggled through the chaos. He didn't dare hesitate—one desperate push to clear the turbulence, then find somewhere to hide...
