Long Yu emerged smiling, his gaze finding his name on the Record Stone, still shimmering with brilliant light.

Rank 99.

Barely into the top hundred, sure, but reaching this on his first attempt was already remarkable. Given another chance, he was confident he could break into the top 50.

Still, the Dragon Nest only stayed open for a month. Spending too much time in the Myriad Realms Tower would be counterproductive. He shook his head and turned to the Divine Dragon Empire crowd, expecting to see faces full of admiration.

Instead, every single one of them was still staring at the Record Stone.

'They must be stunned by my performance,' Long Yu thought, shaking his head with mild amusement. It was only rank 99—nothing difficult for a prince of his caliber.

Then the crowd erupted:

"She's at a hundred—she actually broke into the top hundred too!"

"She's still going! The Ninth Prince might..."

"Incredible! A girl who looks completely harmless has talent like this?"

Long Yu blinked. He spun toward the Record Stone. The glow around his name had already begun to fade, while another name was blazing with light. And his own name was trembling.

As if it were about to be knocked down a spot.

His expression froze. He'd just made the list and was already being overtaken?

Nearly everyone was watching the Record Stone with bated breath. Long Yu's name shuddered and swayed until, finally, the light went out entirely. He dropped from 99th to 100th.

"She really passed him!"

"How is she this strong?"

"Is this what true great-clan disciples look like?"

Those who'd silently mocked her earlier felt their cheeks burning.

Long Yu's face was even uglier. His fists clenched tight. This was supposed to be his moment of glory, and someone had stolen it right from under him.

"Qin Lian'er..." he murmured.

His gaze cut to Qin Jiang. He knew she was Qin Jiang's sister—he just hadn't expected this level of talent. For someone who'd been the center of attention his entire life, the jealousy stung.

'If I hadn't held back to save energy for the next few days, I wouldn't necessarily be worse than her!' he told himself.

He was about to leave when another chorus of gasps erupted. He whipped around instinctively. Everyone was still glued to the Record Stone. Long Yu's brow furrowed, his heart lurching—had he been bumped down again?

He looked. Sure enough, his name was shaking.

Someone was challenging his rank.

Every eye locked onto the stele. Long Yu's heart climbed into his throat. The trembling grew more and more violent until, at last, his dangling hope died completely.

He'd been knocked out of the top hundred.

The name now blazing in his former spot: Little Red.

Long Yu's mouth twitched. Little Red? Was that seriously not a maid's name?

Watching his name slide to 101st, utterly unremarkable among ten thousand entries, he felt his heart seize. Only the top hundred received any distinction. He'd assumed that once he'd clawed his way in—bumping someone out for rank 99—he'd hold the position for at least a century. Then he'd improve when the opportunity arose.

But how long had it been? Less than an hour, and he'd already been knocked down twice.

He almost felt like crying. This was just too cruel.

Taking a deep breath, Long Yu decided he wasn't leaving after all. He wanted to see just how far these two who'd surpassed him could go.

At these ranks, progress had slowed considerably. Qin Jiang told the rest of the women to enter the tower as well, though Liu Shuwan stayed at his side—with Fourth Ancestor and the others outside the Dragon Nest, she was Qin Jiang's protector in here.

About half an hour later, Little Red was the first to emerge, fluttering over to land on Qin Jiang's shoulder. "Hehe, rank 69! Am I awesome or what?"

Qin Jiang nodded. "Very impressive." He never stinted on praise for his people. He plucked Little Red from his shoulder and cradled her in his hands. "Your cultivation went up quite a bit?"

"Yep!" Little Red bobbed her head. "The energy in there is weird—it directly boosts cultivation. I even felt my bloodline improve a tiny bit."

"Your bloodline improved?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

Little Red nodded. Bloodline enhancement was nothing but good news for her.

Another hour or so passed. Ye Ling'er's, Chen Ningbing's, and the other women's names began appearing on the Record Stone, their ranks climbing steadily.

Then Qin Lian'er's name flared with dazzling light, and she stepped out of the Myriad Realms Tower.

Rank 23.

Seeing her result, Qin Lian'er nodded with satisfaction, then flickered to Qin Jiang's side.

The Divine Dragon Empire contingent was long past being shocked into speechlessness. Even Long Yu felt the same. Rank 23—he couldn't reach that if he tried his hardest.

"Big bro, I got even stronger!" Qin Lian'er beamed.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Rank 23—impressive, Lian'er!"

"And I wasn't even going all out!" She planted her hands on her hips. She hadn't used the Immortal Fire, relying purely on her base strength to reach 23rd. With the Immortal Fire, top ten would've been a certainty.

"But the people in there really are monsters," she added more seriously.

Inside the Myriad Realms Tower, each floor pitted you against a same-realm opponent of increasing strength. Defeating roughly twenty-plus such opponents earned you a spot in the top ten thousand. Beyond that, you fought simulated versions of the Record Stone's listed cultivators—virtual constructs modeled after their actual combat power.

At the top-hundred level, nearly every opponent was a freak of nature, each battle demanding considerable time. Fortunately, time flowed differently inside the tower—otherwise, reaching the top hundred would take weeks.

Past the top ten thousand, you could skip ranks, challenging opponents up to a hundred ranks above your current position each time. Without that option, fighting ten thousand consecutive battles would be unbearable.

Qin Lian'er had skipped ranks for most of the climb. Only within the top hundred did she take smaller jumps, fighting her way to 23rd before finally calling it quits.
