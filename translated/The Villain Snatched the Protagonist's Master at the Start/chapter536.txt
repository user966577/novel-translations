Li Yang's pupils contracted. He stared at the exquisite face before him in utter disbelief. What did she just say? She used to be a man? How was that possible?

Ye Xuan smiled at his stunned expression. "Surprise?"

Li Yang's brain short-circuited. Not only had his feelings been toyed with—they'd been toyed with by a man?

He drew a shaky breath and forced down the grief and fury churning inside him. "So... can I leave now?"

He wanted nothing more than to get away from this place of heartbreak. He'd find somewhere no one could see him, and cry until he couldn't cry anymore.

"Leave?" Ye Xuan scoffed. She returned to Qin Jiang's side and regarded Li Yang with cold detachment. "I'm afraid you won't be leaving."

"What do you mean?"

Li Yang frowned. Even now, he still hadn't sensed the danger. Among all the Children of Destiny Qin Jiang had dealt with, Li Yang's intelligence ranked dead last—dragging down the entire average.

Qin Jiang chuckled and turned his attention to the sword at Li Yang's waist—the Immortal King weapon. Inside it, three True Immortal remnant souls lingered. In the past, they might have posed a minor threat, but now? Mere True Immortals were nothing. He could destroy them with a snap of his fingers, let alone remnant souls.

Ye Xuan, following his gaze, sent a burst of energy at the sword, simultaneously knocking Li Yang to the ground again. The Chaos Sword trembled. Inside, the three remnant souls remained silent. They'd warned Li Yang countless times over the years, but blinded by Ye Xuan's charms, he'd refused to listen—even getting into screaming matches with them over her.

Eventually, they'd given up on him entirely. If not for the Chaos Sword's blood bond, they'd have fled long ago.

Now, Qin Jiang's gaze made their Primordial Spirits nearly seize up. They'd been discovered. And Ye Xuan's attack on the sword—perhaps they'd been known about from the very beginning.

The three remnant souls exchanged glances, faces grim.

"No point hiding. Come say your last goodbye to your disciple," Qin Jiang said lightly.

Li Yang's expression changed—only now did he recognize the danger. He clutched the Chaos Sword before him like a shield. But in the next moment, it shuddered, and three True Immortal remnant souls materialized in the courtyard.

"Masters..." Li Yang opened his mouth, face flushing with shame. All three had always looked out for him, but he'd repeatedly defied them for a woman. He'd disappointed them terribly.

The three remnant souls glanced at Li Yang and shook their heads. Then they turned to Qin Jiang and bowed. "We greet the Lord of Huaxia."

Rather polite, Qin Jiang noted with amusement. The three of them combined, paired with the Chaos Sword, might barely match a True Immortal. Not bad, actually.

After a moment's thought, he looked at Ye Xuan. "I've told you about that sword's origins. It's a decent treasure. Do you want it?"

Ye Xuan had proven herself—loyal and capable. Worth investing in. An Immortal King weapon would be useful to her.

But she shook her head. "I don't need it."

"No?"

"No."

"Suit yourself."

If Ye Xuan didn't want it, he'd feed it to Yun Bao's father. But first, these three remnant souls had to go.

He looked at them. They hadn't moved from their bows, clearly too terrified to straighten up. Plenty of survival instinct.

"Live or die?" he asked casually.

The three remnant souls exchanged looks, then glanced at Li Yang. They turned back to Qin Jiang with resolute faces and said in unison, "Live."

They'd given up on Li Yang completely. Hopeless—like trying to prop up mud on a wall.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. "Good. Kill Li Yang, and you live."

The three remnant souls trembled. They'd lost hope in him, true, but they'd been master and disciple for decades. Being asked to kill him with their own hands...

They turned to face Li Yang. Panic flooded his features. "Masters, I'm your disciple!"

Conflict flickered in their eyes. They all knew that Li Yang was dead regardless of what they did today. But to be the ones who killed him—that was soul-crushing.

Qin Jiang didn't rush them. He watched with interest—master slaying disciple was quite the drama.

After a long silence, one of the remnant souls spoke, voice trembling. "Disciple... don't blame us."

"Master!" Li Yang's heart lurched. He tried again, desperate. "Master, all these years of teacher and student—have you forgotten?"

"Teacher and student..." They paused, then smiled bitterly. "In your heart, that bond probably doesn't compare to a pretty face."

Li Yang faltered. He'd spent years lost in Ye Xuan's warmth, neglecting his masters entirely. Their bitterness was deserved—but he didn't want to die.

He clenched his fists and dropped to his knees. "Masters, it's all my fault. I deserve death. Kill me!"

"Alright."

"???"

His face went blank. They agreed just like that? Wasn't this the part where they were supposed to be moved by the bonds of mentorship, have a tearful heart-to-heart, forgive him, and then fight to the death to protect him?

This wasn't how the script was supposed to go.

Before he could find words, the three remnant souls advanced on him. The suffocating weight of mortal danger finally jolted him to full alertness. He scrambled to his feet and stumbled backward. "Masters, have you truly abandoned all regard for our bond?"
