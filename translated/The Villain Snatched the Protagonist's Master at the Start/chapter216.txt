Qin Family City.

Lian'er had been left behind, and after this long without seeing Qin Jiang, she was starting to feel a little glum. Still, the Qin Family City's territory was expanding constantly, growing larger by the day, which gave the little tyrant plenty of room to cause mischief. She'd wander around whenever she needed to clear her head.

Everyone in the city doted on the little demoness. No matter how much havoc she wreaked, there were people dedicated to cleaning up after her.

On this particular day, the young lady set out in grand fashion—a whole procession, an absurd number of guards flanking her. More lurked in the shadows, watching from concealment.

She barreled down the street with all the subtlety of a military parade. Passersby scrambled to make way. But one person didn't get the memo.

A blind man.

He was dressed like a beggar, a strip of black cloth tied over his eyes, and he held a long sword in one hand—though the blade was covered in rust. He stood squarely in the middle of the road, walking at his own unhurried pace. Bystanders called out warnings, but he ignored them all, plodding directly along Lian'er's path.

"Hmph, where'd this stinking beggar come from!" One of Lian'er's guards stepped forward, intending to shove him aside. But the man's body was like a mountain—completely immovable. The guard's expression darkened, and he applied force in earnest.

"Come back!" Lian'er called out sharply, her delicate brow creasing.

The guard froze, and though he looked reluctant, he shot the beggar one last glare before returning to her side.

"Fourth Ancestor!" Lian'er called.

The Fourth Ancestor materialized before her in an instant, his expression a touch weary. Previously, he'd been assigned to protect Qin Jiang. Now he'd been demoted to babysitting the little sister. The siblings both called him "Fourth Ancestor" with practiced ease—like summoning a family butler. He was a scholar, for heaven's sake. At this rate, he'd be a professional enforcer by year's end.

"Get rid of this stinking beggar," Lian'er said, pointing ahead.

The Fourth Ancestor looked over and frowned. Lian'er's guards had been handpicked—all of them skilled cultivators. The one who'd just tried was at the Supreme Realm. And he couldn't budge a beggar? His eyes narrowed. This beggar might be more than he appeared.

He was about to make his move when the beggar shifted, stepping calmly to the side.

The Fourth Ancestor: "..."

The guard from earlier bristled. What was this—bullying the weak and fearing the strong?

Onlookers whispered and snickered at the beggar's expense.

Lian'er studied the blind man with a slight frown. Something about him rubbed her the wrong way, but with her brother gone and only the Fourth Ancestor here, she felt a little less confident than usual. 'Fourth Ancestor, forget him,' she said. Without Qin Jiang, she had no real sense of security. In her eyes, only her brother could handle anything and everything. The Fourth Ancestor was good, but not quite good enough. Better not to pick unnecessary fights.

She was about to move on when something caught her eye—a tall, striking woman in the crowd, watching the scene with evident fascination.

Lian'er's eyes lit up. Her brother should be coming home soon. Shouldn't she prepare a gift?

Her eyes darted around, and she whispered a quick instruction to one of her guards before continuing her stroll. At some point, the guard she'd spoken to quietly disappeared.

This time, Lian'er didn't wander for long. She returned to the Qin estate before the hour was up. Her guard was already waiting, and beside her stood the woman Lian'er had spotted.

"Hehe, hello there, big sister!" Lian'er beamed, her face the very picture of innocent adorableness.

The woman returned a gentle smile. "Hello, little sister. You had someone bring me here—is there something you need?"

She studied Lian'er curiously. The sweet, cherubic smile was quite different from the domineering little empress she'd seen on the road.

Lian'er sauntered over and grabbed the woman's hand like they were old friends. "A pretty girl like you, all alone out there—it's dangerous! On the road, I saw how many people were eyeing you with bad intentions. That beggar, too—they're all bad people! I was worried about you, so I brought you here."

"That beggar?" The woman blinked. "If I remember correctly, he was blind..."

Lian'er: "..."

Right. He was blind.

She scratched her head, her face betraying not even a flicker of embarrassment. "Even though he's blind, I could see the evil in his heart!"

"Hehe, you're such a cute little thing." The woman chuckled softly. "Thank you for your concern, but don't worry about me. I'm not afraid of those smelly men. They come one at a time, I beat them one at a time. They come in groups, I beat them all!"

She said it with genuine confidence, utterly self-assured.

"My lady, this woman really is quite formidable," the guard murmured to Lian'er. When she'd found the woman, she'd been in the middle of thoroughly thrashing a man. That one backward glance alone had made the guard feel the woman could kill her effortlessly. She'd notified the ancestral elders before bringing the woman to Lian'er—only after receiving their assurance had she dared.

Hearing this, the clever Lian'er immediately realized this woman wouldn't be as easy to abduct as Bai Susu had been. Good thing she hadn't tried anything drastic.

"You're that strong?" Lian'er's expression didn't waver. She clasped the woman's hand tighter. "Then could you maybe protect me? I'll pay you!"

"Protect you?" The woman looked puzzled. "You have plenty of powerful people around you."

Her gaze swept the surroundings, and the Great Emperor elders hidden in the shadows stiffened slightly. Still, they weren't worried. Lian'er had been left here along with all of Qin Jiang's women, and Qin Jiang had naturally left ample defenses in place. If something went wrong, the protections here could withstand even an Immortal's assault for a time. Between Qin Jiang's preparations and the gathered elders, they were confident they could rescue Lian'er even if this woman suddenly turned hostile.

"My forces are still a little weak," Lian'er said, putting on a pitiful expression and swinging the woman's hand like a spoiled child. "Please, big sister? I'll give you lots and lots of payment!"

"I'm only here to sightsee," the woman said, hesitating. Payment didn't really interest her, but Lian'er's pouting was hard to refuse.

Lian'er's eyes sparkled. "We can go together! I know Qin Family City really well—I can show you around!"

"I was thinking of visiting other places too..."

"I can come along! I've only ever been to the Heavenly Pill Palace so far."

The woman's interest was piqued. "The Heavenly Pill Palace? I haven't been there yet! I only came down from the mountains a few months ago—I've been traveling the Western Regions this whole time. Is the Heavenly Pill Palace fun?"
