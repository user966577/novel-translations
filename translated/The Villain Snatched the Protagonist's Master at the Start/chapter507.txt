Wu Tian was seriously considering whether he should leave. Staying here might actually be more dangerous than taking his chances in the wilderness.

He'd even begun to suspect these two were deliberately messing with him. But that didn't make sense. He'd kept an extremely low profile and had no enemies to speak of. Even Huaxia wouldn't go after him... would they? True, he'd tried to rescue his sister, but he hadn't succeeded. Surely they didn't know his intentions.

Still, looking back on recent events, his luck had been atrocious. Because of Huaxia, the Wu family had cut off his resources. Huaxia itself refused to give him any. His attempt to rescue his sister had nearly gotten him killed. Then he'd run into those two cowards. And now these two, who seemed about as bright as a pair of bricks, kept burying him alive.

Wu Tian sighed. His luck had hit rock bottom. Even if he left, he'd probably just stumble into more misfortune.

In the end, looking at the father and daughter, he said wearily, "I'm fine. You don't need to take care of me. Just let me stay here for a while."

"Don't take care of you? But your injuries..."

"As long as you don't take care of me, I'll heal in no time!"

Wu Tian cut him off.

The middle-aged man hesitated, then reluctantly nodded. "All right, then."

Hearing that, the tension drained from Wu Tian's body. His head swam, and he passed out again.

The father and daughter looked at each other. The girl spoke first. "Daddy, are we really not going to take care of him?"

"How would we take care of him?"

"Bury him?"

"Forget it. If we bury him again, we'll actually kill him."

The man rolled his eyes, walked over, and nudged Wu Tian's limp body aside with a few well-placed kicks, muttering, "He's crushing the vegetables."

After tidying the garden to his satisfaction, he clapped his hands and turned around, about to say something—when his face went rigid.

Seeing his expression, the girl blinked. "What's wrong?"

"Be... behind you..."

The man raised a trembling finger, pointing past her shoulder, his voice quavering.

The girl startled and spun around.

A man and a woman stood directly behind her. When the man saw her turn, he smiled warmly and gave a little wave. "Hello."

"Um..."

The girl swallowed, staring at Qin Jiang, her cheeks flushing pink. "H-hello~"

'What a handsome man!'

Qin Jiang's face was all charm. He shot An Xihe a smug look. One greeting—that's all it took to enchant a beauty.

An Xihe rolled her eyes. 'The stat monster thinks he's actually skilled,' she thought. Anyone else and the girl wouldn't have given them the time of day.

Qin Jiang stepped forward, closing the distance. His smile was radiant. "Such a beautiful lady. Might I know your name?"

"I'm Yun Bao~"

"Yun Bao? Bao-bao. What a lovely name."

Qin Jiang's voice was pure honey.

Yun Bao's cheeks burned. Her little heart hammered in her chest. 'He called me Bao-bao!'

Behind her, the middle-aged man's face had gone very, very dark. But he didn't dare say a word. The pressure emanating from that woman was staggering—one look from her could snuff out his existence. Not even True Immortals radiated that kind of power. In all the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, only one person...

The Immortal King.

He stole a glance at An Xihe, then at Qin Jiang, and a terrible suspicion crystallized. His heart sank.

How had they attracted these two?

Though he'd lived in hiding, he kept abreast of the broader situation. These two were essentially the rulers of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. If they had designs on the pair of them, things looked grim indeed.

The man ducked his head and suppressed his aura, trying to shrink his presence as much as possible. But his daughter seemed thoroughly smitten.

His anxiety spiked. If his guess was correct, the man before him had a certain reputation—and his own daughter was, by any measure, a beauty. He didn't want her entangled with anyone. Humans were too dangerous—heartless, mercenary, rotten to the core.

"Bao-bao, I'd like to give you a gift. I'm sure you'll love it."

"A gift?"

"Mm-hm."

Qin Jiang smiled. With a flip of his palm, a shimmering, iridescent orb appeared. He held it out to Yun Bao. "Do you like it?"

"Wow!!!"

Yun Bao's eyes lit up. She lunged forward, grabbed the orb, and swallowed it whole.

The next instant, her face froze. She looked up at Qin Jiang, panic flickering in her eyes. 'Oh no. Did I just blow my cover?'

"I..."

She opened her mouth to explain, but no words came.

Qin Jiang chuckled and reached out, ruffling her hair. "Tasty?"

"Y-yes~"

Yun Bao nodded dumbly.

Qin Jiang flipped his palm again, producing another orb. But this time, Yun Bao didn't dare eat it. She turned to look at her father. The man's face had gone pale—he was fairly certain their identities had been exposed.

"Go on, eat. I'm not going to hurt you."

Qin Jiang held the orb to Yun Bao's lips. She opened her mouth reflexively and swallowed it down.

Then Qin Jiang tossed a handful of miscellaneous treasures to the middle-aged man.

"You..."

The man stared at Qin Jiang. "You know what we are?"

"Pixiu, obviously."

Qin Jiang grinned. "Pixiu—auspicious beasts born with fortune. They attract wealth and devour treasures, using them to strengthen themselves. That's precisely why Pixiu are difficult to keep—they can bankrupt an entire sect. But if you take a Pixiu's bones and forge them into a treasure..."

He let the implication hang in the air. "Well. Then it only attracts wealth, doesn't it?"

The man and Yun Bao both went pale, fear flooding their eyes.

Qin Jiang's gaze moved between them. The man clenched his jaw and stepped forward.

"If you want bones for a treasure, use mine! My cultivation is higher than Yun Bao's—the result would be better. Just please... leave her alone."

"Daddy..."

Yun Bao's voice trembled. She turned to Qin Jiang, her eyes pleading. "Please don't kill us. We can find treasures for you. We'll only eat a tiny bit—no, we don't have to eat any at all."
