The mountains outside the formation were in chaos—shouts echoing from every direction.

Chen Changsheng's face was dark. The Snake Race's numbers in these mountains were absurd. Every time he shook one group, he ran headlong into the next.

Left with no choice, he'd killed several of them, which only intensified the manhunt. In less than a day, he'd encountered over a hundred separate patrols, some led by Supreme-level fighters.

He didn't fear any individual Supreme, but getting bogged down in a brawl would draw more reinforcements. And the Snake Race had plenty of Great Emperors prowling these mountains—opponents he couldn't handle. So he kept running.

The frustration was suffocating. Aside from his earliest reincarnations, when his foundations had been thin, he'd been the one doing the crushing in every subsequent life. He hadn't expected the tenth life—on the cusp of his ultimate triumph—to be this humiliating.

"Snake Race!"

He ground his teeth, suppressing his aura to a whisper, and watched a Supreme-level fighter pass overhead. After a tense wait, he emerged—only for another alarm to ring out.

"He's here! Take him!"

"Damn it!"

He cursed and bolted again. The Snake Race's tracking capabilities in their own territory were terrifyingly effective. Every serpent in the mountains served as their eyes.

It was maddening.

Mid-flight, Chen Changsheng suddenly halted. His brow furrowed as he surveyed his surroundings.

"This area..."

He murmured, and his eyes began to gleam. "There's a formation here!"

Glancing behind him—no pursuit yet—he darted through the array, studying it as he moved. Its primary effect was disorientation. Anyone who wasn't well-versed in formations would wander in circles and exit without ever realizing they'd stepped into something unusual. Even getting this far required expertise.

Chen Changsheng wove through the formation, his excitement mounting. He was now virtually certain of its purpose: concealment, illusory misdirection, even spatial distortion.

A formation built to hide people.

Given that the Snake Race Empress's entire faction had vanished without a trace, and the empress herself had fled into these very mountains...

"Yu Lan is hiding right here!"

He was sure of it.

Meanwhile, outside the formation's perimeter, Snake Race soldiers watched in bewilderment as Chen Changsheng simply vanished.

"Where'd he go?"

A Supreme-level officer appeared. "The target?"

"Sir, he was right ahead—then he just... disappeared."

The officer frowned and chased in the direction indicated. Before the watching soldiers' baffled eyes, their commander walked in circles for an extended period before eventually wandering back to the starting point.

He scowled. "He really is gone?"

The rank-and-file exchanged confused glances. Someone spoke up cautiously. "Sir, just now, you... didn't actually move."

"What? I went everywhere—searched the whole area!"

But their unanimous stares told a different story. His expression hardened.

"I really didn't move?"

"You were walking in circles the whole time..."

The officer spun back toward the anomalous zone. He pointed at a soldier. "You. Go check."

"Yes, sir."

The man crept forward. At first, everything seemed normal—then he crossed some invisible threshold and began walking in tight circles, utterly oblivious.

Witnessing this, the officer's eyes lit up.

"Well, well. Lucky day indeed."

He immediately ordered his men to cordon off the area, then rushed to report. He alone couldn't handle the Snake Race Empress's faction.

Inside the formation's outer layer, Chen Changsheng set to work dismantling the arrays. His expertise in formation craft was considerable.

"Emperor-grade. Impressive. But not enough to stop me."

A confident smirk. Array after array crumbled under his hands. The formation flickered, showing unmistakable signs of damage.

He had no concern about Yu Lan's reaction. He had trump cards—the means to extract her people and fight their way out. In his view, hiding was defeatist. Better to break free and challenge the rival bloodline directly. With his help, victory was assured. Even if Yu Lan's faction took losses, the outcome would be worth it.

So he felt no guilt about tearing down her sanctuary.

Inside the formation, every member of Yu Lan's faction felt the tremors. Faces fell as the implications sank in.

"Someone's breaking the formation!"

"Is it the Black Water Serpent faction?"

"How did they find us? There's no one in the Snake Race who knows formations—even Great Emperors shouldn't be able to detect this place!"

"What do we do?"

"Report to the empress first. And remember—we have two Immortals on our side. Even if they've found us, we can fight."

"Right, the empress and Lady Yu Ru are both close to that man. The Immortals will surely help."

The vibrations reached Yu Lan and Yu Ru as well. The sisters had spent the whole night talking and come to terms with much. Feeling the formation shudder, they emerged from their room, exchanging a grave look.

At the same time, Qin Jiang stepped out, brow furrowed.

Had the Black Water Serpent faction found them already?

Beside him, Mo Mo was positively seething. Qin Jiang hadn't come to her room until the small hours, and they'd barely had two hours together before this...

She gnashed her teeth. "Whoever's responsible for ruining my evening—I will skin them alive!"

Mo Mo's fury was palpable.
