"The Ice Phoenix Spirit — mastered."

Li Qingqiu spoke to herself as she rose from the ice phoenix's back. With a flick of her wrist, the phoenix cried out once and dissolved into a stream of light that flowed back into her body. Her gaze flickered briefly toward the Li ancestor and the others below before she vanished.

The Li family elders beamed with delight. "That was the Ice Phoenix Spirit from the Ice Divine Art! Qingqiu actually mastered it — her power must have grown tremendously."

"Ha ha, Qingqiu's talent is the finest our Li family has seen in a million years."

"She truly is our heir. Someday, she'll lead the Li family to even greater heights!"

They chattered excitedly, lavishing praise without restraint. Only the Li ancestor looked pained. A commotion that large — Qin Jiang couldn't possibly have missed it. And he already had his eye on her.

Seeing the elders' enthusiasm, irritation flared in his chest. He waved them off. "What are you so happy about? A minor improvement and you act like she's ascended to godhood! Get out — all of you! Go carry out my orders, and if there's a single mistake, I'll hold every one of you accountable!"

The elders' smiles died. None dared argue with the old patriarch. They scattered with awkward murmurs. Sighing, the Li ancestor headed for Li Qingqiu's quarters.

Meanwhile, in a secluded courtyard on the family's outskirts, a hard-faced young man watched Li Qingqiu's silhouette vanish from the sky. Longing and admiration swirled in his gaze.

"Cousin Qingqiu's gotten even stronger."

He was a Li family member — not of the main line, but still respectably placed. His talent, however... at thirty years old with only a Golden Body Realm cultivation, he was considered worthless. Not just by clan standards — even by the Ten Lands', that was abysmal.

After burning through considerable resources with nothing to show for it, the family had cut their losses and abandoned him. But Li Yang believed in perseverance. He'd never stopped training, day after day. Progress was glacial — but it was progress.

"If only I had half of Cousin Qingqiu's talent," he sighed. "With my work ethic, I'd be just as strong."

The sword at his waist trembled. It was a dull, unremarkable thing — dusty gray, easily overlooked. But only Li Yang knew its secret: three old monsters lived inside.

"Hey, kid! You're selling yourself short again. We've told you — your talent is absolutely no less than that Frost Divine Body girl's!"

"That's right! We can't identify your exact physique, but you can absorb Chaos Qi and unseal the Chaos Sword. That alone proves you're extraordinary."

"And don't forget — you're only Golden Body, but your raw strength rivals the Divine Ability Realm. Li Yang, you are a once-in-an-eternity genius!"

Three voices echoed in his mind from the sword. Li Yang managed only a wan smile. He wanted to believe them, but his cultivation speed told a different story. As for his strength — yes, he'd been born with monstrous power, far beyond normal even as a child. It had earned him early attention and heavy investment, but when his cultivation refused to keep pace, the family wrote him off. All those resources, wasted. From that point on, his peers never let him forget it. Mockery, scorn, petty cruelties — a daily diet.

But there was one person who was different. Li Qingqiu. She looked down on him, certainly — but she looked down on everyone equally. That was the only fairness Li Yang had ever known.

To him, she was a goddess. The only one worth caring about. Part of why he'd never given up was because of her. Someday, he wanted to be someone she'd actually notice. Someone she might respect.

The thought brought a smile to his face and steel to his resolve. He reached toward the direction where Li Qingqiu had stood, closed his fist around empty air, brought it to his nose, and inhaled deeply — as if he'd captured the air around her.

It was, admittedly, a little creepy.

"Oi, kid! What are you doing, acting like some stalker? If you like the girl, go chase her! Sniffing air — you're really something else..."

Li Yang flushed, rubbing the back of his head with an embarrassed laugh. "You know how she is, elders. Cousin Qingqiu is so proud — she probably wouldn't even glance in my direction. She might not even know I exist..."

His expression dimmed, but he rallied quickly. "Besides, you always say I'm a once-in-an-eternity genius. Maybe one day I'll have a sudden breakthrough and blow her away. Then I'll finally be someone special in her eyes."

"You are a genius."

"And a simp."

"No, no — he hasn't even managed to simp yet. You have to be noticed to qualify. He doesn't even meet the minimum requirements."

Li Yang took it in stride. His mental fortitude had been forged through years of abuse — nothing could shake him. Without another word, he lifted his gaze to where Li Qingqiu had lingered, staring with an infatuated smile.

"Alright, enough with the lovesick puppy act! Time to train!"

Eventually, the sword spirits jolted him back. Li Yang tore his eyes away reluctantly and retreated to his room. Before starting, he clenched his fist and whispered his daily affirmation: "Li Yang — you *will* make Cousin Qingqiu notice you!"

The three old monsters sighed in unison. The kid talked about hard work, but half his day was spent daydreaming. If they weren't absolutely certain he was a once-in-an-eternity talent, they'd have taken the Chaos Sword and left long ago.
