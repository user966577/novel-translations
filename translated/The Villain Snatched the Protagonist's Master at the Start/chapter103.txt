"Collect!"

Qin Jiang gritted his teeth. Just thinking about Ye Xuan made him shudder. Still, the man had his uses—revolting as he was, Ye Xuan made for a perfect punishment detail. See someone you don't like? Tie them up and toss them to Ye Xuan for the full physical-and-psychological double feature.

【Collection successful. Fortune will be transferred to the Qin family. The Host may allocate fortune distribution.】

He could allocate it too? That meant if he concentrated all the fortune on one person, he could essentially manufacture a Child of Destiny. Could he then farm rewards from his own creation?

While he was mulling this over, the system chimed in: 【Bug exploitation is prohibited.】

So much for that idea. Without the ability to exploit the loop, there was no point in creating a new Child of Destiny.

Qin Lian'er tugged on his arm. "Brother, stop spacing out."

Qin Jiang pulled his awareness from the system, a satisfied smile on his face. This had been quite the haul.

"Let's go. We're heading home."

"Home?" Qin Lian'er blinked, disappointed. She hadn't had her fill of adventure yet.

"Things on the Heavenly Mystery Continent are about to get turbulent. We'll head home first, and once everything settles down, I'll bring you out again."

"Fine."

Meanwhile, back in the Qin Domain, countless people stood gaping at the sky. An entire mountain range—stretching over thirty miles—was flying overhead. Fourth Ancestor had carried Thousand Year Mountain through the air for an entire night, covering the vast distance from the ruins site to Qin territory. Naturally, the spectacle caused a sensation everywhere along the route.

"So that's really Thousand Year Mountain? I heard the Qin family's Fourth Ancestor ripped it straight out of the ground and carried it home. It's actually true!"

"I never imagined I'd see Thousand Year Mountain from my own doorstep."

"We're talking hundreds of thousands of miles away, and here it is right above our heads."

"Once Fourth Ancestor sets it down, Thousand Year Mountain becomes our local mountain! I heard it's covered in rare spiritual herbs. Think we'll get a chance to go up there?"

"Forget the mountain—what matters is the Great Emperor Ruins on top of it!"

"We're all people of the Qin Domain. Technically, we're under the Qin family's wing. Maybe we can get some scraps."

The chatter was endless as people watched the enormous mountain drift toward the Qin family estate.

The Qin family's powerhouses had received word in advance. Once Thousand Year Mountain entered the Qin Domain, a dozen Supreme Realm ancestors rose into the air and flew beneath the mountain to help carry it alongside Fourth Ancestor.

Even they felt surreal about the situation. Never in their lives had they imagined carrying an entire mountain through the sky.

Soon they arrived at the Qin family compound. First Ancestor and the other senior elders were waiting.

Seeing Thousand Year Mountain, their faces twitched. "Fourth Brother, you actually carried the whole thing back."

They'd assumed he would just bring back the treasures inside the ruins. Instead, he'd hauled back the entire mountain range.

Fourth Ancestor supported the mountain with one hand and flashed a grin. "Xiao Jiang told me to. Now hurry up and find me a place to put this thing—holding it up is getting tiring."

Looking at the thirty-mile mountain range, the others were at a loss. Where exactly were they supposed to put something this massive? Under Fourth Ancestor's nagging, they eventually leveled another mountain nearby and set Thousand Year Mountain in its place. The Great Emperor Ruins within had already opened, though First Ancestor and the other senior elders showed little interest. They planned to save it as a training ground for the younger generation.

First Ancestor turned to Fourth Ancestor. "Why did Xiao Jiang want you to lug this thing home?"

"To provoke everyone, obviously." Fourth Ancestor shrugged.

The others paused, then frowned. "Xiao Jiang wants to start a war?"

"Probably." Fourth Ancestor nodded, excitement flickering across his face. "Plenty of ancient clans were there when I took the mountain. I'm sure we've thoroughly pissed them off. They won't dare act openly, but they'll definitely be scheming in secret. When the time comes—we crush them all! Total continental domination!"

The idea stirred something in the other ancestors, though First Ancestor remained cautious. "The ancient clans aren't weak. We'd win, but the losses wouldn't be small..."

"Oh right, forgot to mention—Xiao Jiang also has nine Great Emperor Laws."

Fourth Ancestor dropped this casually, watching their reactions with relish. The shock on their faces was deeply satisfying.

It took a long moment for them to recover. "What did you just say?"

"Great Emperor Laws."

"How many?"

"Nine!"

Another stunned silence. Then their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw wild joy. Nine Great Emperor Laws meant nine new Great Emperors!

What was there to fear? If anyone dared move against the Qin family, over a dozen Great Emperors would descend on them—one palm strike each and every enemy would be paste.

Losses? What losses?

"Ha! It seems the Qin family was destined to rule the Heavenly Mystery Continent!"

"Where's Xiao Jiang? When's he coming back?"

"Should we go meet him on the way?"

"Good idea."

"Better safe than sorry."

And so, a parade of ancestral elders set off in grand formation toward Qin Jiang's location.

At that moment, Qin Jiang was taking his sweet time on the journey home. When the scenery was nice, he'd stop to enjoy it. No rush. A leisurely return trip, taking in the sights—not bad at all.

His leisure lasted less than half a day before a wall of ancestral elders materialized in front of the Void Beast.

Qin Jiang stepped out of the traveling palace and stared at the assembly. "What the—are you guys going to war?"

Every single Qin family ancestor was present—enough firepower to take on the entire continent. Had some other ancient clan produced a Great Emperor?

Before he could finish the thought, the ancestral elders swarmed him with beaming faces.

"Xiao Jiang! Your old ancestors came specially to escort you home."

"It's dangerous out here all alone. We're here to bring you back safely."

"You've been away for over a month! We've missed you terribly."

Qin Jiang saw right through them. Nearly all of the half-Emperor ancestors had showed up. He swept his arm, and ten Great Emperor Laws materialized around him—the original nine plus one extracted from Lin Chen via the Myriad Dao Stone.

At the sight of the laws, every ancestor's eyes went red.

"So many!"

"Wait—ten? Wasn't it supposed to be nine?"

"An extra one? Does Xiao Jiang generate Great Emperor Laws? Like some kind of Great Emperor Law factory..."

Qin Jiang's face darkened at that last remark. You're the factory. Your whole family is a factory!

"Ten Great Emperor Laws, but we don't have enough half-Emperors." He scanned the crowd—only seven half-Emperors remained. While Supreme Realm cultivators could absorb a Great Emperor Law, their advancement would be significantly slower.
