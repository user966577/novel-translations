"Little Jiang," the two Fox Race elders said, already addressing him with familiar warmth. In their eyes, Qin Jiang was nothing less than a fine son-in-law. "That old Black Serpent claims you have a treasure that can help Immortals advance. Is it true?"

"Hmm?" So that was how the Black Serpent Ancestor had rounded up five Immortals. Qin Jiang had assumed the old snake was simply well-connected, but it turned out he'd been selling fantasies. He rolled his eyes. "You got played. If I had something like that, I'd have used it already." He gestured at Jian Yao and the others.

Then, with a sly grin, he added: "I don't have a treasure that helps Immortals advance. But I do have one that sends them into reincarnation."

"Reincarnation?"

"Sure. Kill an Immortal and they get reincarnated, right?" He shrugged with a laugh.

The Fox Race elders stiffened. They didn't think he was bluffing—there was, after all, ample precedent.

Their conversation hadn't been concealed. The Black Serpent Ancestor and his two remaining allies heard every word.

"Black Serpent, care to explain?" one of them said coldly.

The Ancestor's face darkened. "You believe him? If he really had such a treasure, would he announce it?"

The two Immortals paused. He had a point.

"My Black Water Serpent clan was practically annihilated gathering this intelligence," the Ancestor pressed, glancing at the ruins of his former territory with a twitch of his lip. Well, it really was destroyed.

His companions looked at the devastation and found their trust in him inching upward. But even if the treasure was real, what could they do? Six Immortals stood across from them. There was no opportunity to seize anything now, and retaliation afterward was all but guaranteed—especially with the uncertainty surrounding Qin Jiang's Immortal-slaying capability.

One of them gave Qin Jiang a hopeful look. "Ahem, Little Jiang—is there any chance we're family too?"

Qin Jiang: "???"

'Since when does everyone get to call me by my first name?'

He glanced at Jian Yao and the others. They understood instantly. Four Immortals stepped forward, their combined auras crashing toward the enemy like a tidal wave. Hu Xian'er looked at the two Fox Race elders; they exchanged a glance and released their own pressure in concert.

The Black Serpent Ancestor and his two allies went rigid.

"Watch yourselves—that old Black Serpent specializes in poison," one of the Fox Race elders warned.

Poison? Qin Jiang scoffed inwardly. His Immaculate Divine Body was immune to all toxins, and his Taotie Divine Body could devour poison outright. Yu Lan's bloodline poison had been literally eaten by Qin Jiang — and instead of harming him, it had strengthened him.

"Poison? Child's play," Mo Mo said dismissively.

For a demon of her caliber, poison was the lowest of concerns. Jian Yao, Xue Mei, and Yan Shiya were equally unconcerned. Generally speaking, cultivators who relied on poison tended to be weaker in direct combat. And even if someone did get poisoned through trickery, Qin Jiang could fix it. The man was immune to toxins.

As the two sides faced off, Qin Jiang quietly readied the Immortal King Seal. The Black Serpent Ancestor had to die.

'A Human Immortal should take about three to five percent of the seal's power,' he mused. The Ghost Immortal had been somewhat wasteful; the Black Serpent Ancestor seemed stronger.

'Better go with five percent. Don't want to leave him alive.'

While Qin Jiang calculated, Jian Yao—never one for patience—had already launched a sword strike. Combat erupted instantly. Jian Yao, Mo Mo, and Xue Mei took the offensive, while Yan Shiya vanished, her presence disappearing entirely. None of the opposing Immortals could detect her, but the Black Serpent Ancestor's group felt a persistent, prickling threat at their backs that prevented them from fighting at full strength.

The two Fox Race elders participated, but only in a supporting role, hovering at the edges like sentinels.

Qin Jiang and the rest retreated to a safe distance. The shockwaves from Immortal combat were devastating. The entire Black Water Serpent territory was engulfed in collateral damage; few of its inhabitants would survive.

The Black Serpent Ancestor's face twisted. He tried to take the fight skyward to spare his clan, but alone, he couldn't break free. The Black Water Serpent clan was finished.

His two allies were being steadily pushed back and clearly weren't fighting with full commitment. They were looking for an opening to flee. Outnumbered as they were, a determined escape was hard to prevent.

Qin Jiang knew this. The Immortal King Seal was already primed. The moment the opportunity arose, he'd lock onto the Black Serpent Ancestor. The Myriad Dao Stone was ready as well. Once the Ancestor fell, Qin Jiang would immediately extract his law.

It should be the Poison Dao Law.

In the thick of battle, Jian Yao and Mo Mo exchanged a knowing glance. They knew Qin Jiang had the means to slay Immortals, but the battlefield was too crowded—friendly fire was a real risk. Working in concert, they gradually isolated the Black Serpent Ancestor from his allies.

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. His wives really did come through.

At that precise moment, Yan Shiya materialized and drove her sword at the Ancestor. Caught off guard, he had no time to dodge. He roared and took the blow head-on, the impact knocking him clear of the battlefield.

And then—

Every Immortal present felt their bodies lock up for a split second, an overwhelming sense of mortal danger flooding their hearts.

Jian Yao and Mo Mo had experienced this before. They reacted instantly, flashing away from the Black Serpent Ancestor. While the other two enemy Immortals were still reeling from shock, the pair struck at them, seizing the opening.

"No!" the Black Serpent Ancestor shrieked, his horrified voice shaking heaven and earth.

Frozen in place, an incomparable force bore down on him. He could feel death's breath on his neck.

With a desperate roar, he reverted to his true form — a colossal black serpent, hundreds of feet long. Gleaming scales rippled with power. He spewed waves of toxic mist, layering it over his body as a shield.

But he faced the Immortal King Seal.

This power could slay Immortal Kings, let alone a mere Human Immortal.

His defenses shattered one by one. In a single devastating instant, the seal erased him from existence.

His enormous corpse remained intact, crashing to the earth and smashing what little was left of the Black Water Serpent territory into rubble. His eyes held no light—only the terror of his final moment.

Every Immortal present broke out in a cold sweat. An Immortal had fallen.

Qin Jiang's weapon was still functional.

"Run!" The two Immortals the Black Serpent Ancestor had recruited didn't hesitate for even a heartbeat. They threw everything they had into a desperate retreat.

They'd seen Qin Jiang's gaze turning their way. The specter of death seemed to be reaching for them.
