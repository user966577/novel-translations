The Fourth Patron scratched his head. In the end, all he could promise was a few extra spots—letting everyone in was absolutely out of the question.

Of course, Qin Jiang had never actually intended to bring everyone. The negotiation tactic was simple: if you want them to open a window, start by asking them to knock down a wall. Give the other side room to feel like they'd bargained you down.

Besides, he knew the Dragon Nest well. From the spoilers, he'd already learned that one of the Ninth Prince's greatest fortunes came from within it. This time, naturally, he intended to snatch it first. Bringing more people meant being prepared for anything. And the Dragon Nest truly did hold considerable opportunities—enough to give everyone a boost.

Over the next five days, Qin Jiang shuttled between the Third Princess's mansion and the airship. In his spare time, he began teaching Xia Qianling to cultivate.

She'd started late, but her talent was genuinely impressive—fortune heroines didn't earn their title for nothing. Moreover, she possessed a special physique: the Mystic Yin Body.

In certain respects, it was even more sought-after than a Divine Body. For instance, simply being with Xia Qianling caused Qin Jiang's cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds—all the way to the Unity Realm. And that was without even activating his Divine Body. He'd even deliberately suppressed his progress.

Xia Qianling didn't come away empty-handed either. After awakening the Mystic Yin Body, her qi and blood surged to nearly ten thousand. The system also produced rewards, one of which was tailor-made for her: the Mystic Yin Divine Scripture—the perfect cultivation method for the Mystic Yin Body.

Just like that, five days flew by.

The day the Dragon Nest opened, Qin Jiang led his entourage of women into the imperial palace. They drew plenty of stares along the way, but no one dared look too long. Qin Jiang's face had spread far beyond noble circles—ever since the Ninth Prince's grandmother had been executed, his likeness had been circulating among the common folk.

Inside the palace, attendants were already waiting. The moment they spotted Qin Jiang, they hurried over and carefully escorted the group toward the throne hall.

The hall was already bustling. Princes, princesses, and children of the nobility stood gathered inside. They glanced at Qin Jiang once and quickly averted their eyes.

The Dragon Emperor sat on his throne, and when he saw the crowd of women flanking Qin Jiang, his mouth twitched. That was... quite a few people.

In Qin Jiang's view, it wasn't that many. At least he hadn't brought the 360 Songstresses—the Dragon Nest would be useless for them, so they'd stayed on the airship. Apart from the Songstresses, every other woman was here. Plus a few guards to handle the grunt work. All told, not even a hundred people.

Perfectly reasonable, in his opinion. After all, the Dragon Nest could hold over ten thousand entrants. The combined retinues of all the princes and princesses outnumbered his group anyway.

The Dragon Emperor took a deep breath. He'd anticipated this and found nothing unacceptable.

The First Patron and the others approached to exchange pleasantries with Qin Jiang, but seeing he had no interest in chatting, they tactfully withdrew.

Liu Shuwan leaned close to whisper, "Are you sure I can enter too?" Most secret realms had cultivation restrictions. As a Great Emperor, Liu Shuwan would normally be barred from entering. Forcing her way in would cause irreversible damage to the realm.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Of course. The Dragon Nest doesn't restrict cultivation level—it only limits each person to a single entry."

No cultivation cap, just a one-time-only rule.

They didn't wait long. The Dragon Emperor surveyed the room briefly, not bothering to check whether everyone had arrived, and stood. "In a moment, I will open the Dragon Nest. Enter directly once the passage forms. But be warned—the Dragon Nest remains open for only one month. You must return within that time, or you will never be able to leave."

Short and to the point. Everyone here already knew the basics; the Dragon Emperor didn't need to elaborate.

With that, his aura exploded outward. A vortex appeared above the hall. Then the Dragon Emperor pressed two fingers together like a blade and slashed his own palm. Blood sprayed forth, splashing across the vortex and stabilizing it instantly. It began to morph into a gateway.

He retracted his aura and exhaled. "It's open. You may enter."

The crowd stirred with eagerness, but no one moved first. One couldn't steal the spotlight from the hosts. The princes and princesses should enter first, and among them, the most prominent was naturally the Ninth Prince. But at that moment, the Ninth Prince was staring at Qin Jiang.

His grandmother was dead. Because of Qin Jiang. But he had no power to take revenge. The Ninth Prince stood expressionless, rooted in place. With Qin Jiang here, he wasn't the main character.

Seeing everyone's gaze chain—the crowd watching the Ninth Prince, the Ninth Prince watching him—Qin Jiang found it somewhat absurd, as if he'd personally wronged every one of them.

"We'll go first."

He stepped forward and was the first to enter the vortex, vanishing from the hall. His women followed one by one, with Liu Shuwan bringing up the rear. Only after she'd passed through did the Ninth Prince finally begin walking toward the gateway. The rest followed suit.

Inside the Dragon Nest, space trembled as figures materialized—Qin Jiang and his group. No one had been separated; everyone arrived at the same location. After Liu Shuwan entered, the Ninth Prince and the others appeared in succession. They spared Qin Jiang a single glance before scattering, unwilling to linger.

Qin Jiang was still surveying the Dragon Nest. Fog hung everywhere, cutting visibility down sharply—even at the Unity Realm, he could only see a few thousand feet. The landscape looked barren and lifeless.

Every woman looked to Qin Jiang. Naturally, none of them would split off. Where he went, they followed.

"Let's go. Just wander for now." Qin Jiang smiled.

Long Xin'er spoke up. "I know the Dragon Nest fairly well. Why don't I lead?"

"Sure."

Qin Jiang nodded. The Dragon Nest had several fixed fortune sites that Long Xin'er probably knew better than he did. The real prize, of course, was the Dragon Nest's greatest treasure. Everything else was secondary—he'd brought the women along specifically for those fixed locations, where they could get a modest boost.

So it didn't matter whether he led or Long Xin'er did.

She guided the group toward the first site, explaining as they walked: "Up ahead there's a tower called the Myriad Realms Tower. Climbing it directly grants cultivation. The higher you climb, the more you gain. And the cultivation it provides won't damage your foundation—it actually makes it more stable."
