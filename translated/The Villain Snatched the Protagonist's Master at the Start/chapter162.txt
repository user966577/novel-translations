The Heavenly Pill Palace. The Pill Emperor's courtyard.

Behind a firmly shut door, Lian'er sat on her bed clutching a jade vial. She whispered to the flickering flame hovering before her: "Immortal Fire, will this stuff really knock out my brother?"

A full month of work with the Immortal Fire, and she'd finally produced the knockout drug.

Still, doubts lingered.

The Immortal Fire trembled faintly, communicating through consciousness: "Absolutely!"

To be fair, Lian'er had tested a tiny amount on herself. Just a pinch of powder had nearly put her under—she'd been groggy for half a day.

She licked her lips, then a serious problem occurred to her. "Uh... after big bro gets knocked out, will he still be... you know... functional?"

The Immortal Fire paused. That was a factor it had overlooked.

After a moment's hesitation: "Maybe... we add a little something extra."

"Like what?"

"Get some Passion Bloom, Desire Grass, Mirage Fruit..."

The names made Lian'er blink—then she immediately understood what kind of "extra ingredient" the Immortal Fire had in mind.

The next day.

Lian'er found Qin Jiang and latched onto his arm with a beaming smile. "Big bro~ Come hang out with me!"

"Done with alchemy already?" Qin Jiang asked, surprised.

Lian'er had always been energetic, but for the past month she'd been a recluse—locked in her room, only venturing out occasionally to "buy ingredients." He'd been half-worried she'd make herself sick.

She shook her head. "All work and no play, you know? Come on, big bro. Please~"

"Sure." He smiled. He genuinely preferred seeing Lian'er happy and carefree rather than grinding away at cultivation.

"Want to bring the girls along?"

Lian'er puffed her cheeks and shook her head, her voice carrying a touch of genuine hurt. "No way. If they come, you'll just pay attention to them. Just the two of us. You haven't spent one-on-one time with me in forever~"

She swayed his arm back and forth, her face a portrait of wounded adorableness.

That was all it took. Qin Jiang caved immediately, ruffling her hair. "Alright, alright. Just us."

A smile broke across her face.

They left the Heavenly Pill Palace together, Lian'er chattering nonstop as she dragged him through the streets. Qin Jiang felt a pang of guilt—it really had been too long since he'd spent quality time with her.

"Bro, I actually bought a little courtyard nearby. Wanna see it?"

"A courtyard?" That was unexpected.

"Yep!" She nodded brightly. "A really cute one. Whenever I hit a wall with alchemy this past month, I'd go there to unwind."

"Sure, let's take a look."

He followed her through a winding maze of back alleys until they reached a secluded courtyard in a quiet corner of the city. Qin Jiang's brow creased slightly.

Something about this place felt off.

He glanced at Lian'er. The hand gripping his arm had tightened just a fraction, as if she was nervous. And her eyes held a spark of... excitement?

'What is she up to?'

He kept his suspicions to himself.

"This is it, big bro!" Lian'er announced happily. She pulled him forward and pushed the door open—

BOOM!

An explosion detonated, and a tidal wave of powder engulfed them both.
