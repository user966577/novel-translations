"Done!" Mo Mo stood, complexion pale but smile radiant. It had been a while since she'd killed so satisfyingly.

Qin Jiang walked over and fed her a pill. Color returned to her cheeks. "Got them all?"

She grinned. "Everyone in Grey Cloud Heaven is dead. A few Zhao descendants were outside the realm, but they won't escape either. I poured enough power into the curse to keep hunting until it's spent. Every last drop of Zhao blood will be wiped clean."

Qin Jiang nodded, taking her hand. "Had your fill this time?"

"Hehe, this was just settling that crazy swordswoman's grudge. My own enemies are still waiting." Mo Mo giggled.

Nearby, the Li family ancestor hadn't dared leave. Overhearing their exchange sent chills down his spine. A true demon — and she'd used some blood technique to exterminate the entire Zhao bloodline. Not a single drop left alive.

He took a steadying breath and genuinely began to consider whether joining Huaxia might be the wise choice. At least it beat extinction. Besides, Huaxia's ambition was obvious to anyone with eyes. If not for being newly established — still building its foundation, and with Azure Cloud Heaven freshly battered — they'd likely have launched wars of conquest already. Regardless, the faction was ascendant: thriving and growing at terrifying speed. Sooner or later, they would come for the remaining realms. And when they did, the negotiating terms would be far less generous.

Still, it was hard to accept. The Li family had ruled as hegemons for ages. Bending the knee felt like a bitter pill. The old man's eyes flickered with indecision. In front of Qin Jiang's group, he'd already debased himself to the extreme. It was miserable — but it was survival. Once they left, he could go right back to being a king. Joining Huaxia, on the other hand, meant permanent subordination — though it came with permanent safety.

Status versus security. Which to choose?

While he agonized, Qin Jiang glanced over with a smile. "Your surname is Li, right?"

"..."

"Ha ha, Old Li, looks like your family's doing pretty well for itself. You wouldn't mind me bumming a few meals here, would you?"

Without waiting for an answer, Qin Jiang waved the women along and headed straight for the Li compound. The old man hurried after him. "Manor Lord, what are you—"

"Tired from all the killing. We'll rest here a few days. Get some rooms ready, would you?"

"..."

The Li ancestor's mouth twitched. Treating his ancestral home like an inn? Without even paying? But what could he do — throw out an Immortal King? He swallowed his pride and nodded. "In that case, the Li family will extend our fullest hospitality. Manor Lord, please follow me."

No other Li family members appeared. The moment the ancestor had recognized Qin Jiang's group, he'd sent a transmission ordering every disciple to stay indoors and cause no trouble. He dreaded some hot-headed youngster accidentally offending their guests.

But now they were actually inside the compound. All he could do was pray no one did anything foolish. He didn't want the Li family to share the Zhao family's fate.

He led them to a secluded courtyard reserved for honored guests. After settling everyone in, he was about to leave when Qin Jiang spoke.

"Your family has an heir — quite talented, I hear."

While Mo Mo had been performing the Bloodline Curse, he'd checked the system's spoiler. The Child of Destiny was indeed a Li family member, and the Sword Sect's so-called "Immortal King secret treasure" was in their possession.

The Li ancestor's face shifted. Qin Jiang had a reputation — a very loud one, even endorsed by the Grand Sovereign himself. Pervert. Colossal pervert.

And their heir happened to be a woman. A stunningly beautiful woman. Countless young prodigies across Grey Cloud Heaven had pined for her, but the girl's standards were impossibly high, her temperament even colder. She barely acknowledged her own family, let alone outsiders — a perpetual ice queen. You could say ten sentences and be lucky to get a nod.

Yet her talent was beyond question. The Li family treated her as a treasure.

Had the great pervert set his sights on her?

The old man's face stiffened. This was terrible. On one hand, he couldn't bear to watch his precious heir get carried off by some pig — even if said pig was powerful and connected. On the other, he was terrified she might offend Qin Jiang. The Li family simply could not afford a confrontation with Huaxia. The Zhao family's ashes were still warm.

Masking his turmoil with a smile, he said: "Ha ha, Manor Lord is quite right. Our heir is indeed talented. She's only in her twenties and already in seclusion attempting a breakthrough to Supreme."

"In seclusion?"

"Just entered, not long ago. Otherwise, she'd certainly insist on meeting you. She's quite an admirer of yours."

"Is that so?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, studying the old man with a half-smile. The ancestor nodded vigorously. Stall for now — Qin Jiang wouldn't stay long. And the girl rarely showed her face. There was no way they'd cross paths. He mentally congratulated himself on his quick thinking.

"What a pity," Qin Jiang said, shaking his head with feigned regret. He waved dismissively. The old man forced a parting smile and turned to leave. Stepping through the courtyard gate, he closed it behind him and exhaled slowly.

'Better go warn Qingqiu to stay out of sight,' he thought, and hurried off.

Other Li family leaders materialized around him. He issued instructions as he walked — every precaution, every detail, crystal clear. Do not offend Qin Jiang's group under any circumstances.

Mid-sentence, he stopped dead.

In the distance, an enormous ice phoenix had erupted into the sky. Perched atop it sat a woman's silhouette.

The Li ancestor stared. His face twitched. "It's over. She's definitely getting taken. This is fate... there's no escaping fate..."
