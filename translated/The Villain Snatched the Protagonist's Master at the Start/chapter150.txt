The Heavenly Pill Palace.

The outer area served as a trading zone—pills, spirit herbs, and alchemical supplies as far as the eye could see. Qin Jiang browsed with his entourage but found nothing that caught his interest.

Deeper inside, the temperature rose noticeably. This was the alchemists' domain. Pill masters sat cross-legged before their furnaces, refining in earnest. The rich fragrance of medicinal pills saturated the air, so thick it was almost intoxicating.

"So many alchemists!" Lian'er marveled.

Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er were equally awed. The Fire Tribe had a long alchemical tradition, but it paled in comparison to this. Every single alchemist here would've been considered elite back in the Fire Tribe.

Qin Jiang nodded approvingly. "If we bring the Heavenly Pill Palace into the fold, it'll be a massive boost for the Qin family's development."

"You got this, big brother~" Lian'er cheered, pumping her tiny fist.

A sudden commotion drew their attention. Up ahead, a crowd had gathered around one of the refining stations. Energy rippled outward, accompanied by wisps of pill fragrance.

"Saint-grade pill." Qin Jiang identified it with a single sniff. The energy from the finished product pushed the onlookers back as they gave the alchemist room.

The crowd parted, and Qin Jiang caught his first glimpse of the pill master. Lian'er beat him to the punch.

"Wow—she's gorgeous!" The girl's eyes went wide, then immediately began their signature calculating rotation.

Without a word, Lian'er shot forward. The female alchemist tapped her furnace, and a perfectly round pill settled into her palm—just as Lian'er materialized in front of her.

Two bright, sparkling eyes gazed up at the woman. "You're so pretty, big sister!"

The alchemist looked down at the adorable girl and couldn't help but smile. Before she could respond, Lian'er delivered the follow-up.

"Can you be my sister-in-law?"

The alchemist: "..."

'This girl is devastatingly cute, but the things coming out of her mouth are devastating for entirely different reasons.'

Qin Jiang strolled over, gently pulling Lian'er aside, and offered the woman an apologetic smile. "Sorry about that. My sister has no filter."

"It's fine." The alchemist shook her head. "She's just a child. I understand."

"Haha, thanks for being understanding. But since we're on the subject—would you like to be my woman?"

Qin Jiang smiled pleasantly.

The alchemist's expression froze. The little girl not knowing any better was one thing. But a grown man?

Snickers rippled through the crowd.

"Being handsome doesn't make you special. Our Heavenly Pill Palace's Saintess isn't the shallow type."

"Buddy, this is the Heavenly Pill Palace's Saintess you're talking to. She's got suitors lined up around the block. A pretty face won't cut it."

"He's not even an alchemist, and he's trying to court the Saintess?"

The bystanders were amused, their comments more teasing than malicious.

Qin Jiang couldn't have cared less, but he happened to be surrounded by fiercely protective women.

"Shut your mouths!" Jian Yao's voice cracked like a whip. "Who do you think you are, running your mouths about my man? One more word and I'll cut you down where you stand."

She didn't release her aura, but the natural pressure of an immortal-path cultivator made every person present flinch involuntarily.

Mo Mo curled her lip. "Just kill them. Teach them what 'loose lips sink ships' means. They'll remember the lesson in their next life."

Liu Shuwan had already drawn her sword. She looked to Qin Jiang. "Want me to kill them?"

"Just teach them a lesson. No fatalities."

Qin Jiang waved it off casually, then turned his attention back to the female alchemist. "You're the Saintess?"

No wonder Lian'er had zeroed in on her. The system had pinged the moment he'd laid eyes on this woman. He hadn't checked the details yet, but the odds of her being a fortune heroine were excellent.

The Saintess didn't answer. Her eyes were on Jian Yao and the others, alarm rising.

"What are you doing?!"

She darted forward, positioning herself between the women and the crowd. "Fighting is forbidden in the Heavenly Pill Palace!"

Jian Yao and Mo Mo held back. Liu Shuwan stepped forward with a cold hum. "The Heavenly Pill Palace's rules don't apply to us."

Before the Saintess could react, Liu Shuwan's sword sang. A crescent of sword energy lashed out. The Saintess tried to dodge, but the crushing sense of danger rooted her to the spot. The blade light screamed toward her face—

She squeezed her eyes shut.

At the last instant, Liu Shuwan redirected the strike. It curved around the Saintess and tore into the men who'd been mouthing off. Screams erupted, accompanied by the wet sounds of severed flesh. When the Saintess opened her eyes, she saw each of the offenders clutching the stump where an arm had been.

"You—"

Her face was pale. She hadn't expected such immediate, decisive violence—or such blatant disregard for the Heavenly Pill Palace's authority.

"Just a small lesson," Liu Shuwan said mildly, sheathing her sword and returning to Qin Jiang's side.

The commotion drew the Heavenly Pill Palace's enforcement squad. They took one look at the blood and frowned, then addressed the Saintess with a respectful bow. "Saintess, what happened here?"

The Saintess looked toward Qin Jiang's group. Every one of them appeared utterly unconcerned. Before she could speak, Qin Jiang answered for her.

"They ran their mouths. I had someone teach them manners."

The squad leader turned to him. "You did this?"

"Well—my wife stood up for me. Close enough."

Qin Jiang nodded matter-of-factly, pulling Liu Shuwan's hand into his. Having a woman willing to draw steel on his behalf was worth showing off. That was a man's pride.

The squad leader frowned. "Are you aware that the Heavenly Pill Palace forbids combat on its grounds?"

"I'm aware." Qin Jiang gestured toward the Saintess. "She already mentioned it. But—" A confident, almost arrogant grin spread across his face. "A little place like the Heavenly Pill Palace can't bind everyone to its rules. Case in point—us. Wan'er, show them what real power looks like."

Liu Shuwan gave him a look. 'He's definitely just showing off.' But her man wanted a display, and she'd indulge him.

Great Emperor aura erupted from her body. The razor-sharp pressure sent everyone stumbling backward.

The squad leader's face went taut. "Great Emperor!"

A Great Emperor was far beyond anything he could handle. But the Heavenly Pill Palace had Great Emperors of its own.

The instant Liu Shuwan's aura flared, a crushing wave of power detonated from the Palace's depths.

"Fellow Daoist—no one runs wild in the Heavenly Pill Palace!"
