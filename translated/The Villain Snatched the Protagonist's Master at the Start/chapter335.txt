In the wake of the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's conquest and the Wolf Race's annihilation, the Demon Domain had descended into a degree of chaos. Not every race, after all, possessed the good sense to think before acting.

After the Wolf Race's fall, a number of brainless factions had charged straight into Wolf Race territory, hoping to loot the spoils. None of them had paused to consider whether they were remotely qualified to claim anything. The result was predictable — the Snake Race and Fox Race both dispatched their strongest, three Human Immortals each, six in total. The two sides exchanged a friendly nod upon arrival, then jointly set about cleaning house.

There was no mercy. Every outsider found on Wolf Race land was cut down without hesitation. Not a scrap of the Wolf Race's legacy would leave with them — it belonged to the three overlords now.

The bloody purge sent shockwaves through the domain. One rogue Human Immortal was even killed in the joint assault. It took a full day to sweep the territory clean.

Only then did the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's people arrive, fashionably late. Their foundation was thinner — Xue Mei was their sole Human Immortal, and sending ordinary tribespeople earlier would have accomplished nothing. As for Xue Mei herself, Qin Jiang naturally wasn't going to waste her on cleanup duty.

The Snake Race and Fox Race, by now, were both aware that the one who'd annihilated the Wolf Race was An Xihe — the woman perpetually at Qin Jiang's side. The allocation of the Wolf Race's legacy had been Qin Jiang's decision, so even though the Celestial Rabbit Tribe was far weaker than the other two, no one dared push them around. All three sides dealt with each other courteously.

Negotiations were brief and amicable. The three races divided the Wolf Race's spoils without incident, each faction satisfied with their share. Afterward, they returned to their respective territories — the Snake Race and Fox Race under escort by three Human Immortals apiece, practically untouchable, while the Celestial Rabbit Tribe traveled with Qin Jiang's group shadowing them in secret.

Halfway back, someone did come looking for death — a rogue Human Immortal, eyeing the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's haul.

"Xue Mei," Qin Jiang murmured from concealment, squeezing her hand with a grin. "Time to announce the Demon Domain's new order."

Xue Mei nodded and materialized in the open air. Human Immortal pressure surged outward, drawing every eye for miles.

"Touch my Celestial Rabbit Tribe," she declared, her voice cold as winter steel, "and die."

The would-be thief went rigid, pinned by the sheer weight of her aura. Xue Mei's presence swelled further, an eerie energy flickering in her eyes, and her voice — laced with spiritual power — carried across the entire Demon Domain:

"The Wolf Race is no more. From this day forward, the Celestial Rabbit Tribe claims their place! Should anyone dispute our right as overlords — suffer this man's fate!"

The rogue Human Immortal turned to stone in an instant.

Xue Mei tossed out the Myriad Dao Stone, extracting his law. Before countless watching eyes, the petrified immortal crumbled into rubble and plummeted from the sky.

Silence swallowed the Demon Domain whole.

No one had expected the Celestial Rabbit Tribe to make such a bold play — the Wolf Race barely cold, and they were already staking their claim as the new third overlord. And to punctuate it by slaying a Human Immortal in front of everyone? Xue Mei had already made a name for herself by killing two immortals back in the Chaos District. Whispers of "the Demon Domain's strongest" were already circulating. Now, with this brazen declaration, precious few dared question it.

Every yao clan held its breath, waiting. They were watching the Snake Race and Fox Race for a reaction. If neither objected, no lesser faction would dream of speaking up. Killing Human Immortals like swatting flies — who in their right mind would provoke that?

The oppressive aura hung over the domain for a long while. Not a single challenge came.

Only then did Xue Mei withdraw her pressure, wave casually at her tribespeople, and vanish back into the void.

"Badass," Qin Jiang said, giving her a thumbs up.

Xue Mei rolled her eyes, then turned to An Xihe beside her and hooked her arm through the older woman's with an affectionate smile. "I just borrowed your reputation, Xihe-jiejie."

"You held your own." An Xihe smiled. "That Petrification move of yours packs serious punch. But your cultivation still needs to advance quickly — otherwise, eventually, someone will see through you."

Petrification was formidable, but anyone who'd reached Human Immortal had trump cards of their own. In a true fight to the death between peers, both sides typically walked away hurt, if they walked away at all. Of course, genuine prodigies — the Children of Destiny types — were a different story entirely. They cheated, dominating everyone at their level.

Xue Mei's pretty face fell. She nodded. "I know. It's just that breaking through will probably take a very long time..."

Her gaze drifted to Qin Jiang. In the old days, when she'd been alone, secluding herself for a thousand or ten thousand years had meant nothing. But now, she'd miss him.

"We have the Space-Time Temple," Qin Jiang said, stepping between the two women and wrapping an arm around each. He looked at Xue Mei with a smile. "With my current strength, I can upgrade it to a 1:100 time ratio. Before you go into seclusion, Xihe and Qing Chan can share their insights on the True Immortal realm, and I'll give you some treasures. Shouldn't take long."

Xue Mei was genuinely powerful — a veteran Human Immortal. Back in the Chaos District, without An Xihe's help, she'd still managed to completely suppress another Human Immortal in single combat. In a true death match, killing one wasn't out of the question — she'd just take some injuries. With insights from An Xihe and Qing Chan, plus the right resources from Qin Jiang, pushing for True Immortal should be well within reach.

"Let me wait until the faction is up and running and things have stabilized," Xue Mei said. "You're still shorthanded right now. I should stay and help."

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile. "Good. In the meantime, I can help shore up your foundation — deepen your reserves a bit."

"Huh? How?"

"Hehe. Don't forget — I've comprehended the Yin-Yang Law."

"You—"

Xue Mei's cheeks flushed. She immediately darted to An Xihe's side and clung to her arm. "Xihe-jiejie, you have to help me!"

Facing Qin Jiang alone, she couldn't hold out. She needed backup, and An Xihe was the undisputed champion of that particular arena. But An Xihe merely rolled her eyes, seized Xue Mei by the wrist, and tossed her right back into Qin Jiang's arms.

"I haven't forgiven you for defecting last time," An Xihe said with a haughty little sniff.

Xue Mei's face burned crimson. She looked up at Qin Jiang, blinked those lovely eyes, and tried one last gambit. "How about we go find Yu Lan and Yu Ru instead?"

If An Xihe wouldn't help, there were other sisters. And regardless of whether they helped, Qin Jiang certainly wouldn't let them off easy once he had them in sight.

It was called distributing the damage.
