After getting Chen Changsheng settled, Dao Zhen left the courtyard.

Halfway down the street, he ran straight into Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang beamed and stuck out his palm. "Brother Dao Zhen, finders keepers—share the wealth."

Dao Zhen: "..."

His cheek twitched. Of course Qin Jiang knew about the payment. The treasure hadn't even warmed in his pocket yet.

Parting with any of it stung, but the reality was clear. In the current pecking order, he didn't outrank Qin Jiang. The boy had two True Immortals behind him, one of whom was on the verge of becoming an Immortal King. If Qin Jiang complained to them, life would get uncomfortable fast. Dao Zhen was well aware of how shamelessly spoiled this brat was.

"I'm the one who did the rescuing," he protested. "Chen Changsheng's gift to me. Eighty-twenty split."

Qin Jiang blinked, rubbed his chin thoughtfully, and nodded. "Twenty percent. Fine, I suppose your contribution earns you that much."

"???"

Dao Zhen's expression froze. Twenty percent—for him? And "I suppose"? As if even that was generous?

"You—"

"No need for thanks, Brother Dao Zhen. We're brothers, after all. Giving you twenty percent is only right."

"..."

Dao Zhen stared at him, face slowly darkening. This boy's hide was even thicker than his own. A pity, really—he'd have made a perfect disciple for the Human Dao Sect. But the sect couldn't hold someone like him.

At least the Human Dao Sect's future heir was his dao companion. And Qin Jiang treated Baizhe well. In a sense, he was already half a member of the sect.

Thinking of it that way, Dao Zhen's expression softened. Eventually, Baizhe would inherit the Human Dao Sect, and when that day came, Qin Jiang would have to help support it. There was no way he'd leave his own wife's sect to rot.

With that comforting thought, Dao Zhen produced eighty percent of the haul and handed it over without further argument. The remaining twenty was for his own private chicken fund. Not a coin of it would go to the Human Dao Sect's treasury.

Qin Jiang was almost disappointed by how easily Dao Zhen caved. He enjoyed the process of extortion, not just the result. This was anticlimactic.

The treasure itself was nothing special—Qin Jiang could tell at a glance. The Azure Lotus Divine Palace's vaults dwarfed this many times over, stacked to the ceiling with courting gifts. The richest faction in all of Azure Cloud Heaven, bar none. What Dao Zhen had coughed up was pocket change by comparison.

He tucked it away with a shrug. Better than nothing.

Next, he asked about Chen Changsheng. Dao Zhen reported truthfully—the deception had worked exactly as planned. Chen Changsheng was fully convinced that Chen Qi'er was Qin Jiang's agent.

Qin Jiang smirked, already scheming up another clash between the two. He also needed to accelerate his Reincarnation Law's growth.

Seeing the wheels turning, Dao Zhen hesitated, then spoke up. "Qin Jiang, if you're going to deal with them, use decisive force. Especially now, during this critical period."

"Hm?"

"Our Human Dao Sect's Fortune-Reading Art is second to none. Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng both carry immense fortune. If you don't finish them in one blow, they'll only come back stronger. One day, their power might exceed your expectations—and by then, regret will be useless."

Dao Zhen's tone was earnest, almost pleading. Qin Jiang's fate was now inseparable from the Human Dao Sect's. He felt obligated to warn him. This couldn't continue. One mishap at this critical juncture, and the Human Dao Sect would suffer alongside Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. The old fox was finally being genuine? These past weeks, Qin Jiang had been watching Dao Zhen carefully—the mission to save Chen Changsheng had been as much a test of loyalty as anything. Dao Zhen had passed. But that didn't mean Qin Jiang could afford to lower his guard during such a sensitive time.

He nodded with a smile. "I know what I'm doing."

His plan was to eliminate all three Children of Destiny before An Xihe's breakthrough concluded. Having them lurking in the Chaos District was a recipe for disaster—Children of Destiny had an annoying habit of stumbling into exactly the right opportunity at exactly the wrong time.

But first, he wanted his Reincarnation Law to mature. Even if it didn't reach full maturity, it was time to reclaim it. He'd make up the difference himself.

Dao Zhen couldn't tell whether the warning had actually landed. But he resolved to keep a close eye on both Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng. If either showed signs of a dangerous breakthrough, he'd intervene personally. The line he'd drawn for himself was clear: as long as neither reached True Immortal, he could handle them easily.

Elsewhere.

Chen Qi'er ducked into an abandoned building where Chen Wuming was waiting.

"Master, how did it go?" Chen Wuming asked.

Though Chen Qi'er hadn't told him what they were looking for, Chen Wuming could tell from his master's expression that it was important. If he could find it first, it might make a worthy offering to Black Dragon's mysterious boss.

Chen Qi'er shook his head. The trip had yielded nothing. He had, however, confirmed that Qin Jiang was likely here. He'd need to tread more carefully going forward.

Seeing the disappointment, Chen Wuming's internal disdain grew. This Chen Qi'er was useless! Couldn't find beautiful women, couldn't find treasure, and for all his talk about having a devoted sister, he hadn't gone looking for her even once. The whole thing was probably a lie.

What sister would want someone like this?

Chen Wuming kept his contempt well hidden. Months of playing double agent had taught him to mask his emotions.

The two sat in silence for a while before Chen Wuming tentatively asked, "Master, what exactly are you looking for? Maybe I can help. It's worth a shot."

"You?" Chen Qi'er glanced at him. His disciple did possess remarkable fortune—during the fight with Chen Changsheng, Chen Wuming had been accidentally flung into a spatial rift and somehow crawled back out alive. Perhaps he really could find something.

After a pause, he explained. "I'm searching for Azure Cloud Heaven's origin power. Someone in this Chaos District has extracted it from the realm and concentrated it somewhere. Outside the district, I could still sense traces of it, but once I entered, the signature vanished completely. Not even a whisper."

"Azure Cloud Heaven's origin power?" Chen Wuming's eyes widened—then gleamed. A treasure like that, presented to Black Dragon's boss, would surely earn favor.
