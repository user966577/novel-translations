The airship sailed toward the Divine Dragon Continent.

Inside the Void Divine Temple, every last one of Long Xin'er's secrets had been thoroughly measured by Qin Jiang. By hand, naturally. But he could proudly declare: his hands were rulers.

Long Xin'er lay limp on the bed, her eyes half-lidded, a thin gauze sheet draped over her body. She propped herself up and looked at him, her lips parting softly.

"Can you tell me who you are?"

"Right now? I'm your man."

Qin Jiang smiled, sitting on the edge of the bed. "All you need to know is this: with me here, even the throne of the Divine Dragon Continent is within your reach."

"The throne..." Long Xin'er murmured, a spark kindling in her eyes. But it dimmed just as quickly. The Divine Dragon Continent was ruled by strength—every monarch had been a Great Emperor. She was nowhere close. Her ambition far outstripped her power.

She looked up. "We're heading to the Divine Dragon Continent now?"

"That's right."

"Don't you want to go back?"

Long Xin'er sank back onto the bed and shook her head. "The imperial family holds no warmth for me. There's nothing there worth missing."

The most heartless place was always a royal court. Born into the palace, all that existed was profit and the pursuit of the throne. Affection was the cheapest commodity of all.

Qin Jiang leaned down and ruffled her hair. "Let's go back for a visit, at least. You did spend decades there."

"You really want to go?" Doubt creased her brow. "I'm a princess of the Divine Dragon Empire. Unfavored or not, I still represent imperial dignity. What you did to me—if the Empire finds out, they'll punish you. Perhaps your status will protect you from death, but they won't let you off easily. One Great Emperor won't be enough to shield you."

"One Great Emperor?" Qin Jiang spread his hands. "Who said I only have one?"

"Hm?"

"By the way—how many Great Emperors does the Divine Dragon Continent have?"

Seeing that Qin Jiang showed not a shred of fear, Long Xin'er answered honestly. "My father—the reigning Dragon Emperor—is one. There are also four Great Emperor Imperial Patrons, plus four independent Great Emperors among the populace. Nine in total."

"That few?"

Qin Jiang's eyebrow rose. He currently had six ancestral Emperors plus Liu Shuwan—seven total. If only Jian Yao weren't still in seclusion. Her strength was equivalent to at least three Great Emperors, and if she broke through to the immortal path, she could single-handedly sweep the entire Divine Dragon Continent.

"Few?" Long Xin'er's eyes gleamed. A smile tugged at her lips. "I knew it—your status must be extraordinary."

"Oh?" Qin Jiang studied her. "You were testing me?"

"You're my man now. Shouldn't I know a bit more about you?"

Qin Jiang was mildly impressed. A princess through and through—always scheming. Then Long Xin'er pressed further.

"Can you really help me take the throne?"

"Putting you on the throne isn't hard. But I won't be staying on the Divine Dragon Continent for long. Are you sure you want to stay behind instead of coming with me?"

Hesitation crossed her face. Right now, the throne was more alluring than Qin Jiang. But without him, she'd never hold it. And his background was clearly extraordinary. Staying by his side might be the smarter choice.

She felt no real affection for him—they'd only known each other a day. Apart from his impressive stamina, she hadn't discovered many redeeming qualities. So her calculations were purely strategic.

"Think it over," Qin Jiang said with a smile, and left.

Half a month of sailing through the Chaos later, a continent finally came into view.

Black Dragon appeared behind Qin Jiang. "Young Master, shall we approach directly?"

The continent ahead was the Divine Dragon Continent. A bit closer, and its people would detect the airship.

"Straight in."

With this much firepower, why bother sneaking?

Black Dragon acknowledged the order. The ship forged ahead. Before they even entered the continent's airspace, a swarm of soldiers launched from the surface, forming a blockade.

"Halt! This is the Divine Dragon Empire! Submit to inspection before entering!"

The lead soldier bellowed the warning. The airship didn't slow by a fraction. Under their horrified gazes, the flying castle plowed straight toward them.

"Stop! Stop the ship!"

"Halt and submit to inspection, or be treated as an enemy of the Divine Dragon Continent!"

The soldiers roared, retreating desperately while unleashing their strongest attacks against the hull. Against an Emperor-grade airship, their efforts were less than mosquito bites.

Without the slightest pause, the ship crashed through them. Soldiers scattered like flies, flung in every direction.

On deck, Qin Jiang watched impassively. Long Xin'er appeared beside him, her eyes narrowing.

"You're provoking the Divine Dragon Empire."

"They provoked me first."

Qin Jiang scoffed. A handful of border grunts daring to order him to stop for inspection? That was the real provocation.

Long Xin'er rolled her eyes and turned back to watch.

The collision had been seen by plenty of people on the continent. The border military mobilized immediately. Generals took to the sky, surrounding the airship from a distance. One sharp-eyed officer spotted the imperial vessel trailing behind the Emperor-grade ship.

"That's an imperial ship!"

Heads turned. Sure enough—it bore the royal crest.

"Whichever member of the imperial family is aboard, please come forward and cooperate with inspection!" a general barked.

Long Xin'er glanced at Qin Jiang. "Should I show myself?"

"Why bother?"

Qin Jiang swept his arm. The airship surged forward, a castle charging directly at the cluster of generals. Caught off guard, they were sent flying, blood spraying from their mouths. Their cultivation was stronger than the rank-and-file soldiers, so they survived—but the humiliation was total.

The entire border defense was livid. Not even royalty had the right to be this brazen.

"Ramming the border garrison is a crime regardless of your rank! I don't care which prince or princess you are—you WILL be punished!"

A furious voice boomed across the sky. It belonged to the garrison's Supreme-level commander—a cultivator of such stature that even princes and princesses owed him respect.
