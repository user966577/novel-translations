Right in front of Nangong Yun, Qin Jiang tenderly teased Xue Yue.

Their intimacy twisted the knife in Nangong Yun's gut. He'd thought he didn't have deep feelings for Xue Yue, but watching this now, his chest ached unbearably. It was like watching something that should have been his become someone else's — and worse, he'd handed it over willingly.

Under Qin Jiang's gentle teasing, Xue Yue's face broke into a genuine smile. With Nangong Yun watching, she was supposed to look reluctant, but her acting just wasn't there. In the end, all she could do was bury her face in Qin Jiang's chest.

He held her close, patting her back, planting a soft kiss on her hair. "Yueyue, wait just a bit. I've got something that'll make you feel better."

Then he turned to Nangong Yun with a smile. "Alright, nothing else to discuss. Head on back. Yueyue's not feeling well — I need to treat her. An injection should do the trick."

"An injection?" Nangong Yun repeated.

"Yeah. The other day, she came to me crying, said she felt awful. I gave her an injection and she started feeling great."

Nangong Yun had never experienced certain things firsthand, but he understood enough. His face turned a shade of green.

In Qin Jiang's arms, Xue Yue pinched him discreetly. This scoundrel — saying things like that in front of Nangong Yun! What if that disgusting creature started fantasizing about her? The thought alone made her dry-heave. She nearly threw up.

Qin Jiang blinked. 'Wait — that's not in the script.' He pulled her back slightly, studying her flushed face with a hint of concern. "Yueyue, are you..."

"I'm fine." She pressed a hand to her mouth and shook her head.

He examined her closely, then couldn't help himself. "You're not pregnant, are you?"

"Pregnant?!" Before Xue Yue could even react, Nangong Yun blurted out the word in shock.

Her expression turned frigid. "Mind your own business!"

Then she looked back at Qin Jiang, tapping his chest lightly, her voice soft. "Silly. It's only been a few days — even if I were pregnant, it's too early to tell. And besides, you know perfectly well I swallowed most of it. The little bit that stayed inside got refined away."

"Fair point." Qin Jiang nodded.

He'd nearly broken character — Xue Yue's reaction had been genuinely convincing. But then she blushed and whispered, "Though if you want, I could give you one~"

She cast a sideways glance at Nangong Yun, a flicker of mockery in her eyes.

He saw it. It hurt.

To Nangong Yun, she was doing it on purpose — deliberately provoking him. But her dry-heaving earlier? That was real. Being held by this man disgusted her so much she nearly vomited. The thought deepened his guilt. He even felt a twinge of regret.

"Really? You'd have my baby?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

Xue Yue nodded shyly, leaning against him. "If you want."

"Then let's get started right now!"

"Hey, I'm not even pregnant yet!"

"That's what I'm fixing."

He laughed, pulled Xue Yue and Weiwei along, and headed back into the courtyard, leaving Nangong Yun behind as the gate closed.

Nangong Yun's heart sank further. If this continued, his senior sister and Xue Yue might actually end up pregnant. He couldn't bear to imagine them standing before him with swollen bellies. The thought sent a chill through his entire body.

Inside the courtyard, the group exchanged glances and burst out laughing.

"Weiwei, you were brilliant," Qin Jiang praised. "That look in your eyes — I almost believed it myself."

But Weiwei pouted, brows furrowing. "Hmph. If you say things like that, I'm not acting anymore!"

"Why not?"

"What if you believe the act and decide you don't want me? What would I do then?"

Her eyes glistened with unshed tears, her expression wounded. Qin Jiang immediately pulled her close. "It's just a performance — I'd never take it seriously. Don't overthink this. I could never bring myself to give you up."

"But what if?"

"There is no 'what if'!" He kissed her deeply, holding it for a long moment before pulling back. "Don't let your imagination run wild. No 'what if.' Understood?"

"...Okay~"

Then his hand, resting at her waist, rose and came down with a sharp smack on her backside. She yelped. He pinched her cheek. "Not very convincing."

"I am! I'm very convincing!"

She pouted, and when she saw his hand rising again, she quickly added, "I know, I know — there's no 'what if'!"

"Better." He nodded approvingly.

His hand came down again, but gently this time — more of a caress. There was no "what if" — of that, Qin Jiang was certain. With Leadership Charisma, he could see that both Weiwei and Xue Yue were completely devoted to him. A hundred percent. No chance of betrayal. So acting was just acting. He would never take it seriously.

Weiwei wrapped her arms around his neck. "Then promise me — you'll trust me. You won't let go of me. Otherwise, I'm not acting anymore."

She was still worried. If Qin Jiang believed the act and truly abandoned her, she didn't know how she'd go on living.

Seeing her anxiety, Qin Jiang glanced at Xue Yue, hesitated, and said, "Yueyue, maybe we should drop the whole act. Sure, it made Nangong Yun squirm, but it makes us uncomfortable too. Not worth it."

"You're right," Xue Yue agreed. She'd almost thrown up during the performance. Tormenting Nangong Yun was satisfying, but it came at a cost. And hearing Weiwei's concerns, she shared the same fear — what if Qin Jiang took the act at face value and rejected them? Compared to making Nangong Yun suffer, Qin Jiang mattered infinitely more.

"Okay~ Whatever you say." Xue Yue nodded, and both women snuggled into Qin Jiang's arms.

She looked up at him, eyes brimming with affection, and whispered shyly, "Husband... didn't you say you wanted me to have your baby~?"
