Every word from Dao Kun's mouth stabbed like a blade through Chen Qi'er's heart.

He hadn't returned merely to see his sister. He'd wanted to... be with her. Live together, side by side. But now she already had a Dao companion.

'A perfect match. A golden couple. Uncle. Red envelope...'

Each phrase hit harder than the last. He could barely breathe. A Human Immortal powerhouse actually stumbled.

"Are you alright?" Dao Kun startled.

The man looked healthy and vigorous—nothing like someone who'd been injured. Why was he swaying?

Chen Qi'er waved him off, his heart twisting painfully. For the first time in his life, he felt this kind of anguish. He took a deep breath and looked up at the palace, his voice low. "Baizhe's... Dao companion is up there too?"

"That's right. He has a certain relationship with Immortal Qing Chan as well."

"What kind of relationship?"

Dao Kun coughed. "The same kind he has with Baizhe."

"???"

Chen Qi'er's mouth twitched. The man already had other women, and he still had the nerve to pursue his sister? This was blatant polygamy.

Then he recalled what Dao Kun had said—that he might soon become an uncle. Chen Qi'er could almost picture what Baizhe was doing at this very moment. Were they... creating new life?

He clutched his chest and took several shuddering breaths, barely able to absorb the news.

"Are you really okay?" Dao Kun peered at him, thoroughly baffled. A Human Immortal with heart problems? Seriously?

"I'm fine." Chen Qi'er shook his head.

The pain was almost suffocating. Everything he'd worked for seemed to have been in vain.

Aboard the traveling palace, Chen Baizhe had given all her tea to Ning Xue'er. Brewing tea properly was an art in itself—when Qin Jiang tried his hand at it, the result was both murky and bitter. Ning Xue'er's brew, by contrast, carried a fragrant undercurrent beneath the bitterness that lingered on the palate. Even Chen Baizhe, who didn't care for tea, found herself drinking several extra cups.

"I had no idea there was so much to tea-making. All the tea I've drunk before was wasted," Chen Baizhe sighed.

Ning Xue'er smiled warmly, looking at Chen Baizhe with obvious fondness. She loved fine tea, and this woman had just handed over an enormous stash of Human Dao Tea. That made them best friends in her book.

"Whenever you want tea, just come find me, Baizhe. I'll brew it for you personally, no matter the hour."

"Sounds wonderful," Chen Baizhe agreed.

Qing Chan, meanwhile, took a swig of wine with a dismissive pout. Tea. What was the fuss? Wine was clearly superior. And quite useful too—it was being plied with drink that let Qin Jiang get his hands on this Baizhe girl in the first place.

The women were chatting and laughing when Qing Chan's brow suddenly twitched.

"What is it?" Qin Jiang was lounging with his head in her lap. He noticed the change immediately.

Qing Chan smiled, stroking his cheek. "Seems like someone's stirring up trouble at the Human Dao Sect."

"Stirring up trouble here?" Qin Jiang was surprised.

The other women were curious too and extended their senses. "What powerful soul energy." "Pretty brazen—does he have no respect for the Human Dao Sect?" "Sect Master Dao Kun just pushed back." "They're not fighting?"

They chattered, painting a vivid picture of what was happening below. After a while, with no signs of battle, everyone was puzzled. The intruder had been so disrespectful, yet Dao Kun was holding back?

They gathered at the palace's edge. Qin Jiang wandered over too, and soon spotted Dao Kun's figure below. Standing beside him was another figure, and the sight made Qin Jiang's brow lift slightly.

'Chen Qi'er? Finally showed up. Too bad—you're already too late.'

He stood at Chen Baizhe's side. When she caught sight of Chen Qi'er, her body went rigid for an instant.

"What's wrong, Baizhe?" He took her hand.

She fell silent, studying the distant figure. After a long while, she looked away, a shimmer of tears in her eyes. She turned to Qin Jiang, her lips parting softly. "That's... my brother."

The other women stared. Qin Jiang kept his eyes on Chen Baizhe, squeezing her hand just a little tighter. She felt the small gesture, used her free hand to wipe her eyes, then shot him a look of mild exasperation. "You're afraid I'll run off?"

"I am."

Qin Jiang nodded with complete sincerity.

Seeing that look on his face, Chen Baizhe couldn't help but laugh. Being cared about this much felt wonderful. She squeezed his hand back and spoke gently.

"I told you already—he's just my brother. You're my husband."

The women erupted in teasing whistles and catcalls, turning Chen Baizhe's cheeks pink.

Qin Jiang smiled, still holding her hand. He looked toward Chen Qi'er. "Want to go see him?"

"Do you want me to?" Chen Baizhe asked, deferring to him.

He gave her hand another squeeze. "He's your brother. Properly speaking, you should at least see him. But I'm coming with you."

"Okay."

She nodded, smiling. She'd expected that seeing Chen Qi'er would make her sad—after all, he was alive yet hadn't visited her in all these years, meaning she wasn't important to him. But looking at Qin Jiang, terrified she'd slip away, her mood was inexplicably light. Someone might not care about her, but someone else did.

"Then... come with me to see him?"

Qin Jiang nodded, looked at her once more, then swept her into his arms. Satisfied with the arrangement, he leapt from the palace, carrying her down.

She shot him a look. His possessiveness wasn't exactly subtle, but she didn't resist. If holding her made him feel secure, then let him hold her.

In a flash, they landed beside Chen Qi'er. Dao Kun blinked, then quickly stepped forward, turning to Chen Qi'er.

"Baizhe's here. Let me introduce you—this is her Dao companion, Qin Jiang. Young Master Qin."

The dazed Chen Qi'er snapped out of his stupor at the sound of his sister's name. He looked over immediately—and the sight of Qin Jiang holding Baizhe hit him like a sledgehammer.

His lips trembled. His sister had grown even more beautiful. But she was nestled in another man's arms, and that man—

Chen Qi'er froze, his eyes going wide.

"You!"
