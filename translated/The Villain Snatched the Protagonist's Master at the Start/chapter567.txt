Mengqian didn't answer, only snorted coldly. If she weren't worried about the Empress, she'd have left already.

In Qin Jiang's mind, however, silence meant consent.

"Ah! What are you doing?!"

Mengqian yelped, her face going scarlet. She hadn't expected Qin Jiang to carry the Empress right up to her—and the visual impact on a sheltered young woman was overwhelming.

One hand supported the Empress—who was doing all the moving on her own at this point—while his free hand reached for Mengqian's waist.

She dodged. "What—what are you trying to do?"

"You."

"???"

Panic flooded her features, her eyes darting everywhere except at him. The shamelessness of this man—doing that in front of her was bad enough, but now he was walking right up to her?

"You already agreed."

He closed in again. This time, she didn't escape. He caught her around the waist.

Mengqian tried to pull free. "You—don't! You'll interrupt the detoxification!"

"I'm still working on her. See?"

"Then don't get distracted—"

"Heh, don't worry. I can handle both. I'm very experienced."

With one hand—his free one—he had her undressed in moments. The man was appallingly practiced.

"Stop—"

She clutched herself, struggling to break free, but the Empress was still in his other arm—a human shield. Mengqian didn't dare use her spiritual power, afraid of hurting the Empress in her current state.

Physical strength alone wasn't enough to escape.

"You already agreed, so what's the resistance for? Unless you enjoy being forced? Heh—perfect, because I enjoy forcing."

Mengqian's face went crimson with fury. What kind of person said that out loud? About forcing people? And sounded proud of it?

"I never agreed!"

"You did—just now."

"I didn't say anything just now!"

"Exactly. Silence is consent."

She almost bit through her own lip. What logic was that? Since when did silence mean consent?

"I never agreed. Let me go and focus on detoxifying the Empress."

Qin Jiang nodded—then completely ignored her request. He smirked. "I know you like being forced. Don't worry. I'll oblige."

She wanted to scream. If the Empress weren't being held hostage, her fists would already be flying.

"I don't like being forced!"

"Heh. Your body says otherwise."

He raised his hand. Mengqian's already-red face turned the color of blood, heat spreading across every inch of her skin.

She grabbed his wrist and pushed it down, refusing to look. Turning her head, she managed through clenched teeth, "What do you actually want?"

"I've told you. You."

"..."

Helpless didn't begin to cover it. She was going to lose her virtue—that much was inevitable. Seeing her expression, Qin Jiang relented.

"Fine. Let me put it another way."

"What?"

"If you want me to finish detoxifying your empress, you'd better behave."

"..."

A threat. He'd repackaged the same demand as a threat. But oddly, this version was easier to swallow—sacrificing herself for the Empress. Noble. Selfless.

Why hadn't he just said that from the start? Instead of that nonsense about enjoying being forced?

Her eyes held a flash of resentment, but her body stopped fighting. She went still.

Qin Jiang smiled and explored. Before long, she'd gone soft against him—melting into his arms just like the Empress, eyes glazing over. But she kept her jaw tight, refusing to ask for anything. The Empress needed it more.

Qin Jiang wasn't about to leave her hanging, though. He shifted his attention, and Mengqian yelped. She gripped him hard, brow furrowed, enduring.

After a while, she managed, "Focus on the Empress. She needs it more."

"Can you wait?"

She blushed and looked away. "I don't need anything."

"Alright."

He agreed cheerfully and turned back to the Empress. Mengqian was suddenly aware of an odd emptiness. She peeked down, face burning, and swallowed. Just moments ago, he'd been doing that to her too.

It had hurt at first. But after the pain faded, the feeling was... indescribable. She wanted more—wanted to properly experience it.

But the Empress came first. She'd endure for now. Given what he'd already done, he wasn't going to just let her go. There'd be another chance.

Roughly four hours later, the Empress's detoxification was still incomplete. The Grand Elder's poison was ferociously potent. But the Empress had hit her limit—four hours of sustained intensity at that level would have broken most people. Only her Immortal Emperor constitution had kept her going this long.

She needed rest.

"Why did you stop? Keep going!" Mengqian urged from the side.

Qin Jiang shot her a look. "She can't take any more. If I keep going, she might actually die."

Such things had happened before—in a certain novel, even the final boss had met that end. Tragic, really.

Worry creased Mengqian's face. "What now?"

"Relax. Most of the poison's gone. The urgency has passed—she can rest."

"Oh. Good."

"However..."

"What?"

"Heh heh. She gets to rest. But you don't."
