On the surface, the colossal water figure dissolved, transforming into an enormous gateway. The gathered cultivators hesitated for only a heartbeat before the first ones launched themselves toward it. The rest followed in a rushing tide.

Some, however, were repelled at the threshold.

"Immortal Kings can't enter?"

Those blocked were all Immortal King-level cultivators. They frowned but didn't force the issue, shaking their heads and pulling back. Several Immortal Kings who'd intended to escort their disciples produced protective treasures, passed them along with a few words of advice, and then withdrew.

Inside the realm, Black Dragon and Little Xu had already snuck in well ahead of time. Seeing the first entrants appear, Black Dragon gave Little Xu a nudge.

"Wake up. Time to work."

"People are here?" Little Xu rubbed his eyes, saw the steady stream of figures materializing throughout the realm, and immediately snapped to attention.

Their mission was surveillance—monitoring every person inside and recording anyone who stood out. And it wasn't just the two of them. Nearly every Huaxia operative strong enough to enter the realm had been deployed.

After all, Qin Jiang had a family to feed. He couldn't afford to miss any opportunity to identify a Child of Destiny, and this secret realm was prime hunting ground. Whether a new one would appear beyond the Tianji he'd already found, Qin Jiang couldn't be sure—but the more, the better. They were his sponsors, after all.

"So many people," Little Xu marveled.

Black Dragon shot him a look. "Obviously. This is an Immortal Emperor's secret realm—top-tier. Of course it draws a crowd."

"Heh heh—too bad there's nothing left for them. They're all going home empty-handed."

Little Xu chuckled. He'd stripped the place bare. Not even a single spirit stone remained.

Oblivious to the surveillance, the new arrivals spread out cautiously, relaxing only after confirming there were no immediate threats. They began exploring—and quickly grew confused.

"How is there nothing here?"

"This is supposed to be a medicinal garden? There's not a single herb! Did they all rot away?"

"No—even rot would leave traces."

"Hold on... this soil looks freshly turned. Someone was here before us!"

"What the—is this a pill chamber? Where are the pills? Who the hell took everything?"

"The armory—completely empty."

"The technique library has no techniques."

"Damn it, what kind of secret realm is this? Cleaned out! Not a single thing left!"

"Not even a spirit stone."

"Wait—I found one! Wedged in a crack between two rocks. Nearly missed it."

As the explorers compared notes, they realized that every single one of them had come away with nothing. The greatest find among them all was one spirit stone.

Hidden nearby, Little Xu's eyes bulged when he spotted it. "Are you kidding me? I missed one? That's a loss!"

"Relax. We'll find a chance to take it back," Black Dragon said.

Qin Jiang had drilled into them a simple philosophy: not profiting was the same as losing. And right now, they were down one spirit stone. The lucky finder's entire inventory would have to serve as compensation.

As the exploration continued and frustration mounted, tempers frayed. Conflicts began breaking out—especially among those who'd already had grudges.

Through it all, one solitary figure navigated alone, ignoring everyone around him. In his hand, he clutched a blood-red stone.

It was his family's heirloom—passed down through generations for longer than anyone could remember. For all those years, the so-called heirloom had shown no signs of anything special, and his family had steadily declined along with it.

Legend said that at their peak, his clan had boasted Immortal King-level cultivators. Now, the strongest among them was him—a mere Human Immortal. But his talent was extraordinary. Regarded as the family's best hope, he'd been hailed as the one most likely to restore them to their former glory. He'd worked relentlessly—breaking through to Human Immortal before the age of 500, he was a widely recognized genius.

Yet after reaching Human Immortal, he'd learned a harsh truth: talent alone wasn't enough. Every step beyond Human Immortal demanded immense resources—resources his family simply couldn't provide.

Then the Immortal Emperor's secret realm appeared. He decided to take the gamble.

Better still, the dormant heirloom had stirred when the realm surfaced—for the first time in living memory. Perhaps there was a connection.

He rushed to the realm with the heirloom. Outside the entrance, the stone's reaction had faded, nearly dampening his hopes. But the moment he crossed the threshold, the stone grew warm in his hand, and a faint consciousness within it began guiding him.

There was no doubt now. The heirloom truly was linked to this place.

So even though the realm was stripped bare, he pressed on, following the stone's guidance—until he stood before an enormous statue. He looked up. The statue bore a striking resemblance to the water-formed figure that had appeared above the sea—the likeness of the Immortal Emperor.

'This is it?'

He murmured, glancing down at the blood-red stone. It pulsed with a faint flicker of light, as if in confirmation.

This had to be the place. But what was special about it? He examined the statue carefully and saw nothing unusual. Then the stone flickered again, sending out another pulse of guidance. He instinctively looked upward and launched himself into the air.

That was when he noticed: at the statue's chest—right where the heart would be—there was a cavity. Its shape roughly matched the blood-red stone, but the size difference was absurd. The cavity measured several yards across, while the stone barely filled his palm.

Frowning, he flew closer.

And stopped dead.

Someone was already inside the cavity, clutching a recording crystal and apparently documenting something. Their eyes met. Both stared blankly at each other.
