Seeing the Phoenix Sword hovering before her, Qin Lian'er blinked, then instinctively reached out and grasped it.

CLANG!!!

The sword shuddered violently, and a pillar of sword qi tore through Li Xueyi's barrier, churning the skies above.

"This is..."

Li Xueyi staggered, her face losing a shade of color. But her eyes were locked on the Phoenix Sword:

"An Emperor weapon! This is an Emperor weapon!"

Qin Hao's jaw dropped, though his first instinct was to check on his wife:

"Xueyi, are you alright?"

She shook her head. The Phoenix Sword had forcefully ruptured her barrier, leaving her aura slightly disrupted, but she wasn't injured.

The sword's rampage didn't last long.

One figure after another materialized around the residence. A collective shout rang out, and together they sealed the entire estate. Moments later, the ancestral elders appeared in the courtyard.

They stared at Qin Lian'er, faces full of astonishment.

"A divine body? And an Emperor weapon?"

The Phoenix Sword hovered beside Qin Lian'er like a loyal guardian.

At the Emperor weapon level, blades possessed sufficient sentience to choose their own master.

The Fourth Ancestor arrived as well. One look at Qin Lian'er, then immediately to Qin Jiang—divine body, Emperor weapon, this had his fingerprints all over it.

"Your handiwork?"

The Fourth Ancestor phrased it as a question, but his tone left no room for doubt.

Qin Jiang spread his hands:

"I had a dream..."

"Enough. Stop."

The Fourth Ancestor cut him off.

'Every time with this excuse. What kind of dreams are you having where everything comes true?'

Qin Jiang shrugged. Believe it or not—that's what happened.

The ancestral elders didn't bother pressing either. However Qin Jiang had done it, gaining a Divine Body holder and an Emperor weapon was nothing but good news for the family.

That said, with Qin Lian'er now possessing a Divine Body, her status within the clan would naturally rise. First order of business: upgrading her personal guard.

"Lian'er, this old man will assign you a new set of guards. Would you like to come help choose?"

The Fourth Ancestor wore a warm smile, his voice gentle.

Qin Jiang blinked. 'He's never that nice when he's talking to me.'

"Guards?

But I already have plenty."

As the Qin family's little princess, her current protection wasn't at Qin Jiang's level, but it was still among the best.

The Fourth Ancestor chuckled:

"Your current guards are too weak. I'll get you stronger ones."

"Oh, well..."

She was about to agree when Qin Jiang cut in:

"I have a unit that would work perfectly as Lian'er's guard."

"You?"

The Fourth Ancestor looked surprised.

Everything Qin Jiang had was provided by the family—or so he thought. 'Does this kid have hidden forces?'

Qin Jiang smiled cryptically and clapped his hands.

Figures flickered into view. In the blink of an eye, the courtyard was packed with silhouettes:

"The 360 Songstresses greet the Master!"

Every figure dropped to one knee before Qin Jiang in perfect unison.

The Fourth Ancestor and company gawked.

They hadn't sensed a single one of these women hiding nearby!

Qin Hao and Li Xueyi were equally startled.

These women seemed to have been in the courtyard all along, yet not one person had detected them. If they'd been enemies...

The thought made everyone's expressions darken slightly.

"Rise."

Qin Jiang smiled.

This was a system reward—360 Songstresses. Three hundred sixty beautiful women, and powerful ones at that: 36 Saints and 324 Unity Realm cultivators.

Individually, nothing extraordinary.

But they possessed a Combined Strike Art. When all three hundred sixty fought as one, they could match a Nine Tribulations Supreme!

Nine Tribulations Supreme—among the absolute pinnacle of the Heavenly Mystery Continent.

Of course, their actual cultivation wasn't at that level. The reason they'd evaded the Fourth Ancestor's senses wasn't skill—it was because Qin Jiang had just summoned them a moment ago.

Coming back to their senses, the Fourth Ancestor and the others studied the parade of beautiful figures, and their expressions gradually turned peculiar. All eyes drifted to Qin Jiang.

The Fourth Ancestor sighed:

"Young people really should learn moderation."

Qin Lian'er's big eyes darted from face to face, practically buzzing with excitement:

"Big brother, are these all sisters-in-law?"

Qin Jiang: "???"

"Sigh, I didn't know you already had so many, big brother. Do you still want the one I snatched for you?"

She was still thinking about pawning off her kidnapping victim.

Qin Jiang's face went dark:

"What are you talking about? These are guards I'm giving you."

Doubt flickered in Qin Lian'er's eyes. 'Not sisters-in-law?'

But when she looked at those beautiful faces—and then at Qin Jiang's thunderous expression—understanding dawned.

He was embarrassed!

He wanted to use her as a cover.

After all, as the Qin family's young lord, being labeled a skirt-chaser would invite criticism.

Resolution hardened on Qin Lian'er's small face:

"Don't worry, big brother. I'll take good care of the sisters-in-law!

They'll stay with me normally, and whenever you need them, I'll send them right over!"

What on earth?

Seeing Qin Lian'er's deadly serious expression, Qin Jiang suspected she'd gotten completely the wrong idea.

The Fourth Ancestor and the others stifled their laughter.

But studying the 360 Songstresses more carefully, the Fourth Ancestor frowned:

"Jiang'er, these women aren't weak, but without any Supremes among them, I'm afraid..."

In his view, a Divine Body holder needed Supreme-level protection at minimum.

Finally back on topic. Qin Jiang took a breath:

"Don't worry.

They cultivate a Combined Strike Art. With all three hundred sixty working together, they can punch above their weight and slay Supremes.

Against even a Nine Tribulations Supreme, they'd stand a fighting chance."

"Fight a Nine Tribulations Supreme?"

The Fourth Ancestor's mouth fell open:

"This old man hasn't read many books, so don't try to fool me."

When he remained skeptical, Qin Jiang smiled mysteriously:

"How about you test them yourself?"

"I'm a Great Emperor. Picking on a group of Saints and Unity cultivators? I'd be a laughingstock."

He shook his head and turned to the other elders:

"One of you, go give them a try."

"Wait—"

Qin Jiang quickly intervened:

"Fourth Ancestor, their Combined Strike Art is extremely lethal. I'm worried the other elders can't handle it. Better if you go personally."

"Hey! Kid, are you looking down on us?"

"We're Supremes! You think we can't handle a bunch of Saints and Unity realm women?"

"I'll go. Let's see what these girls can do."

The ancestral elders bristled with indignation.

Qin Jiang shot the Fourth Ancestor a helpless look. He was genuinely worried an elder might not survive.
