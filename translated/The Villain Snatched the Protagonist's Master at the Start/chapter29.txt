【Ding! Host has altered a major plotline.

Reward: Time-Space Disc fragment (Immortal-grade treasure);

Reward: Sword Dao upgrade (Sword Intent may be upgraded to Sword Force);

Reward: Ten drops of Great Emperor blood essence;

Reward: Shadowless Sword (half-Emperor weapon; invisible, formless, untraceable—ideal for assassins);

Reward: Villain Points.】

After Qin Jiang's people had thrown Ye Xuan out of Rose Casino, the system's voice echoed in his mind.

The string of rewards brought a grin to his face.

Especially...

"A Time-Space Disc fragment? Immortal-grade treasure?"

Qin Jiang murmured.

He knew that beyond Great Emperor, even higher realms existed—he just didn't know the specifics. Could it be that above Great Emperor lay the path of immortals?

He sent his consciousness into the system space. A luminous white shard floated in the void. Qin Jiang reached out and grasped it:

"So this is the Time-Space Disc fragment?"

His lip twitched. This thing was probably less than a tenth of the complete disc.

He turned it over a few times. Apart from glowing, the fragment seemed to do absolutely nothing.

Then again, perhaps it was simply too advanced for Qin Jiang to comprehend at his current level.

Tossing it aside, he checked the other rewards.

The Sword Intent upgrade would allow his Sword Intent to evolve into Sword Force.

On the Heavenly Mystery Continent, comprehending Sword Intent alone was enough to be called a Sword Dao grandmaster. Sword Force was a level beyond—every swordsman who achieved it was considered a king among sword cultivators.

One stage above that was Sword Heart—true unity of self and sword, the mark of a Sword Dao sovereign.

At his current pace, it shouldn't be long before Qin Jiang comprehended Sword Heart.

Then there was the Great Emperor blood essence—ten full drops. Each contained traces of Great Emperor laws. Whether one could actually comprehend those laws was another matter.

Unlike the pure Great Emperor law he'd received before—essentially equivalent to creating a Great Emperor outright—blood essence was a tier below. But with luck, it could produce several Great Emperors.

The final reward was the Shadowless Sword. One look at its properties told Qin Jiang it was tailor-made for Yan Shiya—she was the head of an assassin organization, after all.

With the Shadowless Sword in hand, she'd be a tiger with wings.

"Not bad at all."

Qin Jiang nodded in satisfaction.

Ye Xuan was quite the cash cow.

Just then—

"Hm?"

His expression shifted. He pulled out the Seven Beauties Painting and unfurled it. Light flashed, and Yan Shiya's figure materialized before him.

Qin Jiang studied her:

"You've reached Supreme?"

Yan Shiya nodded, unable to fully suppress her joy:

"First Tribulation Supreme!"

"Impressive. Jumping straight from Unity Realm, bypassing the Saint Realm entirely, and reaching Supreme—all in three days.

The Seven Beauties Painting's current limit is Nine Tribulations Supreme. Shouldn't be long before you reach that level."

Qin Jiang smiled.

Yan Shiya understood the painting even better than he did, having essentially merged with it. Drawing on its power, she estimated that within a year, she could reach Nine Tribulations Supreme.

On the Heavenly Mystery Continent, Nine Tribulations Supreme was the absolute peak.

After all, one step beyond that was Great Emperor.

"However..."

Qin Jiang's tone shifted. He gazed at Yan Shiya's exquisite features:

"You've received your reward. Don't you think it's time to give something in return?"

Yan Shiya's body trembled, her cheeks flushing crimson.

But thanks to the Seven Beauties Painting, she felt no aversion toward Qin Jiang—quite the opposite. She felt a deep affinity and was willing to fulfill any request he made.

"Shiya is willing to serve her master~"

She said softly, a touch of shyness in her voice.

This was the painting's effect. It hadn't altered Yan Shiya's personality—only her attitude toward Qin Jiang.

Her eyes found his as she asked quietly:

"What would Master have Shiya do?"

Several hours later.

Qin Jiang stretched, feeling thoroughly refreshed. As a Supreme-level cultivator, Yan Shiya's constitution was remarkable—aside from slight fatigue, she was perfectly fine.

Qin Jiang held her in his arms.

He glanced down, then flipped his palm to produce a flexible sword:

"Shiya, try this."

Yan Shiya took the sword and immediately sensed something extraordinary. She made a few casual slashes:

"Fine blade!"

"Channel your spiritual energy into it."

Yan Shiya nodded. A thread of spiritual energy flowed into the sword, and before her astonished eyes, the weapon simply vanished. Yet she could still feel its presence distinctly.

Neither sight nor divine sense could detect it.

"Master, this sword..."

"A half-Emperor weapon. The Shadowless Sword. Like it?"

"A half-Emperor weapon!"

Yan Shiya's eyes widened. A half-Emperor weapon possessed a wisp of Emperor's might.

Even among the Nine Heavens, such a treasure would be coveted.

She withdrew her spiritual energy and the Shadowless Sword reappeared. She ran her fingers along the blade, clearly smitten.

"You seem to like it. It's yours."

Qin Jiang smiled.

Joy blossomed across Yan Shiya's face:

"Master, this sword is too precious. I..."

"It was always meant for you. No one else is suited for it."
