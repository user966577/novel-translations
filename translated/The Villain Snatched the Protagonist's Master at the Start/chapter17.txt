Face to face once more, Ye Ling'er found herself at a complete loss for words.

Especially given Xiao Fan's embarrassing state.

Meanwhile, Xiao Fan's expression was growing colder by the second. He'd seen it all—Ye Ling'er's instinctive retreat, the flash of disgust in her eyes.

And then there was the easy intimacy between her and Qin Jiang.

Each observation was a blade twisting in his chest.

His hatred for Qin Jiang was gradually shifting toward Ye Ling'er as well.

"What are you here for? To laugh at me?"

Xiao Fan's face was ice.

Qin Jiang shrugged, offering nothing. But Ye Ling'er tried to explain.

"That's not it, we—"

"Shut up!"

Xiao Fan snarled.

He didn't dare lash out at Qin Jiang, but he had no such reservations with Ye Ling'er.

Ye Ling'er flinched.

"Xiao Fan, I—"

"Hah, so it's 'Xiao Fan' now?"

He sneered, dripping with sarcasm.

Ye Ling'er faltered. Xiao Fan's behavior bore no resemblance to the gentle, refined man she'd known.

It was as though he'd become an entirely different person.

"Xiao Fan, watch yourself."

Qin Jiang's voice carried a warning edge.

Xiao Fan's bluster wilted. Resentment churned inside him, but he didn't dare talk back.

He could only glare at Ye Ling'er, snort coldly, and fall silent.

This display of cowardice toward the strong and cruelty toward the weak left Ye Ling'er bewildered. Was this really who Xiao Fan was?

Helplessly, she looked to Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang sighed, scooping her into his arms—a sight that made Xiao Fan's blood boil.

"Xiao Fan, Ling'er and I came here to tell you one thing. From now on, Ling'er has nothing to do with your Xiao family.

"In the future, if you provoke me again, don't expect mercy."

With that, Qin Jiang carried Ye Ling'er away.

Xiao Fan stood rooted in place, chest heaving, fists clenched white. He watched their retreating figures.

"Qin Jiang... Ye Ling'er...

"Damn you. Damn you both!"

He hissed, eyes blazing with hatred.

His rage toward Qin Jiang had finally ensnared Ye Ling'er too. In Xiao Fan's mind, Qin Jiang's original target had been Ye Ling'er.

If not for her, the Qin family wouldn't have broken off the engagement, and he wouldn't have fallen this low.

Xiao Fan was deluding himself, shifting all blame onto her.

"Just wait. You adulterous pair—you'll pay for this!"

---

"What's wrong? Still upset?"

Qin Jiang looked at Ye Ling'er, pinching her cheek.

She gazed back at him, crestfallen. Then she glanced over her shoulder, puzzled.

"Why does a person change so much in such a short time?"

She was talking about Xiao Fan, naturally.

Qin Jiang smiled faintly.

"Maybe you never saw the real him. Not until now.

"A person's true face only emerges under extreme circumstances. Your life before was too sheltered."

"I see."

Ye Ling'er nodded.

She lowered her head, lost in thought.

Qin Jiang didn't press further. Say too much and it would feel calculated. Better to let Ye Ling'er fill in the blanks herself.

The Chen estate.

Chen Lie eyed the guards trailing his daughter and swallowed hard. Any one of them was stronger than he was.

"Ningbing...

"Who exactly is he?"

He asked curiously.

Chen Ningbing's gaze swept across the guards. She sighed, then pointed skyward.

"He's the sky above this entire domain."

It took Chen Lie a moment. Then realization hit.

Azure City Town lay within the Qin Domain. The sky above this domain...

Was naturally the Qin family.

"The Qin family!"

He gasped. For cultivators in the Qin Domain, the Qin family was the heavens themselves.

Even an ordinary Qin family disciple would be treated as a visiting dignitary.

And Qin Jiang's bearing, plus the caliber of his guards, marked him as far more than ordinary.

Excitement sparked in Chen Lie's eyes.

Connecting with the Qin family could launch the Chen family into the stratosphere!

"Ningbing, our Chen family's future rests on your shoulders!"

Chen Lie was overjoyed, rubbing his hands together.

"Yes, all on your shoulders. I'll call the elders right now—transfer the patriarch title to you, and the city lordship too."

"Hold on!"

Chen Ningbing stared at her father as if he'd lost his mind.

"Why would you dump all that on me?"

"What do you mean, 'dump'?"

Chen Lie's expression froze. But on second thought... the Chen family and Azure City Town really were burdens.

To the Qin family, his meager assets wouldn't be worth a second glance.

The realization stung. He couldn't even afford a proper dowry for his daughter.

"Well..."

Chen Lie fidgeted awkwardly.

Chen Ningbing thought for a moment.

"There's nothing the family can do for me. Unless..."

"Unless what?"

"You and Mother give me a little sister."

Chen Lie: "???"

His face was a canvas of question marks. But understanding dawned quickly, and he glared at her, ears burning.

"What nonsense!"

Seeing her father's refusal, Chen Ningbing rolled her eyes.

"Then there's really nothing else you can do for me."

Chen Lie: "..."

He looked at her, actually wavering. Maybe...

Have another one?

Then again, he couldn't guarantee it'd be a girl. Plus, at his age, he was a bit... past his prime.

His wife already complained about his performance.

"I'll... try my best."

Chen Lie managed painfully.

Of course, any help from that quarter was at least fifteen years away.

Chen Ningbing had only been joking and didn't take it seriously. Her father, however, was genuinely considering it.

Whether he'd succeed...

That depended on his constitution.

"Oh, and there's this."

Chen Ningbing produced a jade bottle and carefully poured out a pill.

"He said these are Marrow Cleansing Pills—they purify the body and enhance talent.

"I'm keeping one. The rest are for the family's disciples."

To the Qin family, Marrow Cleansing Pills were nothing special. But for the Chen family, they were invaluable treasures.

Chen Lie's eyes glowed. Then hesitation crept in.

"He gave those to you. Giving them to us... wouldn't that be inappropriate?"

"He said I could do whatever I wanted with them. Besides, to him, these are basically garbage. He practically looked like he was taking out the trash when he handed them over."

Chen Ningbing recalled Qin Jiang's expression with a helpless sigh.

Chen Lie: "..."

For a moment, he felt like crawling into a hole. His most prized treasures were another man's trash.

He sighed, then accepted the pills.

A grin spread across his face. With these, the family could produce several genuine talents.

'Garbage is garbage.'

For the Chen family, it was still the good stuff.

Then he looked eagerly at Chen Ningbing.

"Any other garbage?"

Seeing her father's greedy face, Chen Ningbing reluctantly produced a few more items—all gifts from Qin Jiang. Practically trash disposal on his part.
