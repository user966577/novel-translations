*Knock, knock, knock.*

Outside Li Qingqiu's courtyard, the Li ancestor rapped gently. "Qingqiu, are you done training?"

A gust of frigid wind answered, pushing the gate open on its own. The courtyard was bitterly cold — a product of her physique. She sat in a stone chair, gazing at a bare tree. The Li ancestor approached. There was no other seat, and she obviously wasn't going to offer one.

He stood before her and paused. "Qingqiu, we have a guest."

"Mm."

He was long accustomed to this. "A very special guest."

"Mm."

"He mentioned you."

"Mm."

"..."

He paused, then pushed forward. "Aren't you curious why?"

"No."

The old man suppressed a sigh. Time for the direct approach. "This person is a pervert. He brought you up because he most likely wants you to... keep him company."

That finally earned a glance.

Seeing her reaction, he pressed on. "Huaxia — you've heard of them. An Immortal King behind them, undeniably the strongest force in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Just today, they wiped the Zhao family from existence — bloodline and all. Now Huaxia's Manor Lord is staying with us, and he's asked about you. I tried to stall by saying you were in seclusion, but now..."

His smile was pained. Of all the timing.

Li Qingqiu lowered her eyes. A long silence. "What does the ancestor want from me?"

"We can't afford to offend Huaxia. The Zhao family is the warning." In a situation like this, the whole family's survival came first. Whatever Qin Jiang wanted, the old man would do his best to provide. Even if it meant...

"I understand." Li Qingqiu looked down again.

The ancestor opened his mouth but found nothing more to say. Looking at her, bitterness filled his eyes. He forced a thin smile. "He mentioned you, but it might not be what I'm thinking..."

"Mm."

"Well, you just had a breakthrough. I won't disturb you. If anything comes up, I'll... I'll come get you."

He left the courtyard.

In the guest quarters, Qin Jiang and the women had all seen Li Qingqiu's ice phoenix display.

"That woman — is she the Li family heir you mentioned?" An Xihe asked.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. "That's her. Not bad at all."

"Lecher!" The women rolled their eyes in unison.

Jian Yao tilted her head, curious. "How did you know the Li family's heir was a beauty?" She herself hadn't known, and she was from here. Plus, Qin Jiang had spent all his pre-departure time saying goodbye — he hadn't done any research.

Qin Jiang tapped his nose with a grin. "This nose of mine can detect a beauty from a hundred miles away."

"Ew." The women looked disgusted. They knew he was full of it. Even if he could somehow smell beauty, how would he know she was the heir? They didn't push further, but they understood — another sister was incoming.

"Her aura feels like solid ice. Cold personality, probably."

"Must be the physique."

"Cold personality's no problem — Qin Jiang runs hot. He'll thaw her out in no time."

"Hehe, actually, I'm curious whether her body is cold too..."

The women chattered among themselves. They had absolute faith in Qin Jiang — any woman he set his sights on was as good as caught.

Qin Jiang sauntered over, arms spread wide, and gathered them close. "Enough about her. Let me check if my darlings are cold..."

"I'm not cold!"

"Me neither!"

"I am! Qin Jiang, I'm so cold~ Hold me..."

"You little shrimp, that's disgusting! Qin Jiang~ come hold me instead~"

Laughter and squeals filled the courtyard. Eventually they tumbled inside, each claiming to be freezing. Qin Jiang had no choice but to warm them up personally. The results were highly effective — before long, everyone was sweating.

By the next morning, Qin Jiang emerged from a tangle of soft warmth. The women stirred awake too. One night was nothing — appetizer at best. They were all veterans.

"Are we going to meet our new sister today?" Qing Chan asked, rubbing her eyes.

Mo Mo bounced off the bed and skipped to Qin Jiang. "If you're meeting her, you have to look your best."

"Absolutely — first impressions are everything!" Jian Yao agreed.

An Xihe joined in, and together the women fussed over Qin Jiang's appearance. He was indifferent. First impressions? Irrelevant. Hardly any of his women had liked him at first sight, and they were all completely devoted now. But he had to admit — with some effort, he could go from very handsome to devastatingly handsome.

The women stepped back, appraised him head to toe, and nodded with glowing eyes.

"God, he's gorgeous."

"I want to kiss him."

"I want *him.*"

They looked ready to pounce. An Xihe reined them in. "Enough, hands off! This look is our welcome gift to our new sister. No matter how cold she is, one look at him and her ice will crack."

The others pouted but agreed. Qin Jiang examined himself and was satisfied. Extremely handsome indeed.

"Off I go, then?"

The women nodded and pumped their little fists. "Go get her! Bring our sister back!"

"Count on it."

Qin Jiang smiled. Bringing her back was guaranteed — willing or not, Li Qingqiu was coming home with him.
