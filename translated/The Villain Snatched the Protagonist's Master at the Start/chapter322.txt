After several rounds of "one last time," Qin Jiang finally escaped the honey trap.

Ye Ling'er entered seclusion. With the immortal-path law, her breakthrough to the immortal path shouldn't take long inside the Space-Time Temple.

He pulled his gaze from her cultivation chamber and surveyed the other light orbs. Most of his women didn't need his attention right now.

Long Xin'er, for example, didn't need an immortal-path law. The Dragon Pearl she'd received on the Divine Dragon Continent contained the legacy of an immortal-path ancestor. That alone was enough to carry her through.

Xia Qianling's Mystic Yin Body, combined with the Mystic Yin Divine Scripture, only required cultivation resources. Reaching the immortal path would be effortless.

Xiao Jiu was the same — her atavistic Celestial Rabbit bloodline plus the immortal herb she'd consumed made her body and bloodline more than strong enough.

'All prodigies,' Qin Jiang marveled. If every one of them matured fully, he'd be the greatest sugar mama champion in all the myriad realms.

"But Susu needs an immortal-path law."

He looked toward Bai Susu. Her talent was exceptional, but at her current stage, a law would make the difference.

He teleported to her cultivation chamber and gently woke her. At the sight of him, her face burst into delight. She flew into his arms, bouncing with excitement, peppering him with questions.

Watching her, Qin Jiang recalled how they'd first met. Lian'er had kidnapped the girl and brought her to the Qin estate. Terrified and desperate, Bai Susu had endured every humiliation to protect the one thing she had left.

But Qin Jiang hadn't played fair. He'd gone straight for the endgame.

The tears she'd shed. The look in her eyes — pure hatred. And now...

The transformation was staggering.

He pinched her cheek, struck by a sudden urge to reminisce.

"Susu. Remember the first time we met?"

"The first time..." Her face reddened. She shot him a glare, hand pressing against his chest. "What are you getting at?"

"I want to."

"???"

She froze, then flushed with annoyance, swatting at him. "I'm asking what you want to do!"

"This..."

His gaze swept from her lips to the front, around to the back. Then, with perfect sincerity: "All of it."

"..."

She could read his eyes plainly enough. Combined with the mention of their first meeting, she knew exactly where this was going. She huffed, bit her lip, and murmured, "If you want to... then fine."

"Ahem." His eyes sparkled. "Actually, I was hoping you could resist a little. Like the first time..."

"You—"

Her body trembled. Reproachful eyes bored into him as she hissed, "Pervert."

"Heh. I just want to relive our memories. Those were beautiful times."

Beautiful? Bai Susu scoffed internally. There had been nothing beautiful about it from her perspective. That first meeting — it had started with her hands, then her lips, then her chest, and then...

Her defenses had crumbled step by step. She'd thought she could hold the final line, but this scoundrel had lied through his teeth, calling it the absolute last boundary — and then steamrolled straight through it.

He hadn't left her a shred of dignity.

Then again, looking back now... it had been thrilling. The occasional trip down memory lane wasn't so bad.

While she was lost in thought, Qin Jiang tilted her chin up and grinned. "Heh. Sorry, Susu. This is going to be a bit rough on you."

"..."

Were they in character already?

She blinked, thinking back to how the scene had originally played out. She was supposed to cry. But looking at his face — so annoyingly handsome — tears wouldn't come. She'd landed the jackpot.

With that thought, she rose on tiptoe and kissed him, eyes bright with joy.

Qin Jiang: "..."

That was not the script.

"Hehe. Hey there, handsome boy~ What's your name? Want to come home with big sister~?"

"???"

No. The roles were reversed.

Before he could object, Bai Susu had wrapped herself around him, face inches from his, breath warm against his skin.

"Handsome boy, big sister really likes you. Come home with me, and I'll take good care of you~"

"Susu—"

"Call me big sister!"

"..."

His face twitched. "...Big sister~"

"Hehe. Good boy~"

She beamed, hooked one arm around his neck, and patted his head with the other.

Then she leaned in and pecked his lips. "That's your reward~"

The brief kiss left her wanting more. She leaned in again — deeper this time, lingering. When she finally pulled away, satisfied, she cuddled against him.

"Such an obedient little brother. Big sister has more rewards. Want to try?"

"...What kind?"

He swallowed.

Bai Susu's smile turned radiant. She released his neck, guided him to sit, and slipped off her shoes and stockings.

Pale, delicate feet emerged. Qin Jiang's eyes heated.

She noticed — and was pleased. She'd long known this rogue's weakness for a woman's feet.

She lifted one leg and rested her foot on his shoulder. Flexible as she was, the position still let her lean close.

"Does little brother like it?"

"Very much."

The script had gone off the rails, but the results were good. He played along. He tilted his head — and caught his breath. Flawless. He reached out and cradled her foot. Drew in a deep breath.

Heavenly.

Bai Susu's face burned, but she watched him steadily. If it made him happy, she'd do anything, no matter how embarrassing.

"Qin Jiang... that tickles~"

A breathless protest. Her eyes glistened.

He chuckled, released her, and she exhaled with relief — then gracefully lowered herself to a new position. She looked up at him, teeth pressed into her lip, toes flexing slightly.

"Qin Jiang... is this okay~?"
