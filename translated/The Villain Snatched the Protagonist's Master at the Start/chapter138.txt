"Yao!"

Qin Jiang glanced at Jian Yao. She understood immediately—her lips pursed slightly in disapproval, but she nodded anyway.

Subduing this little loli was important for Qin Jiang's safety, after all.

Her eyes flashed. She'd been holding her power at the ready since the unsealing, and now, while the Demon Hall Founder was still reveling in her freedom, Jian Yao struck.

"Hm?" The Founder snapped to attention. "What are you doing?"

Her combat experience was vast, and she reacted instantly, meeting the attack head-on. But millions of years of imprisonment had taken their toll—combined with the power she'd burned through breaking the seal, she had less than a tenth of her former strength.

The moment they clashed, she knew she was outmatched.

Jian Yao relaxed. At this level, handling the Founder was effortless.

After a brief probing exchange, Jian Yao stopped holding back. Her full immortal-path power bore down on the Founder without mercy. Qin Jiang stood nearby, channeling the Void Divine Temple's power to assist.

The temple was truly a supreme treasure—even an immortal-path battle couldn't damage it. Better yet, the power Qin Jiang drew from it was enough to contend with an immortal-path cultivator, at least marginally.

Together, he and Jian Yao overwhelmed the Founder without much difficulty. Jian Yao struck several times in rapid succession, sealing the Founder's cultivation point by point.

"Qin Jiang!"

The Demon Hall Founder's face was thunderous. She glared at him, her power completely locked down.

Jian Yao wiped sweat from her brow. "Done. But my seal won't hold forever—you'd better move fast."

Qin Jiang nodded and approached the Founder.

She was petite—barely five foot two—with long purple hair and faintly crimson eyes that blended the sinister with the seductive. Her delicate face still carried a hint of baby fat, like an exquisite porcelain doll. Devastatingly cute.

He'd never imagined the mighty Demon Hall Founder, an immortal-path existence, would look like this.

He couldn't resist reaching out and pinching her cheek.

"You're dead!" she snarled, killing intent blazing in her crimson eyes. But with her power sealed and body immobilized, she couldn't so much as flinch. All she could do was glare.

"Pretty cute, actually," Qin Jiang said with a smile, giving her cheek a little tug.

Her expression grew even colder, those crimson eyes regarding him like a corpse.

He released her face, then scooped her up in his arms and turned to Jian Yao. "Yao..."

"Shameless," Jian Yao muttered, rolling her eyes. But she nodded. She needed to keep watch over the Founder—sealed or not, an immortal-path powerhouse might have hidden cards. What if she broke free and killed Qin Jiang while Jian Yao was elsewhere?

With her agreement secured, Qin Jiang chuckled, waved his hand, and a room materialized out of the Void Divine Temple's infinite space.

He carried the Demon Hall Founder inside, Jian Yao following close behind.

What followed was...

"Qin Jiang! Touch me and I'll kill you!" The Founder's threatening voice echoed from within.

Qin Jiang was not a man easily cowed by threats.

Jian Yao's voice chimed in too: "Tch. All bark and no bite. Wait till it's over—then we'll see if you can actually bring yourself to hurt him."

Women understood women best. No matter how powerful or fierce, every woman had a soft spot buried deep down.

"A being of the immortal path, willingly submitting to a man—you're a disgrace to the immortal path!"

"I like it. Got a problem with that?"

Jian Yao wasn't one to back down. Every barb the Founder threw, she returned with interest. Then she turned to Qin Jiang impatiently:

"What are you waiting for? Hurry up."

"Qin Jiang—I will kill you!!!"
