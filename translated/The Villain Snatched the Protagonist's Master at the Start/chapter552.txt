"Give me some~"

She swayed against him, her voice no longer pleading but playful. Qin Jiang's kiss had given her all the confidence she needed.

He smiled, kissed her cheek, and murmured, "Sweetheart, the city lord is right outside. He's still technically your husband, and these walls aren't soundproof. You really want to do this here?"

She shivered at the mention of the city lord, her blush deepening. Then she clung tighter, practically vibrating.

"Forget about him! He's not my husband! My lord—darling—hurry, please~"

"Really? Just forget about him?"

"Yes! He's useless! Can't even perform, so he gives his wife away! Let him listen! Let him hear his wife calling someone else 'darling' and giving him a green hat! Darling, darling, darling—please~"

She was clever. She'd caught the flicker of excitement in Qin Jiang's eyes and played right into it, deliberately raising her voice. Outside the door, the city lord could hear every word.

Qin Jiang looked at her—face scarlet but eyes blazing with undeniable thrill. His restraint crumbled. He swept her up, strode to the bed, and tossed her onto it, then followed.

She gasped and gazed up at him, hands sliding around his neck. Nervousness flickered in her eyes. This was really happening.

Meanwhile, outside, the city lord crouched by the door with his head in his hands. He'd heard everything she said. Sending her had been his idea. But hearing her words left a bitter taste. The worst part was that she'd probably meant every single one.

That was the real killer.

Her voice kept drifting out—sounds he'd never heard from her before. In a way, he was experiencing things secondhand.

That was all he could do.

Looking back, he'd spent years avoiding her out of shame and guilt. Forget intimacy—they'd barely crossed paths. He took a deep breath. Maybe he never should have tied down a woman he couldn't satisfy. And now, this was his chance to set things right—give her freedom, let her start over. He could only hope Qin Jiang would be a good man to her. Call it his penance.

Having made his peace, the sourness faded. He sat outside while the sounds grew more intense. A hint of worry crossed his face. It was her first time—she wouldn't break, would she? Nominally, she was still his wife.

Time passed. Four full hours.

Her voice had grown noticeably hoarse, though tinged with something alluring. Not that it mattered to him. Nothing stirred.

Finally, with a long, drawn-out cry, the room went quiet.

The city lord flinched. Her first time, and Qin Jiang had already made her... He stared at the door, feelings a tangled mess.

After a long silence, whispered conversation drifted out—something about comfort, cleaning up.

Another hour passed before the door opened. She emerged nestled against Qin Jiang, her face flushed and radiant.

The city lord had never seen her like this. For a moment, he could only stare. A pang of regret struck. His wife had this side to her, and he'd never known. But with him, that side would have stayed hidden forever.

He sighed. Too late for regrets. Even setting aside the power gap, she'd clearly moved on. If he was being honest, her heart had never truly been his—their marriage had always been transactional. She maintained the facade; he provided stability.

But comfort bred desire. And he couldn't satisfy that desire. Other men were all his subordinates—none would dare touch her. So she'd endured, her own efforts only making the frustration worse.

Now, at last, she'd been truly satisfied.

Seeing the city lord, she smiled warmly. "Thank you. If not for you, I'd never have met my husband. I'm truly grateful."

The city lord's face locked up.

She meant it sincerely. If not for marrying him, she'd have wed someone else and never crossed paths with Qin Jiang. And even if she had, she wouldn't have been pure enough to deserve him. Thanks to the city lord's condition, she'd remained untouched for years—and that had given her the confidence to face Qin Jiang.

Her gratitude was genuine. The city lord's suffering was his alone to bear. He managed a strained smile. "As long as you're both happy."

"Your little surprise was quite nice. I'm very pleased." Qin Jiang chuckled, then looked down at the woman and tilted her chin up. She rose on tiptoe and kissed him—right in front of the city lord.

Their lips parted. Qin Jiang tapped her mouth playfully. "So soft. Sweet."

"Hehe. Like it?"

"Very much."

"Then you have to kiss me every day~"

She grinned impishly. Qin Jiang nodded and kissed her again, then turned to the city lord, pulling the woman close.

"I'm quite taken with your wife. Mind giving her to me?"

The city lord's face went wooden.

The woman blushed and buried herself in Qin Jiang's chest, pressing against him. She wanted more already.

Seeing her reaction, Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. He didn't bother lowering his voice. "Again?"

"Mm~"

She nodded shyly. Qin Jiang shook his head with a laugh and scooped her up. He glanced at the city lord.

"We'll stay a bit longer. Think it over. Let me tend to her first—and review some newly acquired material."

With that, he carried her back into the room.
