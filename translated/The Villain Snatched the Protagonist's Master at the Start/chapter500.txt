At full strength, Wu Yingtao was thoroughly conquered.

Qin Jiang looked down at the girl curled in his arms. Ancient God bloodline or not -- in his presence, she'd submit.

Second Brother was undefeated!

Satisfaction radiated from his face. As for Wu Yingtao, she was finally and completely sated, content in his arms.

But her thoughts eventually drifted back to Wu Tian, and sadness crept into her eyes. Her brother -- her only family -- was gone. She didn't even know when the possession had happened. There hadn't been a goodbye.

And if not for Qin Jiang, she'd still be in the dark, handing her cultivation resources to an imposter. Like a fool counting money for the man who'd robbed her.

Her fists tightened. She would avenge him.

Qin Jiang felt her mood shift. He squeezed her gently. "You still have me. I'll avenge your brother."

"Mm."

With her own strength, she couldn't be sure of victory. But Qin Jiang was the lord of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Even a Heavenly Domain powerhouse would have to think twice. After all, the imposter was hiding for a reason.

She'd figured it out now. Wu Tian's insistence on concealing his talent wasn't humility -- he was afraid of being exposed.

She felt foolish in hindsight. Such an obvious transformation, and she'd never questioned it. She'd even been happy about it. If her real brother knew...

He comforted her until her spirits lifted. They cleaned up and emerged to find the other women socializing on the airship.

Qin Jiang introduced Wu Yingtao, who quickly warmed to the group. The women were always welcoming of new sisters -- after all, their ongoing objective was to one day collectively defeat Qin Jiang. More allies were always welcome.

"Yingtao is very strong," Qin Jiang noted.

That got their attention. A personal endorsement from him meant the new girl was no ordinary addition.

When they learned about Wu Tian's possession, the women rallied behind Wu Yingtao, vowing to help her get revenge.

Qin Jiang cautioned them. "Don't do anything reckless. He's no ordinary enemy. Most likely, he's from the Heavenly Domain. If I'm right, he was once an Immortal Emperor. He's not at peak strength, but he could still have hidden trump cards."

"An Immortal Emperor?" Shock rippled through the group. An Xihe, the strongest person in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, was only an Immortal King -- still a considerable distance from Immortal Emperor.

"Almost certainly. He probably offended someone stronger in the Heavenly Domain and fled here as a remnant soul. Even so, we can't let our guard down."

They nodded. Even a remnant Immortal Emperor demanded caution. Beings at that level always kept aces up their sleeves.

"You knew he was dangerous, and you went alone?" An Xihe appeared at Qin Jiang's side, glaring. "What if something had happened?"

"I didn't know he was an Immortal Emperor before we got there..."

He lied without missing a beat.

"Besides, you were tired at the time."

Her cheeks colored. "Whose fault was that! Next time you go anywhere near him, I'm coming with you."

He agreed readily.

She turned to Wu Yingtao. "I'll help you get revenge."

As the sole Immortal King of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, her word carried weight.

"Thank you, Sister Xihe."

"We're family -- no need for thanks. But when the time comes and we need your strength, you'd better bring everything you've got." She glanced at Qin Jiang as she spoke. The "time" she meant was obvious.

"Whatever Sister Xihe needs, I'll give my all," Wu Yingtao said earnestly.

The other women giggled. "Don't be so serious! What Xihe means is -- when we take on this one." They pointed at Qin Jiang.

Wu Yingtao blinked, then blushed as understanding dawned. She'd witnessed their collective "battles" against Qin Jiang from afar.

She nodded shyly. "I'll do my best."

"If even hubby acknowledges her strength, there can't be many of us who match her."

"I don't know if I'm actually that strong..."

"If hubby says so, you definitely are!"

Qin Jiang shrugged. "She really is strong. You'll see for yourselves. I'd say she's not far behind Xihe."

"Really?" An Xihe was intrigued. Wu Yingtao's cultivation level was still quite low -- could her physique really be that impressive?

A shame she hadn't fully recovered. Otherwise, she'd have organized a joint expedition right then and there.
