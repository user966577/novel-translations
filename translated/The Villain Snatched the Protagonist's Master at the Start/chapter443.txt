After she'd eaten her fill, Xue Yue rested her head on Qin Jiang's lap.

He looked down and ruffled her hair. "Is Yueyue full?"

"Mm-hmm~"

"Did you like it?"

"I liked it~" Xue Yue nodded.

She gazed up at him, her pink tongue flicking across her lips — adorable and seductive in equal measure. Qin Jiang smiled, took her hand, and pulled her up into his arms. "Since Yueyue likes it, how about I make you porridge more often?"

"Yes please~" She nodded obediently, nestling into his chest.

Just then, Liu Shuwan and the others emerged from their rooms and made their way over. Seeing Xue Yue looking slightly worn out, they shot Qin Jiang a look. "Did you bully little Yueyue again?"

"I did no such thing. In fact, I just made her porridge. She ate every last drop." He shrugged.

Xue Yue's cheeks flushed. She squirmed free of his arms, stood up, and greeted the other women. Qin Jiang shook his head, rose to his feet, and grinned at the group. "Are you ladies hungry? I've still got porridge."

"As if! You pervert — we don't want your porridge." Their faces tinged pink as they scoffed in unison.

These past few days, with only the handful of them at Qin Jiang's side, they'd been drinking porridge practically every night. They were about to burst. He didn't press the issue — he'd save it for them anyway. They'd come around eventually.

He turned to Yue Weiwei with a mischievous grin. "Weiwei, want to play a little game with me?"

"What kind of game?" She blushed. Being around Qin Jiang meant a constant rotation of new games, each one more addictive than the last. She quite enjoyed them. Curiosity flickered in her eyes as she wondered what the next one would be.

He glanced at Xue Yue. "This one was actually Yueyue's idea."

"Yueyue's idea?" The women looked at Xue Yue in surprise. She waved her hands, face red. "Not that kind of game!"

She knew perfectly well what sort of games Qin Jiang played with them. But what she'd proposed was simply messing with Nangong Yun.

"Yueyue says Nangong Yun loves to fill in the blanks with his own imagination," Qin Jiang explained. "So we play along with whatever he's imagined and put on a show for him."

"Oh, that kind of game?" Weiwei sounded a touch disappointed, but she didn't spoil the mood. "What exactly did he imagine? How do we act it out?"

"Want to guess?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

Weiwei blinked, then pointed at herself. "Does his fantasy... involve me?"

"Hehe, smart girl." He pulled her into his arms. "In Nangong Yun's version of events, you're currently enduring unspeakable suffering — you only became my woman for his sake, and you're living in utter misery."

Weiwei stared blankly. Enduring suffering for Nangong Yun's sake? Where did he get the audacity? They'd been master and disciple for barely a year, and she'd spent most of that time in cultivation. If not for her master's orders, she wouldn't have followed him at all. His constant pursuit already annoyed her. And he actually believed she'd sacrifice her virtue for him?

"He's not exactly bright, is he?" she said flatly.

"Agreed," Xue Yue nodded, disgust plain on her face.

Weiwei glanced between Xue Yue and Qin Jiang. This scoundrel really was something — in just a few days, he'd completely turned around a woman who'd been infatuated with Nangong Yun. Judging by her expression, she didn't just dislike him now — she was genuinely repulsed. 'Probably the same thing that happened to me.'

"And he's absolutely revolting — makes me want to gag!" Xue Yue added.

Weiwei's eyes widened. That was beyond mere annoyance — she found Nangong Yun physically sickening.

Qin Jiang ruffled Xue Yue's hair to calm her, then explained to Weiwei. "Nangong Yun thinks you're suffering at my side, so he went to Yueyue and asked her to help you."

"Help me? How?"

"He wanted Yueyue to 'share your burden.'"

Weiwei's brow furrowed. Even she found that nauseating. If he truly believed she was suffering, he should do something about it himself — not send another woman to take her place. What kind of logic was that?

Liu Shuwan and the others wore matching expressions of disgust. This Nangong Yun was truly worthless.

"And then he offered to 'compensate' me," Xue Yue spat. "His idea of compensation? His own body. Disgusting!"

Qin Jiang reached over and pulled her into his arms, patting her back to soothe her. Wrapped in his warmth, Xue Yue gradually calmed down.

Weiwei frowned. "That is disgusting."

"So Yueyue wants to put on a little show for him," Qin Jiang said with a smile. "Since he loves his fantasies so much, we'll act them out — give him a taste of his own delusions."

Weiwei thought for a moment. "So I need to play a woman being forced against her will, living in misery?"

"Exactly." He grinned. "Just like our usual roleplay sessions."

Her face went scarlet. Their usual roleplay sessions were far more intense than anything this act would require. Qin Jiang had directed all sorts of scenarios — the seductive teacher and the rebellious student, the handsome prisoner and the beautiful guard, the shady doctor and the naive patient... Over the past few weeks, Weiwei had performed enough roles that her acting chops were actually quite polished.

Playing a woman forced to serve a man she didn't love to protect the man she did? With Weiwei's experience, that would be a breeze. As for Xue Yue — her acting needed work, but with Qin Jiang directing, she'd manage. And Qin Jiang himself? A veteran actor. Any role, any scenario, executed without a single crack in the facade. A true master of the craft.
