The next day.

Qin Jiang set out for the Yan family with Yan Shiya and Yan Yun. Jian Yao, the Demon Hall Founder, and Liu Shuwan accompanied them for security, while the Fourth Ancestor and the rest stayed behind at Qin Family City.

Two immortal-path cultivators and a Great Emperor. Safety was not a concern.

The Yan family's territory wasn't far from Qin Family City. With two immortal-path powerhouses ferrying everyone at top speed, they arrived before sundown.

The Demon Hall Founder swept the compound with her spiritual sense, mapping the entire clan in an instant. "Not bad. Three Great Emperors sitting guard."

She looked at Qin Jiang, eyes bright with anticipation. "Let me handle this one."

She'd fully recovered her strength—and then some. The Heavenly Demon Pill had pushed her beyond her previous peak. After being sealed for millions of years, her only "action" since being freed had been bickering with Jian Yao. She hadn't drawn real blood yet.

Her fingers were itching.

Sensing Qin Jiang might refuse, she sweetened the pitch. "You want the Yan family wiped out, right? I have a secret technique that can kill every person who shares their bloodline—even those who aren't inside the compound."

Qin Jiang cut her off immediately. "Shiya and Yun'er are Yan bloodline too."

"Oh..." The Founder blinked. She'd gotten so caught up in the excitement that she'd forgotten that minor detail.

"Besides, there may be survivors from Shiya and Yun'er's branch. No bloodline techniques," Qin Jiang added.

The Founder glanced at the two women, a flicker of regret crossing her face, and nodded. "Fine."

"You and Yao'er can both go. No need for anything fancy—just crush them."

Qin Jiang smiled. Against a single clan, deploying two immortal-path cultivators was overkill of the highest order. If anything, the Yan family should feel honored.

The two women exchanged a look, competitive sparks flying.

"Race you?" the Founder challenged.

Jian Yao scoffed. "Against this garbage? What's the point? You like killing so much—have at it. They're all yours."

"All mine?"

The Founder paused, caught off guard. Jian Yao nodded, a sly smile playing on her lips as she wrapped herself around Qin Jiang's arm and pressed close. "Go on."

The Founder: "..."

She was doing it on purpose—flaunting her... advantages. The Founder huffed. 'So what if she's curvier? That's her only edge.'

Of course, the Founder wasn't exactly lacking either. A certain someone seemed quite fond of her figure too—especially when he made her wear twin tails.

...Her hair had been falling out.

"Go on, off with you," Jian Yao urged.

Qin Jiang, unbothered by their rivalry—they'd never actually come to blows, and the banter was entertaining—looked at the Founder with a smile. "Mo Mo, if you would."

Mo Mo. That was the Demon Hall Founder's real name. Qin Jiang always called her that.

She gave a petulant sniff, shot Jian Yao one last look, and nodded. "If she doesn't want in, that's her loss. There aren't enough of them for both of us anyway."

She was a genuine grand demoness. She'd killed countless people on her path to immortality. After millions of years without a fight, this handful of enemies was practically an appetizer.

Mo Mo launched herself toward the Yan family compound. Simultaneously, a tidal wave of demonic qi engulfed the entire estate. Within that churning darkness, the anguished wails of countless phantoms echoed—a sound to freeze the blood.

Every member of the Yan family went rigid with terror.

In an instant, their world went black. Then the screaming started—not the phantoms now, but real voices, real people, shrieking from every direction.

Fear spread like contagion.

From deep within the compound, three titanic auras erupted. Great Emperor pressure shoved back some of the demonic qi.

"Fellow Daoist, might we speak face to face?" one of the Yan family's Great Emperors called out, voice tight with strain.

In the first instant alone, nearly half the clan had perished. But the three elders dared not act rashly—the lethal pressure surrounding them was suffocating.

Before the words had fully left his mouth, the demonic qi around them coalesced into a giant fist and came crashing down. The three Great Emperors' eyes widened. They couldn't afford to take this lightly. Combining their strength, they met the blow head-on.

But the gap between immortal-path and Great Emperor was an uncrossable chasm.

The fist struck, and all three faces went white simultaneously. Death bore down on them like a physical weight.

"No!"

Before they could dodge, the boundless demonic qi engulfed them completely. It poured into their bodies through every pore—alive, hungry, unstoppable. Their internal energy went haywire, raging beyond all control.

The agonized screams were mercifully brief. Within a few breaths, the three Great Emperors had been reduced to desiccated husks. Then the husks exploded, releasing fresh torrents of demonic qi that plunged the entire compound back into darkness.

It was over in moments. The Yan family's people never even understood what was happening. They couldn't fight back, couldn't run. Demonic qi seeped through everything.

From start to finish—a handful of breaths.

Mo Mo dusted off her hands. The demonic qi flowed back to her like a loyal pet, and the Yan family compound fell silent. Not a single life force remained.

She flickered back to Qin Jiang's side. "Done."

"Immortal-path really is something else. Impressive!"

Qin Jiang gave her an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Mo Mo beamed. Since taking the Heavenly Demon Pill, her affinity toward Qin Jiang had grown steadily stronger, breeding a quiet dependency. His praise landed perfectly.

Nearby, Yan Shiya and Yan Yun stood in stunned silence. 'That's it?'

The enemies who'd haunted their nightmares—the unassailable foes they'd feared for a lifetime—had crumbled like paper.

Qin Jiang took both women by the hand and gave a gentle squeeze. "The people who hurt you have paid the price. There might be stragglers—I'll send people after them. And I'll have someone search for any surviving members of your branch. The grudge ends here. Let it go."

Yan Shiya's expression was complicated, but she nodded and murmured her assent. Yan Yun was less affected—she'd carried little hatred to begin with.

Qin Jiang smiled and looked toward the ruined compound. "Collect the spoils. Let's head back."
