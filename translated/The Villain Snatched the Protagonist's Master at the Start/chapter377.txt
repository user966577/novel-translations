"Could you... not let that poke me?"

Li Qingqiu's voice was softer than before. Qin Jiang shook his head. "Nope."

"You—" She bit down hard. She'd actually used a gentle tone, and he was still being difficult?

Seeing her frustration, Qin Jiang smiled and tipped her chin up. "Good news — your condition has improved considerably. The treatment is working."

"I'm not sick!"

"You are. Don't avoid the doctor because you're afraid of the diagnosis. Besides, sick people always say they're fine."

"..."

He pinched her cheek. "Relax. Your case is severe, but I'm fully confident I can cure you. Look how much better you're doing already! And I have a potent remedy — once I administer it, you'll be cured in no time."

"A potent remedy?"

Li Qingqiu's fist tightened. Based on his idea of "treatment" so far, she could imagine exactly what this remedy involved.

"That's right! Potent stuff. You'll love it."

"I don't want it!" She refused flatly, jaw set, eyes defiant.

Qin Jiang gave her a look. "You don't get a say. This is for your own good. Don't resist — I'm helping you."

"I'm not sick!"

"You are!"

"I'm not!"

"Are!"

"Am not!"

"Are!"

"Not!"

They argued back and forth. Li Qingqiu glared at him, every trace of icy detachment gone. Qin Jiang observed for a moment, then grinned. "Is today the most you've ever talked in one day?"

She paused. Counting the sentences... it really might be. She'd never argued with anyone like this before. Usually, nothing mattered enough.

But if she didn't fight back now, this man would actually administer the "remedy." That she cared about.

Meeting his gaze, she took a deep breath. "I am really not sick."

"You really are. Otherwise, why would your emotions be so flat? You didn't even react to seeing me. Definitely sick."

"My emotions are flat because of my physique! And why should I react to seeing you? If anyone's sick, it's you!"

"Your physique? But your emotions seem pretty unstable right now. Is that the physique too?"

"..."

Li Qingqiu was on the verge of losing it. Her teeth ground together. For the first time in her life, genuine anger flashed in her eyes. Unstable? Whose fault was that?

"See? One minute you're an ice block, the next you're furious. Clearly your physique is malfunctioning. But don't worry — my remedy can stabilize that too."

"I don't want it! I don't want it! I DON'T WANT IT!"

She very nearly screamed. But the instant the words left her mouth, Qin Jiang sealed her lips with his.

Her eyes went wide. She pushed at him, then resorted to hitting when pushing failed. Eventually, gasping for air, he released her.

She panted hard and glared at him, but ultimately dropped her gaze in defeat.

"The ancestor told me about you yesterday." Her composure was returning — or perhaps she'd simply given up.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Oh? What did he say?"

"He said—" She stopped herself. The ancestor hadn't said a single nice thing. If she repeated it, would the Li family be in danger?

"Ha ha, nothing flattering, I'm guessing."

Li Qingqiu kept quiet. Her verbal skills were limited — say too much and she'd slip up. Meanwhile, Qin Jiang's hands had found their targets with unerring precision.

"Let me guess. He told you I'm no good — probably called me a pervert, right?"

A flash of surprise in her eyes. He knew?

Of course he knew. He had perfectly accurate self-awareness and knew exactly what other people thought of him. In fact, he agreed with the assessment.

"And he probably implied you should keep me company?"

Silence. But silence was its own answer.

Qin Jiang chuckled. "Old Li knows me well. Qingqiu — come with me."

"???"

Just like that? She'd braced herself after the ancestor's warning, but she'd pictured someone who'd at least pretend to be civilized. This man didn't even try. He was nothing like any man she'd ever met.

She had zero experience dealing with someone like him. Normally, silence was her shield — men would hit the wall and leave. But the less she spoke, the more he pushed. And speaking didn't help either.

Now her first kiss was gone. If she went with him, the "potent remedy" was inevitable. She thought of its... dimensions, and felt her cheeks warm. Despite not having experienced it, she'd been feeling it beneath her this entire time.

How could something that small accommodate something that large?

After a long pause, she met his eyes, jaw tight. "I'll go with you. But I'm not taking the remedy."

"Not taking it? That's not an option. I'm doing this for your own good."

"I..." She bit her lip and whispered, "I can't handle it..."

"Hm?" So she'd felt it. And she was scared. He smiled, tilted her chin up, and softened his voice: "Relax. You absolutely can."

"No!"

"Yes!"

His tone brooked no argument. He stood, scooping her into his arms. "Now — let's go."
