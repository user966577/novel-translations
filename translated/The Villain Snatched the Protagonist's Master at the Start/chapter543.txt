Wu Tian's heart brimmed with defiance. In this life, he was supposed to reclaim his glory and exact his revenge.

But here he was, not even back in the Heavenly Domain, and already about to die again.

So bitterly unfair.

His remaining fist clenched tight. He looked at Qin Jiang, whose eyes brimmed with mockery. Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow at him tauntingly.

Wu Tian's mind jolted. Memories of the past years came flooding back—from the moment his sister was chosen...

The Wu family had cut off his resources. Huaxia, which should have been supplying him, had stalled and made excuses at every turn, drastically slowing his progress. And then there was the Pixiu...

The Pixiu.

His gaze snapped to the middle-aged man. They'd met right after he'd been grievously wounded, in a location suspiciously close to Qin Jiang's territory.

Could it be—

His vision swam. An awful theory took shape, impossible to dismiss.

"Don't look at me. The Lord and I are family," the middle-aged man said with a dismissive wave.

He figured the charade was over—might as well pile on the hate. Maybe his son-in-law would reward him with another heap of treasures.

Family?

Wu Tian's vision went black. He nearly passed out.

Of course. His suspicion was right. This man had been planted by Qin Jiang to sabotage him from the inside—slowing his cultivation, devouring his resources, for over twenty years.

No wonder the man's daughter had vanished after that first meeting and was never mentioned again. She was with Qin Jiang. That was why it had to stay hidden.

Every one of those "pranks" over the past two decades had been deliberate.

And the explosion just now—almost certainly premeditated.

Wu Tian glared at the man, jaw clenched. "That Treasure-Seeking Pearl—what was it really?"

"Treasure-Seeking Pearl? What Treasure-Seeking Pearl?" The man spread his hands. "That was a formation crafted by Her Excellency the Immortal Emperor."

He looked at Wu Tian with undisguised contempt. "Heh, I honestly didn't expect you to be this gullible. I made up 'Treasure-Seeking Pearl' on the spot and you actually bought it. Possession really does rot the brain, huh."

Wu Tian's face went dark. So from the very beginning, everything had been a trap.

Qin Jiang nodded with satisfaction at the man's performance. He'd been meticulous in preparing for Wu Tian. In a direct confrontation, every possible weakness had to be exploited first.

The "Treasure-Seeking Pearl" was a device he and An Xihe had specifically engineered—designed to absorb massive quantities of spiritual energy, then convert it into destructive force before detonating. It served a dual purpose: draining Wu Tian's reserves and inflicting grievous bodily harm.

The middle-aged man's role had been critical. Through his misdirection, the device had performed flawlessly.

Wu Tian stared at the man, seething. "You truly deserve to die."

The man flinched and ducked behind Qin Jiang. Drawing hate was fine, but he didn't actually want to die. He'd seen too much, been too close. Whatever Wu Tian had left up his sleeve—an Immortal Emperor's dying fury—could be catastrophic. Better to be safe.

Qin Jiang glanced back at him and waved him off. "Go on, get out of here."

"Right away!"

He bobbed his head rapidly, spun on his heel, and bolted—not once looking back. Wu Tian's eyes tracked him the entire way, burning with hatred. His deepest loathing was reserved for traitors.

He nearly lunged after the man, but his body could barely hold together.

Once the man was gone, Qin Jiang turned to Wu Yingtao. He kept her at his side—safest place for her.

"Yingtao, I'll leave the killing blow to you. Sound good?"

"Mm~" She nodded. She knew her own limits. Jumping into the main fight would only cause problems. Better to wait for the finish.

He smiled, kissed her cheek, and held her close. "Stay near me. Don't wander."

Then he raised one hand and pressed downward. A vast killing formation materialized, engulfing Wu Tian—the Immortal King Killing Formation. Capable of slaying an Immortal King, it would certainly threaten a reincarnated Immortal Emperor.

Beyond that, Qin Jiang produced the Immortal King Seal. He hadn't used it in a long time, but it still held about seventy to eighty percent of its stored power. Not enough to kill an Immortal King outright, but more than sufficient to wound Wu Tian further.

He gripped the seal and unleashed every ounce of its remaining energy. "Go."

A wave of annihilating force crashed down on Wu Tian. He had no chance to dodge.

The explosion shook the earth. Chaotic energy rampaged through the area, swallowing Wu Tian whole.

About fifteen minutes later, Qin Jiang swept his arm and dispersed the lingering chaos.

Where Wu Tian had stood, his physical body was gone—reduced to nothing. Only a Primordial Spirit remained.

As his memories from the previous life had awakened, his Primordial Spirit had gradually reverted to its original appearance. It bore some resemblance to his current life's form, but the bearing was entirely different—and nothing like the brother Wu Yingtao remembered.

Seeing the soul, Wu Yingtao clenched her fists. So he really wasn't her brother. The Primordial Spirit belonged to someone else entirely.

With his body destroyed, Wu Tian's translucent Primordial Spirit flickered weakly. It was far from peak condition. Even at full strength, a bare Primordial Spirit couldn't match an Immortal Emperor—let alone one flanked by eight watchful Immortal Kings.

His only remaining options were to convince Yingtao of his identity or to flee. The first was clearly hopeless. And the second—after the Treasure-Seeking Pearl's detonation, Qin Jiang's attack, and the loss of his physical body, with his Primordial Spirit damaged and trapped inside a killing formation—was nearly impossible.

The cascade of blows had left him without a shred of fighting capability. He looked up at Qin Jiang, eyes smoldering with fury.

All of this—every last bit—was this man's design. Perhaps from the very beginning, he'd been marked for death.

Qin Jiang met the hateful stare with supreme indifference. He tapped a finger, and the Immortal King Killing Formation roared to life.

A new round of devastation was about to begin.
