When it came to business, naturally he couldn't attend to Liu Shuwan alone.

So after finishing up with her, Qin Jiang kept busy — taking care of business with the other women as well. Several more months passed before he finally stepped out of the grand hall. Under the sunlight, his complexion was noticeably pale.

This time, he was genuinely tired. Helping the women boost their cultivation had drained him enormously — enough to fill a bathtub, by his estimate.

He stretched, working out the stiffness, and glanced back. Tired as he was, the exquisite experience still left him wanting more. He could have kept going. But for long-term sustainability, a bit of restraint was wise. With his recovery speed, one day of rest ought to be sufficient. Of that, he was quite confident.

Besides, this was the perfect window to handle some Huaxia administrative matters. The Chaos Plan — it was time to begin.

When the plan was first conceived, Qin Jiang had issued standing orders. By now, candidates had been selected and their names delivered. All they needed was his go-ahead, and Huaxia's chosen operatives would deploy to the other seven Heavens to wreak havoc and turn the entire world upside down.

It was a coveted assignment. Plenty of powerhouses had scrambled for a spot.

Qin Jiang scanned the roster. Every name on it was at least Ancient Emperor, with no shortage of Human Immortals either. A few familiar names caught his eye.

Black Dragon. The old guard had been falling behind Qin Jiang's pace. He spent most of his time in secluded cultivation these days, and his progress hadn't been slow — he'd reached Ancient Emperor. When the Chaos Plan was announced, he'd thrown his hat in the ring and made the cut.

"Black Dragon, huh? Perfect fit." Qin Jiang smiled. That guy had a real talent for stirring up trouble, and this mission was all about causing trouble — on a grand scale. With Huaxia backing them, it didn't matter what they did. Huaxia would cover for them. The only caveat was not getting killed on the spot. If that happened, Huaxia could avenge them, but dead was dead — revenge wouldn't bring anyone back. So self-preservation was paramount. And if death was unavoidable, at least make it count — die in a way that benefited Huaxia.

He looked over the roster once more. None of these people were exactly upstanding citizens. Perfect for the job. He nodded in satisfaction, wasted no more time deliberating, and issued the order.

The Chaos Plan was officially in motion.

At Huaxia headquarters, the command was received immediately. Operatives on the roster were contacted in secret. The message was simple: move out. Head to the other seven Heavens and raise hell. The bigger the chaos, the richer the reward. Any treasures they could seize in the field were theirs to keep — minus a small cut for Huaxia. Fair enough, considering Huaxia's protection was the only reason they wouldn't be hunted down and killed within a week.

On the frontier of Azure Cloud Heaven, Black Dragon opened his eyes. His aura pulsed.

"The Chaos Plan. It's started."

He murmured to himself and rose to his feet. Beside him stood a burly man.

The burly man looked at Black Dragon with a displeased expression. "Old Black, you've got a mission — why drag me along? What if the Young Master needs me?"

This was the Void Beast. Around Qin Jiang, he never assumed human form, always keeping his beast shape. Obediently serving as a mount. A good little Xu. But in front of anyone else, he was the Void Beast — the Void Emperor! Even immortal-path cultivators had to make way for him.

Black Dragon rolled his eyes at the complaint. "With your strength, you're an embarrassment even as a mount. Besides, when's the last time the Young Master actually used you? Instead of sitting around doing nothing, come do something useful."

"He used me on the last trip back to Qin Domain!" the Void Beast protested.

But even he knew it was a weak argument. As an Emperor-level being, even his greatest asset — speed — couldn't match an immortal-path Qin Jiang. The Young Master only bothered with him during leisurely strolls. Most of the time, Qin Jiang dismissed him as too slow — couldn't even get to his dates while they were still warm. So the Void Beast had been benched for ages, doing nothing but eating and sleeping.

That was how Black Dragon had roped him in. Despite being only a Great Emperor, the Void Beast's spatial abilities made him untraceable to anyone below immortal level. Having him along would make their operations far more effective.

"The Young Master's orders are in," Black Dragon said. "You may not have signed up, but coming with me still counts as serving him. Better than wasting away."

The Void Beast pursed his lips but nodded. "Fine. What's the mission?"

"The Chaos Plan. We cause trouble."

Black Dragon's eyes glinted with excitement. Trouble was his specialty.

"The Chaos Plan? Trouble?" The Void Beast blinked.

"It's the Young Master's personally designed plan — must be important. Don't screw it up."

"Tch. You're the one who shouldn't screw it up."

They exchanged a look, nodded at each other, and without another word, stepped into the Chaos.

"We're heading to Mystic Cloud Heaven," Black Dragon said.

The Void Beast nodded, swept his arm out, and spatial energy enveloped Black Dragon. "I'll carry you. Save us some time."

His realm might be lower than Black Dragon's, but in terms of raw speed, he was considerably faster. It was only against immortal-path beings that he seemed slow — the gap between Emperor and immortal was simply too vast.

And so, one dragon and one beast streaked toward Mystic Cloud Heaven.

At the same time, across Azure Cloud Heaven, powerful cultivators departed in every direction. Even in Mystic Cloud Heaven, operatives who'd accepted the mission set out simultaneously, heading for the other seven Heavens.

The Chaos Plan. In that moment, it officially began. From this point forward, everything beyond Huaxia's borders in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands would descend into total chaos.

No one could stop it.

Unless every last corner of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands fell under Huaxia's banner — the chaos would not end.
