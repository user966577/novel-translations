Azure Cloud Heaven. Qin Family City.

Despite its remote location, the city had become the center of Azure Cloud Heaven thanks to Huaxia's influence — a thriving hub of powerful cultivators.

Qin Jiang and his entourage made Qin Family City their first stop. "The place has changed so much."

They'd been away less than a year, but the city was unrecognizable. Its prosperity now rivaled or even surpassed the Central Regions.

"Looks like Fourth Ancestor and the others have been doing well," Qin Jiang said with a smile.

In their absence, Fourth Ancestor's team had handled everything except major decisions. The city's flourishing state spoke to competent management and strategic resource allocation — as Huaxia's headquarters, it needed to look the part.

After a quick inspection, they headed to Huaxia HQ, which had undergone an even more dramatic transformation — from a makeshift operation to a proper institution, imposing and grand. Passersby gazed upon it with reverence and aspiration.

Minimum entry requirement: Great Emperor. Even the gate guards held that rank — the lowest rung at headquarters, yet lavishly compensated. Competition for every position was fierce, with hundreds or thousands vying for a single spot. The result was a staff of elite talent, hand-selected through rigorous screening. Of course, some had used connections — background was also a form of strength.

Together, they'd brought Huaxia's affairs to smooth, orderly operation. The framework of a vast empire was taking shape.

Qin Jiang was pleased. He began by rewarding those who'd performed well, personally addressing the staff with encouragement — and painting a grand vision: the unification of all Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. A lofty promise, but one he fully intended to deliver.

Under the influence of Leadership Charisma, every powerhouse at headquarters devoured the vision with enthusiasm. Through its feedback, Qin Jiang could see that more and more were genuinely loyal — people who would never betray him. These were the ones he'd gradually elevate to key positions. Only then could Huaxia remain firmly in his grasp.

He spent two weeks at headquarters reviewing operations and purging disloyal elements. Several powerhouses were executed without hesitation, along with the factions behind them — a small but decisive reminder of who was in charge.

Afterward, he handed everything off again and set out with his women for the Central Regions. At their speed, they arrived in about two hours.

Rather than heading directly to the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, they stopped first at the Chaos District. The former lawless zone had transformed into the Central Regions' administrative core — a Huaxia outpost that coordinated with Qin Family City to govern all of Azure Cloud Heaven. They slipped in quietly, returning to their private residence in the restricted zone. No one could approach it, even in their absence. Qin Jiang settled the women in, then cleared his throat.

"So, uh... I'm heading to the Azure Lotus Divine Palace."

The women rolled their eyes and waved him off. None of them were coming — the Divine Palace had plenty of "sisters," and conquering them would require real effort. The rest of the girls could use the break.

The Divine Palace wasn't far from the Chaos District. Qin Jiang strolled there in under an hour.

The Matchmaking Temple had been shut down. The long queue of suitors was gone, replaced by a few forlorn men gazing at the palace gates from afar.

Qin Jiang took a deep breath. Every hall in there was a dragon's den. Once inside, it would be absolute carnage. He needed to prepare.

He popped several Kidney Treasure Pills and swallowed them in one gulp. Then he burst through the gates.

Dragon's den or not — he was going in.

His intrusion triggered an immediate response. "Who dares trespass in the Divine Palace?" A barrage of attacks followed, and the palace's grand formation roared to life. Even Qin Jiang found himself scrambling — these women were skilled and paranoid. The opening volley was enough to stun an immortal-path cultivator.

"It's me!" he called, dodging a fresh wave of strikes.

His voice brought them up short. The formation didn't dissipate, but a striking woman at the front waved a hand, and the array projected his image. "Oh! It's Young Master Qin!" Her face lit up with delight.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. He'd planned to sneak in and play a game of tag — the hawk hunting chicks. Instead, the chicks had caught the hawk.

"Lower the formation and let me out."

But the women exchanged glances and, rather than complying, reinforced the barrier. Threads of spiritual energy lashed around him, binding him tight.

"Hey — what—"

Before he could break free, they swarmed in, all laughter and eagerness.

"Got him! Quick, bring him to my room!"

"Why yours? I helped too! He should come to my room."

"I did the most work — I eat first!"

"I spotted him first — I deserve first bite!"

"Me first!"

"Me first!"

And so the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's finest surrounded Qin Jiang, arguing fiercely over their prize.
