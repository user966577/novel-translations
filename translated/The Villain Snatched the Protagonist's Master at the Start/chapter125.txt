"Qin Jiang."

The white-robed man gazed at the Record Stone, his eyes placid as still water—as if nothing in heaven or earth could stir him.

He chuckled softly. "Not a bad seedling. Perhaps one day he'll touch my level."

Then he closed his eyes.

But moments later, they snapped open again, and for the first time, his expression shifted. Light flashed in his gaze, and an image materialized before him—Qin Jiang's figure inside the Myriad Realms Tower.

Having reached first place, Qin Jiang had no more opponents. He stood on the empty arena, looking around.

He was searching for the source of the energy. He wanted to take the whole operation.

After poking around for a while, he rapped his knuckles against the arena floor. The sound was odd.

"Don't tell me this arena is made of condensed energy?"

He placed his palm flat on the surface and activated the Taotie Divine Body. At his current strength, the devouring force couldn't encompass the entire arena, but he could concentrate it on a single point.

He focused everything onto a palm-sized patch of arena. The powerful suction made the surface shudder beneath his hand. A stream of pure energy poured into him.

His eyes lit up. "It really is!"

Confirmation in hand, Qin Jiang went full throttle. Energy flooded in endlessly. Some he refined into cultivation, some he converted directly into power, and some he stored away. A crater was forming beneath his palm.

The entire arena seemed to tremble. The devouring grew easier and easier, spurring him on. He was determined to consume the whole thing.

What he didn't realize was that as he absorbed, the arenas where other challengers were fighting began to flicker and grow translucent. Some people stepped on thin air. Post-battle rewards stopped appearing. Worse still, after defeating an opponent, some waited and waited but no new challenger materialized.

"Devour, devour, devour! Keep going!" Qin Jiang muttered with glee.

Even without deliberately refining the energy into cultivation, his realm was climbing steadily. The Taotie Divine Body's power swelled in kind.

Then a voice boomed through the space:

"Kid, stop!"

Qin Jiang flinched and immediately went on guard, scanning his surroundings. His hands, however, didn't pause. This time, all absorbed energy converted directly to power, and his aura spiked.

But after a full sweep, he found no one. Someone was definitely watching, though—he wasn't hallucinating.

"Who are you?"

The voice returned: "Stop what you're doing first! I created the Myriad Realms Tower. I won't harm you, but the energy inside is what keeps the tower running. You can't absorb any more!"

The tower's creator? Qin Jiang's heart jolted. A being of that caliber had to be an immortal-path existence at minimum—possibly something far beyond. He immediately ceased absorbing and reined in his aura.

"My apologies, Senior. I had no idea."

"I'm not called 'Senior'..."

"Oh, of course, Senior."

Qin Jiang was the picture of obedience. Against someone who could sneeze him out of existence, docility was the smart play.

The voice paused for a long moment before continuing: "The energy you've already absorbed is yours to keep. But no more."

"Understood."

Qin Jiang nodded emphatically.

Seeming satisfied with his compliance, the voice softened. After a brief hesitation: "Stopping you like this does amount to interfering with your fortune. But the Myriad Realms Tower is the cradle of prodigies across all realms—the future of the myriad realms itself. It must not be damaged. However, I can grant you a different fortune. What do you want?"

Qin Jiang's spirits soared. He thought for a moment. "Do you have anything that lets someone break through to the immortal path directly?"

Silence.

A long silence.

The voice didn't return. Qin Jiang looked up, puzzled. Had he left?

"Senior?"

The voice finally reappeared, accompanied by a small, exquisite seal that materialized in the void and drifted toward him.

"The Immortal King Seal. It contains energy I've stored within it. At full release, it can slay an Immortal King. It requires a fresh infusion of energy to be used again. Against anyone below the Immortal King level, only a fraction of its energy is needed—at least ten uses."

Could slay an Immortal King? Qin Jiang snatched the seal eagerly. He didn't know exactly where "Immortal King" sat on the hierarchy, but from context, it had to be a formidable tier within the immortal path.

"Senior, if I used this to kill Great Emperors, how many times could I use it?"

Another silence. Then, eventually, the voice came through—dripping with exasperation:

"Wasteful!"

Qin Jiang blinked. What—Great Emperors weren't worthy of the Immortal King Seal?

"If you used the Immortal King Seal against Great Emperors and detonated it fully... conservative estimate: ten thousand Great Emperors couldn't withstand it."

Qin Jiang sucked in a sharp breath. Ten thousand Great Emperors? He'd struck gold. Absolute gold.

His face split into a grin, though a twinge of regret followed—the fact that the creator could offer something this valuable proved just how precious the tower's energy was. No more absorbing, that was certain. The man was watching.

Qin Jiang's eyes darted as a new idea formed. He stashed the Immortal King Seal in his system space first, then spoke up: "Senior, do you have a daughter?"

"Hm?"

"Ahem. This junior is handsome and dashing, with an imposing bearing. My personality is gentle, refined, mature, and steady. As for talent—well, number one on the Myriad Realms Tower speaks for itself. With credentials like these, might I qualify to be Senior's son-in-law?"

He straightened his clothes and arranged his features into a charming smile, putting his best foot forward.

No response.

Just as he was about to press the point, a spatial ripple engulfed him. Before he could react, he was hurled out of the Myriad Realms Tower. A single parting line echoed behind him:

"From now on, you are banned from the Myriad Realms Tower!"

Qin Jiang: "???"

He stood there, utterly bewildered. He'd been evicted?

Elsewhere, the white-robed man's face was thunderous. He couldn't remember the last time he'd been this speechless. And the worst part? He actually did have a daughter. She was of considerable age but remained a goddess of the myriad realms, having never found a man who met her standards. Still single to this day.

"That brat isn't really going to get his hands on my daughter, is he?"

He muttered to himself, a creeping unease settling in.
