"MY GRANDSON!"

A wail far more anguished than Chen Changsheng's screams tore through the air.

Qin Jiang turned. The Ghost Immortal's grandson had dissolved completely. All that remained was a faint wisp of a soul—which flickered twice and vanished.

Body and soul. Gone.

The Ghost Immortal's eyes went crimson. His aura erupted like a volcano, his face a mask of pure, unhinged madness. "You killed my grandson! I'll slaughter every last one of you! Every person here will accompany him to the grave!"

Jian Yao and Mo Mo exchanged grim looks. The old man had truly snapped. And his primary target would be Qin Jiang.

A berserk immortal out for blood—even the two of them might not be able to keep Qin Jiang safe.

"I'll hold him off. Take Qin Jiang and run," Jian Yao said, her voice tight.

For once, there was no bickering. Mo Mo nodded and appeared before Qin Jiang. "I'll get you out of here."

"Wait." Qin Jiang waved her off with a smile. "Relax. He's just one immortal."

He drew the Immortal King Seal.

His previous uses had barely scratched the surface—less than one percent of its total power. Now, he was going to use it properly.

He was going to slay an immortal.

Qin Jiang locked onto the Ghost Immortal and channeled the Seal's energy. It latched onto the old man like a predator's jaws.

"Yao-yao, move!"

Jian Yao didn't hesitate. She'd felt it—an annihilating pressure emanating from Qin Jiang himself. She retreated instantly.

The Ghost Immortal felt the lock. His frenzy stuttered as the overwhelming scent of death flooded his senses, every hair on his body standing on end.

"Slay."

Qin Jiang pointed two fingers like a sword. Space itself split apart, and an invisible, world-rending force tore toward the Ghost Immortal.

Everyone in the plaza felt a suffocating pressure bear down on their lungs.

The Ghost Immortal went pale. With no time to think, he detonated every ounce of his immortal power. The entire city of Pill City shuddered. Buildings crumbled. Nearly every person present was driven to their knees by the sheer force.

The Ghost Immortal stared at Qin Jiang. He couldn't run—at this point, his only hope was to tank the hit head-on.

The strike arrived.

It shattered every defense, every trump card, every last resort the Ghost Immortal possessed. In the span of a heartbeat, the obliterating energy punched through his guard and flooded his body.

Immortal-path cultivators possessed infinite lifespans—but they could still be killed. They weren't truly undying.

Under the Immortal King Seal's power, a bona fide immortal cultivator had been rendered utterly helpless.

His life force guttered. His agonized shrieks echoed across heaven and earth for fifteen full minutes before, finally, they stopped.

The sky darkened. A light rain began to fall—as if the heavens themselves were mourning the death of an immortal.

"He's... dead?" Mo Mo's voice carried a note of disbelief.

Killing an immortal-path cultivator was extraordinarily difficult. When she'd been sealed all those years ago, it was precisely because outright killing her hadn't been feasible. Even two immortals working together would struggle to end one of their own. And yet—

Qin Jiang had done it effortlessly.

She looked at him, silently grateful she'd never chosen to oppose him. If she had, he could have ended her just as easily.

The shock extended far beyond Mo Mo. Every person in the Heavenly Pill Palace—every spectator, every elder—was struck speechless.

They'd just witnessed the fall of an immortal. And the one responsible was a young man who looked barely past his twenties.

Fear crept into their gazes.

They understood the power hadn't come from Qin Jiang personally—but the fact that he wielded such a treasure, flanked by two immortal-path cultivators... the faction backing him had to be unimaginably powerful.

The Pill Emperor stared, equally stunned. 'Does Azure Cloud Heaven even have a family this powerful?'

She'd interacted with many hidden clans over the millennia, but the strongest among them had at most a couple of immortals. None of them could match what Qin Jiang had just demonstrated—two immortal wives and a weapon capable of annihilating immortals.

No family in Azure Cloud Heaven could produce that.

Qin Jiang paid the crowd's shock no mind. He examined the Immortal King Seal. That strike had used less than five percent of its reserves.

Might've been overkill, actually.

Then he extended his hand toward where the Ghost Immortal had stood. The old man's physical form had been obliterated, but his law essence remained—or rather, had been absorbed by the Myriad Dao Stone, which Qin Jiang had deployed at the moment of the kill.

He'd used it before to absorb Great Emperor Laws. Immortal Laws worked too.

The stone flew to his palm. Inside, an immortal-path law glimmered.

Qin Jiang grinned. Not a bad haul.

"An Immortal Law?" Jian Yao and Mo Mo both looked surprised.

Qin Jiang nodded. "The Ghost Immortal cultivated the Ghost Dao..."

A Ghost Dao Law. He mulled over who it would suit best.

It was virtually impossible to kill an immortal under normal circumstances, and even when you did, their laws typically dispersed. Qin Jiang had forcibly preserved this one—something that shouldn't have been possible.

Jian Yao wasn't particularly shocked. She'd broken through to the immortal path herself thanks to a law Qin Jiang had given her.

"A Ghost Dao Law would suit Sister Shiya well," Jian Yao offered.

She'd spent time with Yan Shiya in the Seven Beauties Painting and knew her well. The assassin's path aligned perfectly with the Ghost Dao.

Plus, with Jian Yao's breakthrough shattering the Painting's realm suppression, Yan Shiya—who'd long been at Nine Tribulations Supreme—was now free to advance to Great Emperor. She was currently in seclusion doing exactly that.

Qin Jiang nodded. "I'll hold it for Shiya. Once she hits Great Emperor, it's hers."

He stored the Myriad Dao Stone in his system space. The immortal law would need purification first.

"System, clean this up. Make sure it's safe."

The system obliged. There'd be a Villain Points deduction, but Qin Jiang had accumulated tens of millions.

'Deduct away.'
