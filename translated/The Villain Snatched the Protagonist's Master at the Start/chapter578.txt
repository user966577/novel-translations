Zhao Sheng staggered back, secretly circulating his qi to counteract the numbness. But his attacker pressed forward relentlessly.

"You dare block?"

He closed the distance and swung again. Zhao Sheng raised his arm once more, grunting at the impact. The force drove him into the ground.

The commotion drew spectators, but no one intervened. The cultivation world operated on simple rules: the strong devoured the weak. If you died, you had only your own weakness to blame.

Blood trickled from Zhao Sheng's lip. His qi churned violently. He glared up at his attacker. "Don't push it!"

"Push it? A little Human Immortal dares threaten me?"

The man sneered, looking down at him, and raised his foot to stomp. Zhao Sheng's body surged with energy. He blasted free of the crater and dodged the blow.

The gap between them was simply too vast. Two casual strikes from a True Immortal had already injured him. After evading, Zhao Sheng took a steadying breath. The man wasn't letting up, and this was a problem he couldn't solve—not unless he fled. But abandoning the Immortal Emperor's legacy when it was right in front of him was unacceptable.

Then he remembered the message stone from the True Immortal he'd met the day before. Maybe the man would help. It was worth a try.

He pulled out the message stone and sent a message without hesitation, praying for a quick response. The reply came instantly.

Relief flooded through him. He quickly described his situation and offered to compensate the man for his help.

By the time his message went out, the aggressor had already closed in again. He spotted the message stone in Zhao Sheng's hand.

"Calling for help?" He snorted, suddenly in no hurry to strike. "Let's see who shows up."

The brief reprieve was welcome. Zhao Sheng stayed silent, not wanting to provoke another attack.

"Ha! There's nobody in this realm I can't handle. Call whoever you want—no one's saving you."

While the man postured, Zhao Sheng watched his message stone anxiously. No response had come since his initial plea. Was the man ignoring him? After all, Zhao Sheng hadn't exactly been warm yesterday. Now he was asking for rescue—if their positions were reversed, he'd be annoyed too.

Then a familiar voice called out from nearby. "Well, well—who's making all this noise? Oh, if it isn't Peng Dazhuang."

Zhao Sheng's head snapped toward the voice. His spirits lifted—it was the True Immortal from yesterday. And from his tone, he knew the aggressor.

The man Zhao Sheng had called was Liu Xing, the Huaxia operative. And the bully, Peng Dazhuang, was also Huaxia—the whole thing was Black Dragon's arrangement, designed to build trust.

"Liu Xing?" Peng Dazhuang turned, his bluster dimming noticeably.

Liu Xing walked over and stopped beside Zhao Sheng. He brushed the dirt off Zhao Sheng's clothes and asked with a smile: "You alright?"

"I'm fine. Thank you."

"Don't mention it."

Liu Xing turned his attention to Peng Dazhuang. "Liu Xing, are you getting involved in this?"

"Getting involved? He's my brother. Touch him again and see what happens."

Peng Dazhuang's expression darkened. After a tense moment, he spat: "Fine. We're done here."

He turned to leave—but Liu Xing appeared in front of him, blocking his path. "Going somewhere?"

"What do you want?"

"Apologize to my brother." Liu Xing pointed at Zhao Sheng.

Peng Dazhuang's eyes widened with fury. "Apologize? Not a chance!"

Liu Xing smirked. He raised a hand and beckoned. Two more figures emerged from the crowd, flanking him with easy grins. Three True Immortals' combined pressure bore down on Peng Dazhuang.

"I may not have much," Liu Xing said coldly, "but I've got plenty of friends. Today, you hurt my brother. You will apologize."

Peng Dazhuang's face turned ashen. His fists clenched. Finally, through gritted teeth: "Fine!"

He faced Zhao Sheng and barked: "Sorry!" Then he whipped back to Liu Xing. "Satisfied?"

Liu Xing glanced at Zhao Sheng, who nodded. "Get lost."

Peng Dazhuang stormed off with a final snort.

'Damn it,' he thought as he walked away. 'Next time, I'm playing the hero. Being the villain sucks—so demeaning. Though, the opening scene was pretty convincing. Shame I couldn't actually throw real punches. Still, my acting was excellent. Definite talent.'

Smiling to himself, Peng Dazhuang went to collect his pay from Black Dragon.

Meanwhile, Zhao Sheng exhaled in relief. He turned to Liu Xing again. "Thank you."

"Come on, we're brothers." Liu Xing waved it off with a grin. "I just like making friends. Thought you looked like good people yesterday, so I reached out. Didn't expect I'd actually get to help."

"Yesterday, I was—" Zhao Sheng started to apologize for his coldness, but Liu Xing cut him off with a smile.

"I get it. In the cultivation world, caution keeps you alive."

Zhao Sheng paused, then met Liu Xing's eyes and said earnestly: "You helped me today. I have nothing to repay you with now, but someday, if you ever need anything—I'll walk through fire for you."

"It was nothing. Don't be so serious. After today, we're friends. No need to keep score."

Liu Xing smiled warmly. But inwardly, he thought: 'No payment, just empty promises. What a cheapskate.'
