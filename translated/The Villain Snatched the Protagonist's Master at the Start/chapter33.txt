Hearing the Fourth Ancestor's words, Qin Jiang's eyes went wide with disbelief.

The Fourth Ancestor assumed he was shocked by the refusal. He smiled gently:

"You are the Qin family's future."

But Qin Jiang's face was pure bewilderment.

"No, wait."

He looked at the Fourth Ancestor reproachfully:

"Fourth Ancestor, are you looking down on me?"

The Fourth Ancestor blinked.

With obvious disdain, Qin Jiang tossed the Great Emperor law back:

"With my talent, do you really think I'd need this to reach Great Emperor?"

The Fourth Ancestor: "..."

'So I need it then?

This isn't you being humble—this is you insulting me!'

"You—"

He pointed at Qin Jiang, momentarily speechless.

Still, with dual Divine Bodies, Qin Jiang genuinely didn't need external aids to reach Great Emperor.

Possessing two Divine Bodies and still failing to reach Great Emperor? That would just mean Qin Jiang was hopeless.

Looking at the Great Emperor law before him, the Fourth Ancestor hesitated. Several Qin family ancestors needed something like this—especially the First Ancestor, the most ancient member of the family.

His remaining lifespan was running short.

Using the law on himself would be somewhat wasteful.

Qin Jiang read the Fourth Ancestor's thoughts. After a moment:

"Fourth Ancestor, actually, last night's dream had more than just this law..."

Before he could finish, the Fourth Ancestor's burning gaze was already locked on him.

Qin Jiang cleared his throat and produced a drop of Great Emperor blood essence:

"Fourth Ancestor, take a look."

"This is..."

The Fourth Ancestor's eyes bulged. He caught the essence, his arm trembling:

"Great Emperor blood essence!"

His voice was pure shock.

First a Great Emperor law, now Great Emperor blood essence. Either one, released to the world, would spark a bloodbath.

Yet Qin Jiang produced them as casually as pocket change.

Most puzzling of all—except when Qin Jiang was busy "carrying on the family line"—the Fourth Ancestor was at his side every moment. He had no idea where these treasures came from.

Could the boy's dreams really be coming true?

Just then, several streaks of light appeared before him. He caught them instinctively. When he saw what they were, his mind went blank.

More Great Emperor blood essence.

Ten drops in total.

"Is this enough?"

Qin Jiang asked.

Originally, he'd planned to keep two drops for recruiting and nurturing future followers. But on reflection, investing in outsiders when he could strengthen his own family seemed foolish.

So he handed over all ten.

"You have more?"

The Fourth Ancestor blurted.

Though he had none left, Qin Jiang thumped his chest:

"All you need!"

Watching the Fourth Ancestor's stunned expression, he preened. 'That's right—bask in the glory of my bottomless pockets.'

"In that case, a few more?"

The Fourth Ancestor's eyes gleamed hungrily.

Qin Jiang coughed:

"Use these up first."

The Fourth Ancestor paused, then understood. The boy was tapped out. Normally, he'd have ribbed Qin Jiang for the bravado, but given the treasures in his hands... best to let the kid save face.

"Fine."

To ensure safety, the Fourth Ancestor returned to the Qin family in person. But worried about Qin Jiang's protection, he drew a circle around him first—outsiders couldn't enter, and Qin Jiang couldn't leave.

Qin Jiang thought he was about to be ordained as a monk.

Unlike a certain monkey's circle, though, this one kept him imprisoned. He was stuck for ages before the Fourth Ancestor returned and freed him.

"Fourth Ancestor, was that payback?"

Qin Jiang grumbled.

The Fourth Ancestor rolled his eyes:

"My heart is vast as the sea. I'd never stoop to petty revenge. The confinement was purely for your safety. You should be grateful."

"Right. Thank you so much."

The Fourth Ancestor waved dismissively:

"I'm going into seclusion. I won't be able to watch over you for a while."

"Then who's protecting me?"

"Relax—I brought ten Supremes with me. That's more than enough."

Qin Jiang's eyes widened.

Ten Supremes. That was stronger than the entire Ye family.

"With the Great Emperor law, my breakthrough shouldn't take long. I'll try to make it back before the action starts."

With that, the Fourth Ancestor vanished.

Qin Jiang knew the Qin family would take no chances with something this momentous. Every reclusive ancestor would emerge to stand guard during the breakthrough.

Alone in the room, he was about to leave for some fresh air when—

A flash, and a figure materialized before him.

Qin Jiang blinked:

"What made you come out?"

It was the Fire Tribe woman from his ring.

Ever since the ancestors had detected her presence, she'd stayed hidden inside. This was her first time emerging.

The moment she left the ring, her brow creased. In an instant, dozens of powerful auras locked onto her, ready to strike.

She took a steadying breath, knowing these were Qin Jiang's protectors.

Forcing herself to relax, she looked at him:

"I've made my decision. Help me restore my physical body, and I'll be your woman."

"Hm?"

Qin Jiang stared:

"Wait—you're giving in already?"

'I haven't even started my offensive, and you're surrendering?'

Seeing his apparent displeasure, the Fire Tribe woman gritted her teeth. She'd spent ages psyching herself up to say those words, and he was... unhappy about it?!

"You've been watching from inside the ring, so you should know—I like melons that need prying. The thrill of the chase, the satisfaction of conquest.

But you...

Not only is there nothing to pry, you've split yourself open and jumped right into my mouth. Where's the fun in that?"

The Fire Tribe woman's eyes went wide. How could someone this twisted exist?

And of all people, she had to be the one stuck with him.

She ground her teeth:

"Then what do you want?"

She had indeed been observing everything from inside the ring. Qin Jiang's talent, intellect, appearance, background—all absolutely top-tier.

His only flaw was being a bit... amorous.

And the whole snatching habit.

She knew that falling into his hands left her with only one path. She'd already accepted it.

The problem was that during her silence, his collection of women kept growing. She was running out of time to stake her claim.

She'd wanted to make the first move, but pride and shyness kept holding her back—until now.
