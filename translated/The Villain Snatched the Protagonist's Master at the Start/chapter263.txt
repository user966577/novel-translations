"Feel it."

Chen Qi'er stood before the young man, releasing wave after wave of tremendous aura. The young man's face was filled with disbelief—his Brother Chen was actually a cultivator, and an incredibly powerful one at that. He dropped to one knee and looked up at Chen Qi'er, who in that moment seemed as vast as heaven and earth itself. All one could do was gaze upward in awe.

After a long while, Chen Qi'er gradually reined in his aura. He reached out and helped the young man to his feet.

"This is the power of cultivators. They are mighty and merciless. Before the strong, the weak are nothing more than insects. The world of cultivation is far crueler than the mortal world—slaughter and death will be your constant companions, and no one knows whether tomorrow or death will come first. Are you sure you want to set foot on the path of immortal cultivation?"

Over several days of observation, Chen Qi'er had grown increasingly impressed with the young man, so he'd revealed his true identity outright, intending to guide him into the world of cultivation.

The young man came back to his senses, his gaze gradually hardening with resolve. He nodded. "I want to become a cultivator. I want to walk the path of immortality!"

"Good." Chen Qi'er nodded.

He produced a cultivation method and handed it to the young man—the very one he himself practiced. Giving it away signaled his intent to take the young man as a disciple. "I'll give you three months. If you can successfully cultivate this method, come find me at the Human Dao Sect's inner sect. I'll be waiting there for you."

He left behind a supply of cultivation resources as well. He'd already checked—the young man's aptitude was far better than his own had been. The method was somewhat profound, but with enough effort, three months would be more than sufficient. Chen Qi'er had always believed that diligence could overcome any lack of talent.

At the Human Dao Sect's inner sect, Dao Kun stared at the couple lost in their honeymoon phase, his expression darkening. He hadn't expected that one moment of inattention would let Qin Jiang raid his own household. His most talented disciple—one who might even break through to True Immortal someday—had been snatched right out from under him. Worst of all, Dao Zhen had repeatedly warned him to avoid entanglements with Qin Jiang. But now...

Looking at his disciple's eyes, which saw nothing but Qin Jiang, Dao Kun felt a wave of helplessness. How had this happened? He knew his disciple well—countless brilliant young men had pursued her over the years, and she'd rejected every last one without a second glance. Deep in her heart, she'd always held onto the memory of that little beggar boy. All these years, no one else had managed to get close. He'd genuinely worried she'd spend her life alone.

And yet, in just a few days, Qin Jiang had somehow gotten together with her? How was that possible? Surely not because of that face—only marginally more handsome than his own? Impossible. His disciple wasn't that shallow, and there'd been no shortage of handsome men among her suitors over the years. She'd never given any of them a second look.

Questions swarmed his mind, but reality lay before him, unchangeable.

"Teacher, haven't you always worried I'd be alone forever?" Chen Baizhe beamed. "Now you can rest easy. Qin Jiang will be there for me."

Under Qin Jiang's relentless campaign of sweet-talking and half-truths, Chen Baizhe had fallen completely into the wolf's trap like an innocent lamb.

Dao Kun's mouth twitched. He forced a smile and nodded. "Ha ha, rest easy, yes... I'm very reassured..."

'Reassured my ass!'

He still trusted Dao Zhen's Fortune-Reading Art implicitly. Qin Jiang was absolutely a walking catastrophe—and his disciple, being this close to him, would inevitably be dragged down.

"Hehe, since you're reassured, Teacher, Qin Jiang and I will head back now." Chen Baizhe giggled. She'd brought Qin Jiang over specifically to tell her teacher the news—after all, he was practically a father to her, and finding a partner was something he deserved to know.

With that, she linked her arm through Qin Jiang's and turned to leave. Watching their retreating figures, Dao Kun's brow furrowed deeply.

"What am I supposed to do?" he muttered.

On one hand, his beloved disciple. On the other, a man his ancestor had designated a walking disaster. They were already together—how could he possibly sever the connection? Expel his disciple from the sect? No! He shook his head. This wasn't her fault; she shouldn't bear the consequences. Perhaps he could find a way to separate them... but she'd finally found a partner. Tearing them apart felt too cruel.

He could tell that regardless of whatever methods Qin Jiang had used, her feelings were genuine. He hadn't seen her smile like that in a very long time. If he broke them apart, she really would be alone forever.

"What a headache." Dao Kun rubbed his temples, then finally sighed. "Forget it. Maybe Dao Zhen was wrong."

"I feel like Teacher wasn't too happy," Chen Baizhe said, glancing at Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang stroked his chin. "Probably... because I swindled him."

"Hmm?"

"I conned all his Human Dao Tea."

Qin Jiang gave a sly grin. After a few days, Dao Kun had surely compared notes with Dao Zhen, meaning he now knew the whole tea incident had been a scam. And now, on top of that, Qin Jiang had run off with his precious disciple. Of course he wasn't happy.

"Human Dao Tea?" Chen Baizhe seized on the key detail, completely ignoring her teacher's feelings. She looked at Qin Jiang, then groaned. "Oh, right. You're only at Supreme—the tea would still be very useful for you."

"..."

Qin Jiang felt distinctly insulted.

Linking her arm through his, Chen Baizhe pulled him toward her courtyard. "I have way more Human Dao Tea than Teacher does. It's all yours."

Soon they returned to the courtyard. Chen Baizhe produced a large jar of Human Dao Tea and handed it to Qin Jiang. She didn't particularly enjoy tea herself—she'd drunk it often when she was weaker, but as her cultivation grew, she'd nearly stopped entirely. Still, her teacher kept sending supplies, so she'd saved it all. Originally, she'd hoped to give it to her brother someday, to help boost his cultivation even a little. But now the intended recipient had changed.

"This much?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. The amount he'd conned from Dao Kun wasn't even a tenth of this.

Chen Baizhe smiled. "Teacher always gives me half his tea. Since I don't drink much, I just saved it all. He likes tea himself, so what he keeps is naturally less than what I've stockpiled. If you drank all of this, it should be enough to push you through to Great Emperor, right?"
