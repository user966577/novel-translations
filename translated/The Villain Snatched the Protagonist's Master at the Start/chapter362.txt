With Ye Ling'er's mother as their guide, Qin Jiang and Ye Ling'er spent several days at the Ye estate. They even visited the Rose Casino — where he'd first met Yan Yun and Yan Shiya. The casino was still under the control of Shadow Pavilion, the assassin organization the sisters had founded, though with their revenge long since accomplished, neither cared to manage it anymore. The Ye family had simply absorbed the operation to generate revenue.

Qin Jiang had originally planned to bring them along, but once they learned Shadow Pavilion had been folded into the Ye family, they'd lost interest. It was just something they'd thrown together on a whim — the Ye family could keep it. Besides, this trip was about accompanying Ye Ling'er home. The other wives had graciously given the couple some private time — after all, every one of them wanted Qin Jiang to herself for a while.

Just as they were preparing to leave, Ye Qingtian appeared.

"Ha ha, Young Master Qin! It's been too long." He bowed slightly, studying Qin Jiang with something bordering on awe. He'd known from their very first meeting that this young man was destined for extraordinary things. Now, sensing the profound depth of Qin Jiang's aura, Ye Qingtian understood — from here on, he could only look up.

"Clan Leader Ye."

Qin Jiang smiled. He'd always had a soft spot for Ye Qingtian — capable and bold, a cut above Ye Lingtian. Although, trailing behind him was Ye Xuan. She curtsied gracefully. "Young Master Qin."

Ye Qingtian glanced at her, then turned to Qin Jiang with an eager expression, rubbing his hands together. "Young Master Qin, I've heard the Qin family is selecting talented disciples..."

"Your intelligence network is impressive, Clan Leader Ye."

"Well, the Qin family is the heart of Qin Domain. Naturally, all the vassal clans pay close attention."

Fair enough. The talent selection wasn't a secret, and he'd planned to open it to the vassal clans eventually — he just hadn't announced it yet. "I'm building an academy," Qin Jiang explained. "I need talented candidates to cultivate. But I want geniuses only — don't send me deadweight."

Ye Qingtian's eyes gleamed. "My daughter Ye Xuan is our clan's top prodigy. Would she qualify?"

Qin Jiang paused. Former Child of Destiny or not, Ye Xuan was undeniably gifted. In just a few years, riding Qin Domain's wave of growth, she'd reached the Saint Realm — not much by Qin Jiang's standards, but within Qin Domain she was top-tier. With better resources, she could easily become a regional powerhouse. More importantly, his Leadership Charisma showed her at one hundred percent loyalty.

She was a genuine talent.

"There'll be a formal selection soon," he said. "All clans will have a chance to participate. Ye Xuan can try."

Father and daughter lit up with delight. Ye Xuan's eyes sparkled. "Thank you, Young Master Qin."

"Whether you pass depends on your own performance."

He didn't linger, turning to Ye Ling'er. "Shall we head back?"

"Sure~ Let me just say goodbye to Mother."

They bid farewell to Ye's mother and departed. Back at the Qin estate, Qin Jiang dropped Ye Ling'er off at the Void Divine Temple and went to find his grandfather — handing off the task of organizing talent selection for the vassal clans.

"Can't you do this yourself?" The old man's face darkened. Ever since his grandson's return, the boy had done nothing but pile work on him. The previous batch of tasks still wasn't finished, and now more pressure.

Qin Jiang shrugged, grinning. "I'm busy."

"Busy?" Grandpa Qin laughed in disbelief, jabbing a finger at him. "You're busy? Fine — tell me exactly what you're so busy with."

"Carrying on the family line."

The old man's expression froze. That... was indeed important.

But then he scrutinized Qin Jiang, brow furrowing. "Boy, is something wrong with you? This many wives, and you're 'carrying on the line' all day — so how come there's not a single result?"

Qin Jiang's face went dark. He simply wasn't ready for children yet! There was nothing wrong with him — his body was in peak condition!

"Alright, alright." The old man waved him off before he could argue. "Leave it all to me. You go get busy. And produce some results, understand?"

Qin Jiang could only nod. He'd walked right into that one.

As for actually having children? Not a chance. He'd achieve immortality eventually — what was the point? Of course, if the mood struck him someday, maybe a few for fun. After all, there was something to be said about pregnant—

He grinned to himself and headed back to the Void Divine Temple.

Behind him, Grandpa Qin shook his head. "That boy will be the death of me."

He sighed and turned to the daunting logistics ahead. Standards, quotas, testing methods — all needed to be established. And the criteria for outsiders couldn't be as lenient as for Qin family members, who were essentially getting in through the back door. Resources came straight from his grandson's pocket. Not a single one could be wasted.

The most important requirement: absolute loyalty to the Qin family. Non-negotiable.
