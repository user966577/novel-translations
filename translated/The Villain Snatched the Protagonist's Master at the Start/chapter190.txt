Several hours later.

Inside one of the formation's chambers, Yu Ru hugged herself tightly, stifling quiet sobs. Her reddened eyes brimmed with fury as she glared at Qin Jiang.

Beside them, Mo Mo pouted. "Qin Jiang, she doesn't look convinced."

She was egging him on. Watching Yu Ru's pitiful state, she finally understood the satisfaction Jian Yao must have felt back when it was her turn.

Qin Jiang shot her a sidelong glance. This little devil was getting out of hand. He reached over and gave her backside a sharp smack.

"Ow! What was that for~"

Mo Mo looked at him with wounded eyes. Qin Jiang ignored her and turned to Yu Ru instead.

"Let go of me! You're a brute, a pervert—don't touch me!"

Yu Ru screamed, thrashing against his hold.

Mo Mo flicked a wrist and subdued her instantly. Yu Ru's venomous glare swiveled to the petite girl. In her eyes, this deceptively sweet-looking little loli was even more hateful than Qin Jiang. While Qin Jiang had been at it, Mo Mo hadn't exactly kept her own hands to herself...

And what came next would probably be even worse.

The thought made Yu Ru's body tremble. She bit her lip, face paling.

Qin Jiang studied her, licked his lips, then—

He comforted Mo Mo first, then spoke. "Mo Mo, give us a moment alone."

His eyes settled on Yu Ru.

Mo Mo nodded obediently and left the room.

Yu Ru watched Qin Jiang with wary eyes. "What do you want?"

Alone with him, she actually relaxed slightly. At least Qin Jiang had been gentle with her—well, comparatively speaking.

He sat down beside her, pulled her close by the waist, and tilted her chin up with one finger. "Let's talk about your situation."

Yu Ru, who'd been squirming, went still.

Her sister had lost power, and their entire faction's status had plummeted overnight. If Yu Lan was gone for good, these people alone couldn't hope to reclaim their former standing. And right now, she didn't even know if her sister was still alive.

She looked up at him. "What are you trying to say?"

"I can help you."

Yu Ru had already figured that much out. She could see that both Immortals at his side were his women. A man who could command the devotion of Immortals had to wield terrifying influence. With his backing, their faction's return to prominence wasn't just possible—if Yu Lan escaped and came back, they could reverse the entire situation.

But the thought of what he'd done to her filled Yu Ru with helpless rage. She fixed him with a bitter stare. He was handsome, powerful, well-connected—if he'd just courted her properly, she wouldn't have refused. So why did he have to force things?

Her eyes glistened again with unshed tears. She sniffled, fighting them back, and forced the words out. "You've already... done this to me. Can't you help us?"

"No."

Qin Jiang shook his head with a smile.

Her expression crumbled further. She glared at him, indignant. "Then what more do you want?"

"Your sister's quite something too, isn't she?"

"You—"

Yu Ru's eyes widened in disbelief. He'd already had her, and he still wanted her sister? Did he expect both of them to share—

Her expression flickered between shock and resignation. Compared to herself, Yu Lan was far prouder. She'd never deigned to look twice at any man. At least Yu Ru, after Qin Jiang's... thorough persuasion, had softened somewhat. But her sister? Even if Qin Jiang forced the issue, Yu Lan would remain as cold and defiant as ever.

Still, Yu Ru genuinely wanted to find Yu Lan someone to lean on. Her sister had been carrying the weight of their entire faction alone, and it was wearing her down.

She looked at Qin Jiang and gritted her teeth. "If you're capable enough, I'm willing to... be with my sister together."

A flush crept across her cheeks.

Qin Jiang beamed.

A proud empress? Mo Mo had been every bit as proud, and she'd come around. Every fierce woman had a soft spot somewhere.

"When your sister arrives, I'll need your cooperation."

"Cooperate how?"

"Does your sister have any weaknesses?"

"I think... maybe."

Yu Ru hesitated. "She cares deeply about our people. Why else build a shelter like this? If you used us to pressure her, she might actually give in." She paused. "But it would only be surface-level. She'd hate you for it."

She laid out her honest assessment.

Qin Jiang nodded thoughtfully. Mo Mo's eventual surrender, he suspected, had less to do with strategy and more to do with... certain proclivities on her part.

Would Yu Lan be the same? He was rather curious.

His favorite type was precisely the secretly deviant kind—women who only showed that side to him. The thought of it drew a wicked grin across his face.

Yu Ru eyed him nervously, inching away. That smile was decidedly unsettling.

She cleared her throat to break the silence and draw his attention back. "Actually, if you were genuinely good to my sister, you'd have a real shot."

"Oh?"

Qin Jiang raised a brow. "I'm genuinely good to all beautiful women!"

Yu Ru: "..."

'You call that good?'

She shot him a withering look and curled protectively around herself. She was a beautiful woman too, and she hadn't seen any "genuine goodness." Only genuine... enthusiasm.

"You don't believe me?"

Reading her expression, Qin Jiang felt his sincerity being questioned. He pulled her into his arms, and in an instant, his eyes transformed—warm, tender, impossibly soft.

Their gazes locked. His voice dropped to a murmur. "Ru'er, haven't I been good to you?"

The sudden gentleness in his eyes made Yu Ru's heart stutter. Something inside her wavered—but she caught herself almost immediately, wrenched free of his embrace, and scrambled backward.

She muttered under her breath: "Drama king."
