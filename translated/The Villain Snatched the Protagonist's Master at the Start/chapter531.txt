Murong Qing looked at Xue Yue, whose own face was tinged with pink. Xue Yue approached, a touch bashful.

Qin Jiang extended an arm and wrapped it around Xue Yue's waist. Unfortunately, his lap was already occupied by Murong Qing—there was no room for Xue Yue to sit.

"Yue'er, you..." Murong Qing's heart fluttered. Being with Xue Yue together would be far more thrilling than sneaking around. She gripped Qin Jiang's "hand" even tighter, her other hand clutching his clothes as she swallowed and asked, "You really want to... together?"

"Mm~" Xue Yue was shy but nodded. After waiting over a decade, she couldn't exactly lose her nerve at the last moment.

"Doesn't Qing'er want it too?" Qin Jiang smiled and kissed her cheek.

Murong Qing lowered her gaze. Though she didn't answer aloud, she expressed herself through action—squeezing Qin Jiang's "hand" repeatedly.

He understood the signal perfectly. He winked at Xue Yue, then stood up in one fluid motion with Murong Qing still in his arms. The sudden movement made her yelp and cling to him for dear life.

He grinned, supporting her with one arm while keeping the other around Xue Yue's waist. Looking down at Murong Qing, he smiled. "If Qing'er has no objections, then... shall we begin?"

"Mm~" She nodded shyly, glanced once at Xue Yue, then buried her face in Qin Jiang's chest. She was too embarrassed. This was her first time together with another woman—and that woman was Xue Yue, no less.

Xue Yue, by contrast, was far more composed. She'd been through plenty of group sessions—every one a grand affair. Adding Murong Qing to the mix was exciting, certainly, but the scale was nothing compared to those events.

"Yue'er, ready?" Qin Jiang asked.

She nodded, pressing close against him. "Ready~"

His eyes lit up with excitement. In a flash, all three of them were on the bed.

Murong Qing kept her eyes squeezed shut, arms locked around Qin Jiang. From the side, Xue Yue could only watch—it didn't look like Murong Qing was letting go anytime soon. That said, there were other ways Xue Yue could lend Qin Jiang a hand.

He gazed down at Murong Qing, brushed the hair from her face, and kissed her forehead. "Qing'er, you're too tense."

"I... I can't help it."

Her face was scarlet. Even with her eyes shut, she could feel Xue Yue watching, and it was simply too much. He tried soothing her, kissing her cheeks, speaking softly—it helped a little, but not much. Every time Xue Yue so much as spoke, whatever calm Murong Qing had managed to build shattered instantly.

She grew more and more tense—so much so that Qin Jiang felt an almost crushing pressure. He'd never experienced anything like it. He could only imagine how anxious she must be feeling.

After a long while with no progress, he looked helplessly at Xue Yue. "Maybe we should... let Qing'er adjust first?"

"Alright." Xue Yue was disappointed but nodded—she couldn't let Murong Qing get hurt. "I'll step out then."

Qin Jiang nodded and pinched her cheek fondly. "Go wait in your room. I'll come find you soon."

"Okay~"

With a nod and a quick farewell to Murong Qing, Xue Yue left the room, leaving the two of them alone.

Murong Qing finally opened her eyes, still looking jittery. The sight made him chuckle. He pinched her cheek and asked, "Yue'er's gone. Not nervous anymore?"

"I'm sorry. I can't control myself." She looked genuinely apologetic. Qin Jiang and Xue Yue must have been preparing for this a long time, and she'd ruined it.

"As long as Qing'er isn't angry, that's all that matters." He ruffled her hair.

Without Xue Yue present, she could relax. She pouted. "I'm still angry."

"You tricked me for over a decade. You owe me compensation."

"How should I compensate you?"

"I don't know." She shook her head. Being at Qin Jiang's side seemed to be enough—she was already content. As for compensation... she honestly had no idea what to ask for. But...

"Forget compensation for now. Right now, you need to satisfy me."

She lifted her arms, wrapped them around his neck, and the desire she'd been suppressing all night erupted at last. She didn't wait for him to make the first move—she initiated.

From heading toward Xue Yue's room, to being discovered, to trying to be with Xue Yue—Murong Qing's arousal had been building and building. Now, finally, she could let it all out.

Qin Jiang was more than willing to oblige. He grinned and kissed her fiercely, matching her rhythm. The two of them moved in perfect sync.

A full two hours later, her intensity finally began to ebb.

He pinched her cheek and grinned. "Satisfied?"

"We've barely started." She pursed her lips and placed her hands on his waist. Then, blushing, she said, "I want to... switch positions."

"Switch positions?"

"Mm~" She nodded, pouting at him. "I'm the queen. I should be the one on top!"

He laughed and nodded. "Yes, my queen. I am forever your loyal subject."

"Then let's switch."

"As you wish~"

A quick flip, and their positions reversed—Murong Qing on top, looking down at him imperiously.

She smirked. "You treasonous minister. Today, your queen shall conquer you and ensure you never dare rebel again!"

"Your Majesty, your humble servant is loyal and true!" Qin Jiang protested innocently.

She huffed and extended her hand toward his lips. "Here. Kiss."

"Mwah~" He kissed the back of her hand, then gazed up at her eagerly. "Shall I kiss anywhere else?"

"Of course! Your queen intends to conquer you utterly—from head to toe!"
