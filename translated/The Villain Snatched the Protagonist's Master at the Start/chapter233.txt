After quite some time, the sounds within the cottage fell abruptly silent, followed by two long, satisfied sighs.

A moment of stillness passed. Qin Jiang sat on the edge of the bed and glanced at the woman beside him.

'True Immortal? So what? My little brother is invincible!'

He rose, stretched, and threw on his clothes with a look of deep contentment, planning to step outside for some air.

He opened the wooden door. Starlight washed over him as he arched into a luxurious stretch, and then—

He froze. His jaw dropped. A whole crowd of figures stood outside the cottage, and his face twitched.

He swept his gaze across them. Jian Yao, Mo Mo, Yan Shiya, Linglong, Zi Fu, and more—every single one of his women was present. On the other side stood a row of familiar yet unfamiliar faces: the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's entire leadership.

Their gazes were... peculiar, drifting over Qin Jiang and his loosely draped clothing that left rather little to the imagination.

A chill ran through him.

He lurched backward and slammed the door shut, face covered in dark lines.

Had he been seeing things? This was the Azure Lotus Divine Palace—what were Jian Yao and the others doing here? And the palace leadership—this was their ancestor's private residence. How could they just wander up to it? Where was the respect?

"What's wrong?" Qing Chan's voice drifted over. True Immortal or not, she looked a touch tired, but still had some energy left in her.

Seeing Qin Jiang duck back inside the moment he'd stepped out, she asked in confusion.

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. Face dark, he pointed at the door. Qing Chan blinked her beautiful eyes, and in the next instant, her face went scarlet.

"There are people out there?!"

'You're a True Immortal and you only just noticed people standing right outside your own house?'

Looking at Qing Chan, Qin Jiang suddenly felt that this bodyguard he'd just recruited might be a little unreliable.

Qing Chan wrapped herself in the blanket, hopped off the bed barefoot, and winced—still a bit tender. She flung open the door and bellowed:

"Get lost, all of you!"

One sweep of her hand, and every person standing before the cottage went flying.

Worth noting: aside from Jian Yao, Mo Mo, and Yan Shiya, the Azure Lotus Divine Palace had several Immortals of its own. Yet before a True Immortal, none of them could resist. Of course, they hadn't actually tried—otherwise they could have put up at least some struggle.

Watching this display, Qin Jiang revised his earlier assessment. Qing Chan was actually pretty reliable after all.

The door slammed shut again. Qing Chan's delicate face was flushed with fury and embarrassment. She had no idea when they'd arrived, but judging by their expressions, they'd been listening for a long time.

The thought made her feel hot all over. Her carefully maintained image was probably in ruins.

She shot Qin Jiang a resentful look. This was all his fault—he was too good at this, making her drop every last defense, which was how they'd ended up with eavesdroppers in the first place.

Her eyes narrowed as she sidled up to him, staring intently. Qin Jiang coughed, his scalp tingling.

Their extended "friendly exchange" had been very friendly indeed, but this beauty was far from fully tamed. Now that the exchange was over, she'd probably come back to her senses.

"Your embarrassing secret is probably out," Qing Chan said suddenly.

Qin Jiang's expression stiffened. His original plan had been to silence Qing Chan, silence Dan Yu, silence Jian Yao, Mo Mo, Yan Shiya...

Maybe he could have covered it up.

But now, there were rather a lot of people outside. Could he really silence them all?

"How about... you go win them over? I'll help!" Qing Chan dropped a bombshell.

Qin Jiang: "???"

He stared at her in disbelief. Their deep exchange hadn't given him a thorough understanding of her personality—he only knew what the intelligence files said. He wasn't sure if Qing Chan was being sarcastic. Women got jealous easily, even True Immortals. For all he knew, she was planning to keep him all to herself, leveraging her overwhelming power.

"You're serious?" he asked carefully.

Qing Chan's expression turned earnest as she nodded. "Ning Xue'er and those girls have impossibly high standards. In all of Azure Cloud Heaven, there aren't many men who could match them—and you're one of them!"

"So I just... take the whole lot?"

Qing Chan huffed, walked to the bed, and lay down on her side. Gazing at him, she said: "If you've got the ability. But after you win them over, you have to punish them in front of me!"

She clenched her little fist, looking fierce. 'You want to eavesdrop? Just you wait—my revenge is coming!'

Qin Jiang: "..."

So this was about revenge. Well, he liked this kind of revenge. Heh heh heh.

He licked his lips, sat beside Qing Chan, propped himself up, and grinned. "Why not just grab them and bring them here so I can punish them directly?"

"No!" Qing Chan rolled her eyes. She might want revenge, but they were still her sisters. Best not to force them. "You can't force a melon off the vine and expect it to be sweet. You should make them come willingly."

Qin Jiang was speechless. He looked at Qing Chan's completely serious face.

'Saying that with a straight face—aren't you the least bit self-conscious?'

"Hehe, you're the exception." Reading his expression, Qing Chan giggled, suddenly remembering that she had, in fact, kidnapped Qin Jiang. She'd held the initiative at first, but as things progressed, control had gradually shifted until Qin Jiang held it entirely. By the end, she had surrendered completely.

The memory made her cheeks flush.

Looking at him, she sighed inwardly. A True Immortal, and she still couldn't match him. She urgently needed her sisters' reinforcement.

Qin Jiang studied Qing Chan through half-lidded eyes. Even wrapped in a blanket, the curves of her figure were hard to conceal.

Noticing his gaze, Qing Chan clutched the blanket tighter, her eyes wary. "You... don't be rash. I'm a True Immortal!"

Qin Jiang smiled and reached out, ripping the blanket apart.

"Ah!" Qing Chan yelped, face blazing red, and immediately curled up in the corner of the bed, arms wrapped around herself.

Qin Jiang breathed a quiet sigh of relief and put away the Immortal King Seal. It seemed their friendly exchange hadn't been entirely without effect—she hadn't lashed out.

"Heh. My embarrassing secret can't be kept under wraps anymore. So what are you going to do about it?" He advanced on her.

Qing Chan's face showed a flash of panic. She tilted her head and pressed a small hand against his chest. "I... I'll make it up to you, okay?"

"Sure."

In one swift motion, he pounced, pulling her into his arms. Qing Chan went rigid, half-heartedly pushing back as she murmured: "That's not the kind of making up I meant."

"This is the interest. The actual compensation is separate."

"What?"

Qing Chan batted at him, pouting. "You scoundrel! Since when does this count as interest?"
