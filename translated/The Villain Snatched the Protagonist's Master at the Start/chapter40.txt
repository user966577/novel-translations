Back at the Ye estate.

The Fourth Ancestor and the others were all present, and curiously, every one of them looked a shade paler.

"Uh...

What happened to all of you?"

Qin Jiang asked.

The Fourth Ancestor swallowed hard, looking slightly nauseated:

"This is what we get for following you. We saw that Ye Xuan. Damn near made me sick."

The other Supreme experts nodded and added:

"Especially since we went in before you did."

"Hm?"

Qin Jiang's expression turned odd.

'Went in before me'—meaning they'd seen...

The Fourth Ancestor wore a look of utter revulsion. He wanted nothing more than to gouge his own eyes out and wash them. To have witnessed such a foul scene—the world had truly gone to the dogs.

The entire courtyard looked listless and drained.

If Ye Xuan knew he'd managed to traumatize a Great Emperor and a pack of Supreme experts this badly, he'd probably feel rather proud.

To cleanse his eyes and purify his soul, Qin Jiang sought out Ye Ling'er...

The next day.

Qin Jiang addressed the two women:

"I'm heading back to the Qin family. Come with me."

"Already?"

Both were surprised.

Qin Jiang nodded. He hadn't been in a rush originally, but now that Ye Xuan had been released, the sooner he left, the better.

He never wanted to lay eyes on Ye Xuan again.

Only sometimes, the harder you try to avoid someone, the more they appear.

Just as Qin Jiang was about to depart, Ye Qingtian arrived—with Ye Xuan in tow.

Ye Qingtian's face was grim:

"Qin Jiang, I...

My son—what happened to him?"

When he said "son," his voice hitched. At this point, "son" didn't quite seem to apply.

"Father, please don't blame Young Lord Qin. I did it all willingly~"

Ye Xuan pouted, clinging to Ye Qingtian's arm and swaying it like a spoiled child.

Ye Qingtian's expression froze. Qin Jiang could clearly see the goosebumps erupting across the man's arms, his fists clenched tight, as though restraining something deep within.

Qin Jiang fought down his nausea:

"Brother Ye, this really isn't my fault. I didn't expect..."

"That's right, Young Lord Qin is so kind. I want to repay him~"

Qin Jiang: "..."

Ye Qingtian's face was wooden. He took a deep breath and looked at Qin Jiang:

"I hear you're leaving?"

Qin Jiang nodded.

Ye Qingtian's eyes darted to Ye Xuan, then back:

"My son wishes to repay you. Perhaps...

Take him with you?"

Qin Jiang: "???"

'You ungrateful bastard!'

Worse still, Ye Xuan's eyes actually sparkled with anticipation.

A chill shot through Qin Jiang:

"Xiao Xu, get out here and take me home!!!"

ROAR!!!

The Void Beast's massive head materialized before Qin Jiang. Without a shred of hesitation, he leaped aboard and vanished into the Void Palace in the blink of an eye.

The next instant, he was gone.

Ye Qingtian: "..."

Ye Xuan: "..."

Piloting the Void Beast, Qin Jiang located Ye Ling'er and the others, picked them up, and refused to stop. He kept urging the beast onward until they'd left the Ye Domain entirely before finally breathing a sigh of relief.

"Qin Jiang, why are we leaving in such a hurry?"

Ye Ling'er asked curiously.

From Qin Jiang's demeanor, you'd think some terrible monster lurked in the Ye estate.

Qin Jiang wiped cold sweat from his brow. Just thinking about Ye Xuan made him shudder:

"Trust me—you don't want to know."

His reaction only made them more curious. They'd never seen Qin Jiang this terrified. After relentless pestering, he caved and told them about Ye Xuan.

Every woman's face went pale.

Qin Jiang observed their reactions, and his spirits lifted somewhat. Beautiful things always had a way of improving one's mood.

"Alright, we've left the Ye estate. We won't be seeing him again."

He smiled, exhaling with relief.

The journey home didn't need to be rushed, so they traveled at a leisurely pace.

But as they passed over a small town, the system's voice suddenly rang out.

【System Mission: Bring Ye Ling'er to see Xiao Fan. (Note: Xiao Fan is in this town.)

Mission Reward: Xiao Fan's remaining fortune will be transferred to the Qin family.】

"Xiao Fan..."

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow and peered down at the small town below. Xiao Fan was down there?

He'd been meaning to bring Ye Ling'er to check on Xiao Fan anyway. Now, with the system issuing a mission, he certainly wouldn't pass it up.

"Ling'er, let's go take a stroll down there."

He looked down at Ye Ling'er, who was nestled against his chest.

---

Meanwhile, in the town below, a beggar wrapped head-to-toe in black cloth wandered the streets. Around him, a crowd of fellow beggars followed, subtly treating him as their leader.

This beggar had arrived only recently.

At first, the other beggars had bullied him. But gradually, they discovered that this newcomer's luck was absurdly good.

Every time, he managed to collect far more than the rest.

And once, when they'd tried to rob him, the new beggar had unleashed terrifying strength, cowing them all into submission.

From then on, the newcomer became the beggar king.

Each day, he led his ragtag band through the streets, and somehow, they always came away with something.

"Boss, where are we headed today?"

"Heh heh, life's good with the boss around. We never go hungry, and sometimes we even get meat. The boss is truly the Beggar God sent from heaven."

"Exactly. Begging was never this easy before. The boss is incredible."

"A natural-born Beggar Divine Body!"

The beggars showered him with praise, oblivious to the fact that beneath those black wrappings, his expression had turned murderous.

Beggar God?

Beggar Divine Body?

Ha. He, Xiao Fan, had been reduced to this. How pathetic.

But now his Fire Divine Body was all but destroyed. His meridians were a charred ruin—cultivation was permanently beyond his reach.

Beyond that, scars covered every inch of his body, refusing to heal. He frightened even himself. If he showed his face, people would mistake him for a monster.

Bitterness gnawed at Xiao Fan's heart.

Without his extraordinary luck, he'd probably have starved to death by now. But he didn't know how long that luck would hold.

Somewhere in the back of his mind, he could feel something ethereal and precious being steadily stripped from him—something vital, something irreplaceable—and there was nothing he could do about it.

He wandered aimlessly, heart full of confusion, when suddenly—

His feet stopped. His eyes locked onto two familiar figures ahead, and his body began to tremble uncontrollably.
