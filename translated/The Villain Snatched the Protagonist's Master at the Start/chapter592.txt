The woman's eyes widened. Just like that? Threatening her without a shred of pretense? It was so... honest, in the worst possible way.

Before her, Yang Hong's heart lurched. This threat held their lives in the balance, and this man could absolutely follow through. He stole a glance at his daughter, wanting to say something, but didn't dare. Right now, her standing was far above his own.

"Take a good look at them," Qin Jiang said lightly. "Because one of these days, they might all just disappear."

The woman shivered. She looked toward the Yang family—her family. Though she'd fallen out of favor because of the Zhao Sheng incident, she was still a Yang by blood. And despite everything, she'd only been sidelined, never truly mistreated. Her father still slipped her extra resources on the quiet.

Looking at them—at her father—she clenched her fists, turned to Qin Jiang, and spoke, her voice trembling faintly. "Don't hurt them. I'll do whatever you say."

"Now that's a good girl." Qin Jiang pecked her on the cheek, then grinned. "Cheer up. Smile for me."

'He threatens me, and then tells me to smile? How am I supposed to smile?'

But under his gaze, she could only force the corners of her mouth upward. This man was unpredictable. Defy him, and who knew what he'd do.

Satisfied, Qin Jiang nodded and turned to Yang Hong. "Right then. You're all dismissed."

"Yes, sir."

Yang Hong didn't linger. He exchanged a meaningful look with his daughter and led the Yang family away. With any luck, his daughter would have the sense to behave. Landing a backer like this meant her future was secure, and the Yang family's prospects had just transformed. The Zhao family? Irrelevant now.

After they left, Qin Jiang issued a few instructions to Black Dragon and the others, then carried the woman back inside. He laid her on the bed and stretched out beside her. She was surprisingly docile, nestling against him without complaint.

"What's this? Holding a grudge?" he asked, looking down at her.

"No." She shook her head. She didn't dare speak her mind—this man was utterly unreasonable.

Qin Jiang's lips curled. He rolled on top of her. "In that case... shall we continue?"

"!!!"

Panic flashed in her eyes. She was still in pain. But she didn't dare resist. Trembling, she clutched the sheets, gave a tiny nod, and closed her eyes—bracing herself.

Yet nothing happened. After a long moment, she opened her eyes in confusion.

Qin Jiang was looking at her with a teasing smile. He leaned down, kissed her gently, and said, "Just messing with you. You're exhausted—get some rest."

He rolled to one side, pulled her into his arms, ruffled her hair with one hand, and patted her back softly with the other. The sudden tenderness caught her off guard. Her heart skipped.

She looked up at him—he really was handsome. And after all that roughness, this flash of gentleness hit differently. Like a man who'd done a thousand wrongs suddenly doing something kind, and being remembered for that single gesture. While a man who'd done a thousand kindnesses could be condemned for one mistake. Feelings worked the same way.

Exhaustion won out. In the warmth of his embrace, drowsiness crept in, and before long, she was asleep.

Over at the Zhao family compound, Zhao Sheng's eyes snapped open. He frowned, pressing a hand to his chest. Something was slipping away—something important.

He rose to his feet, a nameless anxiety coiling in his gut. "Is something about to happen?"

His heart was a storm of restlessness. Meditation was impossible. After standing there a while, he produced a scroll—the portrait of his beloved. Looking at her face, his agitation finally eased.

He traced his fingers across the painted features, his expression softening. "I'll come to the Yang family to propose. Wait for me."

He admired the portrait a little longer before rolling it up. But he'd lost all desire to cultivate. He walked out to his courtyard and stood gazing in the direction of the Yang family. He didn't know why, but the urge to see her—right now, immediately—was overwhelming. Until he did, he couldn't rest.

Brow furrowed, he left his courtyard and quickly found Liu Xing.

"What's wrong?" Liu Xing asked, surprised. Zhao Sheng never sought him out this late.

Zhao Sheng hesitated, then rubbed his hands together awkwardly. "Liu-ge, would you come with me to the Yang family?"

"The Yang family? To propose?"

"No." Zhao Sheng shook his head adamantly, his brow creasing. "I can't explain it, but I keep feeling like something's wrong. Like she's in danger."

Liu Xing's brow twitched. The kid's instincts were sharp—the Manor Lord was over there, so of course something had happened. But it was far too late now. Even if it wasn't, Zhao Sheng going over there would accomplish nothing. He certainly couldn't stop the Manor Lord. More likely, he'd end up standing guard outside.

After a brief pause, Liu Xing nodded. "Alright. Tomorrow?"

"Can we go now?"

"That urgent?"

"I'm afraid something's happened to her." Zhao Sheng smiled wryly.

Liu Xing clicked his tongue, then agreed. "Fine. Let's go."

As they set out from the Zhao estate, Liu Xing discreetly notified Qin Jiang. About two hours later, they arrived at the Yang family's city. The sky was still black.

Liu Xing glanced at the darkness, then at Zhao Sheng. "Isn't it a bit late for a house call?"

It really was. But Zhao Sheng's unease had only intensified. He looked toward the estate, weighed his options briefly, then grabbed Liu Xing's arm and started walking. "Liu-ge, I need to see her. Now."

"Alright."

"Let's hurry."
