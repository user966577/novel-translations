The Ghost Immortal's roar shook the heavens, his aura exploding outward.

Qin Jiang smiled placidly. In the face of an immortal's fury, he was the calmest person present.

"There's no saving him," he said lightly. "That pill ends all suffering. Even an immortal can't reverse it."

End all suffering. The Ghost Immortal's face contorted—Qin Jiang's definition of "ending suffering" was killing the patient.

He could feel his grandson's life force draining away. The body, already half-dissolved, continued to deteriorate even with his energy sustaining it. Worse still, the boy's very soul was disintegrating.

At this rate—complete annihilation. Body and soul, gone.

"You're heartless!" the Ghost Immortal snarled, his aura churning. Every ounce of killing intent was aimed at Qin Jiang.

Jian Yao and Mo Mo flanked Qin Jiang instantly, their eyes locked on the old man.

Then a new figure appeared beside the Ghost Immortal.

"Senior—I may be able to save him!"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. Chen Changsheng had stepped forward.

In the original storyline, this was exactly what happened—Chen Changsheng saved the grandson, earning the Ghost Immortal's eternal gratitude. Was he really going to do it again?

The Pill Emperor frowned. She'd disliked Chen Changsheng from the start. Watching him rush to save a man who'd terrorized women only deepened her contempt.

The Ghost Immortal spun toward the voice. Seeing just a young man, his brow furrowed. "You can save my grandson?"

Chen Changsheng glanced at Qin Jiang, then nodded with confidence. He didn't want to reveal his true identity outright, but he intended to demonstrate enough to make the Pill Emperor recognize him.

He didn't realize her opinion of him had already cratered.

The Ghost Immortal was skeptical, but Chen Changsheng pressed: "Senior, do you have any other options right now?"

The old man froze. Fair point. Things couldn't get much worse.

"Fine." He ground his teeth. "But if you fail—I'll hold you responsible."

Chen Changsheng knelt beside the grandson and assessed the damage. His expression turned grave.

Up on the platform, the Pill Emperor leaned toward Qin Jiang. "Should we stop him?"

The grandson was a criminal who deserved his fate. If not for the Ghost Immortal's power, he'd already have been executed.

But if the grandson died, the Ghost Immortal would go berserk—and a berserk immortal was dangerous, even for them.

"Let's see what happens," Qin Jiang said, smiling.

Chen Changsheng placed his palm on the grandson's body. A hazy, ethereal energy poured from his hand, forcibly expelling the Ghost Immortal's own power in the process.

The Ghost Immortal's eyes went wide.

Qin Jiang murmured to himself: "The Power of Reincarnation."

Ten cycles of death and rebirth had granted Chen Changsheng insight into the laws of reincarnation—though his comprehension was still incomplete.

Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed. He summoned the Myriad Dao Stone to his palm. This man had grasped a Reincarnation Law. When the time was right, he'd extract it.

The Reincarnation Law sat on the same tier as Space-Time Laws—extraordinarily rare and powerful. The Time-Space Disc contained a Space-Time Law fragment, but it was incomplete. Getting a Reincarnation Law in the meantime would be a massive windfall.

But not yet. Not today.

He tucked the Myriad Dao Stone away and let his smile return.

Under the Power of Reincarnation, the grandson's life signs stabilized. His dissolving body even began to regenerate. The Ghost Immortal's face lit up with relief.

The young man really did have talent.

He watched intently as his grandson's condition improved, his tension finally easing—

A streak of sword light screamed toward them.

The Ghost Immortal's face hardened. He threw himself in front of his grandson.

A dull impact. He staggered back a step.

Jian Yao stood with her sword raised, aimed at the grandson. The Ghost Immortal snarled: "You truly intend to make an enemy of me?!"

"Tch. You're nothing." Jian Yao pointed her blade at him. "Step aside, or I kill you first, then your grandson."

"You dare!"

"Heh."

Jian Yao brought her sword down without hesitation.

The Ghost Immortal's expression twisted. He regretted coming here. Against two immortals, he couldn't protect his grandson.

"If you touch my grandson—even if it costs me my life—I will make you regret this!"

He roared his threat, and a suicidal immortal was no joke. Even Jian Yao and Mo Mo couldn't guarantee Qin Jiang's safety against a death charge.

But Qin Jiang seemed unbothered. He strolled off the platform and walked straight toward Chen Changsheng.

The Ghost Immortal's expression shifted, but Jian Yao blocked his path. He couldn't get through.

Meanwhile, Chen Changsheng looked up warily. "What do you want?"

Qin Jiang stopped in front of him, grinned—and slapped him across the face.

"Get lost!"

Chen Changsheng's hands were committed to healing. He couldn't block. The slap sent him spinning through the air.

Without the Power of Reincarnation sustaining him, the grandson's body resumed its rapid dissolution.

"MY GRANDSON!"

The Ghost Immortal howled.

He charged. Jian Yao met him blade-first, cutting off his path.

Chen Changsheng hit the ground in a daze. In ten lifetimes, no one had ever slapped him across the face.

"You're dead!" He leapt to his feet, eyes blazing with murderous fury. Ten lifetimes of accumulated dao fruit meant that, at full power, he could step onto the immortal path and fully comprehend the Reincarnation Law. He would become truly undying—Immortal King, even Immortal Emperor, none of it out of reach.

And someone had just backhanded him.

The humiliation was indescribable.

But Qin Jiang only sneered and closed the distance. He grabbed Chen Changsheng by the collar and commenced a two-handed barrage of open-palm slaps—left, right, left, right.

'You're an early-stage Saint at best in this life. Who are you trying to intimidate?'

Chen Changsheng roared and fought back, but he was facing Qin Jiang—a cultivator at Saint Realm Great Perfection, with superior talent to boot. Ten lifetimes or not, he was going to eat every one of those slaps.

The Power of Reincarnation was genuinely formidable, though. Even Qin Jiang's Taotie Divine Body couldn't devour it directly. He had to deploy the Time-Space Disc to suppress Chen Changsheng before his divine body could forcibly absorb a sliver of the energy—which instantly converted into pure power.

With a final kick, Qin Jiang punted Chen Changsheng across the plaza. The man lay there, utterly stunned.

He was a Saint, but with ten reincarnations behind him, even Supreme-level powerhouses couldn't guarantee a win against him. Yet this young man had beaten him senseless.

His entire worldview had just been shattered.
