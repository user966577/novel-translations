Qin Jiang pocketed the extracted law power and turned to the group with a smile, then looked to Murong Qing. Every Blood Tribe member tensed, mentally reviewing whether they'd ever offended her.

Murong Qing had been shaken by watching Qin Jiang extract an Immortal's law power. When his gaze landed on her, she snapped back to focus and shook her head. The other elders didn't deserve death. But Qin Jiang's opening move had been lethal—if she didn't rein things in, he might kill them all.

"No one else?" he confirmed.

"This is enough."

"Good." His attention shifted to the Blood Tribe chief. "In that case, there's one more thing I'd like to discuss with you."

The chief lifted his head, bewildered. Discuss? As if anything required discussion now. He couldn't so much as speak without Qin Jiang's permission. He was a puppet with awareness. But Qin Jiang had asked, so he played along. "What would Manor Lord Qin like to discuss?"

Neither man played the father-in-law and son-in-law dynamic. Qin Jiang had never treated him as family, and the chief knew it. After the True Spirit Slave Seal, even pretending was impossible.

"I think Huaxia and the Blood Tribe could benefit from a partnership," Qin Jiang said.

"A partnership?"

"That's right. This partnership would strengthen both sides. And the Blood Tribe's gains would be substantial."

"What kind of partnership?"

"The Blood Tribe submits to Huaxia."

The chief stared. That was a partnership?

"With the Blood Tribe on board, Huaxia's strength grows by a tiny bit. But for you? Having Huaxia behind you—that's an enormous boost."

The Blood Tribe members listened in speechless silence. The chief sighed and nodded. "Manor Lord Qin is right."

Submit, then. They had no power to resist. Why dress it up? He'd almost believed Qin Jiang was offering something genuine. In the end, it was exactly what they'd expected—a superior dictating terms. At least it was better than annihilation. After the chief's enslavement and the elder's death, nobody dared object.

The chief took a steadying breath. "Manor Lord Qin, I am willing to lead the Blood Tribe in submission to Huaxia. We will go through fire and water for the cause."

"Ha! It's not that serious. Once you join Huaxia, we're all family."

The Blood Tribe elders, reading the room, fell into line. "We greet the Manor Lord!"

"At ease." Qin Jiang lifted a hand. He knew most of them were submitting out of fear, not loyalty. But once they experienced Huaxia's benefits, they'd come around. The stick-and-carrot approach never failed.

"From this point on, carry on as usual. When assignments come, someone will be in touch."

"Yes, sir. Whenever duty calls, we will not fail the Manor Lord's trust."

Willing or not, they seized every chance to pledge loyalty. There was no escaping Huaxia's orbit now.

With that settled, the three of them left. They didn't return to Xue Yue's quarters but went straight to Murong Qing's residence. Once inside the courtyard, Qin Jiang asked, "Feeling better now, Mother-in-law?"

"Mm. Thank you." She gave a slight nod.

Qin Jiang smiled. "We're family—no need for formalities. Though, from now on, your position in the Blood Tribe will probably be..." He trailed off, but the implication was clear. The Blood Tribe would blame her for Qin Jiang's actions. No one would dare harm her, but she'd be ostracized.

Murong Qing understood. She'd effectively betrayed the tribe. There was no place for her here anymore.

"How about... Mother, you come with us?" Xue Yue said.

She'd figured it out too. Staying would be miserable.

Qin Jiang's eyebrow lifted. It wasn't a bad idea. "What does Mother-in-law think?"

"Come with you..." Murong Qing hesitated, but Xue Yue pressed on eagerly. "We have so many sisters! You'd never be lonely."

Murong Qing's eyes widened. She shot Qin Jiang a look, cheeks flushing. "Yueyue, what are you talking about? I'm your mother. What do you mean, 'sisters'?"

Xue Yue blinked, then realized how that sounded. She scratched her head awkwardly. "That's not what I meant! I meant the girls would definitely... oh, never mind. Living with us is definitely better than staying here."

Some things only got worse with explanation.

Qin Jiang just smiled, watching the two of them. He was fine either way.

Murong Qing realized she'd misread the situation. Her cheeks colored as she glared at Xue Yue. The girl really needed to think before she spoke.

Meanwhile, Xue Yue was privately musing. Weiwei's master, Mu Yunxiao, was already with Qin Jiang. Her own mother was every bit as beautiful. And her parents' marriage was loveless—an arranged political union that had now completely fallen apart. Qin Jiang and her mother together wasn't out of the question.

He was picky, but also shameless enough that he just might be into it.
