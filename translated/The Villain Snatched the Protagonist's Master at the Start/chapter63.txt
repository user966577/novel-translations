One day, Bai Jingyun came to see Qin Jiang. He was preparing to return to the Holy Sword Sect, and the news of Qin Jiang achieving Sword Heart had already spread far and wide, sending shockwaves through the sword cultivation community. Powerful swordsmen had begun arriving at the Qin estate, though the family hadn't accepted any of them—at the Qin family's level, only Supreme Realm cultivators barely warranted a second glance. Anyone weaker didn't qualify.

"Planning to head back?" Qin Jiang considered for a moment. "How about I come along to the Holy Sword Sect?"

"You'd visit our sect?" Bai Jingyun was thrilled.

Nominally, Qin Jiang was already the Holy Sword Sect's Holy Son, but few people actually believed it. After all, he was the Qin family's young patriarch. The Qin family was stronger than the Holy Sword Sect—why would he abandon his position there to play Holy Son? But if Qin Jiang showed up in person, that credibility issue would vanish instantly.

"If it would help, I can make the trip," Qin Jiang offered.

"Yes! Absolutely!" Bai Jingyun said without hesitation.

Qin Jiang nodded. "When are you heading back?"

"Whenever you're ready!"

Qin Jiang: "..."

Bai Jingyun coughed. "Just say the word and I can leave anytime."

"Tomorrow, then." He'd need tonight to properly say goodbye to Ye Ling'er and the others.

He didn't plan on bringing them this time. Bai Susu and Qin Lian'er would come, though—Bai Susu needed to visit home, and his clever little sister could help him with certain... initiatives.

His true reason for visiting the Holy Sword Sect wasn't simple altruism. According to the system's spoilers, the sect harbored an ancient ancestral elder—a female one. Thousands of years old, yet she'd spent her entire life in pursuit of the sword and had never been in a relationship. Qin Jiang felt sorry for her. He really ought to help.

The spoiler had shown her: a half-Emperor with the outward appearance of a girl in her twenties, layered with the depth of ages. The blend of innocence and maturity was enough to make Qin Jiang's heart skip a beat.

The next morning, Ye Ling'er and the others—exhausted from last night's "farewell"—didn't come to see Qin Jiang off. He set out with Bai Susu, Qin Lian'er, and Bai Jingyun toward the Holy Sword Sect.

Aboard the Void Palace, Bai Susu's curious gaze kept drifting to Little Red, perched on Qin Lian'er's shoulder. She'd heard about the phoenix but hadn't seen it until now. "Is that the little phoenix?" she asked.

"Yep! Her name's Little Red. She's amazing," Qin Lian'er confirmed proudly.

"She's so cute!" Bai Susu leaned closer, wanting to pet her but worried the phoenix might not allow it.

Little Red stared back with round, luminous eyes. Her scarlet feathers shimmered, and her fist-sized body was perfectly round. Adorable was an understatement.

"Go ahead, you can pet her. Her feathers are super soft," Qin Lian'er encouraged.

After Qin Lian'er's reassurance, Bai Susu carefully reached out and brushed Little Red's feathers. The phoenix glanced at her, flapped her wings once, then closed her eyes and dozed off on Qin Lian'er's shoulder.

"Wow, they really are soft!" Bai Susu exclaimed.

Little Red became the bonding catalyst—the two women quickly became fast friends.

The Holy Sword Sect wasn't far from the Qin Domain. To accommodate Bai Jingyun's traveling speed, the Void Beast didn't go full throttle, and the journey took three days. Bai Jingyun had sent word ahead, and by the time they arrived, the sect's territory was packed with several times its normal population—the region practically bursting at the seams.

Standing on the Void Palace, Qin Jiang looked down at the sea of humanity below. Bai Jingyun joined him with a smile. "They're all here for you."

The turnout was staggering even to Bai Jingyun. A Sword Heart master was an irresistible magnet for sword cultivators. If all of them joined the sect... well, they'd eat the Holy Sword Sect into bankruptcy.

After a bit more flying, they reached the skies above the Holy Sword Sect itself. The crowds here were thinner—clearly the area had been cleared. A hegemonic power couldn't afford to let too many strangers get too close.

When the Void Beast appeared overhead, the sect knew exactly who had arrived. Every high-ranking member gathered to meet them. As Qin Jiang descended, they surrounded him immediately, every pair of eyes burning with intensity. The sea of fervent stares—all from grizzled old men—made his scalp tingle.

"Young Patriarch Qin, could you... could you perhaps demonstrate your Sword Heart for us?" one elder ventured cautiously.

Behind Qin Jiang, even Bai Jingyun watched with expectation. No one besides Lin Chen had actually felt the power of Sword Heart firsthand.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. "Certainly. Though fair warning—Sword Heart exerts absolute suppression over sword cultivators."

He released a unique aura from within. It blossomed outward, enveloping everyone present. In that instant, every person felt their power slip out of control. Their swords trembled, then launched themselves skyward of their own accord—pointing at Qin Jiang in reverence.

The demonstration lasted only moments before Qin Jiang withdrew his power. Everyone was drenched in cold sweat. Despite outranking him in cultivation, they'd felt an overwhelming compulsion to kneel.

Bai Jingyun drew a shaky breath. No wonder Lin Chen had been crushed so thoroughly. Under Sword Heart's influence, he could barely summon the will to resist.

"This is Sword Heart," Qin Jiang said. "And this is why a Sword Heart master is called the Sword Emperor."

Every gaze turned reverent.

"To witness a Sword Emperor in our lifetimes—that is our fortune," one elder declared. The rest nodded solemnly.

Qin Lian'er and Bai Susu watched with glowing pride—one proud of her brother, the other of her husband.

The sole outlier was Lin Chen. Though stripped of his Holy Son title, he'd remained at the sect for its resources. Qin Jiang wouldn't stay forever; once he left, the sect would be Lin Chen's domain again. For now, he could endure. Patience was the cornerstone of great ambition.

Watching Qin Jiang's back, Lin Chen silently repeated these mantras. Though hatred churned inside him, not a trace showed on his face.
