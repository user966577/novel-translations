Exhausted from her lessons, Shanshan curled up in Qin Jiang's arms and drifted off. He closed his eyes as well.

When he'd first laid eyes on Shanshan, the system had pinged him—which meant she was connected to a Child of Destiny. Was the little thing a fortune heroine?

He sank his consciousness into the system. New plot details materialized quickly. A brief scan, and he opened his eyes, gazing down at her with a strange expression.

Not a fortune heroine. A villain.

It made sense. With that imperious personality, she didn't exactly fit the heroine mold. Within the Royal City, Shanshan was a little terror—leveraging her grandfather's status to bully other Merfolk. She'd terrorized so many that she didn't have a single friend. Everyone feared her. The moment she stepped outside, other Merfolk scattered like she was a walking disaster.

This only made her angrier, which made her lash out harder, which made everyone avoid her more. A vicious cycle that had turned her increasingly isolated and bitter.

Deep down, though, she desperately wanted companionship. Qin Jiang's arrival—his confidence, his status, his actions—had given her hope from the first moment. That was why she'd been so eager to please.

She wanted a friend. This particular friend was a bit inappropriate, but she liked him anyway.

Qin Jiang looked at the little villain curled against his chest and smacked his lips. Who would've guessed she was a bully? But it was pitiable, really—feared by most, scorned by her peers, utterly alone.

As for the Merfolk she'd terrorized? Not his problem. They had to have done something to provoke her. She was clearly a sweet girl who'd been unfairly labeled a menace.

How cruel!

He stroked her hair and kissed her forehead.

Shanshan was a villain, but the Royal City also housed a fortune heroine—and this one was extraordinary.

An empress.

The Merfolk Empress herself—the tribe's only Immortal Emperor and strongest cultivator.

Her situation, however, was precarious. Below her stood the Ten Elders, all Immortal Kings. The strongest among them was the Grand Elder—and the most ambitious. Behind a facade of warmth and benevolence lurked a monster.

He practiced a sinister art that allowed him to absorb a woman's cultivation through intimacy. Countless Merfolk women had fallen victim. And now his sights were set on the Merfolk Empress. If he could absorb her power, he'd become an Immortal Emperor and the tribe's new ruler.

He'd been plotting for ages, and his preparations were nearly complete.

In the original storyline, he failed—barely. His plan was to drug the Empress and then absorb her cultivation, but he'd underestimated an Immortal Emperor's resilience. Even drugged, she'd mustered enough strength to seriously wound him before escaping.

Lost and disoriented, she'd encountered the Child of Destiny. The Grand Elder's scheming had served as someone else's setup.

In the end, the Grand Elder was forced to flee the tribe. When the Empress returned at full power, she hunted him down and killed him—as was every villain's fate.

Qin Jiang had the plot in advance. No way was he letting the Child of Destiny claim this prize.

An Immortal Emperor? The Child of Destiny couldn't handle that.

This one was his.

But should he warn the Empress beforehand, or simply swoop in afterward?

He considered. Warning her might not earn any gratitude—and even if it did, seducing an Immortal Emperor from scratch would take far too long.

Better to pick up the pieces. More practical.

By his calculation, the Grand Elder would make his move in three days. Qin Jiang's presence might cause the timing to shift, though, so he'd need to monitor things.

Through the True Spirit Slave Seal, he ordered his Immortal Kings to covertly watch the Grand Elder—the moment the man headed toward the royal palace, they were to report immediately.

As for Qin Jiang himself? He'd spend the next few days conducting thorough research on Merfolk anatomy.

After extensive study—pinning Shanshan down for the better part of a day—he still couldn't find any significant differences between Merfolk and humans. What he could confirm was that the Merfolk's innate water-manipulation abilities were exceptional. In that department, only Ye Ling'er came close.

Three full days. Qin Jiang and Shanshan never left the bedroom once, exploring every conceivable angle.

Then, on the third day, his Immortal Kings reported via the slave seal—the Grand Elder had left his residence, headed straight for the royal palace.

The arrival of outsiders hadn't altered the timeline. Either that, or the Grand Elder was confident enough not to care.

Qin Jiang smiled, rising from the bed. He pinched Shanshan's cheek. "I have to step out for a bit."

"What for?"

"To find you a Merfolk sister."

"Huh?"

But she wasn't jealous—not anymore. Having Qin Jiang beside her made her happy, and his strength meant she needed allies. Shanshan got up and helped him dress, curiosity winning out. "Who've you got your eye on? Want me to just grab her for you?"

"You couldn't handle this one."

"Hmph! In this Royal City, the people I can't handle can be counted on one hand. Name her—I'll snatch her right now!"

"The Merfolk Empress."

"!!!"

Shanshan froze, then stared at him uncertainly. "Who?"

"The Merfolk Empress."

Seeing her expression, Qin Jiang couldn't help but laugh. "What? Can you snatch her for me?"
