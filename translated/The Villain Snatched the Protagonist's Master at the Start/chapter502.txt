Wu Tian was stopped cold outside the Huaxia branch office.

The guards glared at him. "Beat it. This isn't a place for con artists."

"..."

He clenched his jaw. But he wasn't leaving empty-handed. He took a calming breath and explained. "During the Manor Lord's beauty pageant, my sister was selected. The Manor Lord himself decreed that Huaxia would cover my cultivation resources."

"Never heard of it."

The guards were unmoved, regarding him with open contempt—like he was a beggar.

One guard stepped forward with a knowing smirk. "Look, we're just low-ranking guys with bad memories. So..." He rubbed his fingers together.

Wu Tian laughed bitterly. They wanted a bribe. Petty gatekeepers.

He suppressed his irritation. Compared to Huaxia's resources, a small payment was nothing. He handed over some materials. The guards sneered.

"You think we're beggars?"

"..."

An Immortal Emperor, reduced to this. Unfortunately, he had almost nothing left. He gritted his teeth and surrendered every last resource he possessed. Only then did the guards look satisfied.

They divided the spoils right in front of him, then one jerked his chin toward the entrance. "Wait here. I'll check inside."

The guard returned shortly. "You can go in."

Wu Tian exhaled and entered. He found the resource distribution counter without difficulty.

"I'm Wu Tian. The Manor Lord decreed that Huaxia would cover my cultivation resources."

"Wu Tian?" The clerk—a middle-aged man—consulted his records, then nodded. "The Manor Lord did issue such an order. However..."

"What?"

The clerk smiled pleasantly. "How do you prove that you're Wu Tian?"

"???"

A mighty Immortal Emperor, completely stumped.

How do I prove I'm me?

He opened his mouth, then closed it. He genuinely didn't know how to answer.

The clerk waited with an amiable smile. "If you can't prove you're Wu Tian, I'm afraid I can't release the resources."

Silence stretched.

"How would I go about proving it?" Wu Tian finally asked.

"That's up to you."

Wu Tian was certain this man was deliberately making his life difficult, but he had no proof. The clerk was nothing but smiles and courtesy. At least the guards outside had been openly hostile. This bureaucratic politeness was somehow worse.

"When the Manor Lord issued the order, didn't he describe what I look like?"

"Oh, I wouldn't know. Orders come down through the chain of command. By the time they reach me, all I have is a name."

"..."

Just a name? How was anyone supposed to verify their identity? The only option would be to bring his sister to vouch for him, but the whole point was to get resources before secretly rescuing her. He couldn't tip his hand.

"I'm a member of the Wu family. Isn't that proof enough?"

"How do you prove you're a member of the Wu family?"

"I..."

Every exchange with this man stoked an inextinguishable fire in his chest.

"I'll bring someone from the Wu family. They can confirm I'm Wu Tian."

"That would work."

The next day, Wu Tian returned with a Wu family elder. After bribing the guards again, they made it to the counter.

"This is a Wu family elder," Wu Tian said. "He can confirm my identity."

The clerk glanced at the elder. "And how do you prove you're a Wu family elder?"

Wu Tian: "..."

Here we go again.

The elder looked at Wu Tian, equally baffled. Neither knew what to say.

The elder produced a token. "This is my Wu family elder's insignia. Will that suffice?"

"I'm sorry. We only accept Huaxia-issued credentials. We have no way to verify whether a Wu family token is genuine."

"..."

A long pause.

"How does one obtain Huaxia credentials?" the elder asked.

"Simple. Since the Wu family is now part of Huaxia, you just need your family head to provide a letter of certification. Then you can register at the branch office."

"Just the family head's letter?"

"Correct."

"Fine. Wait here!"

The elder led Wu Tian back out. He had to prove he was a Wu family elder first.

Wu Tian said nothing. He had a sinking feeling that even with the family head's letter, they'd hit another wall. The clerk would probably ask how to verify the family head.

These resources were almost certainly a lost cause.
