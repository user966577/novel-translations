Xue Yue didn't go home that night. She stayed at Qin Jiang's side, spending the evening in a thorough exploration of their newfound intimacy. By morning, she returned to her quarters planning to pack up and move in permanently.

She'd barely stepped through the door when Nangong Yun appeared. She cracked the gate open without inviting him in, brow furrowed. "What?"

She was in a hurry to get back — that jerk was waiting.

"Xue Yue, you should get more rest." He eyed the fatigue on her face with concern.

"None of your business." She had zero patience left. "If you have something to say, say it. Otherwise, I'm busy."

He blinked. 'Her temper is even worse than before. The poison must not have cleared. But I left the antidote...' Then, noticing her exhaustion, it clicked — she hadn't slept well. And women got moody once a month, didn't they? That was probably it.

He forced a smile. "There's something I need your help with."

"What?"

He hesitated, struggling to get the words out. Her patience snapped. "Spit it out!"

"It... might require a sacrifice on your part."

Her eyes narrowed. "If this is about the Blood Tribe—"

"No! Not the Blood Tribe. A personal sacrifice."

"???"

He dropped all pretense. "I was hoping you'd help my senior sister."

"Help Weiwei? With what?"

He sighed, face crumpling with anguish. "You know the man at her side?"

"I do." She certainly did. They'd been kissing and hugging for days, and last night they'd gone all the way.

"My senior sister only gave herself to him for my sake. And now she's living in misery — suffering every day. I can't do anything for her, so I've come to you."

Xue Yue blinked. 'Weiwei — suffering? In misery?' From what she'd seen, Weiwei was thoroughly enjoying herself. 'Did Weiwei tell you this?'

"No. But I saw her the other day — exhausted, just like you are now. That man must be treating her terribly."

Xue Yue held back a retort. She knew exactly why Weiwei was exhausted. "Treating her terribly" was a stretch — it was tiring, yes, but hardly unpleasant. Qin Jiang was considerate and never pushed too hard. And as for Weiwei doing this "for Nangong Yun"... pure fantasy.

'He made all of this up in his own head,' she thought, studying him. 'He really is a clown.'

"So what exactly do you want me to do?"

He fidgeted. "I was hoping you'd go to that man and help share the burden with my senior sister..."

She stared. He was asking her to become Qin Jiang's woman — to lighten Weiwei's "suffering." She couldn't help but laugh. "You want me to become that man's woman?"

"I know it's a lot to ask—"

She held up a hand. "And what's my compensation?"

He steeled himself, face solemn. "If you agree, I'll compensate you. I... I can be with you. You can do anything you want with me. We can even sleep together."

Xue Yue was struck speechless by disgust. She looked at this man she'd once admired and felt revulsion for the first time. She raised her hand to slap him — then thought better of touching him. She grabbed a stick instead and swung it hard between his legs.

His scream echoed as he crumpled to his knees, eyes bulging, face crimson, sweat pouring down his forehead.

She tossed the stick aside, went back in to grab her things, and walked out — stepping around his still-kneeling form — heading straight for Qin Jiang's.
