Looking at Qin Jiang and Lian'er, Qin Hao and Li Xueyi could only sigh in helpless resignation.

They exchanged a glance, and Li Xueyi spoke first. "Well, since that's how it is, there's something I should tell you both."

Her gaze settled on Lian'er.

"Lian'er — the truth is, you popped out of a rock. Your father and I found you and brought you home."

Lian'er: "???"

Qin Jiang: "..."

Qin Hao: "..."

Lian'er was dumbfounded. She popped out of a rock? Was this a joke? Why not just say she was found in a dumpster?

Qin Jiang's brow twitched. He looked at his mother and immediately understood her meaning — she wasn't going to stand in their way.

He knew perfectly well where Lian'er came from. He'd been five years old when she was born, and as a transmigrator who'd been conscious since the womb, he remembered everything.

So regarding his mother's bald-faced fabrication — yes, he absolutely believed it.

Lian'er had definitely popped out of a rock.

He remembered it clearly. One fateful day, atop the Eastern Sea, a boulder had cracked open and Lian'er had sprung forth, landing squarely in their mother's arms.

And that's how she'd been adopted.

Qin Hao cleared his throat and shot Li Xueyi a meaningful look. He felt the story could use some work — there was no way Lian'er would buy something this flimsy. They needed at least a proper backstory to sell it.

His mind raced, trying to add credibility to his wife's claim.

But then—

"So I really did pop out of a rock!"

Lian'er's face lit up with genuine delight.

Whether or not anyone else believed it, she certainly did.

Qin Jiang also exclaimed with appropriate astonishment: "I had no idea Lian'er popped out of a rock!"

Qin Hao stared at his children, both wearing expressions of total, sincere amazement. He was baffled. Were his kids really this gullible? They actually believed this?

"So that means — you're not my real brother!" Lian'er looked up, her bright eyes fixed on Qin Jiang. Joy was written all over her face. As of this moment, every obstacle in her path had been obliterated.

Her brother liked her. Her mother approved. As for her father — he was irrelevant.

Qin Jiang ruffled her hair and nodded with exaggerated wonder. "I really didn't expect you came from a rock."

"Mm... that sounds kind of weird, though."

She glanced at Li Xueyi, her eyes blinking as if to ask whether she could perhaps have a different origin story.

Li Xueyi coughed and ignored the look entirely. She couldn't be bothered to put more effort into this.

They believed it. Good enough.

She looked at Lian'er, her expression softening into something complex. "Even though you came from a rock, Lian'er, we've always treated you as our own daughter. The truth may be out now, but you're still our girl."

"I know, Mom." Lian'er nodded.

Aside from her relationship with Qin Jiang, everything else stayed the same. She wasn't stupid — she understood exactly what her mother was doing.

Beaming, she let go of Qin Jiang and threw herself into Li Xueyi's arms. "Mom, thank you."

"As long as you're happy."

Li Xueyi smiled and stroked her hair, then glanced at Qin Jiang. This was probably the best possible outcome.

Lian'er planted a kiss on Li Xueyi's cheek, then sprang up and turned to Qin Jiang, barely containing her excitement. "Mom, I want to go for a walk with Brother."

A walk? Li Xueyi rolled her eyes. With those hungry eyes, you want to go for a "walk"? She knew exactly what kind of walk this would be.

But she pinched Lian'er's cheek and nodded. "Fine. But walking might be a little... uncomfortable at first. Listen to your brother — he's got plenty of experience. Let him teach you."

Lian'er's face went crimson. She stole a glance at Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang shrugged. He wasn't going to argue — his experience was indeed extensive.

"I'll listen to everything Brother says~"

She hurried back to Qin Jiang's side and slipped her small hand into his.

"Dad, Mom — we're heading out."

She waved goodbye, and once Qin Hao and Li Xueyi nodded, tugged Qin Jiang toward the door. He waved too and let himself be pulled along.

Watching their retreating figures, Qin Hao turned to Li Xueyi with a grave expression. "Xueyi, I think our kids might be a little... simple."

Li Xueyi blinked. "Simple? How so?"

"Your story was ridiculous, and they both believed it instantly. I'm genuinely concerned they suffered some kind of brain damage while they were away."

Li Xueyi stared at him, then rolled her eyes. "You're the simple one. Jiang'er and Lian'er are both perfectly smart — and no, Lian'er couldn't possibly have inherited your brains since she popped out of a rock."

Qin Hao's face twitched. Wait — she believed her own story now? He was the only one who didn't?

Li Xueyi was exasperated. It had been obvious to everyone that they were all playing along — a mutual, unspoken understanding. And then this idiot had to go and call their children stupid.

If he weren't so endearingly dense, she'd smack him.

Meanwhile, the moment Qin Jiang and Lian'er stepped outside, Lian'er transformed into a koala, latching onto him and peppering his face with kisses.

She could finally kiss him properly. She was going to get her fill first.

Within moments, Qin Jiang's face was covered in her lip prints.

"Wow, you taste amazing!" she exclaimed, eyes squinted in delight as she beamed at him.

Qin Jiang held her with one arm and pinched her cheek with the other. "Let's go home first."

"Okay~"

Lian'er giggled, then leaned in close to his ear and whispered: "Brother... what are we going to do when we get home?"

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. He looked down. She wore an expression of pure, wide-eyed innocence — but the corner of her lip was curled in a telltale smirk.

This little minx was trying to tease him.

He tightened his hold, scooped her firmly against him, and gently bit her cheek. "What do you think? Just don't try to run when the time comes."

"Hmph, I'd never run!"

Lian'er's heart sang. Her brother had kissed her again!

And when they got home, they were going to...

She could barely contain her excitement.

The dream was finally coming true!
