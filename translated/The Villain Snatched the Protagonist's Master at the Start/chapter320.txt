Ye Ling'er's technique had improved remarkably with her rising cultivation — smoother, more forceful, more refined. Though water was inherently gentle, the sheer impact from Qin Jiang's perspective was nearly overwhelming.

About four hours later, Ye Ling'er lay against his chest, cheeks rosy, eyes glistening.

"How was it? I haven't been slacking, have I?"

She blinked playfully, fiddling with her loosened twin tails.

Qin Jiang was deeply satisfied. He nodded, replaying the earlier display — the surging waves — and let out an appreciative sigh. Truly exquisite.

"Ling'er's amazing."

He leaned down, nuzzling her cheek. "But with your strength, how many more rounds can you manage?"

"Mm~" She thought about it, face red. "I've got plenty left. Do you want to go again?"

"Obviously."

His grin widened. He licked his lips, flipped her over in one smooth motion — and found himself eye-to-eye with her from a startlingly intimate angle.

Ye Ling'er turned aside with a gasp, burying her face in her hands. Her other eye went wide. She'd nearly triggered an involuntary discharge.

She suppressed it — barely — though a faint mist had already gathered. Some things couldn't be controlled.

Qin Jiang absorbed the stray moisture and teased, "Your control needs work, Ling'er. Can't even hold back at will?"

"You... jerk~"

She swatted at him from behind her hands. This was a passive skill — one that activated hardest when facing Qin Jiang specifically. With him, the trigger sensitivity multiplied by a factor of ten.

He was the key. The activation switch for her technique. Whether it turned on or not was entirely in his hands. Occasionally she could trigger it herself, but it was never as satisfying as when he did it.

And right now, a few teasing words had been enough to set her off.

Face burning, she turned to face him. The technique's aftereffect left her depleted, leaning softly against his chest. She pulled a handkerchief from her spatial ring and gently cleaned his face.

"Can you keep going?"

"I... y-yes~"

Though her hands trembled, though her cheeks were crimson — Ye Ling'er wanted more of Qin Jiang's attention. Besides, she genuinely did have reserves left.

And so — five days passed.

Ye Ling'er was finally, truly spent. She lay draped over him, eyes half-closed, too exhausted to move a muscle. She'd hit her absolute limit. Her cultivation still fell far short of Qin Jiang's. And he hadn't even been going all-out — just steady pressure. At full power, she wouldn't have lasted a day.

He gazed down at her, eyes soft. He tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, bent to kiss her forehead, and patted her back gently.

"Rest. I won't leave."

"Mm~"

Only then did she let herself drift off, arms locked around his waist.

Hours later, she stirred — and without opening her eyes, nuzzled against him, murmuring contentedly. Adorable.

Qin Jiang smiled and stroked her hair. "Awake?"

"So tired~"

Her voice was cotton-soft. She bonked her head lightly against his chest and pouted. "It's all your fault, you big bully~"

Who tests someone's absolute limit like that? Five solid days — she felt wrung out. Bone-dry. Recovery would take ages.

So unfair.

"But Ling'er seemed to enjoy it. And she did say she wanted to find my limit..."

She buried her face against him, flushing harder. She had enjoyed it. But it was exhausting. And his limit? Nowhere in sight. The gap was enormous, and he'd been holding back the entire time. One serious technique from his arsenal was enough to trigger her involuntarily.

"If Ling'er didn't like it, then next time—"

"I never said I didn't like it!"

She cut him off immediately. How could she not like it? She'd trade anything for more time alone with him.

She clung to him as if afraid he'd vanish. "I'm just... a little tired~"

"I wasn't finished."

"..."

He winked. "I was going to say — if you didn't like it, you should practice more. A few more sessions and you'll love it."

"Wha— you're terrible!"

She puffed up, realizing he'd led her into a misunderstanding on purpose.

"So does Ling'er want a few more sessions?"

She hesitated, red-faced — then nodded shyly. "...Yes~"

"Right now?"

"Huh?"

Her expression turned conflicted. She was exhausted... but if Qin Jiang wanted to...

She was about to nod when he spoke first. "Just kidding. Rest first. And... can you even perform the technique right now?"

"Of course I can!"

Tired or not, she wouldn't accept that challenge lying down. "I've been resting for hours. Two or three more rounds is no problem."

"That fast?"

"Hmph. Obviously~"

She straightened with a touch of pride. Qin Jiang tilted her chin up, mouth curving.

"Then... one more?"

"..."

Her body stiffened. Feeling the heat of his gaze, she bit her lip and nodded.

"One more. Just one, okay?"

"Deal."

He kept his word — one round. Two hours later, he nodded approvingly. "You really can still perform. Impressive."

Ye Ling'er shot him a withering glare. She didn't want to talk to him. Beast. One round for him meant three for her. This was torture.

Whatever trace of recovery she'd managed was gone now. At this rate, she'd never reach full strength again.

Qin Jiang's stamina was simply monstrous. And worse — she couldn't help wanting to trigger her technique in his presence, even when she had nothing left.
