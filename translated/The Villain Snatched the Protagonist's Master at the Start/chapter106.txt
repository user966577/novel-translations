"I'll help you step onto the immortal path!"

Qin Jiang smiled faintly.

Jian Yao was the ideal candidate. Her strength was the closest to the immortal path of anyone he knew. After refining an Immortal Path Law, she could break through to true immortality in the shortest time possible. Better yet, because of the Seven Beauties Painting, he could carry Jian Yao with him at all times—an immortal-level bodyguard more readily available than even the ancestral elders.

There was just one concern.

"Will the Seven Beauties Painting limit your cultivation?" he asked.

The painting's current ceiling was Nine Tribulations Supreme. Forcibly accommodating Jian Yao had already damaged it. He wasn't sure her strength could still improve.

"The painting can't restrict my growth," Jian Yao said, "even though I'm bound inside it. It's just..." She looked up at him. "Can you really help me break through to the immortal path?"

Qin Jiang was an enigma. Even after spending all this time at his side, she still couldn't see through him. So when he claimed he could help her reach immortality, part of her actually believed it.

Seeing the hope in her eyes, Qin Jiang leaned in and kissed her softly on the lips. "One month from now, I'll help you break through. But right now, time's short and we've got important business. Let's take care of that first."

Jian Yao could only stay outside for two hours at a time. Qin Jiang waved his arm and slammed the Fortune-Sealing Stele back into the ground, then swept Jian Yao into his arms and carried her into the Void Divine Temple.

The women inside started to come greet them, but one look at Qin Jiang's expression sent them shrieking and scattering in all directions. He chased after them with a devious grin, having the time of his life.

Meanwhile, the ancient clans had begun mobilizing.

The six clans closest to the Qin family were tasked with luring out the Qin Great Emperors, while the remaining clans secretly funneled resources and elite fighters to support them. These six clans dispatched their disciples to the Qin Domain, preparing to provoke a confrontation.

Just as the ancient clans finished their preparations and were about to give the order—

A sword aura erupted from the Qin family compound, piercing the heavens. Imperial might radiated across the entire continent, undisguised and overwhelming.

The ancient clan powerhouses stared toward the Qin estate in stunned silence.

"An Emperor-level cultivator... and that aura—it's a new Emperor! The Qin family has produced another Great Emperor!"

"Abort the operation! Now! Terminate immediately and redraw the plans!"

"What the hell is wrong with the Qin family? Do they just hand out Emperor breakthroughs like candy?"

"Enough talking—we need to rethink this. Every additional Great Emperor could be the difference between life and death for us!"

The clans' offensive ground to an immediate halt.

At the same time, the Qin family's own powerhouses stared toward Qin Jiang's residence in astonishment. This Emperor aura didn't belong to any of the ancestral elders.

"That's a Sword Heart cultivator—the wife Xiao Jiang brought back from the Holy Sword Sect?"

"She broke through to Great Emperor!"

"A Great Emperor with Sword Heart... none of us could match her."

The ancestors exchanged glances of genuine awe.

Inside the Void Divine Temple, the enormous shockwave made Qin Jiang flinch mid-stride. Fortunately, everything still worked. He threw on his clothes and rushed to Liu Shuwan's seclusion chamber. The massive hall trembled as though caught in an earthquake, and the other women had already fled to a safe distance. Razor-sharp sword light filled the air.

"Of all the times to break through," Qin Jiang muttered, the corner of his mouth twitching. Liu Shuwan had nearly destroyed her own future marital bliss.

Piercing energy shot skyward. The Void Divine Temple could have concealed the celestial phenomenon, but Qin Jiang saw no point. The Qin family's strength didn't need to be hidden anymore. Once every ancestor completed their breakthrough, they'd be able to steamroll the entire continent.

The celestial phenomenon lasted a full day.

When the chamber doors finally opened, Liu Shuwan emerged. The moment she saw Qin Jiang, a radiant smile lit up her beautiful face—she'd sensed his presence even during her breakthrough.

"Qin Jiang." She jogged over and threw herself into his arms. Great Emperor or not, her personality hadn't changed one bit.

The other women crowded around, chattering their congratulations. Liu Shuwan glanced around and noticed that during her two months of seclusion, two new sisters had joined the fold. Qin Jiang moved fast—terrifyingly fast. If she ever went into seclusion for eight or ten years, she didn't dare imagine whether there'd still be room for her at his side. He might even have children with the others by then.

The thought sent a flicker of worry through her eyes. At her level, secluding for a decade was hardly unusual. Before meeting Qin Jiang, her longest seclusion had lasted several centuries. Since joining him, she hadn't needed to cultivate in isolation at all—these two months were the sole exception. And in those few short months, her cultivation had advanced more than it had in thousands of years.

She looked at Qin Jiang, and her sense of urgency crystallized into a quiet resolve: she would never go into seclusion lightly again. Even if it meant not cultivating, she'd stay by his side. After all, she was a Great Emperor now. Surely that earned her the right to stand beside him. And as for the other women? They were all far weaker than her.

Feeling slightly better, Liu Shuwan exchanged greetings with her sisters and introduced herself to Huo Ying'er and Chu Hanyan, whom she was meeting for the first time. The atmosphere was warm and harmonious. Qin Jiang was pleased—though he had no idea what was going on in their heads. Compared to men, women's thoughts ran far deeper and more intricate.

After Liu Shuwan's emergence, Qin Jiang spent several days with her—though the other women were never far from the picture.

Time flew.

A month had passed since the Immortal Path Seed was placed in the Immortal Marrow.

Qin Jiang stepped out of the Void Divine Temple and approached the Fortune-Sealing Stele. Lifting it aside, the Immortal Marrow appeared before him. Unlike before, a shimmering law now coiled around it, flowing like liquid light.

"So this is an Immortal Path Law?"

His eyes gleamed with curiosity. With a beckoning gesture, the law detached from the Immortal Marrow and settled into his palm. He examined it closely—far more profound than a Great Emperor Law. A single moment of carelessness could trap one's consciousness within it.

He tore his gaze away and produced the Seven Beauties Painting. A flash of light, and Jian Yao materialized before him.

"Yao Yao, take a look at this." He tossed the Immortal Path Law to her.

She caught it reflexively. The instant it made contact, her eyes widened in disbelief. The power within her body stirred to life, and the bottleneck that had imprisoned her for millennia began to loosen. For the first time, she could see the road ahead.

The immortal path.

"This is an Immortal Path Law?" She looked up, her eyes brimming with elation.

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile. "With this, stepping onto the immortal path shouldn't be a problem, right?"

"No problem—absolutely no problem!"

Joy blazed across Jian Yao's face. She launched herself at him, pinning him down and planting kisses all over his face.

"Qin Jiang, I love you to death!"
