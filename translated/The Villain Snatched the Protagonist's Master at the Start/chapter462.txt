Outside the former Alliance base, Nangong Yun crouched in the shadows, fists clenched, watching. His brothers were long gone. Their base now swarmed with Zhou family operatives — every one of them his enemy.

He waited for an opening. Days passed without one. He forced himself to be patient. A hunter needed patience.

Then the Zhou family gathered in formation. Something big was happening. If they were mobilizing, he might find a crack to exploit. His expectations had tempered since the last fight — the Zhou family's Great Emperors weren't as weak as he'd assumed. He still couldn't figure out how he'd escaped them in the first place. Could they have been holding back? Impossible. The Zhou family and the Nangong family were blood enemies, and after the Alliance massacre, there was no reason for mercy. He chalked it up to luck.

While they assembled, new figures materialized overhead — figures whose mere presence made his heart seize.

Ancient Emperors. The Zhou family had sent Ancient Emperors. For him?

He suppressed his aura to nothing and prayed. Against this many Ancient Emperors, he had zero chance. He could only hope they wouldn't notice him.

Every eye turned his way. His blood ran cold. A moment's hesitation, then he dropped all pretense and bolted.

One of the newcomers raised a finger — just that, a casual flick. Nangong Yun froze mid-flight, his body locked in place. He thrashed with everything he had. Nothing.

The man appeared before him, regarding him with open contempt. A Human Immortal, forced to deal with a mere Great Emperor. If Huaxia hadn't demanded it, he'd never stoop so low.

Nangong Yun's stomach dropped. Not an Ancient Emperor — a Human Immortal. Against the immortal path, he had zero chance of escape.

The Human Immortal stripped him of every possession — spatial treasures, weapons, everything. Then he probed Nangong Yun's body with his Primordial Spirit, checking for anything fused internally. Top to bottom, he left nothing.

"A mere Great Emperor is beneath me." The binding released. Nangong Yun blinked — then immediately tried to run. The binding snapped back on.

Nangong Yun's fists clenched, his composure cracking. This was deliberate humiliation.

The Human Immortal waved a hand. Nangong Yun's clothes disintegrated.

He went rigid. "What are you doing?!" Losing his treasures was one thing — he could reclaim those. But his dignity... He shuddered. If a man took that from him, he'd rather die.

Fortunately, the Human Immortal had no interest in his body. A casual palm strike sent him flying. The instructions had been clear: take everything on Nangong Yun's person. Everything meant everything — clothes included. Black Dragon had said not to miss even a stone.

The Human Immortal gathered every last item and sought out Black Dragon. Despite outranking him in cultivation, he showed deference — Black Dragon spoke for Qin Jiang. Even a True Immortal bowed to that authority.

"These are all of Nangong Yun's possessions. Would you like to inspect them?"

Black Dragon rifled through the pile and quickly found a warm stone. "This should be it." He examined it against the description his young master had provided. A match.

The Mystic Yang Divine Stone. An Immortal King-grade treasure, irresistible to any fire-attribute cultivator. He stored it carefully and tossed the rest back. "Dispose of these however you like."

"And regarding the credit?"

"This treasure still needs the Manor Lord's confirmation. If it checks out, it's a major contribution. When the Zhou family joins Huaxia, this will serve you well."

"Thank you, my lord. Please put in a good word for us."

The Human Immortal's eyes gleamed. Huaxia was demanding, but generous to its own. Cultivators who'd joined had undergone transformations in mere years, with many seeing massive increases in power. With this contribution, he might even have a shot at True Immortal.
