Inside the grand hall, Qin Jiang sat with his eyes half-closed, a trace of satisfaction on his face. His consciousness had sunk into the system space, where the Seven Beauties Painting drifted, and within it, Yan Shiya's figure blazed with intense light.

Thanks to the Time-Space Disc's acceleration, Yan Shiya had experienced over a decade within the painting, enough time to fully refine the Immortal Path Law. Now she was making her push toward the Immortal path itself.

With a thought, Qin Jiang channeled the Myriad Realms Tower energy sealed within his body into the painting. The Immortal King Seal floated alongside it, radiating a soft glow. Under the Time-Space Disc's influence, days passed inside the painting while only moments elapsed for Qin Jiang.

Yan Shiya's aura climbed to its peak.

Then—

The Seven Beauties Painting shuddered violently, as if crying out in protest. Since Qin Jiang had obtained it, he'd never upgraded the artifact, yet two of its residents had now broken through to the Immortal path. The painting was on the verge of collapse.

With a sudden surge, Yan Shiya's aura locked into place. She had officially entered the Immortal path.

The painting's trembling gradually subsided. After waiting a short while longer, Qin Jiang turned his palm upward, and the Seven Beauties Painting materialized in his hand. It pulsed once, and Yan Shiya appeared before him.

After over a decade of secluded cultivation, the sight of Qin Jiang sent her hurtling straight into his arms.

"Qin Jiang, I missed you so much!" she cried, throwing herself at him and clinging on tightly, her head nuzzling into his shoulder.

Holding the painting in one hand and Yan Shiya in the other, Qin Jiang smiled wryly. The artifact had effectively lost its binding power over both Yan Shiya and Jian Yao—the two of them could come and go as they pleased. At this point, its only remaining use was as a recovery chamber, significantly boosting their stamina and endurance.

He wrapped an arm around her waist, supporting her weight. "So Shiya's reached the Immortal path too."

"Hehe, all because of you," she said with a sweet, coquettish smile.

Back on the Heavenly Mystery Continent—now the Qin Domain—she'd been a minor Supreme. The Great Emperor realm had seemed like a distant dream. She'd never imagined she'd one day reach the level of an Immortal, and every bit of it was thanks to Qin Jiang.

Though the Seven Beauties Painting no longer bound her, her feelings for him had only grown stronger. Looking at his face, she wrapped her arms around his neck and planted a kiss on his cheek. After avenging her family, her personality had opened up considerably.

"From now on, I can protect you too," she murmured, pressing her head against his shoulder. "That makes me really happy."

She'd always envied Jian Yao. Both lived within the Seven Beauties Painting, but Jian Yao's strength made her a genuine asset to Qin Jiang. Whenever the two talked, it was always Jian Yao describing how she'd protected him, while Yan Shiya could only sit inside the painting—a pretty ornament and nothing more.

But now she was an Immortal too.

Qin Jiang tilted his head and kissed her cheek softly. Yan Shiya turned to meet him—

"Mm..."

She clung to his neck, pouring out all the affection she'd stored up during her seclusion.

After a long while, they parted. Yan Shiya's face was rosy, her lips dewy, her breath coming in warm little puffs. Captivating beyond measure.

"Shiya, I need protecting right now," Qin Jiang said with a grin, his gaze drifting to her glistening lips. His arms tightened around her, eyes sparkling with mischief. "You should probably come protect me, don't you think?"

Yan Shiya blinked, reading the playful smirk on his face, and understood immediately. Her eyes trailed downward briefly. "And where exactly do you need protection?"

"Heh, in the most vulnerable spot, obviously," he said with a chuckle. "I need somewhere safe and warm."

"You're terrible!" Yan Shiya's face went scarlet. She gave his shoulder a light smack, then whispered, "I happen to have just the place. Want to come in?"

With Yan Shiya's breakthrough, Qin Jiang now had three Immortals at his side. Beyond them, Jian Yao was stationed at the Celestial Rabbit Tribe and could reach him quickly if needed. And Liu Shuwan had already received a suitable Immortal Path Law—it wouldn't be long before she broke through as well. Five Immortal-path cultivators. In all of Azure Cloud Heaven, that might not make them untouchable, but it was certainly enough to command respect from anyone.

Several hours later, Qin Jiang and Yan Shiya emerged from the hall. Her face was flushed and there was a hint of fatigue in her expression as she clung to his arm.

Formidable as ever.

Even after breaking through to the Immortal path, she still wasn't his match. Terrifying. She tilted her head up, studying his profile, genuine puzzlement in her beautiful eyes. What kind of constitution did this man have? His recovery seemed to outpace his expenditure—and his expenditure was enormous, given how many women he had to attend to. Yet he was still brimming with energy every single day.

"What are you looking at?" Qin Jiang asked, glancing down with a smile.

Yan Shiya looked away and shook her head. "Nothing. Is this the Snake Race?"

She'd been in seclusion this whole time and had only just learned that Qin Jiang had come to the Demon Domain and gotten into a conflict with one of its major factions.

He nodded. "This is the Purple-Scale Serpent territory. See—their Empress is heading over now."

Yu Lan's figure appeared in the distance, accompanied by Mo Mo, Xue Mei, and Yu Ru.

"Big Sis Mo Mo," Yan Shiya greeted. She only recognized Mo Mo—Qin Jiang had met Xue Mei long after Yan Shiya entered seclusion. When she noticed Xue Mei, surprise flickered in her eyes. Another Immortal?

Xue Mei and the others were equally taken aback. Qin Jiang hadn't mentioned Yan Shiya to them; none of them had known he had yet another Immortal up his sleeve.

"Little Shiya broke through!" Mo Mo said, looking up at the taller woman. Petite as she was, she had to crane her neck, but she maintained her worldly-elder air nonetheless. In fairness, she really was the oldest among them by far.

Yan Shiya smiled and nodded. She'd always been fond of Mo Mo. When it came time to annihilate the Yan family, it was Mo Mo who'd done the deed.

"Not bad. With you here, we're all the safer," Mo Mo declared, rising on her tiptoes to pat Yan Shiya's shoulder. The image of a tiny loli trying to act like a seasoned mentor was almost too much.

Qin Jiang couldn't help but grin. He reached out and pinched her chubby little cheek—soft and adorable.

"Hey! What are you doing?" Mo Mo swatted his hand away and gave him a petulant glare. Couldn't he see she was encouraging the junior? His pinch had just demolished whatever dignity she'd been trying to project.

She puffed out her cheeks, hands on her hips, and fixed him with a glower—which, of course, only made her look even more adorable. Despite being the oldest and strongest person present, her appearance gave her zero intimidation factor. Compared to Mo Mo, every other woman here looked like her older sister.

In reality, Mo Mo was the big sister. The very old big sister.

A loli big sister.
