The women watched wistfully as Ning Xue'er led Qin Jiang away. Lin Lin and the others whispered among themselves:

"No wonder the Palace Master wasn't interested in that Chen Changsheng. Turns out she was hiding a hottie of her own."

"Look at her attitude—she's clearly planning to keep him as a palace pet."

"Does that mean we get a turn when she's not looking?"

"Careful, or the Palace Master will slap you~"

Though they'd barely walked away, Qin Jiang overheard the chatter. He glanced back, caught the women's eyes, and gave them an encouraging nod.

'Help yourselves. I can handle it!'

Turning back, he addressed Jian Yao and the others. "When did you all get here?"

"Mo Mo, Shiya, and I came right when you started. Linglong and the rest were brought over later."

"???"

Qin Jiang fell silent. Right when he started?

"So you were outside listening the whole time?"

"Hmph, yes. You were quite enthusiastic." Jian Yao gave a light snort.

Qin Jiang's face darkened. He looked at Ning Xue'er and the palace leadership. "And all of you were eavesdropping together?"

"We were just... a teeny bit curious," Ning Xue'er offered lamely.

Unlike Jian Yao's group, they were all virgins—albeit older ones. They genuinely had no experience with such things and found it rather difficult to speak candidly in front of Qin Jiang.

Seeing them all nod, Qin Jiang was thoroughly dejected. His embarrassing secret was out, and silencing this many mouths wouldn't be easy.

"Ahem... where's Qing Chan?" Ning Xue'er coughed, changing the subject.

Qin Jiang eyed her, gaze narrowing. "I hear from Qing Chan that kidnapping me was your idea?"

"..."

Qing Chan had sold her out that fast?

It wasn't really her idea, though. She'd only told Qing Chan where Qin Jiang was. The actual kidnapping was entirely Qing Chan's initiative.

She shook her head firmly. "That wasn't me! It was all Qing Chan's own doing. I just told her where you were."

"Oh?" Qin Jiang nodded. "So you're the mastermind."

"..."

Ning Xue'er's face darkened. She glared at him. "Mastermind? That's so harsh! I'm the Palace Master—can't you show a little respect?"

"I'm the palace ancestor's husband!" Qin Jiang didn't back down an inch. "And your ancestor calls me darling, as I'm sure you all heard?"

"..."

Every woman's face twitched. He was really doubling down.

"So in the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, I outrank everyone. You all answer to me!"

Qin Jiang was positively radiant. 'Your ancestor has been conquered. Who are you juniors to bare your teeth at me?'

Ning Xue'er curled her lip and muttered under her breath: "Petty little man."

"Hm?"

This Ning Xue'er had quite the feisty spirit.

Meeting his stare, she showed no fear. Their gazes locked. Ning Xue'er lifted her chin, eyes glinting with challenge.

"Our esteemed elder—what exactly are you going to do about us?"

A challenge? Qin Jiang licked his lips. If she was calling him "elder," what should he call her?

"Little Xue'er, I do know how to tattle, you know. I'll have Qing Chan grab you and spank your bottom!"

Ning Xue'er stiffened, her cheeks flushing pink. She retreated half a step. "What kind of man tattles to a woman?"

Qin Jiang's move was like a kid running home to tell mommy that someone was being mean. Not an ounce of masculine pride.

"Well, there's one standing right in front of you."

"Shameless!" Ning Xue'er rolled her eyes, spun on her heel, and led the palace women away.

Qin Jiang smiled at their retreating figures and called after them: "Next time we meet, show some respect—or watch your backsides!"

"Outrageous!" came the collective indignant cry.

Jian Yao tugged at him. "Let's dial it back. This is their turf."

"Says who? From now on, this is our turf!" Qin Jiang struck a triumphant pose. "Their ancestor has been conquered. The Azure Lotus Divine Palace is mine!"

"You sure about the 'conquered' part?" Jian Yao arched a brow. That woman's temper seemed a lot like her own. The group had merely been eavesdropping, and she'd blasted them all away. A little volatile.

Qin Jiang coughed, mildly guilty. "Well... at certain moments, she does listen to me."

"She was pretty obedient before she kicked us out, sure. But you took forever to come out—what happened after?"

What happened? Qing Chan had gotten uppity, so he'd taught her another lesson.

Qin Jiang shook his head, not elaborating. "Where did you all go earlier?"

"Oh—we ran into Chen Changsheng." Jian Yao grinned. "That guy actually went to the Matchmaking Temple to court Ning Xue'er."

"Oh?" Qin Jiang perked up. "And then?"

"Got kicked out, obviously. But Ning Xue'er played him good—he's probably being hunted down as we speak."

She recounted the whole episode. Hu Xian'er, standing nearby, held up the Ancient Emperor Pill.

"Look—this was his gift. Ning Xue'er secretly kept the real one. Once I take it, I can break through to Ancient Emperor! Hehe, then I can protect you too!"

"Good." Qin Jiang smiled, tweaking her nose and rubbing her fox ears. She purred contentedly, eyes squeezed shut.

Meanwhile, he checked the system. He'd muted notifications—having it ding constantly ruined the mood. Sure enough, rewards for altering the plot had accumulated.

'At this point, the Children of Destiny can't even advance their storylines without me lifting a finger.'

His growing power and influence meant others changed the plot for him now. Lian'er keeping Zi Fu close had triggered one change; Qing Chan targeting him due to his reputation had triggered another. Derailing destiny had become effortless—even fun. Against weaker Children of Destiny, he wouldn't even need to show his face to toy them to death.

And that meant his influence was only growing.
