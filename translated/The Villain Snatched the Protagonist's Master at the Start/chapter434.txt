Several days passed. Nangong Yun's spirits had recovered somewhat — the dead couldn't come back, and he needed to look forward. Starting with avenging his two fallen brothers. The problem was, he still had no idea who'd killed them, and the alliance lacked the resources to investigate. So his thoughts turned to Qin Jiang. His senior sister had already sacrificed herself for this man's cooperation; it was only fair to take advantage of it.

He visited Weiwei's quarters every day, hoping to speak with Qin Jiang. But the courtyard gate remained firmly shut. Standing outside, fists clenched, he didn't need to see or hear to know what was happening in there. His senior sister's life must have been miserable.

The thought pained him, but there was nothing he could do except silently pray that Qin Jiang would be gentler. His senior sister was a delicate flower — she couldn't withstand that kind of abuse.

He wasn't the only daily visitor. Xue Yue came too, though she hid in the shadows and waited for Nangong Yun to leave first. Watching his retreating figure, a flicker of guilt crossed her eyes. She'd followed Qin Jiang's instructions these past few days, distancing herself from Nangong Yun entirely. But privately, she still wondered — could she somehow save him too? It was a long shot. If there truly was no chance, the Blood Tribe had to come first.

She stood before the gate and waited. It swung open, and an invisible force pulled her inside. She didn't panic — this wasn't her first time.

The first thing she saw was Qin Jiang. Her face instantly reddened. "Hey — put some clothes on!"

He rolled his eyes, threw on a shirt, and pulled her into his arms without preamble, smirking. "It's not like it's the first time you've seen it. Why still so shy?"

Her arms instinctively went around him in return — the product of days of practice. She'd grown accustomed to his hold. Addicted to it, even. If she went a day without being held, she felt restless all evening. She inhaled deeply, savoring his scent, which she was beginning to crave. She tilted her head up to study his face — still absurdly handsome. If not for the last shreds of her rationality, she'd have kissed him on the spot. She swallowed discreetly and looked away.

"What are we practicing today?"

Over the past few days, they'd practiced every possible hugging position. Hand-holding too, naturally. The progress wasn't fast — but Qin Jiang relished watching Xue Yue's expression, that blend of reluctance, anticipation, and helpless surrender. That was precisely why he'd slowed the pace.

"Today..." He smiled and tilted her chin up. "We practice kissing."

"What?" She jolted, face burning, and shook her head frantically. "No! We're just pretending — we can't—"

Before she could finish, he caught her chin and kissed her. Her eyes flew wide. The arms around him tightened, as though she wanted to melt into him entirely.

When he finally lifted his head, her gaze was hazy, her breathing quick. Tears welled in her eyes. Her first kiss — gone.

"You—"

"It's for your own good. We may be pretending, but it has to look real. Your million clansmen are on the line. One little slip-up could put them all in danger."

She sniffled, wiped her eyes, and turned her face away — though her heart still hammered. The memory of his lips on hers replayed endlessly, and she found herself looking forward to more practice. Not that she'd let him know.

He held her waist with one hand, turned her face back with the other, wiped her tears, and said gently, "If it's too much, we can take it slow."

"Take it slow?"

"Mm. We could start with cheek kisses."

Her mouth twitched. 'You already kissed me on the lips and now you want to go slow?' But since he was offering to be gentler, she couldn't exactly push for more. She nodded with feigned reluctance.

He immediately leaned down and kissed her cheek. Electricity jolted through her. He pointed to his own cheek with a grin. "Your turn."

"I — I have to kiss you too?"

"Of course. That's how real couples work. Weiwei and I are like that all the time."

"Oh... fine."

Nervously, she wrapped her arms around his neck, rose on her toes, and pressed her lips to his cheek. "Like that?"

"A bit stiff. Let's practice more. Kiss me again."

"Okay."

They held each other, trading kisses back and forth until her technique grew steadily more natural. About an hour later, Qin Jiang kissed her earlobe and whispered, "Yueyue, time for a real kiss."

"Mm." She nodded, wrapped her arms around his neck, tilted her face up, and closed her eyes in anticipation.

He cupped her face and pressed his lips to hers — soft at first, then deeper. When they finally parted, he flicked her nose. "Very good."

"Do we need to keep practicing?" she asked in a small voice, cheeks burning.

"You haven't fully mastered the technique yet."

"Okay. Let's practice some more."

"Good girl."
