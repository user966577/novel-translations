The curtain fell on the grand performance.

The colossal airship hovered above the imperial city, its shadow stretching over the palace like a dark cloud. The Dragon Emperor's cheek twitched at the sight. Wasn't this a bit much?

But one glance at the ancestral Emperors stilled his tongue. He couldn't win this fight.

Once inside the city, Qin Jiang had no interest in making small talk with a bunch of old men. He went straight to the Third Princess's mansion.

Liu Shuwan stayed at his side throughout. In someone else's territory, caution was the better part of valor.

Fourth Ancestor and the others returned to the airship, where the Fourth Patron was promptly surrounded by his three brothers.

"Fourth Brother, what happened to you?" the First Patron demanded.

The Fourth Patron's face soured. He spread his hands in resignation. "Poisoned. From now on, I go where that young lord tells me to go and do what he tells me to do."

"Poisoned?"

The First Patron frowned, placed a hand on the Fourth Patron's shoulder, and probed for a long while. "I don't detect anything abnormal."

"Obviously!" The Fourth Patron rolled his eyes. "If you could detect it, I'd have purged it myself already. This poison can kill a Great Emperor!"

The other Patrons' expressions shifted. A poison lethal to Great Emperors? They'd never heard of such a thing.

Nearby, the Dragon Emperor had overheard. He rubbed his temples. Qin Jiang hadn't shown any hostility—yet—but having a tiger in his backyard was profoundly unsettling.

"Do you know his background?" the Dragon Emperor asked the Fourth Patron.

"No idea. But with that many Emperor bodyguards, he's clearly someone important—probably the heir of a major Nine Heavens clan. From what little I've observed, he's just here to sightsee. That show at the gate was purely because he was bored and wanted entertainment. As long as you don't offend him, he won't cause trouble for the Empire. And with Third Princess at his side, he'll probably exercise some restraint."

"From the Nine Heavens, hm?"

The Dragon Emperor massaged his forehead. A legitimate aristocrat would mind his reputation—but Qin Jiang? One look and you could tell he wasn't the responsible type. Impulsive, powerful, and answerable to no one. The worst kind of guest.

As for his own daughter serving as a buffer—the Dragon Emperor didn't believe for a second that a Nine Heavens scion would let a woman change his mind.

"Forget it. Just keep him comfortable," the Dragon Emperor sighed.

As the ruler of an entire continent, his every decision affected billions. Against someone from a higher echelon, he couldn't afford to act on impulse. He had too many concerns.

He turned to the Fourth Patron. "Will you return to his side, or stay at the palace?"

"Either works."

The Fourth Patron shrugged.

"He allows you that much freedom?"

"He can kill me whenever he wants. What's the point of restricting my movement?"

The Dragon Emperor's mouth twitched. At least the Fourth Patron was handling captivity with admirable composure.

The Third Princess's mansion was modest by royal standards—not lavish, but respectable enough. A standard princess residence for an unremarkable princess.

Back in familiar surroundings, Long Xin'er visibly relaxed.

The airship parked directly above her mansion for easy access.

The following day, Qin Jiang headed out with Liu Shuwan and Qin Lian'er to explore the imperial city.

Qin Lian'er pouted. "Brother, if you two want a date, why drag me along?"

Living in Qin Jiang's shadow meant she never went hungry—the dog food was endless.

He'd brought her as a radar, naturally. Wandering alone, he might never cross paths with a Child of Destiny. With Qin Lian'er at his side, the odds improved dramatically.

"You were bored, weren't you? Fresh air will do you good."

And so the trio drifted through the imperial city without direction. Novel trinkets constantly caught Qin Lian'er's eye, and Qin Jiang never hesitated to open his wallet—buying whatever she wanted, trying whatever looked interesting.

Until they came upon a corner where a girl in mourning white knelt beside a corpse. The body bore the unmistakable marks of a beating death. The girl's eyes were red and swollen, tears streaming down rain-streaked cheeks.

Beside her stood a grand estate. Two burly men emerged from its gates and marched toward her.

"Get lost! Who told you to come here crying? Bad luck!"

"Damn old fool—bumped into the madam and got what he deserved. Cost us our monthly pay, too. Grab the body and get out!"

They cursed coarsely. Fresh from a wage dock, their tempers ran hot, and the girl's wailing threatened to draw attention from inside—which would mean more punishment.

Cowed by their aggression, the girl shrank into herself, but she didn't move. She remained kneeling before her father's body, a stubborn light burning in her tearful eyes.
