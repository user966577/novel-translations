The palace.

The First Patron hauled Long Yu back and dumped him unceremoniously before the Dragon Emperor. Demonic qi roiled across Long Yu's body. The Dragon Emperor stared at him, brow furrowed deeply. It had only been a short time—how had the corruption progressed this far?

Something didn't add up. Could the darkness festering in Long Yu's heart be even more potent than he'd assumed?

He walked over and placed a hand on Long Yu's shoulder, probing carefully before withdrawing. His expression darkened. He turned to the First Patron with a sigh. "First Patron, this matter... what do you think we should do?"

"The decision is yours, Your Majesty," the First Patron replied evenly.

He knew Long Yu's corruption had gone too deep—there was no pulling him back. And at the frontier, nearly a million people had died because of him. The public demanded an answer. But that answer involved the Dragon Emperor's own son—his once-favorite son, no less. The First Patron had no intention of getting tangled in that mess.

The Dragon Emperor was clearly torn. He had distanced himself from Long Yu, yes, but that had been a matter of political necessity—not personal cruelty. Long Yu could've lived comfortably as a prince for the rest of his days. But now, given the magnitude of his crimes, any reckoning would cost Long Yu his life.

Could he really kill his own son?

The Dragon Emperor agonized in silence, then rubbed his temples and looked at the First Patron again. "Give me your recommendation. Whatever it is, I won't hold it against you."

The First Patron let out a bitter chuckle, hesitated briefly, then spoke. "Your Majesty, on my way back, I heard quite a lot about the Ninth Prince..."

"Oh?"

"The public wants him dead. Nearly a million citizens slaughtered at the frontier—the worst-hit city was wiped out entirely. Beyond that, the frontier Commander and his generals have submitted a joint memorial. It'll be on your desk shortly."

The First Patron's tone was measured, almost clinical.

The Dragon Emperor frowned. "The common people know already?"

The affair hadn't been kept secret, exactly, but it involved the imperial family. Those in the know should've been discreet, and even if word leaked, it shouldn't have spread this fast. Unless someone was deliberately fanning the flames.

"Nearly every region on the continent has heard. And in the version being told, the Ninth Prince is being painted as something close to a demon incarnate..."

The Dragon Emperor's face hardened. He glanced at Long Yu, and a flicker of realization crossed his eyes. "Qin Jiang?"

The First Patron said nothing, neither confirming nor denying. But the only person besides the Dragon Emperor himself with the reach to orchestrate something like this was exactly the person they were both thinking of.

The Dragon Emperor exhaled a long, turbid breath. 'So he still hasn't let Long Yu go.'

He took a steadying breath and waved his hand. "Take him away. Lock him in the imperial prison. And announce to the realm—five days from now, I will personally oversee Long Yu's execution."

Inside the Void Divine Temple.

Jian Yao unsealed the Demon Hall Founder. A vast, terrifying aura surged outward for an instant before the Founder swiftly reined it in.

Jian Yao kept a wary eye on her. The moment the Founder made any hostile move, she'd cut her down without hesitation.

But instead of hostility, the Founder curled her lip at Jian Yao. "What are you staring at, you old hag?"

"What did you just call me?"

"Old hag. Got a problem with that?"

"Say it one more time. I dare you. See if I don't seal you right back up!"

Jian Yao's gorgeous eyes blazed.

The Founder smirked provocatively, then latched onto Qin Jiang's arm in a single fluid motion. "Qin Jiang, look at how she's treating me~"

Jian Yao: "..."

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. The Demon Hall Founder was apparently a world-class manipulator.

Jian Yao glared daggers at the Founder's pitiful-maiden act, fury simmering with nowhere to go.

The Founder shot her a triumphant look. 'Besides having a better figure than me, what advantages do you even have?'

"Qin Jiang, let me protect you from now on. I'll do a much better job than her!" The Founder's voice was soft and helpless—the very picture of a delicate flower. Manipulative energy practically radiated off her.

Qin Jiang pinched her chubby little cheek. "Dial it back."

Then he pulled Jian Yao into his arms, soothing her immediately. Between the two, he naturally trusted Jian Yao more.

The Founder pouted but remained unconvinced.

Still, she was self-aware enough to know that Qin Jiang wouldn't fully trust her anytime soon. She glanced at Jian Yao, then announced, "I'm going to go cultivate."

"Wait."

Qin Jiang stopped her. With a wave of his arm, he extracted a strand of energy from what the Myriad Realms Tower had devoured and floated it toward the Founder. "Try this."

The Founder carefully absorbed a sliver of it, pulling it into her body. Her eyes lit up instantly. She devoured the rest without hesitation and looked up at Qin Jiang. "Is there more of this?"

"How does it feel?"

"If I had enough of this energy, I could return to my peak in a month at most!" She cast a competitive glance at Jian Yao. "Stronger than her."

Jian Yao opened her mouth to retort, but Qin Jiang pulled her close and murmured a few calming words. She settled for a cold huff and pointedly ignored the Founder.

"And without this energy—how long?"

"Three years at least. And you'd need to provide the right environment—like, say, massacring a city..."

Being a demonic cultivator, her methods were predictably brutal.

Qin Jiang didn't particularly care. As long as the targets weren't his people, he wouldn't lose sleep over a single city—or an entire continent, for that matter. But three years was far too long. He was heading to the Nine Heavens in days. Ideally, the Founder would be at full strength before they left. Whether she'd betray him was a secondary concern—he still had cards to play. If she turned on him, the worst-case scenario was wasting some energy.

After a moment's deliberation, Qin Jiang withdrew nearly half the energy sealed within his body. "Will this be enough?"

The dense energy spilled outward. The Founder inhaled deeply, eyes sparkling, and nodded eagerly. "More than enough!"

She swept the energy up with a wave of her hand, sealed it, and absorbed it all in an instant. Then she looked at Qin Jiang. "I'm going into seclusion now."

"Go ahead. If you need more, come find me."

"Okay~"

The Founder flashed him a smile, then vanished.

Jian Yao immediately claimed Qin Jiang's arm, staring after the Founder with a worried frown. "You trust her that much?"

"I don't trust her. I trust you." Qin Jiang smiled and pulled Jian Yao close. "I trust that you can protect me."

"Smooth talker." Jian Yao rolled her eyes, though a note of genuine concern crept in. "I'm not sure I could actually beat her, to be honest."

One-on-one, she didn't fear the Founder. But if she had to protect Qin Jiang simultaneously, caution was warranted.

Qin Jiang chuckled softly. "Relax. I've got it under control."
