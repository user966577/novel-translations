"Unseal her?" Qing Chan looked at Ning Xue'er nestled in Qin Jiang's arms, gazing back with wide, innocent eyes.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Go ahead. Xue'er's been very well-behaved."

Qing Chan was skeptical, but judging by their posture, they'd clearly gotten to know each other quite thoroughly. She nodded and waved her hand. A thread of energy drifted out of Ning Xue'er's body and dissolved into the air. "Done."

Feeling her spiritual power rush back, Ning Xue'er beamed. She grabbed Qin Jiang's head, pulled him down, kissed him, and cooed: "Qin Jiang, you're the best~"

Qing Chan: "???"

'I'm the one who unsealed her! And that voice—since when does she talk like that? She never used to be this saccharine.'

"Ning Xue'er, drop the act. Doesn't it hurt, squeezing your voice like that?" Qing Chan glared.

Ning Xue'er's eyes shimmered as she clung tighter to Qin Jiang's neck. "But I've always talked like this~ Why is Qing Chan being so mean~?"

"..."

Qing Chan's expression darkened. 'Normal conversation is "mean" now?'

"Ning Xue'er, do you want me to seal you again?"

Ning Xue'er shrank into Qin Jiang's arms, looking pitifully wounded. "Qin Jiang~ Qing Chan wants to seal me again~ I'm scared~"

Qin Jiang: "..."

Qing Chan: "..."

"No wonder you love tea so much," Qing Chan said through gritted teeth. "You've got the skills to match."

Ning Xue'er's voice stayed marshmallow-soft. "I've always admired Qing Chan, actually~ Being so bold, drinking all that wine, reeking of alcohol all the time. Such a shame my tolerance isn't as good. Oh—Qin Jiang, do you like women who drink?"

"Ning Xue'er, what exactly are you implying?"

Ning Xue'er flinched theatrically. "Qing Chan is so scary~ Qin Jiang, is she like this with you too~?"

"..."

Every sentence circled back to Qin Jiang, leaving Qing Chan with no angle of attack. Even if she sealed Ning Xue'er again, the girl would just weep prettily in Qin Jiang's arms, begging for comfort—and come out ahead. Qing Chan felt stifled. She turned to Qin Jiang, who hadn't said a single useful word.

"Qin Jiang~" Qing Chan called out.

He coughed, gently set Ning Xue'er down, and scratched his head. "I think I have something to attend to."

Tactical retreat.

But before he could escape, Ning Xue'er seized one arm—if he left, she'd be defenseless. Qing Chan latched onto the other. Both women looked up at him expectantly, and Qin Jiang felt a headache forming. One little manipulator. One tough girl.

In truth, he didn't much care for manipulative types—but if the sweet-talking was aimed exclusively at him, that changed the calculus considerably. When Ning Xue'er turned that honeyed voice on him, batting her lashes and pouting, his bones went soft. And she was proactive. That was a plus.

Then again, Qing Chan's type had its own powerful appeal. Strong, fiercely protective—who wouldn't want a wife who could shield you from the world? Lying safe in arms powerful enough to crush mountains, surrounded by warmth and softness. Sublime.

Most importantly, both women were stunningly beautiful. And Qin Jiang was, at his core, a man of aesthetics. For beautiful women, he had boundless tolerance. Minor flaws? Overlooked. As long as she was his.

"Qin Jiang~"

"Qin Jiang~"

They hung off his arms, each trying to outdo the other. He took a deep breath, freed his arms, and pulled them both close by the waist. In situations like this, the cardinal rule was simple: never speak. Words only made things worse. Action was the only answer.

As the saying went—don't listen to what a man says. Watch what he does.

And so, amid gasps and sighs, Qing Chan and Ning Xue'er experienced firsthand what Qin Jiang's "actions" entailed.

The next day.

Qin Jiang pinched Ning Xue'er's cheek. "Still going to play the sweet-and-innocent card?"

"I don't know what you mean~" She pouted, tracing circles on his chest with one finger.

"..."

He caught her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. "Keep it up."

"Hee hee—mwah~" She planted a kiss on his cheek.

He licked his lips, then turned to Qing Chan, drawing her close by the waist. "Still jealous?"

"It's her fault—" Qing Chan muttered. If Ning Xue'er hadn't provoked her, she wouldn't have been jealous.

Fair point. And the solution wasn't complicated. He leaned down and kissed Qing Chan—hard, deep, and possessive. Almost suffocating. When he finally pulled back: "Better?"

"Mm~" Her eyes went hazy, her head settling against his chest.

Ning Xue'er blinked, then looked up at him. "I want one too~"

He hesitated, then leaned down and gave her a gentle kiss.

"Hey, that's not the same." She wasn't having it. She grabbed his head and kissed him the way he'd kissed Qing Chan—fierce and demanding. 'If you won't give, I'll take.'

When she finally released him, she smacked her lips, eyes bright with approval—as if to say: 'Well done.'

Qin Jiang rubbed his temples. Qing Chan acted tough but turned passive at the crucial moment. Ning Xue'er seemed soft as silk, but when it mattered, she was the aggressive one. Talk about contradictions.

Qing Chan watched Ning Xue'er's performance, her brow creasing. Unbalanced again. She shoved Ning Xue'er aside and dove in with a kiss of her own, then shot her a triumphant look. Ning Xue'er refused to lose—she pushed in for another round. Then Qing Chan again. Back and forth, Qin Jiang became a battlefield.

By the time he escaped the room, his lips were swollen from the onslaught.

Waiting outside—Jian Yao, Mo Mo, Yan Shiya... He scanned the group. All his women, watching him. He hadn't attended to them in days.

With a sigh, he walked over. "Come to my room. I've set up a time-space mark in there—we can adjust the flow of time and save ourselves some trouble."

He headed back inside. Jian Yao and the others exchanged glances, eyes bright, and followed.

'What a decadent life.' Qin Jiang had tried resisting the decadence. Multiple times. But reason never triumphed. So he'd given in.

This was living.
