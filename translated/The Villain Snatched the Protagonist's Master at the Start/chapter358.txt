Chen Lie rushed over the moment he received word, his expression grim.

But when he saw who was on stage with his daughter, the tension drained from his face and he exhaled a long breath of relief, wiping the sweat from his brow.

He'd been told that his daughter had come home — and immediately set up a tournament for a new husband. He'd feared the worst: that she and Qin Jiang had had a falling-out.

Now he could see the truth.

This was just a young couple fooling around. What the kids these days called adding spice to the relationship.

A smile spread across Chen Lie's face as he watched. His daughter was doing just fine — clearly very much in her son-in-law's good graces. A man of Qin Jiang's stature wouldn't indulge in a silly game like this otherwise.

Good for her.

And good for the Chen family. Their position was more secure than ever.

On stage, Qin Jiang and Chen Ningbing noticed Chen Lie's arrival. They exchanged a glance.

Qin Jiang smirked, swept his arm around her waist, and pulled her close. Then he dipped his head and pressed a firm, lingering kiss to her lips.

When he finally let her up — nearly breathless — he asked: "Miss Chen. Surrender?"

"N— mmph..."

She tried to protest, but he kissed her again.

A long while later: "Still won't admit defeat?"

"You—"

Chen Ningbing's face was flushed and her eyes slightly unfocused. Her body was growing soft in his arms. The scoundrel knew perfectly well what his proximity did to her — and he was doing this in public.

She bit her lip, looking at him with a mix of reproach and something altogether hungrier.

Qin Jiang grinned and started to lean in again.

"Stop—" Chen Ningbing pressed her face against his chest, her voice small. "Stop kissing me~"

She was about to lose control right here and now.

"Then do you surrender?"

"Fine. I surrender."

"Then it's straight to the bridal chamber!"

He scooped her up and vaulted off the stage, announcing to the crowd with theatrical grandeur: "Azure City Town's number-one beauty is mine from this day forth!"

The audience was somewhere between speechless and enlightened. They'd put it together — this was the lord of Qin Domain himself.

The couple was simply having fun.

A few quick-witted souls offered enthusiastic congratulations, playing along beautifully. Qin Jiang, thoroughly entertained, rewarded them with casual gifts of cultivation resources.

Once the crowd dispersed, only Chen Lie and a handful of Chen family members remained.

"Heh, Young Master Qin — the Chen family has everything prepared. Shall we head back?" Chen Lie sidled up, all smiles.

He'd sent word ahead the moment he'd spotted Qin Jiang, ordering the estate readied.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "Is the bridal chamber ready?"

"???"

Chen Lie's smile froze. They were actually going through with the bridal chamber?

Chen Ningbing shot Qin Jiang a look and wriggled free of his arms. She turned to her father. "Don't fuss, Father. We're just here for a visit. Nothing extravagant."

Chen Lie glanced at Qin Jiang, deferring to his son-in-law. As the father-in-law, he should have the authority here — but with Qin Jiang's status, the dynamic was reversed.

Qin Jiang smiled easily. "Whatever Bing'er says."

"Then let's just head to the estate."

"Alright."

He took Chen Ningbing's hand and set off. Chen Lie hurried after them, signaling discreetly to his people. Someone peeled off to cancel the welcome preparations.

Qin Jiang had said no fanfare. Under normal circumstances, Chen Lie would have prepared something anyway — "no fuss" never actually meant no fuss when dealing with someone important.

But these weren't normal circumstances. His son-in-law was clearly in a hurry to reach the bridal chamber. Delay him now, and Chen Lie would be the one lacking situational awareness.

"The room your daughter grew up in is still exactly as she left it," Chen Lie offered helpfully. "Servants keep it spotless."

The room might not be set up as a bridal chamber specifically, but it had everything needed for one. Namely: privacy and a bed.

Qin Jiang nodded approvingly. Now this was a father-in-law who understood priorities.

"Perfect. Bing'er's been feeling nostalgic. We'll start there."

The subtext couldn't have been clearer. Chen Ningbing's cheeks pinked, but her fingers traced a light pattern against his palm. She wasn't objecting.

On stage, when he'd kissed her, she'd already been wanting to—

Might as well. No reason to hold back.

At the Chen family estate, the senior members had lined up to greet them. Chen Lie waved them off. Don't hold up my son-in-law's important business!

Once the welcoming party was dismissed, Chen Lie made himself scarce with a convenient excuse. The estate hadn't changed much over the years — no risk of getting lost.

Hand in hand, they found their way to Chen Ningbing's old courtyard.

This was where it had all started.

Chen Ningbing looked at Qin Jiang, warmth in her eyes. She leaned close and murmured: "Qin Jiang — do you like me, or did you just want to sleep with me?"

"I like my Bing'er, of course."

He smiled and drew her in, answering the question — and answering the one she'd asked him all those years ago.

Hearing this, her smile deepened. She stood on tiptoe to kiss his cheek, then whispered in his ear:

"Then... shall we have our bridal chamber?"

They stepped into the courtyard. It was immaculate, exactly as she'd left it. Her father had maintained it well.

Chen Ningbing took in every detail, a gentle nostalgia in her expression.

She pulled Qin Jiang into her room and smiled. "Today — bath first."

"Together?"

"Mm~"

She nodded. Her first time with him had happened during a bath together.

She wanted to relive the memory.

Before long, everything was prepared. Chen Ningbing fixed him with blazing eyes.

On the stage, she'd lost.

Now she was issuing a rematch — even knowing she was hopelessly outclassed.

But she was undaunted.

She licked her lips, then with a splash, slipped into the water.

"Qin Jiang — come fight me!"

This time, she'd chosen water as her battlefield. Perhaps the home advantage would count for something.
