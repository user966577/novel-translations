On the way back to the Celestial Rabbit Tribe, Liu Shuwan was still in a daze. She'd only tagged along for what she thought was a casual outing, and she'd come away with an Immortal Path Law—a Sword Dao Law, no less, the perfect fit for her.

With this, she could break through to the immortal path in short order. She'd finally stand alongside Jian Yao and Mo Mo, truly useful to Qin Jiang instead of just a pretty face. The anxious cloud that had hung over her for so long scattered completely, replaced by a radiant smile.

"Qin Jiang, let me go into seclusion when we get back."

She was eager to break through as soon as possible.

Qin Jiang held her waist and shook his head with a smile. "No rush. Absorb the law first—don't try to refine it yet. Wait until we're back in Qin Family City."

Even with an Immortal Path Law, reaching the immortal path could take years or decades. But Qin Jiang had the Time-Space Disc. Once it was fully restored and installed in the Void Divine Temple, cultivation time inside would compress dramatically. A few months at most, and Liu Shuwan would break through.

As for now, Qin Jiang glanced at his system space. The Time-Space Disc sat alongside the Seven Beauties Painting, with the Immortal King Seal feeding them both energy. Inside the painting, Yan Shiya was deep in seclusion. She'd broken through to Great Emperor during his last visit to Qin Family City, indulged in a few days with him, then taken her Immortal Path Law and gone right back in.

With the Time-Space Disc's acceleration, years had already passed for Yan Shiya inside the painting. By Qin Jiang's estimate, she'd emerge within half a month—a new Immortal.

That would give him four Immortal-path powerhouses. Even facing the Snake Race, one of the Demon Domain's three great powers, he had nothing to fear. Besides, they wouldn't necessarily be enemies.

Liu Shuwan trusted Qin Jiang implicitly. Though she wanted to rush into seclusion, she nodded obediently and agreed to wait.

At a small city on the Demon Domain's border—a mixed settlement where humans and yao coexisted—a teahouse was buzzing with gossip.

"Hey, did you hear? Something's going on with the Snake Race. They've been stirring up trouble all over the Demon Domain lately. A lot of clans are unhappy."

"I heard the same thing, but I don't know the details."

"Heh. The Snake Race... I might know a thing or two..."

Every eye in the teahouse turned toward the speaker. He took a leisurely sip of tea and grinned. "No harm in telling you. You all know the Snake Race has a strict bloodline hierarchy. Right now, aside from their ancient powerhouses in long-term seclusion, there are only three royal bloodlines. One of them is the current clan chief. Recently, this clan chief announced she'd be entering seclusion to attempt the immortal path, so the position is changing hands."

"The Snake Race is getting a new clan chief?"

"That's right. The two remaining royal bloodline holders are the natural frontrunners. But one of them seems to have... run into a problem."

"What kind of problem?"

"Not entirely sure. But my guess? She was sabotaged. So the succession shouldn't produce much drama. Give it some time and things will settle down."

"I see. Any idea which royal got targeted?"

"Oh, that part's common knowledge. It's the empress—the one they call the most beautiful woman in the Demon Domain. Such a shame, a beauty like that..."

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the teahouse. Everyone in the Demon Domain's vicinity had heard of the empress's legendary beauty. Sighs filled the room.

No one noticed the young man who slipped quietly out the door.

He lifted his head, revealing a familiar face. Chen Changsheng.

His expression was grim. "The Snake Race Empress... is it Yu Lan?"

Yu Lan had been a friend from his eighth life, someone he'd met while training in the Demon Domain. She hadn't been empress then, but Chen Changsheng knew she carried a royal bloodline—given time, she'd rise to the Snake Race's upper echelons. So he'd cultivated the friendship deliberately, helped her on several occasions, and built a genuine rapport.

After the debacle at the Heavenly Pill Palace, he'd laid low for a while. During that quiet period, the memory of this old acquaintance had resurfaced. Her face had grown hazy in his mind over the years, but he was certain she was no less stunning than the Female Emperor—and her exotic, seductive allure might even surpass it.

He wanted to show the Female Emperor that he had no shortage of exceptional women at his side.

He just hadn't expected to arrive and find her already in trouble.

Chen Changsheng took a deep breath, left the city at speed, and reached the Demon Domain's edge in moments. "Yu Lan, wait for me! I'll get you out of this."
