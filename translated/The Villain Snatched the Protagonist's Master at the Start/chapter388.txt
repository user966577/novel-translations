Mo Mo's killing never stopped. All of Grey Cloud Heaven reeked of blood.

Faction after faction crumbled into nothing, and some had brought it on themselves — "righteous" cultivators who spotted the rising demonic qi and tried to swoop in on the fallen factions' assets. They picked the wrong scavengers to rob. Those assets belonged to Mo Mo's kills, which meant they belonged to Qin Jiang. Trying to poach from Qin Jiang was a death wish.

Mo Mo's list grew longer.

Half a month of unrelenting carnage.

When the last True Immortal faction collapsed, the whole of Grey Cloud Heaven fell silent. By now, every surviving power knew: Huaxia had arrived. And an Immortal King walked with them.

No one dared breathe a word of complaint. Everyone lived in terror that the killing would find them next.

"That hit the spot!" Mo Mo's face was radiant with satisfaction. Every last enemy who'd once hunted her — eliminated. Plus a generous bonus. Glorious.

The mass slaughter had even benefited her cultivation — more effective than any seclusion.

"After all that, Grey Cloud Heaven's probably terrified," Qin Jiang remarked.

Beyond revenge, this had served as a warning — not just for Grey Cloud Heaven, but for all Nine Heavens. Fear made people cooperative. When the time came to bring them into the fold, it would go much smoother.

He glanced toward the distance. The Li Family Ancestor had been shadowing them the entire time, occasionally dealing with scavengers. Qin Jiang beckoned, and the old man flew over immediately.

These two weeks had left him shaken to the bone. He'd watched one mighty faction after another crumble — every last one annihilated without survivors. Brutal beyond words. Thank the heavens he'd been smart enough to play along back at the Li compound. Otherwise, this would have been his fate.

"Heh heh, does the Manor Lord need something from me?" He wore a servile grin, bowing slightly, the picture of deference.

Qin Jiang smiled. The intimidation campaign had clearly worked. He didn't bother with preamble. "Old Li, interested in joining Huaxia?"

"Joining Huaxia? Manor Lord, could my Li family truly join Huaxia?"

The ancestor's face lit up with barely contained joy. Weeks ago, Qin Jiang had floated the idea as a joke, and the old man had been lukewarm about it. Now?

His eyes shone with naked longing. "Manor Lord, joining Huaxia would be the Li family's greatest honor! If you'll have us, I'll lead the entire clan in — through fire or flood, without hesitation!"

"It's not that dramatic." Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. The old man's ability to flip was genuinely impressive. "If the Li family joins, there's actually something I need you to do."

"Whatever Huaxia needs! My life is yours!"

Qin Jiang waved him off. "If I wanted your life, Qingqiu would never let me hear the end of it. Relax — it's not a bad thing. Quite the opposite."

The ancestor's composure cracked into a sheepish grin. His grand declarations were theater, naturally. He wasn't ready to die for Huaxia just yet. But he also knew Qin Jiang was unlikely to harm the Li family — the man clearly doted on Li Qingqiu. Love the girl, love her clan.

"Then what would the Manor Lord have me do?"

Qin Jiang drew himself up, one hand clasped behind his back, eyes sweeping the horizon with sovereign authority.

"I want you to be the Lord of Grey Cloud Heaven."

The Li Family Ancestor stiffened.

Lord of Grey Cloud Heaven? Him?

After the massacre, Qin Jiang could claim Grey Cloud Heaven with zero resistance. The surviving factions would trample each other to join Huaxia. And if Qin Jiang said the Li Family Ancestor was their lord, not a soul would object.

"Manor Lord, the Li family will never — not in a thousand generations — betray Huaxia. Should we falter, may the Great Dao itself strike us down!"

He spoke with absolute sincerity, sealing his words with an oath. He understood that this appointment demanded one thing above all: loyalty. Pledging loyalty to one man in exchange for lordship over an entire heaven? Bargain of a lifetime.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Good. Then within the next two weeks, have every power in Grey Cloud Heaven gather at the Li compound."

"Done!"

The ancestor agreed instantly. Qin Jiang's party returned to the Li estate. Meanwhile, the ancestor dispatched invitations — or rather, summons — to every surviving faction. A two-week deadline.

Everyone understood the invitation came not from the Li family, but from the man behind them: the Lord of Huaxia, Qin Jiang.

The stench of blood still hung in the air. No one dared ignore the summons. Grey Cloud Heaven was changing, and they had no say in what it would become.

One by one, the faction leaders arrived at the Li compound. The ancestor greeted them all with a cat-that-ate-the-canary grin as they bowed and scraped before him — including True Immortals. He was practically glowing. His smile didn't fade from dawn to dusk, and somehow, his face didn't cramp.

Two weeks passed in a blink. Every power in Grey Cloud Heaven had answered the call. The seven remaining True Immortals — aside from the Li Family Ancestor — were all present. A significant haul for Huaxia.

Assuming they could be brought to heel.

The ancestor surveyed the assembled cultivators with naked satisfaction. Soon, these would all be his subordinates. Exhilarating.

After they'd all gathered, Qin Jiang made them wait about an hour before appearing. The Li Family Ancestor had arranged a suitably impressive entrance.

The moment Qin Jiang appeared, every eye locked onto him. He smiled, waved casually, and spoke in a friendly tone:

"Everyone — good to see you."
