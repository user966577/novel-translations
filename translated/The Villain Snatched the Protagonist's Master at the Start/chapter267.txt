The confrontation between Chen Baizhe and Chen Qi'er had driven a wedge between them, and the system naturally showered Qin Jiang with a heap of rewards. But beyond the rewards, what surprised him most was the emergence of yet another Child of Destiny.

"Where did this one come from?" Qin Jiang muttered. Lian'er was in seclusion, so she shouldn't have bumped into any Children of Destiny. His only recent contact had been with Chen Qi'er—had the man brought one along?

【Detected a Child of Destiny connected to the Host. One spoiler available. Host may view the Child of Destiny's trajectory over the next 100 years. Altering the plotline may yield Villain Points or rewards.】

This time, the system's range had expanded significantly—a full century's worth of spoilers, purchased with a million Villain Points. He decided not to trigger the spoiler immediately; a hundred years of plot would take a while to process.

He looked at Chen Baizhe. "Let's head back?"

"Mm." She nodded, waving goodbye to Dao Kun, and the two returned to the traveling palace.

Dao Kun's mouth twitched. He suddenly felt a kinship with Chen Qi'er—ever since his disciple had gotten together with Qin Jiang, she seemed to belong to someone else entirely. No longer the sweet girl who'd pout and wheedle with her dear teacher. He sighed, but there was nothing to be done. The one consolation was that Qin Jiang genuinely seemed to adore her. During the confrontation, his every word and action had been calibrated to protect her feelings—far more considerate than Chen Qi'er had been.

Still, Dao Zhen's warning gnawed at him.

"The Fortune-Reading Art... isn't always accurate, right?" he murmured, hoping for the first time that his ancestor had been wrong.

Aboard the palace, the women were comforting Chen Baizhe while Qin Jiang lay with his head in her lap, eyes half-closed. She glanced down at him. With Qin Jiang here, and all these sisters around her, whether or not she had a brother didn't seem so important anymore. She'd never be alone again.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang's consciousness was deep inside the system interface.

"Chen Wuming? Another one surnamed Chen?"

He was getting a bit exasperated. Children of Destiny named Chen were practically an epidemic. Why couldn't there be one named Qin?

With a mental grumble, he began reviewing the spoilers. The opening scene was set in a ruined temple—two figures: Chen Qi'er and a young man.

'Just as I thought—Chen Qi'er brought this one.'

But the Child of Destiny wasn't Chen Qi'er himself. It was the young man. Chen Wuming—a beggar without a name, who'd met a "big brother" surnamed Chen and adopted the surname for himself. In the plotline, Chen Wuming would become Chen Qi'er's disciple, forming a master-disciple pair.

"Two Children of Destiny in a master-disciple bond. Interesting."

He skimmed through the century-long plot quickly. The villain these two were destined to oppose was none other than himself. They would grow stronger over time and eventually defeat him utterly. A shame, really—armed with foreknowledge, they had zero chance.

"Three months from now, this Chen Wuming will come to the Human Dao Sect to apprentice under Chen Qi'er."

He pondered. Should he simply intercept the disciple? He wasn't interested in teaching anyone himself, but he had plenty of subordinates—tens of thousands of lackeys waiting in the Chaos District. If one of his people took the boy on as a disciple, the Child of Destiny would essentially become his underling.

Recruit a Child of Destiny as a subordinate. Then goad that Child of Destiny into going after Chen Qi'er.

Worth a try.

A spark of mischief lit Qin Jiang's face. He opened his eyes to find two One-Eyed Rabbits hovering inches from his nose. He blinked.

"Awake?" Chen Baizhe's gentle voice came from above.

She'd gathered him into her arms, one hand idly rubbing his head. "You must've been exhausted. I didn't want to wake you, so I just carried you to my room."

"How long was I out?"

Qin Jiang didn't sit up. He simply rolled onto his side, wrapped both arms around her waist, and buried his face against her smooth stomach.

Her cheeks colored. "About eight hours. It's already dark."

"Then my timing is perfect."

Qin Jiang grinned. His lips grazed her bare midriff, and with a gentle press of his arm, she lay back, nestling into his embrace. Their eyes met.

He leaned in and brushed a kiss across her lips. "You did great today."

She rolled her eyes, a note of reproach in her voice. "Because of you, I don't even have a brother anymore."

"He didn't deserve to be your brother."

Qin Jiang kissed her firmly, then looked down at her with a commanding air. "From now on, you're not allowed to call him 'brother.'"

"You..." Her face reddened, hands pressing against his chest. "Who's this domineering?"

"I'm exactly this domineering. If you won't agree, then..."

He licked his lips. She shrank back slightly, her voice small. "Then... what do I call him?"

"His name."

"Alright..."

She nodded. Seeing her compliance, Qin Jiang finally cracked a smile. She peered up at him, a shy question forming. "So... are you jealous?"

"No!"

"You totally are!"

"I am not!"

"Then I'll go back to calling him 'brother'—"

"Absolutely not!"

"Still claiming you're not jealous?"

"Fine. I'm jealous."

A triumphant grin spread across her face. Her hands slid from his chest to loop around his neck. "Then I promise—I won't give you any reason to be jealous again."

She pulled him close and kissed him.

After meeting Chen Qi'er, her last lingering attachment had dissolved entirely. Now, Qin Jiang filled every corner of her heart.

Chen Qi'er stumbled away from the Human Dao Sect's inner sect in a daze. Images of Qin Jiang and Baizhe embracing, of Baizhe rushing to Qin Jiang's defense, replayed endlessly in his mind. His aura churned with killing intent.

"Qin Jiang!" His voice dripped venom. "Just you wait. Once I find your best friend, I'll drag him before you and make him kneel and beg for mercy. Then I'll kill him right in front of your eyes. Watching your closest friend die—you'll suffer. But your suffering will never match mine. You stole my sister!"

He took a shuddering breath, then snarled through clenched teeth. "Killing your friend won't be enough. After that, I'm taking my sister back. Every ounce of pain you've given me—I'll make you feel it tenfold!"
