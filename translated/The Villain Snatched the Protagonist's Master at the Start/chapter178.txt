Three days later.

Hu Xian'er studied the man before her with open curiosity, her pretty eyes gleaming.

'So handsome!'

Qin Jiang was studying her right back.

After spending a few days with the other women, he'd come to the Demon Domain. His first stop, naturally, was to see this guileless little fox for himself.

"You're Qin Jiang?" Hu Xian'er spoke up first.

Over the past few days, Jian Yao had mentioned him constantly. Hu Xian'er knew that Jian Yao's help had come at this man's request—and that, according to Jian Yao, Qin Jiang's motivation for helping the White Fox Tribe was that he wanted to sleep with her.

So before they'd even met, Hu Xian'er's mental image of Qin Jiang was "enormous pervert." But now that she was actually looking at him...

This particular pervert was rather easy on the eyes.

Her gaze was fixed on Qin Jiang, unblinking, drinking in every detail of his face with the intensity of someone who might never get another chance.

She'd freely admit it—she was a sucker for a pretty face. A fox of refined taste. A "face fox," if you will.

The heat in Hu Xian'er's eyes made Qin Jiang raise a brow. According to the plot, Hu Xian'er was supposed to be pure and simple. But in person, she was...

Not entirely innocent.

There was at least some color in those eyes.

Qin Jiang's lips curled. "Seen enough?"

Hu Xian'er's cheeks flushed, but her gaze didn't waver. She shook her head. "No. I want to keep looking."

Mo Mo materialized beside him, planting herself directly in Hu Xian'er's line of sight. "Little fox spirit! This is my man—stop staring!"

Mo Mo's entrance drew Hu Xian'er's attention, though since Mo Mo was considerably shorter, Hu Xian'er had to look down.

"Oh. I know about you. Jian Yao told me—she said you look pure and cute on the surface, but actually you're insatiable, always trying to cling to Qin Jiang—"

Mo Mo's eyes widened. Her teeth clenched.

Jian Yao was right there, and at the sound of Hu Xian'er's innocent recap, her lip curled with satisfaction. Mo Mo whipped her head around.

"You crazy woman! You dare slander me?!"

"Slander?" Jian Yao scoffed. "I stated facts."

She shot Mo Mo a haughty look, leveraging their height difference and her own... superior proportions to full effect.

Mo Mo stiffened. This was the one area where she grudgingly admitted Jian Yao had the edge. But she had her own advantages. She was cuter. And her petite figure...

Qin Jiang happened to adore it.

"Hmph. Big chest, big deal?" Mo Mo leapt onto Qin Jiang, clinging to him like a koala, and smirked at Jian Yao. "Qin Jiang prefers cute!"

"Bleh!" Jian Yao latched onto his other arm, glaring back. "Cute is worthless next to sexy!"

Qin Jiang drew a sharp breath. Reining in his imagination, he settled the dispute the usual way—a sweet word for each—and both women calmed down.

Once peace was restored, he turned to Hu Xian'er. "Can you show me the immortal herb?"

"Sure!"

She skipped to his side and looped her arm through his. "Follow me."

"Uh..."

Qin Jiang blinked. This little fox was certainly forward. Sensing his surprise, Hu Xian'er looked back, head tilted. "What's wrong?"

He glanced at her arm entwined with his.

She followed his gaze, then smiled sweetly. "You had Jian Yao help me, and I don't have much to repay you with. But she said you're very... lustful. So..."

She grew a touch bashful. "I think I'm at least somewhat attractive? If you like, I can offer myself—"

A grin spread across Qin Jiang's face.

This little fox was just like Xia Qianling—soft and gentle. But whereas Xia Qianling was demure yet sharp, this one was...

Completely clueless.

A genuine airhead.

Jian Yao and Mo Mo exchanged a look, brows furrowing in unison. Fox spirits really did live up to their reputation.

Meanwhile, Liu Shuwan trailed quietly behind. She wasn't bothered. She knew exactly where she stood in Qin Jiang's heart—a position that not even Jian Yao or Mo Mo could match. Among his growing harem, the hierarchy had naturally settled itself: Jian Yao and Mo Mo handled Qin Jiang's security, while Liu Shuwan kept the internal peace.

Looking at this sweet, clueless fox, Liu Shuwan's first thought was that once they brought her home, she'd need to tell the other women to go easy on the poor thing. Hu Xian'er was a Great Emperor, technically, but with that personality, anyone could push her around.

"Alright, let's see the herb first."

Hu Xian'er bounced along at his side, leading the group to the little garden. She pointed at the Three Dawn Miracle Bloom. "There it is—our immortal herb!"

She glanced at Qin Jiang. "Are you going to take it?"

"Would you let me?"

Her eyes wavered with visible inner conflict. Jian Yao had warned her this would happen.

"If you need it... then take it." Her voice was small, tinged with dejection. If Qin Jiang wanted to take it by force, she couldn't stop him anyway. Better to give it willingly.

"But..."

The gloom vanished in a flash. She looked up at him, eyes bright. "Can this count as my payment to keep you?"

"Hm?"

"I'll use the immortal herb to keep you!"

She grinned cheekily.

Qin Jiang: "..."

"You're very handsome. I really like you."

His expression turned peculiar. "So that's your reason for wanting to keep me."

"Yep! I want to see you every single day."

Her eyes hadn't left his face once, and the affection was genuine—though it was, quite purely, affection for the face.

He chuckled, shaking his head. "One immortal herb isn't enough to keep me."

"Oh." Hu Xian'er deflated, but Qin Jiang's tone shifted. "However, I could keep you."

"Keep me?" She blinked, then looked at Jian Yao and the others. "Like them?"

"No." Qin Jiang shook his head. "They all help me in significant ways, so it's not really 'keeping.' But you..."

"I can help too!" She puffed her cheeks in protest.

He smirked. "You certainly can."

Hu Xian'er's eyes narrowed. Something about the way he said that felt... loaded.

She couldn't quite put her finger on it, though. And as long as she could be useful to Qin Jiang, she was happy.
