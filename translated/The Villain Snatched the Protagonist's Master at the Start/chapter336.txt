Beyond the Demon Domain, hegemonic powers across every region of Azure Cloud Heaven were falling.

And the ones being destroyed were invariably the ones that had sat at the very top.

The entire realm held its breath. Everyone understood that from this day forward, Azure Cloud Heaven had a true overlord — and it would be the only one.

Meanwhile, back in Qin Family City, Fourth Ancestor and the others were hard at work, compiling intelligence dossiers on every significant faction in Azure Cloud Heaven.

Fourth Ancestor leafed through them, muttering as he went.

"This one's only got a single Ancient Emperor. Too weak. Pass."

"This one has a Human Immortal. Worth a look — see if they're good enough to catch Little Jiang's eye."

"A Great Emperor? Who collected this garbage? What use is a faction this pathetic?"

"Five Ancient Emperors... barely passable, I suppose."

Following Qin Jiang from the backwater Qin Domain all the way to Azure Cloud Heaven had inflated his standards to the heavens. The old Qin family hadn't even had a single Great Emperor, but now, mere Emperors didn't warrant a second glance. He sorted through the dossiers, culled the majority, and sent the survivors to Liu Shuwan for final approval.

Inside the Void Divine Temple, Liu Shuwan was equally busy, drafting the blueprint for their future faction. Per Qin Jiang's vision, it would eventually grow into a colossus — one that would unify the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

An ambitious goal, perhaps even outrageous. But she believed in him, and she was willing to work toward it together.

Which was precisely why the foundation had to be laid right from the start — reward and punishment systems, rank hierarchies, resource allocation. Anything touching on interests needed strict enforcement from day one, to prevent the kind of internal power struggles that would tear the organization apart down the line.

Moreover, this faction would grow by absorbing other powers, which inevitably meant factionalism — splinter groups with old loyalties pulling in different directions. That problem had to be solved.

And then there were a hundred other headaches. Fortunately, she wasn't working alone. The 360 Songstresses pitched in, and the other women who weren't in seclusion contributed their expertise, offering suggestions where they could. The good ideas, Liu Shuwan adopted.

Days passed. Qing Chan and the others returned to Qin Domain, their missions complete. Every targeted hegemon had been obliterated. A handful of small fry had slipped away, but Qing Chan had dispatched hunters after them and issued a kill order across all of Azure Cloud Heaven. Roots and all.

A few days after their return, Qin Jiang's group arrived home as well. Hu Yan of the Fox Race, Yu Lan and Yu Ru of the Snake Race, and one of Zi Fu's elders had all come along. And the entire White Fox Tribe had been packed up and relocated.

Hu Xian'er led a procession of little white foxes into the Void Divine Temple. A few of the youngest hadn't even achieved human form yet — still running around as fluffy white foxes.

The women took one look at them and their eyes lit up. Hands dove in immediately.

"Hey! Let go of my tribespeople!" Hu Xian'er huffed.

Bringing the White Fox Tribe here hadn't been about providing pets. They were meant to be raised properly and eventually... matched with Qin Jiang. The foxes that had achieved human form — all young girls — hid behind Hu Xian'er, peering out at the other women with wide, wary eyes. These women were terrifying — the ones who hadn't even transformed yet were getting their fur stroked right off.

When they saw Hu Xian'er's indignation, the other women reluctantly released the little foxes, who squeaked in protest and scurried into the arms of the older fox girls.

"Xian'er, did you bring your entire tribe?" they asked.

Hu Xian'er nodded, gesturing at her entourage. "All seventy-two members of the White Fox Tribe, right here."

It wasn't a large clan — not even a hundred. And more than half were still young girls who'd need time to... mature. The women eyed the group approvingly. Pretty faces, every one. Given time, they'd all grow into first-rate beauties. Future sisters, and useful allies.

Under the women's guidance, the White Fox Tribe settled into the Void Divine Temple. Hu Xian'er, looking extremely serious, laid down the house rules for her people. After a lengthy speech that amounted to basically nothing — play when you want, have fun when you want — she finished by thumping her chest and promising that if Qin Jiang ever bullied any of them, they should come straight to her.

She'd handle it!

Very much the big-sister-in-charge energy.

While that commotion unfolded, Qin Jiang took An Xihe, Xue Mei, and Xiao Jiu to find Liu Shuwan.

"Wan'er."

He smiled, pulling her straight into his arms. Her pretty face looked slightly haggard with fatigue, and his heart ached. "You've worked so hard." He dipped his head to press a gentle kiss to her brow, then brushed his palm across her forehead as if to smooth away the exhaustion.

Liu Shuwan laughed softly. "It's fine. The sisters all helped — it wasn't that bad." She glanced past him to greet An Xihe and the others, then got back to business:

"The blueprint is almost finished, and we've identified some factions worth recruiting. Want to take a look?"

She indicated the mountainous pile of documents beside her. Qin Jiang took one glance and shook his head.

"You decide. I trust you."

That much paperwork would give him a migraine. Besides, he had full confidence in his wife's abilities. Once the faction was up and running, he planned to be the hands-off boss, leaving the actual management to her.

Liu Shuwan nodded. "In that case, give our faction a name. Once it has a name, we can announce it to the world."

"A name..." Qin Jiang's expression turned thoughtful. After a moment, his eyes brightened. "We'll call it Huaxia."

"Huaxia?" Liu Shuwan and the others repeated the word, testing it.

"Strange name. But if you like it, Huaxia it is."

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded.

Huaxia — a legendary name. In this other world, it was destined to forge its own legend. After all, that name carried fortune in its very bones, a weight of destiny that no mere Child of Destiny could match.

'Though I'm a villain,' he mused. 'I hope I'm not tarnishing the name.'

He wavered for a moment, then steeled his resolve. Once he'd unified every realm under heaven, any sins along the way would be forgiven. Unification itself would be the greatest achievement of all.
