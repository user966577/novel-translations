The Heavenly Waters Great Emperor looked at Zhao Sheng with a warm smile, as though regarding a junior from his own family. But when his gaze fell on Liu Xing, his brow furrowed. He'd brought someone else.

Zhao Sheng stepped forward and cupped his hands respectfully. "Senior, does our arrival here mean we've passed your trial?"

"Of course." The Great Emperor nodded. "Reaching me counts as passing. However... there are two of you, and I have only one legacy."

His gaze shifted to Liu Xing. But before he could say anything, Liu Xing waved his hand. "I don't need the legacy. Give it to my brother."

The Heavenly Waters Great Emperor's mouth twitched. He hadn't planned to give Liu Xing the legacy anyway, but seeing such blatant indifference to his inheritance stung. Was his legacy not worth wanting?

Zhao Sheng, on the other hand, was touched. He nodded gratefully at Liu Xing, then turned back to the Great Emperor. "Senior, I also cultivate water-attribute techniques—a perfect fit for your legacy. I promise I won't bring shame to your inheritance."

"You... are quite good." The Great Emperor nodded approvingly. His expression softened as he looked at Zhao Sheng, then he shot Liu Xing a cold glance and snorted inwardly. Plenty of people would kill for his legacy!

Zhao Sheng's face lit up. "Then, your legacy...?"

"Heh, you passed the trial. The legacy is naturally yours."

But the moment those words left his mouth, a disdainful laugh echoed from nearby. "I wouldn't be so sure about that."

"Who's there?" The Great Emperor's expression changed.

He looked up to find dozens of True Immortals materializing at the legacy's location. How had they found this place? Maintaining the trial had consumed most of his remaining power. He hadn't had the energy to monitor everyone's movements, so Black Dragon's group had followed Zhao Sheng undetected. Only now, with Black Dragon revealing himself, did the Great Emperor notice.

His expression darkened. The maze was designed so that most paths were dead ends—without guidance, finding the center was virtually impossible. He'd rigged it from the start in Zhao Sheng's favor. Yet somehow, all these True Immortals had made it through. Something was wrong.

Under his watchful gaze, Black Dragon's group strolled over casually. Black Dragon spoke up. "We've passed the trial too, right?"

The Great Emperor surveyed the group—all True Immortals, with Zhao Sheng the sole Human Immortal. If they'd all "passed," the ensuing competition would be one-sided. Zhao Sheng wouldn't stand a chance. His eyes flickered. "Only the first to arrive counts as passing. The rest of you are too late."

If he'd had any real power left, he wouldn't have bothered explaining—he'd have simply given the legacy to Zhao Sheng. But facing this many True Immortals, he wasn't confident he could enforce that. He could only hope the lingering prestige of an Immortal Emperor would be enough to deter them.

Unfortunately, intimidation worked on most people—but not Black Dragon. His specialty was charging in headfirst. Moreover, the Immortal King Killing Formation was already deployed right under the Great Emperor's nose, and he hadn't even noticed. That told Black Dragon everything he needed to know about how little power the remnant had left.

"Didn't pass the trial, huh?" Black Dragon smiled.

His gaze dropped to the pool of heart's blood beneath the Great Emperor—brimming with concentrated energy and, more importantly, the Immortal Emperor's legacy. This couldn't be left for someone else. He might not be suited for it personally, but Huaxia had plenty of talented cultivators who'd benefit. It had to go back.

"Senior, you've been dead for who knows how many years. Resting in peace is what you should be doing. As for the legacy—why don't you let me handle it?"

The Heavenly Waters Great Emperor's expression transformed with fury. He surged to his feet, his aura rippling outward with genuine Immortal Emperor pressure. Black Dragon's eyes narrowed. An Immortal Emperor was still an Immortal Emperor, even one who'd been dead for ages. Best to be careful.

"You're courting death, boy!" The Great Emperor's voice shook with rage, and the entire maze trembled violently. But his remnant soul grew more translucent with the effort.

Zhao Sheng's face darkened. He couldn't believe someone would try to seize an Immortal Emperor's legacy by force—right in front of its owner, no less. The audacity was staggering.

"Be careful," Liu Xing whispered. He stepped in front of Zhao Sheng, shielding him from Black Dragon's group. Seeing this, Zhao Sheng felt a surge of gratitude. He thought of how he'd worried earlier that Liu Xing might compete for the legacy, and shame washed over him. He'd misjudged the man with petty suspicions. From this moment forward, Liu Xing was family. If he ever made it big, he'd never forget him.

The two of them hung back while Black Dragon's group faced down the Great Emperor. Without sufficient power, the Great Emperor didn't dare strike first. Black Dragon, meanwhile, quietly gathered his strength. He raised his arm, tapped lightly—and the Immortal King Killing Formation materialized, enveloping the Great Emperor. Instantly, the trembling maze went still.

"What is this?" the Great Emperor cried out in shock and fury.

Black Dragon offered no explanation. He unleashed everything he had, concentrating the formation's full force on the Great Emperor. A massive detonation followed, and raging energy swept through the entire maze. The cultivators trapped within had no time to react—everyone took damage. The maze itself began to crumble.

Black Dragon's group, standing closest, was also hit by the shockwave. But since the bulk of the power was focused on the Great Emperor, the residual blast was manageable for those who'd braced themselves.

Liu Xing and Zhao Sheng, nearest to the Great Emperor, were the first to be caught in the blast. Liu Xing shielded Zhao Sheng, absorbing most of the shockwave—but the impact still forced blood from his mouth, his face going pale. Zhao Sheng felt the strain but escaped injury thanks to Liu Xing's protection.

"Are you alright?" He steadied Liu Xing, concern written across his face.

Liu Xing shook his head, wiped the blood from his lips, and looked toward where the blood pool had been. "The legacy is over there. Go take it!"
