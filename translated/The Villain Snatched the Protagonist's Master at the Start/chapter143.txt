Long Yu was to be publicly executed. The news spread like wildfire.

Citizens across the continent cheered the Dragon Emperor's wisdom. Those in the Imperial City began preparing—rotten eggs, wilted vegetables, whatever garbage they could find—eagerly counting down to execution day.

In their minds, Long Yu was nothing but a grand demon who'd caused untold suffering. Pelting him with trash was letting him off easy.

Time passed quickly, and the day of Long Yu's execution arrived.

From early morning, the streets were packed. Countless civilians carried baskets of household refuse, itching for the spectacle. When the prisoner cart finally appeared, rattling down the main avenue with Long Yu locked inside—hair matted, face hollow, nothing like the proud prince he'd once been—the crowd erupted. Garbage rained down on him from every direction.

Long Yu stared straight ahead with vacant eyes, showing no reaction whatsoever.

Qin Jiang didn't need to leave the airship to watch. From its edge, he had a clear view of every corner of the Imperial City.

At his side were Liu Shuwan, Qin Lian'er, and Long Xin'er. The Demon Hall Founder was still in seclusion, and Jian Yao had stayed behind in the Void Divine Temple to keep watch over her. The other women had their own matters to attend to.

Qin Jiang turned to Long Xin'er. "I'll be leaving the Divine Dragon Empire in a few days. Are you coming with me, or staying?"

"I'm coming with you." Long Xin'er didn't hesitate for a second.

There had been a time when she might have weighed the pros and cons. But not anymore. Everything she'd gained in the Divine Dragon Empire had come from Qin Jiang. Following him was clearly the better path forward—and after spending this time together, genuine feelings had taken root. Her decision was already made.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded, unsurprised.

A commotion rose from below. They looked down and saw the prisoner cart carrying Long Yu creeping through the streets, surrounded by jeering crowds.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. With a flick of his wrist, he tossed out a compass—the very one he'd taken from Chu Yuan. An immortal-grade artifact capable of divining the future. Similar to his system in some ways, but far weaker. He didn't think much of it.

The compass floated over the moment it appeared, trembling eagerly as though desperate to please.

Qin Jiang tapped it and pointed at Long Yu. "Divine his future."

The compass wobbled twice, then began spinning. Light flickered across its surface, and moments later, a white beam shot forth, forming a luminous screen before Qin Jiang.

He watched. A figure appeared on the screen—Long Yu, inside his prison cell. Silence. Then a second figure entered the frame. The man wore no imperial robes, but Qin Jiang recognized him instantly: the Dragon Emperor.

The Dragon Emperor stood before Long Yu, observing him in silence. Then he raised his hand, and a single drop of crystalline emperor blood fell into Long Yu's mouth.

The demonic qi on Long Yu's body immediately went berserk, churning violently. Simultaneously, his bloodline fully awakened, surging and boiling. But paradoxically, as the bloodline activated, the demonic qi grew even denser.

The scene shifted—to the execution itself. The Dragon Emperor stood over Long Yu, blade in hand. One swing. Long Yu's head tumbled free, blood spraying across the platform.

The life force vanished completely.

But then another scene materialized. In this one, the airship was gone from above the Imperial City—this was clearly the future, after Qin Jiang had departed. The Dragon Emperor appeared in a wasteland—the mass graves where executed criminals were dumped. Long Yu's body had been thrown here after the execution, his imperial status posthumously revoked.

The Dragon Emperor scanned the area, then reached out. Long Yu's severed head flew into his palm. Without a moment's hesitation, he crushed it.

A golden light burst from the shattered skull, growing brighter and brighter until it coalesced into a translucent figure in Long Yu's likeness. A primordial spirit—and one completely free of demonic qi.

"Clever bastard," Qin Jiang muttered. "Long Aotian's actually got some tricks up his sleeve."

If he didn't intervene, the Dragon Emperor would genuinely manage to save Long Yu.

Qin Jiang's gaze shifted from the divination to the scene unfolding below in real time. Long Yu had arrived at the execution platform. The Dragon Emperor was already there, preparing to carry out the sentence personally.

What played out was identical to the divination. Amid the crowd's roaring approval, the Dragon Emperor raised the great blade and brought it down on Long Yu's neck. Blood sprayed. The head rolled free.

A beat of silence—then thunderous cries of "Long live the Emperor's wisdom!"

The Dragon Emperor delivered a brief, somber address, then formally announced the revocation of Long Yu's imperial status. He ordered the body disposed of at the mass graves.

Watching the Dragon Emperor's performance, Qin Jiang shook his head with a wry grin. "Say what you will—the man knows how to put on a show."

As the crowd dispersed and the guards collected Long Yu's remains, Qin Jiang stood. "Let's go pay our respects to Long Yu."

He dropped from the airship without bothering to conceal himself, landing beside Long Yu's corpse.

The Dragon Emperor had already left, but Qin Jiang could tell he was still watching from afar. Seeing Qin Jiang appear, the Emperor's heart clenched. 'Has he noticed something?'

The guards recognized Qin Jiang immediately and hurried over with respectful bows.

Qin Jiang waved them off. "Carry on."

They nodded and continued transporting Long Yu's body toward the mass graves. Qin Jiang followed along, which made the soldiers intensely nervous. Liu Shuwan and the others had also seen the divination and understood what he was planning.

They arrived at the mass graves. The soldiers tossed Long Yu's body down, then approached Qin Jiang—but he waved them away before they could speak. They practically fled.

Qin Jiang walked toward Long Yu's corpse. No life force remained. The prince's eyes were frozen wide open, utterly lifeless. Even a careful spiritual probe revealed nothing unusual.

"Impressive technique," Qin Jiang murmured.

He planted one foot on Long Yu's skull and pressed down hard. Bone shattered. Blood sprayed. In that instant, golden light blazed forth.

Long Yu's bewildered primordial spirit appeared before Qin Jiang, still wrapped in a thin membrane of blood—the very thing that had blocked all detection.
