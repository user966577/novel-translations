Watching his identification crumble to nothing, Qin Jiang didn't dare protest. He could only marvel silently at the woman's terrifying strength. The Immortal King Seal was tough enough that he couldn't damage it even at full power, yet she'd crushed it to powder with a casual squeeze.

If she squeezed him like that...

He glanced at her hand—small and delicate as carved jade. Actually, if she squeezed him, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. As long as she was gentle about it.

"You want me to squeeze you too?" she said flatly.

Qin Jiang snapped out of it, shaking his head vigorously. Thinking was one thing. Saying it out loud was another matter entirely.

"Best not to think it either."

His face stiffened. She could read his thoughts? Then she'd heard everything—including his resolution that this woman absolutely had to be his.

"Enough! Stop letting your mind wander."

Her brow creased with irritation. Qin Jiang bit his lip, but instead of stopping, he began conjuring even more vivid imagery in his head—detailed and anatomically specific.

A massive force slammed into him, launching him through the air. Before he could process what happened, he was yanked back to his original position, head spinning and eyes unfocused.

"Try thinking that again. I dare you."

Her voice was ice.

Qin Jiang wobbled on his feet, rubbing his temples with a wince. "You're the one invading my privacy," he muttered. "And somehow I'm in the wrong?"

The words had barely left his mouth before he went flying again, then got dragged right back.

The woman glared at him with a cold snort. "You impersonated my husband, and somehow you're the victim?"

Qin Jiang had nothing to say to that. Normally he was the one who steamrolled through arguments without regard for logic, but right now, being unreasonable wasn't an option. He wisely changed the subject. "That Immortal King Seal—your father gave it to me."

"Anything he gives you is hardly going to be something good." She scoffed. "Did you know that as long as you carried it, he could track your location at any time?"

"He can find me without it too," Qin Jiang said honestly.

The woman paused. Fair point. She herself hadn't exactly broken a sweat locating him, and her father was far beyond her. Conceding the point, she shifted topics as well. "Do you know why I came looking for you?"

"Because I impersonated your husband."

"That's only part of it."

Qin Jiang's eyebrow rose. He studied her face and ventured a guess. "Don't tell me you've fallen for me?"

Predictably, he went sailing through the air again. When he was yanked back this time, his blood was churning and his chest ached. He grimaced, rubbing the sore spot. "Girls shouldn't be this violent!"

She gave him three more rounds of the same treatment before he finally settled down.

By now, Qin Jiang had figured out the situation. She hadn't come just to punish him—if that were the case, she'd have killed him outright. The fact that he was still alive meant she needed something from him. That was why he dared push his luck. Otherwise, if she truly wanted him dead, he'd happily get on his knees and lick her—

His gaze drifted to her feet. The next instant, unsurprisingly, he went flying again.

When he was pulled back, a faint blush of indignation colored the woman's cheeks, and her chest rose and fell with agitated breathing. She was clearly furious.

Taking a deep breath, she fixed him with a stare. "I've looked into you. You're ranked first in the Myriad Realms Tower."

"That's right." A flicker of pride crossed his face. In the Heavenly Domain, the number one ranking seemed to carry real weight. It had worked on the Skyreach City lord, and now this woman was bringing it up too.

"Quite pleased with yourself, aren't you?" she said coolly.

"Not at all." He waved it off airily. "I just wandered in on a whim and ended up at the top without really trying."

"Is that so?" A glint of something—schadenfreude, perhaps—flashed in her beautiful eyes. "Then do you know what became of every previous holder of the number one rank?"

"They must all be incredibly powerful."

"They certainly were." She nodded, her tone oddly solemn. "Every one of them possessed unparalleled talent. Since the Myriad Realms Tower was created—I couldn't even say how long ago—there have been a total of eight people who claimed the top spot." She paused. "Now... they're all dead."

Qin Jiang's smile froze. "All dead?"

"Every single one." A beautiful smile spread across her face. "So—do you think you'll survive?"

Qin Jiang swallowed. After a moment, he asked, "The one who was number one before me—he's dead too? I think he went by 'World's Second.' I bumped him down to second place."

"He's not dead. He was never number one."

"What?"

"The dead ones have all been removed from the rankings. That 'World's Second'—why do you think he goes by that name?"

"..."

"Because he's always been second. Eight people have surpassed him over the ages, and those eight—the ones who held first place—are all dead."

"Everyone who passed him died? He didn't kill them, did he?"

"He doesn't have the strength for that." She shook her head, then fell silent for a moment. "But given their level of power, only two beings in all existence could have killed them."

"Who?"

"One is my father."

Qin Jiang winced. "The Grand Sovereign? Surely it wasn't him..."

"One can hope." Her smile held a mocking edge, as though in her mind, the Grand Sovereign was exactly the culprit.

"And the other?"

"The other isn't exactly a person, but his power rivals my father's. He's the enemy of the myriad realms—known as the Black Sovereign. Officially, all eight were killed by him."

Officially? If only two beings could have done it, and on the record it was the Black Sovereign, then in reality...

Qin Jiang shuddered and shoved the thought from his mind. For all he knew, even thinking it might alert the wrong person.

"Don't worry. While you're with me, he can't eavesdrop undetected." Her tone was calm, confident.

But this was the Grand Sovereign—the universally acknowledged strongest being in the myriad realms. And she was merely his daughter. Honestly, Qin Jiang didn't entirely trust her ability to shield him.

Against the Grand Sovereign, at least.
