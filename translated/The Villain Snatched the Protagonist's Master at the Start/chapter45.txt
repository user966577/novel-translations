Catching Qin Jiang's look, the Fourth Ancestor's brow furrowed. Were these women truly that strong?

Then again, this brat could never be judged by common sense.

A force he'd personally cultivated was bound to be extraordinary. With that in mind, the Fourth Ancestor raised his hand:

"That's enough bickering. I'll do it myself."

He turned to the 360 Songstresses:

"There's not enough room here. We'll fight up in the sky. I'll suppress my power to Nine Tribulations Supreme. Try not to embarrass that kid."

With those words, he rocketed skyward. But the 360 Songstresses didn't follow—instead, they turned to Qin Jiang, awaiting his command.

"Go on.

Don't hold back. He's a Great Emperor—he won't die."

"Yes, Master."

The women answered in unison and soared upward.

The ancestral elders flew up to watch. Qin Hao and Li Xueyi swept up Qin Jiang and Qin Lian'er and followed.

High above.

The 360 Songstresses faced the Fourth Ancestor across the open sky.

Between them, gossamer threads glinted in and out of existence, linking all three hundred sixty women.

The Fourth Ancestor narrowed his eyes.

Individually, none of these women had reached the Supreme Realm. Yet their auras had fused into a singular whole, generating combined pressure that surpassed ordinary Supremes.

Moreover, facing three hundred sixty opponents, the Fourth Ancestor felt as though he faced only one.

That was only possible if all three hundred sixty shared perfect synchronization—not a shred of discord among them—fused into absolute unity.

One or two people might achieve that.

But three hundred sixty?

"How did that kid train them? Three hundred sixty people, and their coordination is flawless."

The Fourth Ancestor murmured.

Then the 360 Songstresses struck first.

Their assault flowed like a dance, captivating to behold.

But from inside the maelstrom, the Fourth Ancestor was startled. The offense looked delicate, yet hidden blades lurked behind every movement—one slip could cost him his life.

His eyes flashed as he moved to counter.

Suddenly, an enchanting melody filled his ears. His Great Emperor-level primordial spirit actually trembled. In that instant of distraction, stinging pain erupted across his skin.

He snapped back to focus and shook off the threads that had wrapped around his body, shattering them.

Looking down, his heart chilled. His robes were in tatters.

Thin lines of blood seeped from the welts crisscrossing his skin.

"Good thing I'm not actually a Nine Tribulations Supreme. Otherwise, letting my guard down like that could've gotten me killed in a single strike."

He muttered to himself.

The next wave came, and this time the Fourth Ancestor fought seriously—though he still limited his output to Nine Tribulations Supreme levels.

When he focused, the battle became more even.

But his expression grew increasingly grave.

The 360 Songstresses seemed to have no weaknesses. He'd tried to cripple one first, disrupting their formation, but found zero openings.

Their coordination was impeccable.

The only option would be to unleash his full Great Emperor power and simply overwhelm them.

After another extended exchange, the Fourth Ancestor flared his aura and blasted the Songstresses back:

"Enough. Let's stop here."

But the 360 Songstresses pressed their attack regardless. They answered to Qin Jiang alone.

The Fourth Ancestor's face darkened.

Qin Jiang hastily called them off, and only then did they disengage.

The sight drew a sigh of admiration from the Fourth Ancestor.

'What kind of charisma does this kid have, that so many exceptional women obey him without question?'

"Heh heh. So, Fourth Ancestor, what's the verdict?"

Qin Jiang sidled up with a grin.

The Fourth Ancestor gave him a sidelong glance:

"Decent. If I'd gone all out, they wouldn't survive a single move."

"Fourth Ancestor, the strongest among them is only a Saint. Have you no shame?"

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes.

A Great Emperor bullying Saints and Unity cultivators—truly brazen!

The Fourth Ancestor's lip twitched. In the heat of battle, he'd nearly forgotten: these women's highest cultivation was Saint Realm, and most were only Unity.

If they grew any stronger...

Wouldn't that mean they could challenge a Great Emperor?

The thought set his eyes ablaze. With proper nurturing, these women could potentially match Great Emperor-level combat power!

Using them as mere guards was a waste!

He looked at Qin Jiang. Judging by their absolute loyalty, they were effectively Qin family members. Maybe the kid had even already...

Worth investing in!

"Jiang'er, these women are excellent. But they shouldn't be guards."

The Fourth Ancestor said.

Qin Jiang looked at him quizzically. The Fourth Ancestor continued:

"They're too talented for that.

And are you really willing to send them into danger?"

Qin Jiang: "..."

Fine. The Fourth Ancestor had the wrong idea too.

He'd literally just summoned the 360 Songstresses. He'd admit that facing so many beauties, his heart had stirred—but there'd been zero opportunity.

And besides...

Three hundred sixty was a bit much even for him.

He wondered whether the Kidney Treasure Pill might help, and decided it was worth experimenting with eventually.

There was also the practical problem that he didn't own a bed large enough.

His bedroom probably couldn't even fit them all.

Qin Jiang stroked his chin. Perhaps it was time to commission a custom-built estate.

"Hey, brat, did you hear what I said?"

Seeing Qin Jiang zone out, the Fourth Ancestor rapped him on the forehead.

"Huh? Yeah, I heard."

Qin Jiang came back to himself, looking at the Songstresses with a smile:

"For now, let them stay with Lian'er. She'll mostly be home at the compound anyway—no real danger."

"So you're not going to properly train them?"

The Fourth Ancestor frowned.

Qin Jiang smiled:

"Don't worry. Their strength won't stagnate."

Ultimately, the Fourth Ancestor gave him a lengthy lecture about not wasting the Songstresses' potential—and even dropped some not-so-subtle hints about taking care of any... unfinished business.

After much fussing, the Fourth Ancestor led the elders back to the rear mountain, where several other elders were still in seclusion.

They were refining the Great Emperor blood essence—there was a chance some might break through to Great Emperor.

They needed someone standing guard.

Qin Jiang and family returned to the residence. The 360 Songstresses practically filled the courtyard.

Li Xueyi rubbed her temples. She'd been perfectly fine with her son bringing home a few women—carrying on the family line was important, after all. But this...

Wasn't this a few too many?

Qin Lian'er, however, was in her element, darting among the Songstresses, chatting away, and every now and then stealing a glance at Qin Jiang while whispering some very private questions.
