Chen Ningshuang was quite the glutton. Fortunately, Qin Jiang had ample reserves—more than enough to satisfy her.

Once she'd eaten her fill, she lay contentedly in his arms. The fox cubs came bouncing back, their eyes fixed on Ningshuang. Though they hadn't experienced it themselves, they could sense the change in her. 'Did that scoundrel really eat Little Shuang'er? What a beast!'

Their gazes toward Qin Jiang turned decidedly strange. If Shuang'er had been eaten, their turn must be coming soon. After all, they were technically older than her—their human forms just happened to look a bit young. But being small could satisfy certain preferences of his, couldn't it?

With that thought, they shifted into human form and crowded around Qin Jiang—porcelain skin, delicate as dolls, parading in front of him. Quite the sight.

Qin Jiang coughed and waved his hand, producing a pile of outfits. "Everyone get dressed."

They shook their heads in unison. "We don't wanna~ We like it this way~"

His cheek twitched. Without another word, he grabbed the nearest fox cub and stuffed her into a Lolita dress, complete with white stockings. Then he worked through the rest of them—short skirts, halter tops, various styles of stockings—until every last one was properly clothed.

He surveyed his work with satisfaction. Much better with the outfits. The fox cubs wrinkled their noses but didn't undress. They could tell he liked it—especially the way his eyes kept drifting to their stocking-clad legs. They knelt around him, showing off. "Hehe, Qin Jiang, do you like it?"

He nodded openly, running his hands over each of them. "Very nice."

They beamed, posing even more enthusiastically. Qin Jiang smiled. He'd been with mature women for so long—a change of pace with something fresh wasn't bad at all.

But Ningshuang, still resting in his arms, muttered under her breath: "Fox spirits!"

He couldn't help laughing. The fox cubs heard her too and sniffed proudly. "We are fox spirits! And fox spirits are the prettiest!"

They weren't wrong—these little white foxes were genuinely lovely, like exquisite works of art. But Ningshuang wasn't about to lose. She sat up straight, chest out, and declared proudly, "I'm bigger than all of you!"

The foxes looked down at themselves. On that front, they truly couldn't compete. Even Hu Xian'er barely matched the current Ningshuang, who clearly still had plenty of growing left to do. Enormous potential.

They pouted, turning to Qin Jiang with pleading eyes. "We want to get bigger too. Qin Jiang, can you help us?"

"Sure." He agreed readily. Starting the cultivation early would definitely yield better results than natural growth.

One by one, they took their turns experiencing his massage technique. Ningshuang even tried to help, but the foxes unanimously preferred his hands, demanding he redo any that she'd done. She rolled her eyes and flopped back into his lap, done volunteering.

Just as Qin Jiang was busy with the massages, several figures approached from outside the airship—An Xihe and the others. They took one look at what he was doing and shot him collective glares. Hu Xian'er marched right up. "You scoundrel, they're still children."

She pried his hands off the nearest cub, placed them firmly on herself, and declared with utmost sincerity, "Don't bully them. Come at me instead!"

Good, good, good. The once-innocent Hu Xian'er had certainly picked up some tricks after spending so long around Qin Jiang.

"Hurry up~" she urged.

The fox cubs looked on, dejected but too timid to compete. Qin Jiang shook his head, gave Hu Xian'er a few squeezes, and stood up. He looked at the assembled women with a smile. "All rested?"

Their cheeks flushed as they nodded, then their eyes drifted to Ningshuang in his arms. Wearing nothing but that sheer gauze, she left nothing to the imagination. Qin Jiang coughed, suddenly self-conscious.

"You... you ate Little Shuang'er?" Chen Ningbing stepped forward. She could tell—her little sister was a woman now.

Qin Jiang nodded sheepishly. "Actually, Shuang'er isn't that small anymore..."

"Beast!" Ningbing huffed.

Every woman present nodded in agreement. They looked at Ningshuang, still clinging tightly to Qin Jiang. Under their gazes, she spoke up softly: "I'm not little~"

She wriggled free and walked to Ningbing's side. Slightly shorter in height, but when she puffed out her chest, Ningbing's eye twitched. 'How is she bigger than me?'

The other women's eyes went wide. She really wasn't small. Even Jian Yao was privately alarmed. 'This girl isn't going to surpass me, is she?' She glanced down at herself. For now, she still held the title, but this girl was young with enormous potential. Jian Yao's own figure had already settled—it wasn't growing anymore. Augmentation through cultivation was possible, but it wouldn't be natural. Qin Jiang probably wouldn't appreciate that.

For the first time, Jian Yao felt a hint of competitive pressure from Chen Ningshuang.

Qin Jiang spread his hands. "I told you—Shuang'er isn't small."

"And I'm still growing!" Ningshuang added.
