Three days.

An Xihe lost badly. She lay against Qin Jiang's chest, cheeks puffed in frustration.

How? She was an Immortal King. How could she still not beat him?

Qin Jiang, on the other hand, was thoroughly content. He held her close, privately marveling. An Immortal King really was something else — she'd lasted a full three days under his best effort.

At this rate, he needed to get stronger. If his women teamed up, he might actually go down. That wouldn't do. The upgraded Kidney Treasure Pill was long overdue for testing.

He looked down at the sulking An Xihe and smiled, kissing her until the irritation melted from her face.

"Shall we head out?"

He glanced around. The formation was impressive — it looked nearly identical to the outside world.

"Xihe, what kind of formation is this?"

An Xihe was still a bit wobbly. He had to carry her. "Originally, it was just a simple trapping formation. But it's my natal formation — it grows with me. As I've gotten stronger, I've inscribed all sorts of additional formations into it: killing arrays, illusion arrays, spirit-gathering arrays... practically everything."

"A hodgepodge?"

"Pretty much." She nodded.

She'd started from nothing. In the beginning, she couldn't even access powerful formations. So she'd cultivated and improvised simultaneously. Through sheer genius, her natal formation had evolved from a basic trapping array into a full Immortal King-level formation — a chaotic but devastatingly effective composite.

"Oh — I also borrowed from your formation. When I broke through to Immortal King, I inscribed formation runes modeled after yours into my natal array. They're incredibly potent."

Offense had always been the weak point of her natal formation. It excelled at trapping and containment. But with the Immortal King Killing Formation as a template, that weakness had been erased.

"My formation was useful to you?"

She nodded. Her biggest headache — offensive capability — was solved.

"Still useful now?" Without hesitation, Qin Jiang produced the Immortal King Killing Formation Plate.

He trusted his women completely. Leadership Charisma had already confirmed it: zero chance of betrayal.

"Is that... the formation plate?" An Xihe's eyes widened.

"An Immortal King-level killing formation," he confirmed.

Just as she'd suspected. The formation's grade had been obvious from the start — it was why she'd incorporated similar rune patterns during her breakthrough.

"Here. You cultivate the Dao of formations. Studying this should be useful." He placed the plate in her hands.

An Xihe stared at him, lips parting. She knew this was his trump card. And he was just... giving it to her?

"What about you?"

"You'll protect me." He pulled her close and pinched her cheek. "I'm the sugar mama guy, remember?"

"But I can't always be by your side."

Compared to strengthening herself, she cared more about Qin Jiang's safety. With his personality, he needed a failsafe. And even the formation plate wasn't enough — against a truly powerful enemy, he wouldn't even have time to activate it. An external tool had its limits.

After a moment's thought, she raised her hand. A drop of blood essence condensed at her fingertip. Her face went instantly pale.

For a cultivator, blood essence was precious beyond measure. Once expended, only the rarest treasures could restore it. Immortal King blood essence would require Immortal King-grade resources.

"Xihe—"

Before he could protest, the blood essence shot into the center of his forehead. A delicate formation rune flickered there briefly, then vanished.

An Xihe smiled. "There. Now I can always protect you."

The blood essence contained a copy of her natal formation. If Qin Jiang was ever in danger, it would activate automatically — far more responsive than any formation plate. And the moment it triggered, she'd know, and could reach him instantly.

"The plate — I don't need it. Keep it for yourself."

She pushed the Immortal King Killing Formation Plate back into his hands. With her natal formation embedded in his body, even an Immortal King couldn't kill him quickly. That would give him time to deploy the plate — and the plate could make an Immortal King regret their existence.

Between the two defenses, even An Xihe herself couldn't kill Qin Jiang if she tried.

He looked at her pale face and felt a pang of guilt. "You just broke through to Immortal King, and the first thing you do is drain yourself like this? You might be the only cultivator in history to do that."

"Mm~ It's all for you."

She pouted, head resting on his shoulder, the plate and a certain other item clutched to her chest.

Qin Jiang shook his head. He laid a gentle smack on her backside. "Drop the formation. Once we're out, take this and rest."

He'd exchanged a stalk of Immortal King-grade medicine from the system. Three hundred thousand Villain Points — not cheap, but compared to An Xihe's pallid face, the cost was nothing.

"Here." He handed her the medicine alongside the formation plate. "Take the medicine first and restore your blood essence. As for the plate, I'm not giving it away — just lending it. Return it when you're done studying."

An Xihe accepted both items with wide eyes. She looked at the medicine, then at the plate, then back up at Qin Jiang. She swallowed.

"You're... this rich?"

"What, planning to rob me?"

She blinked, gave him a once-over, and broke into a mischievous grin. "Stick 'em up! Hand over your valuables!"

"You sure about that?"

His eyebrow quirked. He caught her hand, and a wicked smile spread across his face. The next instant, An Xihe turned crimson and shrieked.

"Pervert!"

She recoiled like a startled rabbit, yanking her hand free. But between her depleted state and the blood essence loss, her legs buckled and she collapsed right back into his arms.

Seeing her condition, Qin Jiang dialed it back. He lifted her gently and kissed her cheek. "Freshly minted Immortal King, and you've already run yourself ragged. That might be a first."

"Mm~ It's all because of you."

She pouted. Her head settled on his shoulder, arms full of medicine and formation plate. Qin Jiang shook his head, gave her rear another light pat, and said, "Drop the formation. Get some rest, then refine the medicine and restore your blood essence."

"Okay~"
