Back at the Void Divine Temple, Qin Jiang spent a few days with the women and even got a taste of the parenting life. Chen Ningshuang was cute enough, but compared to his wives, the toddler's appeal was limited. She'd have to grow up before she could compete.

A few days later, Qin Jiang took Liu Shuwan, Jian Yao, and Bai Susu to the Holy Sword Sect — mainly to let Bai Susu visit her father. Liu Shuwan, as the sect's ancestral elder, wanted to check on its development. Jian Yao, the sect's actual founder, felt less attached. After tens of thousands of years, there wasn't a single person left that she recognized.

As they strolled through the sect, Qin Jiang chuckled. "I'm technically still the Holy Sword Sect's Holy Son. Think they'd still honor that?"

"If you wanted the title, they'd honor it in a heartbeat," Liu Shuwan laughed.

Bai Susu clung to his arm, smiling playfully. "I doubt my father would appreciate it."

"And why not?"

"Last time you visited, you destroyed Sword Valley, stole Sister Wan away, and took all the opportunities stored inside. Father's heart probably ached for years. And they still don't know you took Sister Yao too — that would finish him off."

"Ha! I think what really hurt him most was losing you to me."

Bai Susu's cheeks colored.

Just then, a group hurried toward them — Bai Jingyun and the Grand Elder at the head. "Holy Son! We're terribly sorry for the late welcome!" The Grand Elder bowed deeply.

Qin Jiang waved it off. "I'm just here to bring Susu home. No need for ceremony. How did you even know we were here?"

"Your statue, Holy Son." The Grand Elder smiled. "We've erected statues of you throughout the sect. Every disciple knows your face. One of them spotted you and reported in."

Statues? Qin Jiang blinked. He was that important to them?

"Would you like to inspect them? If anything's unsatisfactory, we can adjust."

"Lead the way."

In the martial grounds, a massive stone statue of Qin Jiang stood at center stage — sword in hand, posture dashing and elegant. He nodded approvingly. Not bad. Captured maybe a tenth of his real handsomeness.

Nine statues total, each in a different heroic pose, all suitably dashing.

"Acceptable," he declared.

The Grand Elder, reading the room perfectly, conjured an excuse and ushered the other elders away — leaving only Bai Jingyun.

"I'll take Sister Yao for a walk," Liu Shuwan said, linking arms with Jian Yao. "You two go ahead." With the sect's ancient ancestor present, Bai Jingyun would only be tenser. The two women disappeared around a corner, and he visibly relaxed.

He studied Qin Jiang and his daughter, then smiled. "Thank you, Little Jiang. You've taken good care of Susu."

His wife had made him promise to protect their daughter. When Bai Susu had been taken, he'd nearly gone mad. Learning what Qin Jiang had done to her, he'd seriously considered rallying the entire sect for vengeance. Only the discovery that she wasn't as miserable as he'd feared — and the mistaken belief she was pregnant — had stayed his hand.

By the time he realized his daughter had fallen for the man, his anger no longer mattered. So he'd accepted it, hoping Qin Jiang would treat her well. Seeing her now, leaning into Qin Jiang with obvious contentment, Bai Jingyun knew she was happy. A stroke of luck, really — she'd stumbled into a fine husband.

"Susu is my woman. Of course I take care of her," Qin Jiang said, pulling Bai Susu into his arms.

"Father, Qin Jiang is wonderful to me. You don't need to worry." She meant it. Aside from the abundance of sister-wives — which honestly wasn't a drawback, given Qin Jiang's stamina — he was the perfect husband.

Bai Jingyun nodded with a smile. But making conversation with a man of Qin Jiang's stature was awkward, and the power gap made it worse. He couldn't play the typical overbearing father-in-law even if he wanted to.

After a stilted walk through the sect, he stopped and cleared his throat. "Well... you two don't get much alone time together. I won't intrude. Susu, I'll be going."

He turned and left. Qin Jiang shook his head with a smile. "Your father really does love you — deliberately giving us privacy."

Bai Susu swatted his chest lightly, watching her father's retreating figure. "He's just bad with words. He doesn't know what to say, so he's leaving to spare us the awkwardness. Just walking together would have been nice, really."
