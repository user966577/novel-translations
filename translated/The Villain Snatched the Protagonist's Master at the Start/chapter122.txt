The Myriad Realms Tower wasn't far.

Two hours later, Qin Jiang and his group caught sight of a towering black spire. Quite a crowd had already gathered outside, all clearly here to challenge the tower.

Beside the tower stood a stone stele covered in densely packed names. The higher up the stele, the larger the names; below the top hundred, though, they were uniformly tiny—like ants crawling across the surface.

"This is the Myriad Realms Tower," Long Xin'er explained. "The stele beside it is the Record Stone. It displays ten thousand names, and every single one belongs to a top-tier prodigy."

She pointed to a minuscule name near the bottom. "See? That's Father's name. Rank 9,876."

Qin Jiang looked. There it was—Long Aotian, three tiny characters utterly unremarkable on the massive stele. His mouth twitched. The Dragon Emperor really was an embarrassment to that name.

"He's probably slipped since last time," Long Xin'er murmured. "I remember Father saying he used to be 9,820th. Must've been bumped down. At this rate, his name will probably vanish entirely by the next time the Dragon Nest opens."

Liu Shuwan and the others studied the stele with fascination. "Where do all these names come from? People from your Divine Dragon Empire?"

"No." Long Xin'er shook her head. "Besides Father, no one else from our empire is on there. And his name is about to disappear too."

"Then who are all these...?"

"Father said the Myriad Realms Tower doesn't only exist in the Dragon Nest—it appears in many places, all interconnected. So the Record Stone ranks prodigies across the entire myriad realms. Getting your name up there is an incredible honor."

"Prodigies of the myriad realms..." Liu Shuwan's eyes lit up. Deep down, she had a competitive streak. Matching herself against the myriad realms' finest would be a rare thrill.

Just then, excited shouts erupted from the crowd:

"The Ninth Prince made the list!"

"Heavens, the greatest genius of our Divine Dragon Empire—he just went in and he's already on the Record Stone!"

"Still climbing! So fast!"

"He's passed His Majesty!"

Amid the commotion, Qin Jiang looked over. Sure enough, the name ascending the stele was Long Yu—the Ninth Prince's real name. He'd already entered the tower.

Qin Jiang wasn't surprised. From the spoilers, he knew Long Yu would barely squeeze into the top hundred, finishing at rank 99. For a first attempt, that was legitimately outstanding.

Long Yu's name continued to rise, drawing gasps from the onlookers.

"What's all the noise? Shut it!" Qin Lian'er stepped forward, her face scrunched in annoyance. She shot a glance at the Record Stone and pouted. "It's just a stone tablet. What's the fuss about?"

The Divine Dragon Empire contingent turned to retort, but the moment they spotted Qin Jiang, every mouth snapped shut. Resentment lingered in their eyes, though. This was a ranking of the myriad realms' greatest geniuses! Making the list meant undeniable talent. And Long Yu's rank was climbing fast—he might even crack the top thousand.

"Want to give it a shot, Lian'er?" Qin Jiang suggested with a smile.

The current Qin Lian'er was a far cry from her former self. Divine Body, Emperor weapon, Immortal Fire—she might be a minor villain, but she was every bit the equal of a Child of Destiny. Even Little Red, perched on her shoulder, had been fed an Emperor-grade bloodline pill, her strength dramatically enhanced.

"Sure!"

Qin Lian'er nodded eagerly, brimming with confidence. She marched straight into the Myriad Realms Tower.

The Divine Dragon Empire crowd pursed their lips, not believing for a second that she'd make the list. They waited to see her fail—internally, at least. No one dared show it.

"Qin Jiang, can Lian'er actually make it?" Liu Shuwan asked.

She had some sense of Qin Lian'er's talent, but this was a ranking of the entire myriad realms. She genuinely wasn't sure.

"Of course!" Qin Jiang had full confidence in his little sister. "Don't overestimate these prodigies, and don't underestimate Lian'er. I'd say cracking the top hundred shouldn't be a problem."

"Top hundred?" The women gasped in unison.

Qin Jiang nodded and smiled at them. "And don't underestimate yourselves, either. With your talent, making the list—even placing near the top—shouldn't be difficult."

The women at his side were no ornaments. Every one of them was a fortune heroine, and they'd spent considerable time with him. Qin Jiang regularly redeemed small items from the system to boost their talent. Their current strength was leagues beyond what it had been.

As for Long Xin'er, the spoilers showed she'd also make the Record Stone, albeit with a modest ranking, completely overshadowed by Long Yu's brilliance. And since she'd been with Qin Jiang for less than a month, there hadn't been much change yet.

While they chatted, everyone kept one eye on the Record Stone. After only about fifteen minutes, Qin Lian'er's name appeared—faster than Long Yu had managed.

"Lian'er!"

Liu Shuwan and the others pointed excitedly at her name.

And right behind Qin Lian'er, another name appeared: Little Red.

"Huh? Little Red counts separately?" Liu Shuwan blinked in surprise.

Qin Jiang chuckled at the two new entries. "The myriad realms' prodigies aren't limited to humans. Little Red naturally gets her own ranking—she and Lian'er were probably separated inside."

Little Red's talent was nothing to scoff at. As a divine beast and a system reward—system products, always top-quality—she'd also consumed plenty of premium resources. Her strength rivaled Qin Lian'er's.

As time trickled by, all eyes stayed glued to the three names: Long Yu, Qin Lian'er, and Little Red. All three kept climbing steadily. Within a couple of hours, each had broken into the top thousand.

The Divine Dragon Empire disciples were thrilled—because of Long Yu, naturally. Qin Lian'er's performance only made them jealous. What they couldn't deny, though, was that the Record Stone really wasn't as untouchable as they'd thought. Moreover, the gap between Qin Lian'er and Long Yu was shrinking. At this rate, she would definitely surpass him. Even Little Red was keeping pace.

Another two hours passed. When Long Yu's rank reached 99, a blinding light erupted from his name. At that same moment, a figure emerged from the Myriad Realms Tower.

It was Long Yu.
