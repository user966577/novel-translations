"Who is it?" came Mu Yunxiao's voice from within, carrying a slight tremor.

Qin Jiang cleared his throat. "It's me."

A beat of silence, then the muffled rustle of fabric and hurried footsteps. The door opened to reveal Mu Yunxiao, a faint blush still clinging to her cheeks. She averted her gaze. "Is something the matter?"

"There is, actually." He nodded, then gestured toward the room. "Mind if we talk inside?"

Before she could respond, he'd already slipped past her.

She stood in the doorway, blinking. By the time she turned around, Qin Jiang was already surveying her room. She quickly shut the door and went to his side.

"Have a seat." She pointed to the chairs.

But his eyes had drifted to her bed — pink sheets, girlish and delicate. And draped over the mattress, an article of her clothing. The intimate kind.

She followed his gaze, face flaming, and rushed to the bed to throw a blanket over the offending garment. She'd barely exhaled when she felt his presence directly behind her.

"It's quite damp in these mountains," he remarked casually, reaching past her to touch the sheets. "These feel a bit..."

"Don't—" she tried to stop him.

Too late. His hand was on the fabric. He raised it, rubbed his fingers together, then brought them to his nose.

"Huh. Mountain dew smells different up here. Kind of... sweet."

She was scarlet from hairline to collarbone. She seized his arm and towed him away from the bed, breathing hard. Once she'd composed herself — somewhat — she looked at him squarely. "It's late. Is it something important?"

"Very important." He sat down and placed a second chair beside his own, patting the seat. "Sit."

She hesitated. 'This is my room, isn't it? So why does he act like he owns it?'

She perched on the edge of the chair. Even so, the gap between them was almost nonexistent, and Qin Jiang seemed to keep inching closer until he was practically sharing her seat. His nearness made her pulse quicken.

He leaned in as if nothing were amiss, his body nearly pressed against hers. He inhaled. "You know, the mountain dew smells a lot like you."

She couldn't meet his eyes. "The moisture settles on the sheets and picks up my scent. Perfectly normal."

"True." He rested his chin almost on her shoulder, their faces so close she could feel his breath on her neck. "You smell really nice."

She laughed nervously and tried to put some distance between them. She could feel each warm exhale against her skin, tingling.

He noticed, smiled, and finally eased back a fraction. Then, his voice turning serious: "I can fix your body's problem. Right now."

"Now?" She whipped around, eyes wide with hope and nerves. "How?"

"Simple." He snapped his fingers, smiling broadly. "Your body's issue is that ice overpowers fire. If we permanently strengthen the fire attribute until it balances the ice, the problem goes away. You've been doing that with fire-attribute medicines, but those are temporary. I can make the enhancement permanent."

"You'd... really help me?"

She knew there were rare treasures capable of permanently enhancing an elemental affinity. She'd simply never had the means to acquire one. With Qin Jiang's resources — lord of Huaxia, ruler of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands in all but name — obtaining such a thing would be trivial.

He took her hand, his touch warm and sure. "You're Weiwei's master. You raised her like a daughter. Of course I'll help."

She stiffened. He was holding her hand again — and this time he wasn't even pretending to be subtle. He was openly kneading her fingers.

"Please... don't do that~" She tugged, but he held firm.

His other arm slid around her waist, pulling her close. He rested his head on her shoulder and closed his eyes, murmuring, "Weiwei says you're the gift she's giving me."

"Excuse me?"

She was a gift? Her own disciple had gifted her to this man?

That treacherous little— !

"But she also said she's giving you a gift," he continued.

Her voice shook. "What gift?"

"Me."

So Weiwei had gifted her to Qin Jiang and Qin Jiang to her. Was this some kind of joke?

"Qin Jiang, please... don't listen to that girl's nonsense. That's not how gifts work..."

She tried to pull away, but he held her tight. His cheek pressed against hers, and his lips brushed the corner of her mouth.

"Then... how should a gift be given?"
