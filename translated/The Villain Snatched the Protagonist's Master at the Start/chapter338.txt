Every eye went wide. They'd only been quiet for a moment — how was that "looking down" on anyone?

And tattling to a woman? A grown man? Had he no shame?

Their faces darkened. They stole a glance at An Xihe and found her gaze glacial, a faint but unmistakable pressure settling over them like a vise. Their bodies went rigid.

Someone rushed to speak up.

"Young Master Qin, you misunderstand — we're merely worried that our sects' meager strength wouldn't meet your standards."

"Exactly! And our disciples are all unruly troublemakers. If we joined Huaxia, we'd only sully its great name."

"Same for our sect — nothing but a bunch of worthless reprobates."

They fell over each other describing how terrible their own factions were, the sincerity in their voices almost convincing.

Qin Jiang furrowed his brow. "Your sects really have it that rough?"

"Alas, we're embarrassed for you to hear it, Young Master Qin."

They sighed collectively, inwardly exhaling with relief. Seemed like the excuses were working. No becoming Huaxia's lapdogs today.

But then, under their watchful gazes, Qin Jiang let out his own heavy sigh, his face the very picture of compassion.

"You truly have suffered. But worry not — once you join Huaxia, I promise to lead you all to safe, prosperous lives."

Dead silence.

That wasn't how this was supposed to go. They stared at him, and one managed a strained chuckle:

"Haha, Young Master Qin, our sect really is too terrible. We'd be a burden to Huaxia."

Qin Jiang shook his head, his tone grave and earnest. "If there's one thing I can't stand, it's watching others suffer. Huaxia embraces all. Your sects may be a bit... run-down, but I guarantee that as long as you follow my orders and stay loyal to Huaxia, things will get better."

They looked at his solemn expression and cursed him silently for his shamelessness. Their polite refusals couldn't have been more obvious. Any person with a shred of social awareness would have taken the hint and offered them a graceful exit. And even if he forced compliance, wouldn't he worry about sabotage?

But looking at Qin Jiang's brazen display, they knew there was no escape.

He surveyed the crowd with a beaming smile. "No need to be so moved, everyone. Look at you — practically in tears! Really, there's no need. Huaxia has always been about helping those in need. Since your lives are this hard, Huaxia will absolutely lend a hand."

"Boo-hoo, Young Master Qin, you're truly too... too kind."

Someone actually did burst into tears.

The others, faces black as storm clouds, had no choice but to pile on the praise and gratitude.

Qin Jiang accepted it all with a radiant grin. "Your kind words are appreciated. From this moment forward, you are all disciples of Huaxia!"

"Wonderful, boo-hoo..."

"Huaxia... I only came to pay my respects, and now my entire sect is gone..."

"Huaxia... what a wonderful place."

The bitterness was palpable. They'd come bearing gifts and ended up gifting their entire organizations. And they had to say thank you.

Watching Qin Jiang preen with satisfaction, they ground their teeth in secret. Shameless! But what could they do? The man had a good wife — the strongest cultivator in Azure Cloud Heaven, no less.

The jealousy burned their eyes. But one look at An Xihe, then at Qin Jiang's unfairly handsome face, and they could only sigh. There was simply no competing. They had enough self-awareness to know they'd never break into the kept-man industry, let alone claim the number-one spot in Azure Cloud Heaven.

If they even entertained the thought, An Xihe would swat them dead before Qin Jiang said a word.

Safety first.

After several deep breaths and a lengthy internal pep talk, they managed to compose themselves. Smiles appeared on their faces as they exchanged glances and spoke in unison:

"We are willing to join Huaxia. Greetings, our Lord."

They had no idea what to actually call the leader of Huaxia, so they defaulted to "Lord."

Qin Jiang considered for a moment. "Huaxia's full name shall be Huaxia Manor. You may address me as Manor Lord."

"Yes, Manor Lord."

They bowed again.

And with that, Huaxia Manor was officially established.

It had absorbed virtually every significant power in Azure Cloud Heaven. The realm buzzed with the news — those who'd been recruited sighed and lamented, while those who hadn't been selected seethed with indignation. Why weren't they chosen? Were they that weak?

But regardless of their feelings, nobody dared voice complaints aloud.

The next order of business was assigning ranks and roles. After deliberation, Qin Jiang and his wives decided that no assignment scheme felt quite right — so they scrapped the idea entirely.

Instead, each faction would retain its own name and identity while swearing fealty to Huaxia Manor. They maintained internal autonomy but were obligated to obey Huaxia Manor's directives and pay annual tribute.

This turned Huaxia Manor into something less like a sect and more like an empire — which suited Qin Jiang just fine. Huaxia had always been an empire.

The subordinate factions, for their part, felt their resistance melt away considerably. Even without formal submission, they'd have been compelled to obey anyway. And as for tribute... well, they had money. Think of it as paying for protection.

"Too loose," Qin Jiang declared. "We need unity. When one is in trouble, all others rally. Every faction must function as a single body — offense and defense as one."

He mandated mutual defense: in normal times, factions operated independently, but if any member faced a crisis, all others were obligated to assist. Additionally, they could request services from each other — need pills? Go to the Heavenly Pill Palace, and they couldn't refuse. But transactions had to be fair. You ask, you bring sincerity; they agree, they deliver. Unreasonable demands could be declined.

Human dynamics were woven into the framework. The system favored the factions — previously, trading for what they needed had been monumentally difficult, sometimes impossible at any price.

As for the mutual defense clause, that was only natural. They were all Huaxia Manor now.

The trickier issue was grudges. Quite a few of these factions had history with each other. Qin Jiang gave them two choices: bury it, or fight to the death until one side was eliminated.

Huaxia Manor didn't need any particular faction badly enough to tolerate internal strife.

Those two options sent a chill through every leader present.

Huaxia Manor didn't play gentle.
