At the Wu family estate, Wu Tian sat alone in his courtyard, sipping tea.

"It's been a while since Yingtao left. Why haven't I heard anything?"

When Qin Jiang had reviewed the spoilers, he'd instructed the Wu family elders to withhold the news from Wu Tian. So even now, he had no idea what had happened.

Concern gnawed at him. Say what you would about being a reincarnated Immortal Emperor—in this life, Wu Yingtao was his blood sister. He wasn't heartless. Besides, she'd gone to that pageant for his sake.

"She hasn't gotten into trouble, has she?"

He'd heard the rumors. Huaxia's lord was no saint—his reputation as a lecher was well established. Tens of thousands of beauties had been assembled. Statistically, Wu Yingtao's odds of being selected should have been low.

Unless the pervert had kept all of them? That wasn't impossible.

Or worse—what if he was collecting women for dual cultivation, draining their yin energy? Such practitioners weren't uncommon in the Heavenly Domain, and the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands were likely no different.

The thought darkened his expression. If that was the case...

"I need to check on her."

He couldn't stand by while his sister walked into a predator's den. True, it had been many days already. Hopefully nothing had happened yet.

With his current strength, he couldn't confront Huaxia directly, but his repertoire of techniques was vast. Reconnaissance should be feasible. As a former Immortal Emperor, he had that much confidence.

He rose to leave—but a knock came at the gate.

Wu Tian paused. In this life, Wu Yingtao was his only family. They were nobodies in the Wu family, with only her looks earning them any recognition. Visitors were rare even when she was home. With her gone, no one bothered with Wu Tian at all.

Which suited him fine. He hated interruptions.

Curious, he opened the gate. A group of Wu family elders stood outside, beaming.

"Little Tian! What are you up to?"

"I was... cultivating."

"Oh, cultivating! What a diligent young man."

Wu Tian managed a polite smile. For a reincarnated Immortal Emperor, this level of social theater was impressive. "What brings the elders here?"

"Good news, actually. Yingtao was selected in the pageant."

Wu Tian's face fell.

She'd gone purely for the cultivation resources. Being selected had never been part of the plan. And that Huaxia lord—what made him worthy of his sister?

"What's the matter? She's been chosen! Moving up in the world. You should be happy."

He forced a smile. "I am. Happy. Is there anything else?"

He wanted them gone so he could rush to rescue her. His sister surely didn't want to be with that lecher.

"Actually, yes. Now that Yingtao's been selected, the Manor Lord himself has decreed that your cultivation resources will be provided by Huaxia. Which means the Wu family's resources... well, we'll need those back."

"???"

"You understand, Little Tian. If Huaxia's already covering you and we keep providing too, it might seem like we're looking down on them."

"..."

Wu Tian understood. With Huaxia's lord being notoriously volatile, the Wu family's caution made sense. He nodded. "I understand."

"Wonderful. Oh, and you should still have some Wu family resources on hand?"

"???"

They wanted those back too?

Under their expectant stares, he produced a portion. "This is all I have left."

"Perfect."

They divided the resources among themselves right in front of him, then smiled. "Don't worry. Huaxia's resources are far superior to ours. There's a Huaxia branch office now—just go there to claim yours."

"Got it."

They departed with a few parting words. Wu Tian watched them go, seething quietly.

The Wu family's resources had been paltry to begin with, and now he'd handed back most of what remained. Not nearly enough for his needs. An Immortal Emperor he might be, but cultivation resources were still essential. More resources meant faster recovery.

A thought struck him. His sister probably wasn't in immediate danger. Why not visit the Huaxia branch first, grab the resources, then mount the rescue? Huaxia's offerings would dwarf the Wu family's.

Free was free.

"Resources first, then rescue Yingtao."

He prepared briefly, asked for directions, and set off. The branch office wasn't far—half a day's journey. The building was newly established, and its lavish exterior spoke to Huaxia's deep pockets.

"Should be a decent haul." He rubbed his hands.

But before he could reach the entrance, guards blocked his path.

"Halt! Huaxia branch office. No unauthorized personnel!"

"I'm Wu Tian. I'm here for my cultivation resources."

"Wu Tian? Never heard of you!"
