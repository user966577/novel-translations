Under Qin Jiang and Lian'er's demonstration, Yun Bao and the other newcomers watched with widening eyes.

So that's how the silk drapes worked?

They watched Lian'er spin through loop after loop, their anticipation building. It looked like tremendous fun—and judging by Lian'er's expressions, it felt even better than it looked.

About two hours later, Lian'er collapsed softly into Qin Jiang's arms, her eyes slightly glazed, lips parted as she caught her breath. Qin Jiang held her by the waist, brushed the hair from her face, and kissed her forehead.

"Lian'er, hungry? The congee is ready."

"Mm~" Lian'er pouted. "Hungry. Feed me~"

"Heh, your wish is my command."

Qin Jiang spooned the warm congee into her mouth himself. When she finished, he wiped the corners of her lips, earning a coy little protest.

He patted her waist gently. "Rest up for a bit, Lian'er."

"Mm~" she murmured.

This was, after all, a teaching session. Judging by the eager looks on Yun Bao and the others, they were itching to try.

Qin Jiang settled Lian'er comfortably to one side, then turned to the waiting group. "Did you all get the idea?"

"I think so?" They nodded, practically vibrating with anticipation.

Liu Shuwan and the other veterans stepped aside graciously, letting the newcomers go first.

"How about... Yingtao starts?" Qin Jiang looked at Wu Yingtao. She was the strongest among the newcomers, so she'd probably last the longest—and serve as one more demonstration for the rest.

Wu Yingtao blushed deeply. Even after years together and countless group training sessions, she still got shy so easily. She walked up and sat beside Qin Jiang, murmuring, "I'm not sure I know how."

"I'll guide you."

He pulled her onto his lap, pinched her cheek, and smiled. "You're the strongest, so you get to be the pioneer for your sisters."

"Oh~ okay."

Yun Bao and the others had no objections—another round of observation suited them fine. Better to study the technique thoroughly than fumble through it unprepared.

Recalling Lian'er's movements, Wu Yingtao followed Qin Jiang's guidance and gradually found her rhythm. She glanced down at him, teeth pressing gently into her lower lip.

This really did feel wonderful.

Qin Jiang's hands steadied her waist, helping her keep pace. "How's it feel, Yingtao?"

"Not bad~" she said softly, her voice tinged with pleasure and slightly husky—irresistibly alluring.

But less than two hours in, Wu Yingtao slumped against Qin Jiang's chest. First time doing this, after all. Despite her formidable strength, inexperience cut the session short.

Qin Jiang caught her and let her rest against him. After a good while, he rubbed her head. "Want to keep going, Yingtao?"

"Let the others have a turn," she said shyly.

She wanted to try again, but her sisters had been waiting long enough. She couldn't hog Qin Jiang all to herself.

"Alright." Qin Jiang pinched her cheek, kissed her lightly, and whispered, "Rest up. I'll come feed you later."

"Mm~"

Wu Yingtao pushed herself up from his chest and walked to the side. Her physique really was extraordinary—with serious effort, she could go three hundred rounds with Qin Jiang without issue.

As she stepped aside, Yun Bao approached. The women had apparently sorted out the order among themselves, saving Qin Jiang the trouble.

"My turn~" Yun Bao announced cheerfully.

She'd been reserved at first, but her true nature had emerged over time. Beyond being a glutton for treasures, she was a glutton in... other regards. Qin Jiang had lost count of how many treasures she'd devoured. Pixiu to the bone.

He beckoned, and Yun Bao launched herself at him, planting a kiss on his lips before grinning. "I'm hungry. You need to fill me up."

"Consider it done." Qin Jiang smacked her bottom lightly. "Let's begin."

"Mm, okay~"

After watching two demonstrations, Yun Bao picked it up quickly under Qin Jiang's assistance.

Meanwhile, the other women gathered around Wu Yingtao, peppering her with questions about tips and sensations. Their frank inquiries left Wu Yingtao red-faced and stammering until Liu Shuwan came to her rescue.

Liu Shuwan gave them a brief theoretical overview, then concluded: "As for how it actually feels—you'll just have to try for yourselves."

Their anticipation grew. They glanced at Qin Jiang and Yun Bao, then filed out of the room. Time dilation covered the entire chamber; however long Qin Jiang spent in there, they'd be waiting the same duration. Better to chat outside, where a few minutes of conversation would see the next person's turn arrive.

Watching them leave, Liu Shuwan settled beside Lian'er. Compared to Wu Yingtao, Lian'er's constitution was a touch more delicate. She was still recovering.

Liu Shuwan sat down and began gently massaging her. Lian'er scooted over and rested her head in Liu Shuwan's lap, beaming. "Thanks, Wan'er."

"Tired?"

"A little."

"That man has no sense of restraint. He's going to hurt someone."

Liu Shuwan shook her head, glancing at Lian'er's lips. "Let me help you with some aftercare."

"Sure~"
