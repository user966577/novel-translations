With all rewards claimed — and a fresh batch of supplies ordered from the system shop — Qin Jiang settled in to wait for the immortal-path laws to come to him.

In the meantime, he and his women spent several pleasant days together, testing the quality of the new merchandise. Qin Jiang found it very much to his liking. The women, for their part, were equal parts flustered and delighted as they played an elaborate game of chase through the Void Divine Temple.

For several days, Qin Jiang thoroughly enjoyed himself, and his women were in high spirits. Since they'd ganged up on him — and he'd refrained from going all-out — none of them were overly exhausted. Some even seemed to want more.

But just as they were rallying for a counterattack, the heavens shook.

Thunderous booms reverberated across the sky. Five ferocious auras, seething with murderous rage, locked onto the Chaos District.

"They're here."

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. He sprang from a tangle of pale limbs, dressed in a flash, and headed out. The women shot him resentful looks — the moment they'd been building toward, interrupted. Their frustration was palpable.

They rose and dressed quickly, most of them immortal-path cultivators — including Qing Chan, a True Immortal. Fueled by pent-up irritation, their collective aura was genuinely intimidating. They took to the sky ahead of Qin Jiang, cold gazes fixed on the five True Immortals' direction.

Qin Jiang followed at a leisurely pace, hanging behind them. He could feel the frustration rolling off them in waves. Unsatisfied women were a force of nature.

Dao Zhen, the Chaos Sect's forces, and An Xihe's subordinates also appeared, converging on Qin Jiang's position. Dao Zhen reached him first.

"How do we handle this?"

"One at a time. Kill them as they come."

Dao Zhen opened his mouth. His relationship with the other True Immortals was actually quite cordial, and under different circumstances, he might have tried to mediate. But the five of them were unlikely to listen to reason — not unless Qin Jiang was an Immortal King who could cow them into submission through sheer power. And on the surface, Qin Jiang was merely a...

Wait. When had he broken through to Great Emperor?

Dao Zhen stared. Just days ago, the man had been at Nine Tribulations Supreme. Even accounting for absurd talent, shouldn't a breakthrough require at least some time in seclusion?

He shook his head. 'This one defies all common sense.'

Great Emperor or not, it wouldn't intimidate five True Immortals. But Qin Jiang had the means to kill True Immortals. Meaning the five would attack, and the five would die. He glanced toward them with a trace of pity.

'Oh well. They're just colleagues. If they have to die so I can live, so be it.'

The five True Immortals shattered the trapping formation but didn't attack immediately. Instead, they communicated among themselves. They held An Xihe in high regard — dangerously so. But even that caution wouldn't stop them. The current balance of power had them on top, and if An Xihe broke through to Immortal King, that balance would be destroyed. Worse, there was bad blood between them. Once she ascended, retribution would follow. Against an Immortal King, they'd be helpless. They had to stop her breakthrough. Their positions — and possibly their lives — depended on it.

Qin Jiang noted their hesitation, then checked the Immortal King Killing Formation. He'd used some energy killing Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng, but he'd replenished it over the past few days by channeling his Taotie Divine Body. Enough to handle five True Immortals with room to spare.

Satisfied, he moved to Qing Chan's side. "Chan'er, leave the five True Immortals to me. You and Wan'er take the girls and deal with their subordinates."

Qing Chan nodded. She knew his trump card — five True Immortals wouldn't be a problem. Her role was protecting her sisters.

"One more thing — try to keep the immortal-path fighters' bodies intact. Don't damage them. I've got a use for them."

He'd been preserving the corpses of every immortal-path cultivator he'd killed. His wife Chu Hanyan was a puppet master — these bodies could be refined into puppets and their power absorbed. With enough immortal-path corpses, she might break through to the immortal path herself without even needing a law.

With everything arranged, the five True Immortals gathered their forces and advanced. Their auras erupted, and across Azure Cloud Heaven, immortal-path presences flared in response — subordinates answering the call, streaming toward the Chaos District.

"One, two... thirteen... twenty..."

Qin Jiang counted under his breath, eyes growing brighter with each arrival. Every single one of them was a treasure — their laws were useful, their corpses were useful, and the factions behind them could be absorbed.

"Jackpot."

Beside him, Dao Zhen's cheek twitched. Only Qin Jiang could smile like that when facing five True Immortals and nearly twenty Human Immortals. But glancing around at their own forces, the situation wasn't as lopsided as it appeared. And with Qin Jiang's trump card...

The enemy was walking into a slaughter.

Qin Jiang rubbed his hands together, barely able to contain himself. About two hours later, the enemy forces converged almost simultaneously, halting at the edge of the Chaos District. Their gazes fell first on Qing Chan and Dao Zhen.

The five True Immortals stood at the front, brows furrowed. During their imprisonment, they'd entertained many theories about what was happening — but never imagined they'd find these two here. Qing Chan and Dao Zhen had defected? They were helping An Xihe break through?

Didn't they remember what happened hundreds of thousands of years ago? They'd been part of the coalition that sabotaged An Xihe's first attempt. Severing someone's path to advancement was a grudge deeper than murder. How could that be forgiven?

If it were them, they'd never let it go.

Still, two True Immortals were two True Immortals. They had five. Five against two — the advantage was theirs.

As for the rest — Human Immortals, Great Emperors, a single Great Emperor named Qin Jiang — they were beneath notice.

Only True Immortals warranted their attention.
