Everyone in the group was at least a Great Emperor, aside from Qin Jiang and Dan Yu. Even at a leisurely pace, they reached the Central Regions in just two weeks.

Unlike the other domains, the Central Regions were sealed off. An enormous formation encompassed the entire territory, slowly siphoning spiritual energy from the surrounding domains. That was precisely what made it a cultivator's holy land.

"Whoever set up this formation—they were something else," Qin Jiang remarked.

The women all nodded. Linglong spoke up. "Supposedly, it was erected by a True Immortal who wanted to create a paradise for cultivation. But the formation angered the other domains, and their combined forces suppressed the True Immortal. Over time, the area within the formation evolved into a domain of its own."

"Suppressed? They didn't kill her?"

"No." Linglong shook her head. "True Immortals aren't so easily killed. The only time I've ever seen a Human Immortal fall was when you killed the Ghost Immortal."

"If she was suppressed, why wasn't the formation destroyed?" Qin Jiang asked.

Linglong shook her head again. "That, I don't know."

"Because they couldn't." Zi Fu cut in. "When that True Immortal was suppressed, she positioned herself directly at the formation's core—the eye of the array. Destroying the formation would require killing her, and the coalition had already exhausted themselves just to seal her. Killing her would have cost some of them their lives. In the end, they modified the formation slightly. It still draws spiritual energy from the other domains, but far more slowly—and the domains' natural recovery rates offset the drain. The matter was quietly dropped."

Zi Fu's knowledge ran deeper, befitting her background in one of the Demon Domain's three great powers. The Snake Race, even in the Central Regions, ranked among the very top.

"I see," Qin Jiang said, nodding. He glanced at Hu Xian'er—her background was no less impressive, but the little fox was blissfully oblivious. Catching his gaze, she beamed and shifted her ears into fox form, nuzzling his face. She knew exactly how to make him happy.

He rubbed her ears with a smile. "Let's go in."

The moment they crossed into the Central Regions, Black Dragon's massive face greeted them. "Hehe, Young Master, I've been waiting for you! Black Dragon greets all the Young Madams."

He was sharp enough to bow to the women—he knew how much Qin Jiang doted on them. Can't afford to slip up. Of course, beyond necessary courtesy, he didn't get too familiar. His one and only master was Qin Jiang.

"At ease. Take us to get settled."

"Rest assured, Young Master—your residence is all prepared! Plenty of room! Even with all the Young Madams, there'll be spare rooms to spare." Black Dragon grinned. He'd been told in advance how many people were coming and, knowing Qin Jiang's tendency to accumulate companions, had secured extra capacity. Sure enough, the party had already grown by one.

Chuckling to himself, Black Dragon led the way, deliberately slowing his pace so Qin Jiang could take in the Central Regions.

After a while, Zi Fu spoke up, her expression odd. "We're not heading to the Chaos District, are we?"

"The Chaos District?"

Qin Jiang looked at Black Dragon, who nodded. "Young Madam is correct—the residence I've prepared is in the Chaos District."

"The Chaos District. Sounds... special." Qin Jiang mused.

"Young Master, as perceptive as ever!" Black Dragon launched into his explanation. "The Chaos District is the only zone in the Central Regions without rules or order. Fists are the law—whoever hits hardest claims the biggest territory. Hehe, your residence? I punched my way to it."

Qin Jiang was unsurprised. Black Dragon lacked finesse but had brute force in spades. Give him enough power, and he'd thrive in a place like the Chaos District.

"That's accurate," Zi Fu confirmed. "The lawlessness is where the name comes from. But there's also a little-known secret about the Chaos District."

"Secret?" Qin Jiang's brow rose, a thought clicking. "Don't tell me the True Immortal who was sealed is right underneath it."

"My husband is so clever!" Zi Fu beamed. "Exactly! That True Immortal was sealed within the Chaos District. That's why any faction with real power avoids building there—after all, the True Immortal is still alive. Who knows when she might break free?"

"A True Immortal is sealed in the Chaos District?!" Black Dragon blanched. He was an outsider with no access to this kind of intelligence. Even among locals, only the upper echelon knew the full story.

"Young Master, I've made a mistake—the Chaos District is too dangerous!" he said, head bowed in self-reproach.

Linglong spoke up. "Our Heavenly Pill Palace has a residence in the Central Regions. We could go there."

"The Snake Race has one too," Zi Fu added.

"I think the Fox Race does too!" Hu Xian'er chimed in.

Qin Jiang waved them all off. "The Chaos District is fine. That True Immortal's been sealed for ages—she's not going to break free the moment we show up. Black Dragon, lead on."

"Yes, sir."

Before long, they entered the Chaos District's territory. The atmosphere shifted palpably—sinister gazes tracked their group from every shadow.

Qin Jiang chuckled. "Mo Mo, give them a little demonstration."

"Hehe, gladly~"

Mo Mo flicked her fingers. Tendrils of demonic energy lashed out in every direction. Screams erupted all around.

"Leave a few standing," Qin Jiang added quickly. "A demonstration needs witnesses."

Mo Mo nodded, recalled her energy, and dusted off her hands. "I like this place." Her eyes sparkled—she loved dark, wicked energy, and the Chaos District was steeped in it. If she could slaughter everyone here... The thought lit a glow of excitement in her eyes.
