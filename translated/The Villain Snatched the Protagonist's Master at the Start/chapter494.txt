In the room, Qin Jiang teased Wu Yingtao until she was drenched in sweat before finally relenting.

She lay in his arms, limp and breathless.

After she'd recovered a little, he spoke. "Yingtao, you have an older brother, right?"

"Mm-hmm." She wasn't surprised that he knew. With his position, looking into her background was a matter of a single word. The Wu family would have volunteered her information without being asked.

What did surprise her was that he'd brought up her brother unprompted. Had he noticed something?

She frowned, a hint of conflict in her eyes. Wu Tian had been hiding his strength, and she was the only one who knew. By all accounts, even if Qin Jiang had reviewed her file, he shouldn't have noticed anything unusual.

But if he asked directly, should she tell the truth?

On one hand, there was her brother -- the sibling who'd been with her through thick and thin. On the other, her future husband, who'd given her a cultivation method and awakened her bloodline. She weighed it silently. Even if she told Qin Jiang, he wouldn't harm her brother, would he? Besides, there was no point in hiding talent forever. Wu Tian couldn't even access decent cultivation resources.

Better to be open about it. Maybe Qin Jiang would see his potential and invest in him. With Huaxia's resources behind him, her brother's future would be limitless.

She decided that if Qin Jiang asked, she'd come clean. They were family now. There shouldn't be secrets.

"Has your brother been acting strangely lately? Almost like a different person?"

Her eyes widened. So he had noticed?

She nodded. "He really does seem like a different person. His talent used to be terrible, but now, out of nowhere, his cultivation has been soaring."

"Is it just his talent that changed? What about his personality?"

"His personality?" She thought carefully. "It has changed. Before, he was gloomy -- he'd hide in his room all day and barely step outside. But now he's confident, composed, and goes out regularly. I figured it was because his talent improved."

Qin Jiang's expression grew grave. Noticing his shift, Wu Yingtao felt a chill. "What is it?"

"Think about the before and after. Do they really seem like the same person?"

She compared her memories of the old Wu Tian with the current one. Aside from his face... everything was different.

A jolt of horror shot through her. Her brother -- was he still himself?

She'd never questioned it before, but now, with Qin Jiang's prompting, the discrepancies were glaring. The transformation was too dramatic. A sudden boost in talent could be explained by a lucky encounter, but a personality shift this extreme? That shouldn't happen. And if he'd been cooped up in his room all day, where would he have found such an encounter?

It was deeply unsettling.

She gripped his sleeve. "Do you know something?"

"I've found some things." He nodded, hesitated briefly, then said, "Actually, when I chose you, I sent people to investigate your background."

"As you should." She didn't mind. Someone in his position couldn't choose a companion carelessly.

"During the investigation, we found anomalies with your brother."

"What anomalies?"

"Do you know what possession is?"

"Possession?" Her eyes went wide. As a cultivator, she certainly knew the term. When powerful beings died, their primordial spirits could linger. The more malevolent ones would seize another person's body to resurrect themselves.

Had her brother been possessed?

Reflecting on Wu Tian's changes, it seemed increasingly plausible.

"My brother was... possessed?" Her voice trembled.

She'd always been the one caring for Wu Tian, but he was still her flesh and blood. If something had happened to him, she couldn't just shrug it off.

Qin Jiang sighed softly, holding her and patting her back. "It's a possibility. But we can't rule out that your brother genuinely had a breakthrough -- gained some fortuitous encounter that boosted his talent and confidence, resulting in the personality change."

His words were meant to comfort, but Wu Yingtao found the alternative almost impossible to believe. The most likely explanation was possession.

Which meant Wu Tian had already been killed. The person walking around in his body was someone else entirely. Not her brother.

She'd virtually convinced herself, though a sliver of doubt remained. She still needed confirmation.

If Wu Tian truly had been possessed, she would avenge him.

"Is there a way to confirm it?"

Qin Jiang frowned and shook his head. "It's hard to verify. The one method is to examine his primordial spirit -- I've encountered a possession victim before, and the spirit and body didn't match. But to see someone's primordial spirit, you'd either have to destroy their physical body -- which obviously isn't an option -- or get their consent. Most people wouldn't refuse a simple examination, unless they had something to hide."

In truth, the primordial spirit was a closely guarded secret for any cultivator. It was more vulnerable than the physical body and easier to tamper with, so few would casually allow inspection.

But under Qin Jiang's guidance, Wu Yingtao reasoned that if her brother had nothing to hide, letting his own sister examine his primordial spirit should be no big deal.

If he refused, it meant he was guilty.
