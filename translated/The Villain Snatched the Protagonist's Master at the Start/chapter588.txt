Meanwhile, Zhao Sheng had returned to the Zhao family with Liu Xing.

The Zhao family's strongest member was Zhao Sheng himself—a mere Human Immortal. A faction of this caliber was beneath notice in the Heavenly Domain, relegated to some forgotten corner. Still, in their little neck of the woods, they were considered a prominent family. Within a few hundred miles, only one other family could rival them—headed by another Human Immortal, though one far older than Zhao Sheng, having held that rank for tens of thousands of years.

Originally, that elder had been the local powerhouse. But as Zhao Sheng broke through, the other family's standing had plummeted, falling below the Zhao family. After all, Zhao Sheng was extraordinarily young—only a few centuries old. His future undoubtedly held a breakthrough to True Immortal, perhaps even Immortal King. This naturally bred hostility from the rival family, directed at Zhao Sheng and the entire Zhao clan, with constant provocations both overt and subtle.

Zhao Sheng bore it stoically. He didn't want conflict—it would inevitably cost his family. But there was another reason for his restraint: the other patriarch's daughter.

They'd met once, in passing. Not a word had been exchanged, but Zhao Sheng had fallen for her at first sight. And she, it seemed, had noticed him too. When he'd been breaking through to Human Immortal, her family had tried to interfere—and she was the one who'd stopped them, allowing his breakthrough to succeed.

Because of her, he kept yielding in disputes, even conceding advantages to her family. All for that one woman. Unfortunately, they still hadn't spoken a single word to each other, and her father would never willingly allow them to be together.

Zhao Sheng's plan was to wait until he'd broken through to True Immortal, then formally propose. At that point, the old man wouldn't dare refuse.

But that was a matter for another time.

For now, Liu Xing was touring the Zhao family estate with Zhao Sheng. The clan treated their patriarch with deep respect—members bowed from a distance at the sight of him. After covering nearly every corner of the compound, Zhao Sheng looked a bit embarrassed.

"Liu-ge, the place is a bit humble. I hope you'll bear with it."

"Not at all—it's nice." Liu Xing smiled easily.

Zhao Sheng relaxed. "I've already ordered a banquet prepared in your honor. It should be ready by now. Shall we head over?"

"Sounds good." Liu Xing nodded. "I'd love to see what talent the Zhao family has. Don't disappoint me."

"You flatter us. We're just a small family. Even our most gifted members probably wouldn't catch your eye."

"Come on. Your talent, Zhao Sheng, would rank among the best in the entire Heavenly Domain."

Liu Xing clapped him on the shoulder.

The two made their way to the banquet hall, chatting and laughing. Nearly every member of the Zhao family was in attendance—a testament to how seriously Zhao Sheng took his guest. They all knew Liu Xing was a True Immortal, which earned him considerable respect and made them proud that their patriarch had such a powerful friend.

During the feast, Zhao Sheng arranged for the clan's promising young talents to show off. Liu Xing praised them generously, though secretly, he was a bit disappointed. No beauties worth mentioning among the Zhao clan. Had there been one, he could've introduced her to the Manor Lord and scored another merit point. But the pickings were slim—nothing that would meet the Manor Lord's standards.

Just then, an elder sidled up to Zhao Sheng with a teasing grin. "Patriarch, now that we have Lord Liu's help, maybe it's time to go propose?"

"Ahem—Elder, please don't joke about that." Zhao Sheng's cheeks reddened as he waved the suggestion away.

Still, he couldn't help glancing at Liu Xing. The thought had crossed his mind. He desperately wanted to be with her, but who knew how long it would take to reach True Immortal? If Liu-ge could help...

"Propose?" Liu Xing's interest was piqued. He turned to Zhao Sheng with a raised brow. "You're looking to propose?"

"No, no—" Zhao Sheng shook his head hastily.

Liu Xing grinned and pressed on. "You've got someone you fancy?"

"Well..."

Zhao Sheng squirmed, embarrassed. The elder, impatient on his patriarch's behalf, jumped in to explain the situation.

When Liu Xing heard that the two had met only once and never even spoken, his interest intensified. This could be a major opportunity.

"Got a portrait?" he asked.

The elder looked at Zhao Sheng, who sheepishly scratched his head, then carefully produced a scroll. He unrolled it gently and laid it before Liu Xing.

Liu Xing's eyes lit up. This woman was something else. Another big score! Of course, portraits could be flattering. He'd need to verify in person—if he recommended her to the Manor Lord and she turned out to be a disappointment, that merit would become a demerit real quick.

"Nice taste, Zhao Sheng." Liu Xing grinned.

Zhao Sheng gazed at the portrait, a hint of longing in his eyes. Hearing Liu Xing's teasing, he blushed. "I just... like her."

"Does she like you back?"

"I don't know." Zhao Sheng shook his head.

The elder chimed in, "She definitely does! Why else would she have stopped her family from interfering with your breakthrough?"

"A match made in heaven." Liu Xing laughed.

Whether or not the girl liked Zhao Sheng was irrelevant, of course. With the Manor Lord's abilities, once he set his sights on a woman, she'd end up in his collection one way or another.

"How about I go with you to propose?" Liu Xing offered.

Zhao Sheng hesitated. He truly did want to be with her sooner rather than later, but ideally through his own merits.

"Liu-ge, that's alright. I'd rather earn her family's approval on my own."

Determination flashed across his face. Liu Xing clapped his shoulder encouragingly.

"Good man—that's the spirit! But let me at least vet her first. You don't mind, do you?"

"Not at all." Zhao Sheng shook his head quickly, grinning. "I know you're looking out for me, Liu-ge."

"Great." Liu Xing chuckled. "I'll check her out when I get the chance. If she passes muster, I'll throw my full support behind getting you to True Immortal as fast as possible."

"Thanks, Liu-ge."
