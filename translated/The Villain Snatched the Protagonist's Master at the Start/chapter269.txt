Aboard the traveling palace, Qin Jiang was studying a scroll—the Human Dao Sect's supreme cultivation method, a gift from Chen Baizhe.

"Dao Follows Nature. Interesting."

Beside him, Chen Baizhe propped her chin on her hand, smiling. "If you're interested, why not focus on our sect's method? Dao Follows Nature is incredibly profound—even I haven't fully grasped it."

Qin Jiang shook his head, a faint smirk forming. "This method isn't for me."

Dao Follows Nature was predicated on desirelessness—sitting above the world, watching events unfold, and letting all things take their natural course. Qin Jiang was the opposite. He wanted to seize everything. Change everything.

"But I do have a method that seems quite similar." He reached into his storage ring and produced another scroll, handing it to Chen Baizhe.

"Heart Sutra?" She unrolled it and was immediately absorbed. After a while, she looked up, her eyes bright with excitement. "Qin Jiang, there's so much here worth studying. Many concepts overlap with Dao Follows Nature."

The two methods weren't identical, but they shared numerous underlying principles.

"Though it seems... incomplete," she noted.

He nodded. "It is. My mother created it, and she's still refining it."

"Your mother?" Chen Baizhe was startled. Creating a cultivation method wasn't particularly difficult, but to create one on par with Dao Follows Nature required the genius of a sect founder. The Heart Sutra was lower in grade, but she could see its limitless potential. If completed, it might match or even surpass Dao Follows Nature. Qin Jiang's mother must be extraordinarily gifted—no wonder she'd produced such an exceptional son.

As she marveled, Qin Jiang slid over and wrapped an arm around her waist, grinning. "The correct form of address isn't 'your mother,' you know. You should be calling her Mom too."

"I..." Her cheeks flamed. Given their relationship, she really should use the same term. But it was so embarrassing.

She lowered her head, unable to meet his eyes. He chuckled and held up the Dao Follows Nature scroll. "I was thinking—Mom could probably learn from this too. Would it be alright if—"

"Then give it... give it to our... our Mom." Her voice was barely a whisper. By the end, her face was the color of sunset, the blush spreading all the way to her earlobes.

Qin Jiang blinked, then pretended not to have heard, a teasing glint in his eye. "What was that?"

"You..." She looked up and pouted, seeing right through his act. "Never mind if you didn't hear."

She reached for the scroll. Qin Jiang immediately handed it over.

"..."

Holding it, she gave him a reproachful look. She'd been hoping to use this as a gift for her mother-in-law, and this rascal just wanted to tease her. She hesitated, then bit her lip and thrust the scroll back at him.

"You... you give it to our Mom."

This time her voice was slightly louder. As for the word itself—she actually quite liked saying it. Just a bit shy.

Qin Jiang took the scroll, noted the warning look in her eyes, and decided not to push his luck. He nodded with a smile. "Alright. I'll tell Mom it's a gift from Baizhe."

Though he'd left the Heavenly Mystery Continent, he maintained regular contact with home. He couldn't send physical items, but he could relay the contents of Dao Follows Nature. His mother had standing orders: every time he added a new wife, she was to be informed. Given Qin Jiang's efficiency, the updates were frequent, and every single time, his mother would ask if any of the girls were showing yet. She was done raising her own kids and eager for grandchildren.

Unfortunately, Qin Jiang wasn't ready for fatherhood. He hadn't sown enough wild oats yet—parenthood could wait. So every time, he simply... dealt with the matter before it became an issue.

The two were still flirting when a knock came at the door, followed by Qing Chan's voice: "Baizhe, old man Dao Zhen wants to see you."

"The ancestor?" Chen Baizhe blinked.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, released his hold, and took her hand. "Let's go. I'll come with you."

They stepped outside. Dao Zhen and Dao Kun were waiting below the palace—and Dao Kun's face was covered in fresh bruises. Someone had beaten him up.

"Teacher, your face..."

"Ahem." Dao Kun covered his cheeks with a sheepish cough. "Bumped into something."

Dao Zhen shot him a look, then turned to Qin Jiang and Chen Baizhe. He was about to speak when he noticed the scroll in Qin Jiang's hand. It looked distinctly like the Human Dao Sect's supreme method.

His face twitched.

He'd actually come to probe whether there was any crack in the couple's relationship he might exploit. If things were even slightly rocky, a well-placed nudge might break them apart. But now—

The foolish girl had already given away their most sacred technique.

How was he supposed to work with that?

Dao Kun spotted the scroll too, his eyes nearly popping. "Is that... Dao Follows Nature?"

"This?" Qin Jiang raised the scroll and waved it casually. "Sure is. Baizhe is the Human Dao Sect's designated successor—she has the authority to share Dao Follows Nature, doesn't she?"

Dao Zhen and Dao Kun's mouths twitched in unison. Technically, yes. As her Dao companion, studying the sect's method was within bounds. But the man was Qin Jiang.

More importantly, this confirmed what they'd feared. Baizhe was completely, irreversibly devoted. She'd handed over the sect's supreme method without a second thought. Any scheme to separate them was dead on arrival.

"So, what did you want Baizhe for?" Qin Jiang pressed.

Dao Zhen and Dao Kun exchanged a glance. They'd had a purpose, but it was moot now. Dao Zhen cleared his throat. "Nothing in particular. Just heard that you and Baizhe were together, so I came to take a look."

"Just to look?"

"???"

"Brother Dao Zhen, this is a big occasion—Baizhe and I getting together. Surely there should be some kind of... gift?"

Dao Zhen's expression blackened. You want to take and eat? Their most precious talent was already gone, and now he wanted presents too?
