The White Fox Tribe.

Hu Xian'er led Jian Yao to their little herb garden. It was home to a variety of spirit medicines, but the star attraction stood at the center—a three-colored flower swaying gently in the breeze, casting soft luminous halos in every direction.

An immortal herb.

It was called the Three Dawn Miracle Bloom, and it possessed the power to temper the body. Legend held that consuming it could forge an immortal physique—indestructible, impervious—and grant eternal youth. That last benefit alone was enough to make any woman's eyes burn with desire.

Even Jian Yao's gaze grew noticeably hotter.

She took a steadying breath and turned to Hu Xian'er, frowning as she scanned the surroundings. No protective formations. No barriers. Not even a fence.

In fact, some little foxes had been romping around the garden before their arrival.

And the garden itself sat in plain view behind the White Fox Tribe's main settlement, completely unhidden. Anyone who wandered in could spot the Three Dawn Miracle Bloom within minutes.

"You don't have any security around the immortal herb?"

Hu Xian'er blinked. "We do! These little foxes guard it all the time."

Jian Yao looked at the foxes in question. One of them was at the Qi-Blood Realm.

She was at a loss for words.

That was "security"?

Mentally filing that under "not my problem," she didn't bother pressing the point. Qin Jiang would take the Bloom when he arrived anyway.

She had just opened her mouth to say something when her brow quirked. Her gaze shot toward the valley's entrance, and a glint of interest flashed in her eyes.

"We have visitors."

"Visitors?" Hu Xian'er looked puzzled, following Jian Yao's gaze. "We don't really have friends..."

Before she could finish, a massive barrier slammed down over the entire White Fox Tribe.

Three figures appeared in the sky above.

Hu Xian'er's expression went blank. 'Those are the friends?'

She looked at Jian Yao nervously. "Big sister, they..."

"They're here for the herb."

Hu Xian'er's face darkened, genuine anger rising. 'We didn't bother anyone! Why does everyone want to rob us?'

Three tremendous auras swept across the tribe, their Primordial Spirit Power scouring every corner—clearly searching for the herb's location. Killing intent laced the probing energy, setting every little fox in the valley trembling.

Hu Xian'er's brows knitted tight. She could sense three Emperor-level cultivators. Two were roughly her equal, but the third...

An Ancient Emperor. Stronger than her.

She turned to Jian Yao with pitiful eyes. "Big sister, I can't beat them."

"I'll handle it."

Jian Yao raised her head, sword already in hand. Three Emperor-path weaklings? In her eyes, they were no different from ants.

At the same moment, the Tang Patriarch's group spotted the herb garden below and locked onto the Three Dawn Miracle Bloom immediately.

"An immortal herb—the Three Dawn Miracle Bloom!" The Patriarch's face lit up. Just as Tang Yin had described: a physique-enhancing immortal herb, perfectly suited for the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's princess.

Secure the herb, deliver it to the Celestial Rabbit Tribe, and their Immortal protector would be assured.

"Seize the herb first!"

At his command, one Great Emperor dove toward Hu Xian'er while the other rocketed toward the Bloom. As for Jian Yao—they didn't even register her presence.

As the two hurtled downward, Hu Xian'er paled. Then—

A single sword cry pierced the air, and time itself seemed to freeze. The two charging Great Emperors lurched to a halt mid-flight, their eyes filling with absolute terror.

The next instant—

"AHHH!!!"

Agonized screams ripped through the valley. Blood rained from the sky as both Great Emperors were cleaved clean in half, their bodies plummeting to the earth.

Above, the Tang Patriarch watched the carnage unfold and his face twisted in horror. He finally noticed Jian Yao—but it was already too late. Before he could move, an eerie sword light materialized inches from his face.

His eyes glazed over.

Blood dripped from his body as the Tang Patriarch fell from the sky.

No life force remained.

"There we go," Jian Yao said, sheathing her sword.

Hu Xian'er hadn't even processed what happened. From the moment Jian Yao drew to the moment she finished—one breath. Three Emperor-level cultivators, annihilated.

'So strong!'

She stared at Jian Yao, eyes sparkling with adoration. "Big sister, you're amazing!"

"Below Immortal, all are ants," Jian Yao said coolly.

Hu Xian'er pouted. 'Doesn't that make me an ant too?'

How rude.

Ignoring the fox girl's sulking, Jian Yao raised a hand, shattering the barrier with a casual gesture. Her gaze drifted to a specific spot in the distance. There was a little ant out there—Tang Yin.

But Qin Jiang had said to leave him be for now. As the women around him grew in number, Qin Jiang had become more economical—after all, it took an enormous amount of resources to help them all keep pace. Children of Destiny were the best source of those resources. Every last drop had to be squeezed out.

This Tang Yin, however, seemed rather... low-value. Probably not much juice to extract.

Qin Jiang's real focus remained on Chen Changsheng—a leek so thick and green it was worth more than every other Child of Destiny he'd encountered combined. If he could harvest that one thoroughly, the rewards would be staggering.

Outside the White Fox Tribe.

Tang Yin's face was twisted with rage as he fled at full speed. He'd seen everything. His own father, plus two Great Emperors—all killed without so much as a chance to fight back.

An Immortal. It had to be.

"How? How could the White Fox Tribe have an Immortal cultivator?!"

He didn't dare stop or even leak a trace of his aura, terrified that the Immortal would give chase.

He ran and ran, until finally he couldn't run anymore. Looking back over his shoulder, his entire body trembling, he clenched his fists.

"Father... I will avenge you!"

*Oink oink oink...*

A chorus of grunting erupted around him.

Tang Yin's expression froze. In his blind panic, he'd run straight into unfamiliar territory.

The ground shook. A horde of wild boars emerged from the underbrush, hundreds of them, their beady crimson eyes fixed on the intruder.

"Damn it!"

Tang Yin cursed. His time in the Demon Domain had taught him one cardinal rule: never, ever mess with wild boars. They were powerful, numbingly stupid, fiercely territorial, and attacked intruders on sight. Their herds numbered in the thousands—even Great Emperors steered clear.

*Oink oink oink!*

The boars bellowed at Tang Yin, and as his face drained of color, a stampede of fat, furious beasts charged straight at him.
