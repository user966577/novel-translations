Qin Jiang followed Murong Qing's gaze and found her staring at the Blood Tribe's Human Immortal elder. The man's face stiffened as a wave of unease rose in his chest.

"Is that him?" Qin Jiang asked.

Murong Qing nodded, killing intent flickering in her eyes. "He's the one who proposed expelling Yueyue."

The elder's face drained of color. He could plainly sense the murderous edge in her voice. She wanted him dead. On her own, she was no threat, but she was standing next to a man who killed as easily as breathing.

"Well, don't just stand there," Qin Jiang said with a light laugh. "She's called you out. Step forward."

The elder's body trembled as he shuffled out from the group. Looking at Qin Jiang, he forced a stiff smile and bowed. "Greetings, Manor Lord Qin."

"Oh, no need for formalities." Qin Jiang waved dismissively. The man was already dead—no point in standing on ceremony.

The elder straightened, still shaking. Under Qin Jiang's gaze, he felt like a corpse being measured for a coffin. 'He's not really going to kill me, is he? I proposed the expulsion, sure, but the chief made the final decision. And Xue Yue wasn't even harmed.'

"Pick how you want to die," Qin Jiang said.

The elder flinched, staring in disbelief. Just like that? Not even time to process?

"Manor Lord Qin, you—you can't do this! I've served the Blood Tribe faithfully, I've bled for the Blood Tribe--"

"What does the Blood Tribe have to do with me?"

Silence. The elder's mouth hung open. Right. The Blood Tribe meant nothing to Qin Jiang. He turned to the chief, desperate. He'd served loyally, bled for the tribe—surely the chief would intervene? The chief was Qin Jiang's father-in-law, after all. His words had to carry some weight.

"Chief!"

But the chief kept his head bowed, saying nothing. He was still reeling from the True Spirit Slave Seal. Even if he spoke, Qin Jiang wouldn't listen. He was a slave now. His opinions were irrelevant.

"Chief!" The elder raised his voice, but the chief remained silent. The other Blood Tribe powerhouses kept their heads down too. Against a force they couldn't beat—not even a fraction of a chance—what was there to say? If they'd had any alternatives, they wouldn't have expelled Xue Yue in the first place.

The elder looked around. No one would meet his eyes.

Finally, he turned back to Qin Jiang with a bitter smile, understanding that escape was impossible. He took a deep breath.

"If Manor Lord Qin wants me to choose how I die, then... I'd like to know—how strong are you, exactly?"

His aura erupted, surging with everything he had, eyes locked on Qin Jiang. If he was going to die, dying at the hands of Huaxia's lord was at least something worth remembering.

Interest flickered across Qin Jiang's face. He was itching for a fight. His cultivation had nearly reached True Immortal level—handling a Human Immortal was child's play. He nodded with a grin. "Alright. I'll grant you that."

Both shot into the sky simultaneously. Human Immortal-level battles were destructive enough that neither wanted to fight near the Blood Tribe's territory. They climbed tens of thousands of feet before stopping.

The elder took a deep breath, suppressing his fear, and let out a booming laugh. "To fight Huaxia's lord—this life wasn't wasted! Come!"

He attacked first. With nothing left to lose, this would be his final blaze of glory. Every ounce of power surged through him, burning reserves he'd never tapped. For the first time in his life, he felt truly powerful.

Then Qin Jiang raised his palm and flicked.

The elder flew backward, stumbling to regain his footing, gaping in shock. They were both Human Immortals. He'd gone all out, pushed himself to the breaking point—and Qin Jiang had swatted him away with a casual wave, barely swaying from the impact.

'Am I really this weak?'

"Again." Qin Jiang's eyes gleamed with battle lust. He so rarely had the chance to fight that he hadn't realized just how strong he'd become. Today was the perfect test.

The elder clenched his fists, steadied his breathing, and charged. This time, Qin Jiang moved too—a blur that appeared inches from the elder's face, followed by a blow of devastating force that shattered his defenses instantly.

The elder flew backward again. Qin Jiang chased after him, grinning, and unleashed a relentless barrage. The elder's counterattacks were meaningless—the Taotie Divine Body absorbed every shred of energy and converted it into fuel for Qin Jiang's own strikes.

He beat the elder around the sky like a punching bag. Within minutes, all resistance ceased. The elder slammed into the ground, a broken crater forming beneath him.

Qin Jiang landed beside him. The elder couldn't stand. He was drenched in blood, eyes wide, staring upward. He'd wanted a glorious last stand, a grand finale. Instead, he'd been a human punching bag. The humiliation was worse than the pain.

He struggled to rise, but his body had nothing left. Blood and organ fragments seeped from the corners of his mouth. For an Immortal, these injuries weren't fatal—but they were devastating.

Qin Jiang stepped forward. The Myriad Dao Stone materialized in his palm. He activated it, and a wave of power enveloped the elder. The man's body locked up. Searing agony ripped through him, twisting his face, tearing a howl from his throat.

Qin Jiang watched impassively as the elder's law power was drawn out. When it was done, the elder's aura had faded to almost nothing. Qin Jiang delivered a casual palm strike, ending his life.

From start to finish, not a single Blood Tribe member dared to speak. They watched Qin Jiang with fear bordering on reverence. The sight of a Human Immortal's law power being ripped from his body chilled them to the bone.

In their eyes, Qin Jiang was nothing less than a demon.
