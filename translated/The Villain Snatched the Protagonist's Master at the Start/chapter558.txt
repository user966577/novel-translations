Over the next few days, more Skyreach City lords began arriving—tricked into... invited over.

Each one's first experience upon arrival was a dose of the True Spirit Slave Seal.

But when Qin Jiang had enslaved over a dozen more Immortal Kings, he noticed that Skyreach City lords were still streaming in.

How many had they invited?

After enslaving yet another one, he turned to the gathered city lords with a frown. "How many people did you trick—ugh, how many did you invite?"

"Master, we followed your instructions and invited ten or so."

"That's right—I invited ten."

"I invited nine."

"I went a little overboard—thirteen."

"I only invited eight."

Qin Jiang's face darkened as they continued boasting. Each of them had invited ten or so. He'd meant ten or so total. With every one of them doing it independently, the grand total was pushing a hundred.

He didn't even have enough True Spirit Slave Seals.

Still, they were already here. He could hardly send them back.

Taking a deep breath, Qin Jiang retreated to the Space-Time Temple to craft more seals at a frantic pace.

One month later.

Qin Jiang stared at the hundred-plus Immortal Kings arrayed before him and sighed. Had they made too much noise?

To make matters worse, the later arrivals wanted to invite their friends too. At this rate, he'd have every Skyreach City lord in the Heavenly Domain under his thumb.

Shaking his head, he waved them off. "Keep ten with me. Everyone else, return to your cities."

Ten would serve as his personal retinue. The rest would go back to their Skyreach Cities—both to avoid detection and to generate resources from their positions. Under Qin Jiang's orders, the top ten were quickly selected. The others were disappointed, sensing that staying with Qin Jiang might offer better prospects, but they'd lost the competition. They'd have to settle for logistics and resource gathering.

After dispatching the city lords, Qin Jiang prepared to leave and officially enter the Heavenly Domain proper.

But just before his departure, Tieshan approached him with an unexpected request—he wanted to be enslaved. His tone was resolute.

"You're sure?"

Tieshan nodded without hesitation. "I'm sure. Young Master Qin, I want to be permanently loyal to you. Please grant this request."

It wasn't that he was eager for it. But among all the city lords, he was the only one without a seal. The others were already eyeing him with hostility. He worried they might conspire against him someday—set a trap and have him killed.

Moreover, while he was technically Qin Jiang's confidant, he'd always be on the outside compared to the sealed lords. Qin Jiang would never fully trust him. And if the other lords ever slandered him unanimously, Qin Jiang might well go along with it and eliminate the odd man out.

So Tieshan volunteered.

"Alright." Qin Jiang produced a True Spirit Slave Seal and patted his shoulder. "Tieshan, even without the seal, you'd still be my confidant. But since you've asked, I won't refuse."

"I understand." Tieshan gave a strained smile.

The seal shot into his mind. He didn't resist, and within moments, the True Spirit Slave Seal had taken hold. Opening his eyes, Tieshan breathed a sigh of relief. Now he truly belonged.

"Good. Stay at Skyreach City. It's time for me to leave."

Tieshan nodded, then hesitated. His gaze flickered to Qin Jiang and he said quietly, "Master... Mu Lan—I hope you'll treat her well."

Qin Jiang's smile cooled. "That's not your concern." His voice carried a faint chill, and a flicker of displeasure crossed his eyes. The roleplay scenarios he and Mu Lan enjoyed might reference Tieshan for a bit of spice, but the man himself had no standing to comment. He was a subordinate—nothing more.

Feeling his master's displeasure, Tieshan stiffened and immediately dropped to one knee. "Forgive me, Master."

"Go back."

Qin Jiang didn't spare him another glance, boarding the immortal ship directly. Only after it had vanished into the distance did Tieshan rise. He took a deep breath, composing himself into the dignified city lord he'd always been, and returned to Skyreach City.

He had a feeling that the Heavenly Domain was about to get very interesting.

Meanwhile, on the lead ship, Qin Jiang frowned at a group kneeling before him. "Why haven't you dealt with them yet?"

He directed the question at Black Dragon. The captives were the people from the Level One Domain who'd tried to seize their ship upon arrival. The strongest among them were merely True Immortals—Black Dragon's group had subdued them instantly. Qin Jiang hadn't bothered dealing with them personally, just told Black Dragon to handle it.

Yet here they still were.

"Young Master, they claim to know the location of an Immortal Emperor secret realm."

Qin Jiang's eyebrow rose. Before he could even ask, the captives were already talking.

"My lord, we truly know of an Immortal Emperor secret realm! It was left by an ancestor from our domain. We came to the Heavenly Domain specifically for it!"

"You want to live?"

"Yes!" They nodded frantically, then added sheepishly, "We also hope you'll allow us to explore the realm alongside you."

"Heh. Sure."

An Immortal Emperor secret realm would hold considerable treasures, and more importantly, opening it would create a commotion—the kind that attracted Children of Destiny.

His expression softened slightly. "Lead the way."

"Yes!"

They scrambled to comply. The three immortal ships set course for the supposed Immortal Emperor secret realm.

Qin Jiang returned to the middle ship. Lounging with his women, he took in the scenery—which wasn't all that special, though the spiritual energy was considerably denser than back home. They were still at the Heavenly Domain's edge, and travelers were sparse.

Occasionally they encountered newcomers to the Heavenly Domain, but none dared challenge their fleet again. Instead, Black Dragon's group took the initiative—robbing them first, just to be safe.

Preemptive self-defense, as they saw it.
