Qin Domain!

The Qin Domain had undergone an earth-shattering transformation. Under the Qin family's leadership, every resource across the entire domain had been consolidated and distributed systematically, producing a massive surge in collective strength in a remarkably short time.

The key was a treasure map Qin Jiang had left behind, detailing the location of every fortunate encounter across the Qin Domain. Thanks to that map, the domain's development was booming.

The Qin family's power, in particular, was skyrocketing. Saints and Supremes were popping up like mushrooms after rain—practically every day brought another breakthrough. Most of the domain's major families and factions had fallen in line, and even the ancient clans dared not make a move after seeing the Qin family's trajectory.

Whenever the Qin family acted, the entire domain mobilized in concert.

Within the Qin family estate, the most desolate spot remained Reflection Cliff—the place designated for punishment. Per Qin Jiang's directive, the spiritual energy here was kept at its thinnest.

Even so, the current spiritual energy at Reflection Cliff was far richer than what it had been before.

Today, a breakthrough aura emanated from Reflection Cliff. Nearby cultivators sensed it and raised their eyebrows. 'Someone's breaking through at Reflection Cliff? Are they deliberately making it harder on themselves?'

Qin Hao, still serving as the Qin family's patriarch, felt the aura too. His brow furrowed. "That's Father's aura?"

He strode out and flickered to Reflection Cliff in an instant. "Father's been cultivating in seclusion at Reflection Cliff this whole time..."

When he'd first broken through to Saint, he'd asked after the old man, only to be told he was in seclusion. He hadn't pressed the matter—but he certainly hadn't expected his father to be holed up here of all places.

No wonder it had taken so long. Reflection Cliff's spiritual energy had plummeted during the initial redistribution and had only recently recovered to exceed its former levels. If the old man had secluded himself anywhere else, he'd have broken through ages ago.

Qin Hao himself had reached Saint Realm Great Perfection—one step from the Supreme Realm. He'd broken through to Saint not long ago, and the speed of his progression since then had been extraordinary.

"Hahaha! I've finally broken through to Saint!"

A booming laugh erupted from Reflection Cliff, thick with self-satisfaction.

Everyone who heard it rolled their eyes. Saints and Supremes were breaking through every day in the current Qin Domain. What was there to brag about?

The old man's Saint-level aura radiated outward without restraint, as if he wanted the entire world to know. A year ago, this might have earned some admiration. Now, it felt like watching a court jester take a bow.

Qin Hao's cheek twitched. He landed inside Reflection Cliff and appeared at the old man's side. "Dad. Keep it down."

"Oh, Hao'er!" The old man's eyebrow rose. He seemed to have no intention of reining in his aura whatsoever. He clapped Qin Hao on the shoulder, beaming. "Son, your old man's a Saint now too! I'm no worse than you. Oh—by the way, what realm are you? I can't seem to read you..."

"Dad, I'm already at Saint Realm Great Perfection."

"Great Perfection, huh? About the same as... wait, what?"

The old man's casual smile froze. His eyes went wide. "Saint Realm Great Perfection?!"

Seeing his father's shock, Qin Hao gave a resigned smile and nodded. He released his aura, effortlessly pressing the old man's energy back into his body.

Honestly, the old man's display was a bit embarrassing.

Feeling his son's overwhelming power, the old man's jaw dropped. After a long, stunned silence, he managed: "How long was I in seclusion?"

"A year and a half."

"A year and a half, and you jumped from early Saint straight to Great Perfection?"

The old man was incredulous. Qin Hao nodded. "Dad, times have changed."

"???"

'Times have changed?' No matter how much the times changed, cultivation shouldn't get easier. And he was living in the same era! Why hadn't he noticed any difference?

At that moment, a Supreme-level aura exploded from deep within the Qin estate.

The old man stared in that direction. "That aura... is that Father? He broke through to Supreme?"

"Yes. That's Grandpa," Qin Hao confirmed. "He started his seclusion a month ago. Breaking through to Supreme makes perfect sense."

"Makes sense?!" The old man sputtered.

One month. Supreme Realm. In what universe did that make sense?!

He had the sudden, disorienting sensation that the world around him had become unrecognizable.

Qin Hao glanced at his father, hesitated, then said, "Actually, if you'd secluded yourself anywhere else, you'd probably have broken through much sooner."

"What do you mean?"

"Reflection Cliff has the thinnest spiritual energy in the entire estate. The areas where the ancestral elders cultivate have energy dozens of times more concentrated than here."

The old man: "..."

He'd actually thought Reflection Cliff's energy was quite rich—especially now, noticeably better than before. And the ancestral cultivation areas had dozens of times more? 'Is this even the same Qin family?'

The Supreme aura subsided. These days, with Supremes everywhere, no one felt compelled to show off a breakthrough. After all, not everyone shared the old man's... enthusiasm.

The aura had barely faded before a figure appeared beside Qin Hao and the old man.

"Well, well—the brat actually broke through?"

The newcomer eyed the old man with an arched brow. It was Qin Jiang's great-grandfather.

"Father..."

The old man felt a bit hard done by. It had been his own father who'd ordered him to cultivate at Reflection Cliff, and that order was exactly why he'd wasted so much time.

He shot his father a resentful look. "Dad, didn't you know Reflection Cliff has the worst spiritual energy in the whole estate?"

The great-grandfather blinked. He genuinely had forgotten. Back when he'd sent his son here, the energy levels had been roughly uniform. It was only after Qin Jiang's redistribution that the disparity had grown massive. And then he'd simply... forgotten about his son.

It was the Supreme breakthrough that had reminded him the old man was still down here.

He coughed awkwardly. "Well, it's not that much worse. And you broke through just fine, didn't you?"

"Dozens of times worse..."

"Ah. So you heard about that."

The old man's face blackened. If this weren't his own father, he'd have seriously considered throwing punches.

Of course, he'd have lost.

"Anyway, you broke through. Water under the bridge." The great-grandfather waved it off and swiftly changed the subject, turning to Qin Hao. "How's the Qin Domain's development coming along?"

"Very well..."

Qin Hao launched into an update. The old man listened from the side, mouth agape.

'Times really have changed.'
