Her fierce gaze didn't faze Qin Jiang. Instead, what captured his attention most were her delicate jade feet.

Following his gaze, the woman lowered her head slightly. Her expression grew even icier.

"Lecher! You're courting death!"

Killing intent filled her voice.

Qin Jiang raised his head and looked at the woman's exquisite face, smiling faintly.

"Drop the act. If you could actually make a move, would you be spouting so much nonsense?"

At his words, the woman let out a cold snort.

Internally, she seethed with rage. Right now, she was only a soul form—and an extremely weak one at that. She'd secretly absorbed Xiao Fan's power for over a decade just to barely regain consciousness.

She'd originally planned to find an opportunity to reveal everything to Xiao Fan. With her help, his future path would certainly be smoother. And she'd hoped to use Xiao Fan's power to reconstruct her physical body.

She just hadn't expected that before she could reveal herself, Qin Jiang had snatched her away.

"You knew all along that I was hiding in the ring?"

The woman asked.

Qin Jiang nodded, his tone dismissive.

"Anyone with half-decent perception could have detected you. You're lucky the Xiao family had no real experts. Otherwise, secretly absorbing Xiao Fan's power like that would have gotten you killed long ago."

"Hmph!"

The woman snorted coldly.

Secretly absorbing Xiao Fan's power was indeed underhanded of her, but she had no choice. Without doing so, she would have dissipated entirely.

Besides, she was confident she could help Xiao Fan!

"Since you knew I existed and still took me, you must have a use for me, right?"

The woman's eyes flickered as she spoke.

Qin Jiang nodded.

"There is indeed something I need you for."

At this, the woman inwardly relaxed. She truly didn't dare make a move against Qin Jiang. Setting aside whether she even could—his status alone was enough to give her pause.

But if Qin Jiang needed something from her, that was negotiable.

"My family's ancestors have been pressuring me to carry on the family line. So I need your help with that."

Qin Jiang said with a smile.

Hearing this, the woman's expression—which had just begun to soften—instantly froze over. Her aura surged. Even as just a soul form, her presence was quite formidable.

Unfortunately, the system's year-long spoiler hadn't revealed her original strength.

All he knew was that she came from the Fire Tribe.

Nothing else.

But as long as she was within the Qin family, she couldn't possibly threaten him.

"If you keep flaring your aura like that and my ancestors come running, they might just tie you up and force you to bear children for me."

Qin Jiang teased.

The woman's delicate body stiffened. She understood the Qin family's power. Taking a deep breath, she slowly suppressed her aura.

"Give up on that idea. I will never love anyone."

The woman said coldly.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

"Who said carrying on the family line requires love? Heh. A forcefully snatched melon may not be sweet, but it still quenches your thirst. And there's a greater sense of accomplishment too."

"You..."

Hearing his words, she couldn't deny the panic rising within her.

If Qin Jiang really did force himself on her, she truly wouldn't be able to resist.

The woman's expression shifted between dark and light. Suddenly, something occurred to her. She let out a cold laugh.

"Heh. You're thinking about continuing your family line now, but before long, your Qin family might face a great catastrophe!"

"Oh?"

"When facing a supreme genius, you either befriend them or eliminate them. But you..."

The woman snorted lightly and said no more.

But Qin Jiang had already understood. He looked at her with a half-smile.

"This supreme genius you're talking about—it wouldn't happen to be Xiao Fan, would it?"

"Hm?"

The woman's face stiffened.

She stared at Qin Jiang, her eyes filled with uncertainty. She'd said those words only to instill some wariness in him. When he pressed for details, she could then bargain for some benefits.

But Qin Jiang had guessed it directly!

How was that possible?

In everyone's eyes, Xiao Fan was nothing but trash.

She'd assumed Qin Jiang thought the same. Otherwise, she couldn't understand why he would break off the engagement. After all, Xiao Fan was a supreme genius.

"The Fire Divine Body—that does qualify as supreme genius material."

Qin Jiang nodded.

The woman: "..."

She stared at Qin Jiang in disbelief.

"How did you know?"

Xiao Fan's Fire Divine Body hadn't actually awakened yet. She'd only discovered it by chance while absorbing his power over the years. Yet Qin Jiang had only interacted with Xiao Fan briefly—how could he have noticed?

Then why did he still break off the engagement?

A genius with a Divine Body—wouldn't it be wonderful to bring him into the Qin family?

The woman couldn't understand.

Moreover, Qin Jiang seemed to know everything. In her eyes, he was becoming increasingly mysterious.

"A Divine Body holder—yet you've made an enemy of him and let him continue to grow. Aren't you afraid he'll take revenge on the Qin family?"

The woman asked, confused.

Qin Jiang scoffed.

"It's just a Divine Body.

"You say that like nobody else has one!"

"You..."

The woman's beautiful eyes went wide.

"You also have a Divine Body?"

Qin Jiang smiled faintly.

"This humble one happens to possess a Divine Body as well."

And he was about to have a second one.

That last part he only muttered in his heart.

The woman was somewhat dazed. Were Divine Bodies this common nowadays?

She remembered that in her era, even the great ancient clans didn't have any Divine Body holders.

Now, having been awake for just a few days, she'd already encountered two.

"What Divine Body do you have?"

The woman couldn't help but ask.

Qin Jiang blinked and said earnestly, "Bear my children, and I'll tell you."

The woman's face darkened. Being around Qin Jiang gave her absolutely no sense of security.

Seeing the woman fall silent, Qin Jiang didn't say anything more.

He pointed at the ring.

"You can go back if you want. I only called you out to see what you looked like."

The woman gritted her silver teeth and glared at Qin Jiang. She hadn't been this angry in a very long time.

This bastard could infuriate her with just a few sentences.

"Also, I'm about to go into seclusion. Don't come out and disturb me. If anything happens to me, I'll definitely have my ancestors capture you, restore your body, and then make you bear me ten children!"

Ten children?

The woman stumbled, shooting Qin Jiang a hateful glare. Did this bastard think she was a pig?

With a cold snort, she retreated directly into the ring. Out of sight, out of mind.

Qin Jiang beckoned with his hand, returning the ring to his finger. He even gave it a light tap.

"Stop knocking on my door!"

The woman's voice rang out simultaneously.

Qin Jiang chuckled awkwardly and withdrew his hand. The ring really was like her front door.

Taking a deep breath, Qin Jiang calmed his mind and adjusted his state.

After a while, once he'd properly prepared himself, he spoke silently.

"System, use Hidden Divine Body Awakening."

As his words fell, a dormant power within his body slowly began to emerge.

The spiritual energy around him seemed drawn by some force, converging toward Qin Jiang.
