The next morning, Qin Jiang opened his eyes to find Hu Xian'er nestled in his arms, beaming up at him.

"Xian'er?"

"Hee hee, surprise!" She giggled, hugging him tightly with both arms. Her little head shimmered, and a pair of fox ears popped out, softly brushing against his cheek.

Qin Jiang stared at her. This little fox really had him wrapped around her finger. He took a deep breath and suppressed the restless urge rising within him, though he couldn't resist reaching up to rub those fluffy ears. Then, looking at the contented expression on her face, he asked, "How did you get here? Did Wan'er and Yao Yao come too?"

"Yep!" Hu Xian'er's big eyes curved into happy crescents as she nodded. "And not just them—my daddy came too."

Qin Jiang froze. Her father? The man whose little girl he'd spirited away along with the entire White Fox Tribe—was he here to settle the score?

"What's your father's cultivation level?" Qin Jiang asked.

Hu Xian'er pressed close, savoring his warmth. She loved his scent. "Immortal," she answered breezily. "He's the Fox Race chieftain, too. Hee hee, I heard you're going to fight the Snake Race. With my daddy here, we'll crush them for sure!"

An Immortal. Qin Jiang winced internally. Not someone he could take in a fight.

He stood up, and Hu Xian'er clung to him like an octopus, refusing to let go. With a helpless shake of his head, Qin Jiang noticed Yu Lan still sound asleep nearby—exhausted from their previous night's exertions—and decided not to disturb her.

Carrying the little fox, he stepped out of the room and closed the door behind him. "Take me to your father."

"Okay!" Hu Xian'er pointed the way, one arm still hooked around his neck.

As they walked, Qin Jiang asked, "Are we really going to meet your father like this?"

"What's wrong?"

"I'm carrying his precious little girl. Won't he be upset?"

"Nah." Hu Xian'er shook her head confidently. "My daddy has the best temper. I've never even seen him get angry."

An Immortal-path cultivator and Fox Race chieftain with a good temper? Qin Jiang had his doubts. More likely, the man simply never got angry around Hu Xian'er. With a daughter this adorably naive, who could? But showing up with said daughter draped all over him might be a different story.

Still, with Hu Xian'er present, even an angry father-in-law would probably hold his temper.

"There! That courtyard." She pointed at a small compound.

The Fox Race chieftain had arrived at the Snake Race quietly, keeping a low profile. The Purple-Scale Serpent clan, aware of his connection to Qin Jiang, had kept things discreet.

Qin Jiang pushed through the gate without ceremony.

Instantly, a piercing gaze locked onto him. He looked back and saw a scholarly middle-aged man whose refined bearing reminded him of the Fourth Ancestor. But experience had taught Qin Jiang that outward demeanor and inner character rarely matched—the Fourth Ancestor being a prime example.

"Daddy!" Hu Xian'er called out cheerfully, still plastered to Qin Jiang's body. Being alone with him was a rare treat; she wasn't about to give it up.

The middle-aged man managed a strained smile, but the sharp edge never left his eyes.

"You're Qin Jiang?" His voice carried an unmistakable undercurrent of anger.

Qin Jiang nodded, walked over, and sat down directly across from the man, settling Hu Xian'er sideways across his lap. He met the Fox Race chieftain's glare with an easy smile. "Sir, as you can see, Xian'er has me a bit occupied, so you'll have to forgive me for not offering a proper bow."

The middle-aged man's face twitched. The posture did make bowing impractical, admittedly. But the thing occupying his hands was his little girl—the precious treasure he'd raised for thousands of years!

His fists clenched beneath the table. If Hu Xian'er weren't here, he would have been considerably less civil.

"Hee hee, Daddy doesn't care about those kinds of formalities," Hu Xian'er chimed in, her little feet swinging against Qin Jiang's leg. "Right, Daddy?"

The man drew a long, measured breath, then ground out through gritted teeth: "Right. No need for formalities."

Qin Jiang could tell from his clenched jaw that the man was anything but sincere. He smiled. "You came to the Snake Race specifically to see me, sir?"

The chieftain glanced at Hu Xian'er. What he actually wanted was to thrash this boy within an inch of his life. A playboy who'd stolen his innocent daughter—how could he swallow this? But with Hu Xian'er watching him adoringly, he couldn't very well start swinging. Might as well play along for now. His daughter was so guileless that fooling her would be child's play.

He nodded stiffly. "Of course. My daughter chose you. Naturally, her father should come take a look."

"And now that you've looked, sir? Any thoughts?"

"Aside from being handsome, utterly worthless."

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. Was that a compliment or an insult? Calling him worthless should have been offensive, but somehow he couldn't bring himself to be angry about it.

"Daddy! What are you talking about?" Hu Xian'er's round eyes narrowed at her father. She threw her arms around Qin Jiang's neck protectively. "You've barely met him! Qin Jiang is amazing!"

She couldn't think of any more specific praise, but she knew one thing for certain—Qin Jiang was incredible. She certainly couldn't beat him.

The chieftain's eye twitched. In all her years, his little girl had never talked back to him like this. And she was doing it for another man.

"Xian'er, he's your father. Show some respect," Qin Jiang said with a barely concealed smirk.

Hu Xian'er nodded obediently. "Oh, okay!"

Creak...

"Hm? What was that sound?" She looked curiously at her father.

Then, remembering Qin Jiang's words, she blinked and added, "Daddy, I'm sorry. Qin Jiang's right—I should be more respectful."

Creak, creak...

The chieftain was grinding his teeth so hard they were about to shatter. The apology itself was somewhat gratifying, but then she'd followed it up with "Qin Jiang's right"?

Fury surged through him. His fists trembled and his whole body shook with suppressed rage. For an Immortal-path cultivator to be pushed this far without exploding was genuinely impressive. Managing to hold it in was even more so.

He stared at Qin Jiang's innocent expression and Hu Xian'er's guileless face.

After a long, labored moment, he waved his hand irritably. "Fine. I've seen enough. You can go."

"Wouldn't you like to get to know me a bit better, sir?" Qin Jiang offered with a blink.

The chieftain's face darkened. Know him better? All he needed to know was that some smooth-talking punk had run off with his daughter. Everything else was irrelevant.
