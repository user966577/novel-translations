Three Children of Destiny — all dead. Qin Jiang felt oddly hollow. His toys were gone.

The next Child of Destiny could be anywhere, and his personal radar — well, his dear little sister — had apparently turned over a new leaf and was actually cultivating diligently for once. She hadn't been out scouting trouble for him at all. Once this business was wrapped up, he'd have to take Lian'er traveling to find the next one.

Just then, Liu Shuwan and Chen Baizhe lifted their heads from his arms, peering up at him. Liu Shuwan waved a hand in front of his face. "What are you thinking about?"

He snapped back, looked down at the two beautiful faces gazing up at him, and kissed each one. Arms around both, he grinned. "I was thinking — if you two teamed up, how many rounds could you last?"

Both women flushed scarlet, eyes flashing with indignant embarrassment. Their hands found his waist simultaneously and pinched.

"Scoundrel."

"Pervert."

They exchanged a glance, a competitive spark igniting between them. Each grabbed an arm and hoisted Qin Jiang toward home. How many rounds? They'd show him exactly what sisterly teamwork looked like. They'd leave him utterly spent. Not a drop left.

Unfortunately, the fantasy and the reality diverged dramatically.

One full day later, two women huddled beneath the blankets, shivering, arms wrapped around themselves, fixing Qin Jiang with deeply aggrieved stares. Indeed — not a drop left. Only it was them who'd been emptied. Qin Jiang, by all appearances, looked ready for another campaign.

The gap was simply too vast.

Qin Jiang shrugged. He was barely warmed up. But he wasn't one to push past the limit — a major battle was likely days away, and he couldn't have his women going into combat on wobbly legs.

Still, restraint didn't mean he was willing to sleep alone. He'd even been exiled to the floor. The three of them faced off — Qin Jiang staring unblinkingly at the pair, looking almost pitifully wronged.

Liu Shuwan and Chen Baizhe exchanged a glance, their resolve wavering. Those wounded-puppy eyes were simply too much.

After a hesitation, Liu Shuwan bit her lip and lifted the blanket. "Come back to bed."

Qin Jiang's face split into a grin. He vaulted in and wrapped his arms around her. "I knew my wife loved me."

"Idiot." She rolled her eyes.

Chen Baizhe snuggled in from the other side, and he gathered her up too. He kissed each of them on the cheek and said, "Alright, just rest. I'm not going to do anything — I just want to hold you."

Both women blinked. They'd steeled themselves for another round, only to hear... this?

"You don't want to...?" Chen Baizhe asked, bewildered.

Qin Jiang tweaked her nose. "I'm not an animal. You're both exhausted — do you think I'd enjoy myself knowing that? I came to bed because I want you in my arms. That's it."

He patted their shoulders. "Sleep. We're just resting together."

Holding their soft, warm bodies close — even without anything else, it felt wonderful. Both women's eyes shimmered with warmth.

"Okay."

They curled into him, too tired in body but not in spirit, content to simply gaze at his handsome face from the shelter of his arms. Before long, they drifted off.

Qin Jiang, however, closed his eyes and dove into the system interface. His rewards were still uncollected.

"System, transfer the fortune first."

【Done.】

A pause. "All transferred?"

【Yes.】

Fortune increases never came with any physical sensation. If not for the Qin family's growing prosperity and the existence of the Fortune Golden Dragon, he'd have suspected the system was skimming.

"Three Children of Destiny's worth of fortune... I wonder how my little golden dragon is doing."

【You can check.】

"For free?"

【...Yes.】

The system display conjured an image — the Fortune-Sealing Stele, and the golden dragon's lair within. But the sight that greeted him made Qin Jiang's eyes bulge.

"That's... my little golden dragon?"

A colossal dragon coiled atop the stele, snoring away. But its body was wreathed in plumes of thick black smoke.

He blinked. He distinctly remembered a little golden dragon. How had it become... whatever this was?

Inside the image, the sleeping dragon cracked one eye open, looking suspicious. It peered around, alert. 'Someone's watching me.' Its lantern-sized eyes swept the surroundings but found nothing. It scratched its belly with one massive claw, noticed the black smoke pouring off itself, and hastily shook its great head. The smoke dispersed, and golden scales shimmered back into place.

It muttered to itself: "Fell asleep and let the real form slip out. Good thing the master isn't here — he'd throw me out for sure..."

Qin Jiang heard every word. His brain short-circuited.

The golden form was fake? The adorable little golden dragon had been a disguise all along?

"System. Explain."

【That is your family's fortune incarnation.】

"Shouldn't it be a Fortune Golden Dragon? Why is it pumping out black smoke?"

【...】

"Don't tell me it's because of me."

【Ahem. I see the host has some self-awareness. It is indeed the Qin family's fortune, but given the family's... nature — which the Heavenly Dao categorizes as rebellious — the fortune has taken on a rebel's characteristics. Does the host understand?】

Qin Jiang's lips twitched. He watched the fortune dragon — now golden again, snoring peacefully — and asked, "So it's fortune that the Heavenly Dao abandoned."

【Not just abandoned. After being cast off, it became entangled with the Qin family's karma, resulting in... its current appearance.】

"Does a Fortune Black Dragon actually do anything?"

【Certainly. Abandoned or not, fortune is fortune. If the host continues hunting more fortune to feed it, there's a chance it could overthrow the Heavenly Dao's own fortune dragon entirely — devour it and take its place.】
