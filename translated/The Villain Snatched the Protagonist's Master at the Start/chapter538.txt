Seeing that the three True Immortal remnant souls had lost the will to live, Qin Jiang didn't bother with further words. He destroyed them with a single strike.

Without the remnant souls, the Chaos Sword was effectively half-crippled. But Yun Bao's father wouldn't be picky—everything was food to a Pixiu.

After dealing with the remnant souls, Qin Jiang turned his attention to Li Yang's corpse. A flick of his finger reduced it to nothing—annihilated, scattered to oblivion. Now, finally, Li Yang was truly dead.

He closed his eyes briefly to check the system rewards, and a smile spread across his face. A massive recovery in one haul.

Two Children of Destiny remained, and they were likely on par with Li Yang. Wu Tian might be worth even more, given his background. The rewards would be richer still.

With that settled, Qin Jiang bid Ye Xuan farewell and departed. Time to pay the next honored contributor a visit.

Both Nangong Yun and Wu Tian were in Mystic Cloud Heaven. He brought the women along and headed there directly.

Wu Tian was the more dangerous target, so he'd be saved for last. Nangong Yun came first.

Originally, Qin Jiang had planned to bring Mu Yunxiao, Yue Weiwei, and Xue Yue. But Nangong Yun's situation was... messy. Revolting, even. Qin Jiang barely wanted to go himself, let alone subject the women to it.

Going alone, he brought Black Dragon and Little Xu instead, sending them ahead as an advance team.

In a remote mountain valley, a cluster of small wooden cabins had been built—a crude village, to the casual observer. But screams echoed constantly from within, and every single voice was male.

From a distance, Qin Jiang looked at Black Dragon and Little Xu. Both men's mouths twitched, expressions pained. They didn't want to see this either.

In the end, Black Dragon stepped up. He'd already seen this sort of thing before.

"Young Master, I'll go clean things up."

"Heh, go ahead. I'll put it on your record after this is done," Qin Jiang said with a smile.

Black Dragon managed a smile uglier than a grimace. "Thank you, Young Master."

He took a deep breath, grabbed Little Xu, and marched toward the cabins.

"Hey, hey, hey! Why are you dragging me? I don't want to go!" Little Xu protested vehemently, even trying to slip into the Void. But Black Dragon held him fast—no chance of escape.

Even from dozens of yards away, the shouts from inside the cabins were audible. Black Dragon dragged Little Xu forward, then with a mighty heave, hurled him straight at one of the cabins.

"What the—! You bastard, Black Dragon!" Little Xu roared as he crashed through the wall.

All sound inside ceased for a split second. Then Little Xu let out a wail and burst back out. "AHHH! My eyes! They're dirty!!!"

Black Dragon appeared behind him, seized him, and flung him at a different cabin.

"You motherf—" Little Xu's profanity-laden shriek was cut short as he transformed into his true form mid-flight—the massive Void Beast crashed down, demolishing every cabin in the valley.

Hundreds of naked men lay exposed in the wreckage.

Little Xu scrambled up, eyes screwed shut, and dove into the Void. "BLEGH—Black Dragon, you're dead! BLEGH—I'm gonna be sick, you son of a—!!!"

He retched and cursed simultaneously as he vanished. Black Dragon watched him go with a helpless sigh. No catching him now.

Which meant this mess was his to clean up.

He surveyed the scene. Several hundred men, most of them round-faced, crew-cut, and heavily bearded. Some of them, incredibly, hadn't reacted fast enough and were still in their original positions.

After Nangong Yun and Brother Jie had escaped the Zhou family, they'd settled in this mountain valley. Nangong Yun still harbored dreams of revenge, but hiding in a backwater made that impossible, leaving him perpetually depressed. Brother Jie, pained to see him like that, eventually hit upon an idea—have Nangong Yun use his beauty to seduce recruits.

It worked shockingly well. More and more men were willing to defy Huaxia for Nangong Yun's sake. Over time, the camp evolved into a proper settlement—Nantong Village. Every last villager was gay. Tops, bottoms, switches—the whole spectrum.

In short: chaos.

Black Dragon, fighting the urge to vomit, assumed his true dragon form. His oppressive aura crashed down on the crowd. With a contemptuous glare, he roared, "EVERYONE PUT YOUR DAMN CLOTHES ON!"

The men trembled under his presence and scrambled to obey. Black Dragon was nearly at True Immortal level—terrifyingly strong. The village didn't have a single Human Immortal; their strongest was merely an Ancient Emperor. None could resist.

Most dressed in a panic, though a few—still in the throes of passion—managed to squeeze in one or two more thrusts before stopping. Black Dragon's eye twitched. "You—"

He couldn't hold back. One swipe of his claw and the offender was paste.

Amid the pandemonium, the men eventually got dressed—crookedly, sloppily, but at least covering the essentials. They stared up at Black Dragon in terror, afraid that one massive claw would end them.

In the crowd, Nangong Yun kept his head down. He was a wanted man—the Zhou family was still hunting him. Best not to be recognized.

Beside him, Brother Jie stood protectively, shielding him from Black Dragon's line of sight. What they didn't realize was that Black Dragon had identified Nangong Yun from the very start.

With Nangong Yun locked in his sights, Black Dragon scanned the crowd to make sure nothing unseemly remained in view. Satisfied, he nodded and turned his massive head.

"Young Master, all clear!"

Qin Jiang appeared atop Black Dragon's head. Little Xu, back in human form, stood at Qin Jiang's side, also perched on Black Dragon's skull.

Black Dragon was annoyed at Little Xu, but with Qin Jiang present, he couldn't very well shake him off. He settled for seething quietly.

Little Xu flashed a smug grin and stomped on Black Dragon's head for good measure—payback for the visual trauma. This wasn't over, though. Once this was done, Black Dragon would learn what happened to people who crossed him.

From his vantage point, Qin Jiang quickly spotted Nangong Yun. He'd changed considerably—not fully feminized like Ye Xuan, but close. Every gesture, every mannerism was distinctly feminine.

Right now, Nangong Yun was clinging nervously to Brother Jie, face buried in his chest—the very picture of a shy maiden.
