In the room, Murong Qing was still in Qin Jiang's arms, sitting squarely on his lap. Their connection hadn't broken for a single moment.

Her gaze swept back and forth between Qin Jiang and Xue Yue. After a long silence, she couldn't help but ask, "You two... were acting the whole time?"

"Ahem, doesn't Qing'er enjoy this sort of thing?" Qin Jiang coughed.

Murong Qing drew a deep breath, her fists clenching, voice tinged with mortification. "Let go of me!"

"No."

"You..." She raised her fist and punched him squarely in the chest—hard enough to actually sting. She was genuinely angry.

But when she saw him wince, she softened in spite of herself. She forced her face into a stern mask and looked away. "I said let go!"

Qin Jiang said nothing. He shifted ever so slightly, and Murong Qing immediately lost her composure. Her face reddened and she glared at him furiously. He blinked innocently and shifted again.

Murong Qing bit her lip and stared at him reproachfully. Then he flashed a grin. "Qing'er, I think the situation is actually that you haven't let go of me."

Her face flushed crimson. She glanced down and bit her lip. She'd not only failed to release him—she'd tightened. The fact that she could restrain herself from throwing her arms around him was already impressive self-control. As for other areas... she was utterly powerless.

Deep down, she truly couldn't bear to let go. It was just that she was angry. She needed to keep a straight face—otherwise, this scoundrel would push for more.

Especially with Yue'er right there.

Qin Jiang held Murong Qing by the waist and glanced at Xue Yue, who was watching them with eager eyes. If he could just coax Murong Qing around, the next step would certainly involve a three-course meal.

He licked his lips and tightened his hold, pressing their bodies closer together. Murong Qing kept her head turned away, one hand braced between them. She didn't speak, but her body language was clear—she was still angry and needed to be coaxed.

He freed one hand, took hers, and placed it on his shoulder. Then he pulled her flush against him, eliminating every last gap between them. Murong Qing snatched her hand back. She absolutely refused to touch him. He'd deceived her for over a decade—she couldn't let him off this easily.

At the very least, he should kiss her a few times.

With that thought, she shot him a sidelong glance and gave a dainty huff—thoroughly tsundere.

Qin Jiang couldn't help but smile. He reached out and tilted her chin toward him, making her face him directly. Murong Qing pouted and tried to pull free, but in the next instant, he kissed her.

She melted. Her arms went around him of their own accord. After a few soft whimpers, she capitulated entirely. She gave him one last reproachful look, then closed her eyes and kissed him back.

The kiss lasted a very long time—long enough to leave her boneless, slumped against his chest. Only then did he pull away.

He stroked her back, kissed her hair, and murmured, "Qing'er, not angry anymore?"

"You lied to me for over a decade."

"Then I'll pay you back a decade. How about that?"

"Hm? How?"

"Heh, I could spend a decade alone with you in the Space-Time Temple."

Her eyes went wide. She shot him a withering look. "Absolutely not!" A decade alone with Qin Jiang? Was he insane? She'd actually die! His stamina wasn't something she could handle by herself.

"Not enough, Qing'er?"

He blinked, then drew a deep breath and said with utter sincerity, "If it keeps you from being angry, I'll make it a hundred years."

Murong Qing's eye twitched. She couldn't survive ten years, let alone a hundred. And from the look of it, he was ready to keep raising the offer. She quickly clapped a hand over his mouth. "You can let go of me first."

Xue Yue was right there. Sitting in his lap was more than a little embarrassing.

He blinked, caught her hand, and said innocently, "How about... you let go of me first, Qing'er?"

Her face burned. She hadn't just failed to let go—she'd clamped down tighter than ever. She looked down, bit her lip, and tried to release him. It was physically impossible. She had no control.

Her blush deepened. She pouted at herself in silent frustration. She was supposed to be angry... and yet she felt like she couldn't be apart from him. Though, after so many years together, she really couldn't be apart from him.

Still—how pathetically weak-willed.

She sat there stewing, cheeks puffed out—adorably petulant. Qin Jiang poked her cheek. She frowned. "What are you doing~"

"Heh, Qing'er is so cute."

She huffed, opened her mouth, and chomped down on his finger. He didn't even flinch. Her bite had zero force behind it—she ended up just holding it in her mouth. She puffed her cheeks and swatted his hand away. The scoundrel had done it on purpose, knowing she wouldn't actually bite.

"Not angry anymore?"

"Hmph, I'm still angry!"

"Want another bite?"

"Bleh, no I don't!"

Murong Qing was fully in pouting-and-sulking mode now. It was only Xue Yue's presence keeping her even slightly reserved. Otherwise, she definitely would have bitten him somewhere else—though where exactly, who could say.

Holding her, Qin Jiang sighed. "Qing'er, I didn't mean to deceive you. At first, I was worried you wouldn't be able to accept it, so I kept it hidden. Later, I noticed you actually enjoyed this kind of arrangement, so I just... kept putting it off..."

"I do not enjoy it~" Murong Qing muttered, entirely unconvincingly.

Qin Jiang smiled. "I do."

"Hmph, pervert!" She glanced at Xue Yue. "So why stop hiding it now?"

"Ahem, mainly because of Yue'er." He cleared his throat. "She was getting impatient."

"Hm?"

"She wants to be with you. So I thought I'd give things one last push."

"???"
