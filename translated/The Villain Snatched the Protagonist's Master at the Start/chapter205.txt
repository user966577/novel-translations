At the Purple-Scale Serpent territory, Qin Jiang sat with Yu Lan in his arms, staring at the spectacle beyond the clan boundary—a group of burly men striking poses and flexing provocatively.

"What... is this?" He turned to Yu Lan. "Is this some kind of Snake Race tradition?"

The sight was absolutely eye-searing.

Yu Lan's face was flushed. They weren't her clansmen, but they were technically part of the Snake Race, and the display was mortifying. She felt secondhand embarrassment on behalf of the entire species.

"Empress, Master Qin, we've figured out what they're doing," announced a Purple-Scale Serpent warrior as he approached, his expression somewhere between amusement and disbelief.

"What's going on with them?" Yu Lan asked. For the first few days, it had been waves of scouts, which they'd ignored. But now—what in the world were these?

"Uh, apparently it's on the Black Water Serpent's orders. They were sent here to... display their masculine charm."

Yu Lan: "???"

The warrior coughed, glanced at Qin Jiang, and continued sheepishly: "From what we've gathered, the Black Water Serpent sent them here to, well... seduce those two Immortals at your side."

Qin Jiang: "???"

Seduce Mo Mo and Xue Mei? With these guys? The disrespect was staggering.

Yu Lan fell silent, her gaze drifting between Qin Jiang and the gyrating mass of muscle outside. Was this really meant to be seduction? Qin Jiang's portrait must have been circulating for days. Was Mo Ling an idiot? Sending this lot?

There was no comparison.

"I'm fairly sure they're insulting me," Qin Jiang said darkly. "And insulting Mo Mo and Mei Mei."

Thankfully, Mo Mo and Xue Mei had exhausted themselves in a major battle the previous day and hadn't come out to witness this travesty. Otherwise, the two of them would probably have gone straight to the Black Water Serpent territory to level the place.

Yu Lan blinked her beautiful eyes and twisted a strand of hair around her finger. "The way I see it, they probably assume you're being kept by Mo Mo and Xue Mei as their... pretty boy. That's why they're sending men to seduce them."

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. So he really was being insulted. "Do I look like a kept man?"

Yu Lan tilted her head to study his handsome profile, then nodded earnestly. "Yes."

In terms of appearance, Qin Jiang was incredibly appealing. That face alone was enough to turn heads.

He shot her a look, then brought his hand down with a sharp smack.

"Ah! What was that for?" Yu Lan squeaked, her face reddening.

The Purple-Scale Serpent warrior wisely retreated.

Pulling Yu Lan into his arms, Qin Jiang flashed a wicked grin. "Pretty boy, huh? Then let me show you what this pretty boy can do."

At the Black Water Serpent clan, Mo Ling studied Chen Changsheng under his scrutiny, making the man's scalp tingle. Something about this big black snake's gaze felt distinctly off.

"Ahem. Chieftain Mo Ling, my name is Chen Changsheng," he introduced himself with a cupped fist.

Mo Ling gave a cursory nod. After a long, disappointed sigh, he turned to one of his subordinates: "His looks are a few grades below the target, but he'll have to do. Who knows—maybe they're into this type."

At least he was better-looking than anyone in the Black Water Serpent clan.

The warriors nodded. "Should we send him over?"

Chen Changsheng listened to this exchange in utter bewilderment. Send him where?

"Hey, kid, consider yourself lucky," Mo Ling said, a note of jealousy in his voice. "Those two beauties—I'd give my right hand for either of them. But they're Immortal-level. I'm not in their league. My current theory is that they like pretty boys, and I clearly don't qualify. You, on the other hand..."

"???" Two beauties? And Immortals?

"That's two Immortal-level women," another warrior chimed in. "If you manage to seduce even one and keep her happy, your future is made."

A chill ran through Chen Changsheng's body. Two beautiful Immortals at Qin Jiang's side—he knew exactly who they were talking about.

They wanted to send him to Qin Jiang?

"Chieftain Mo Ling, what exactly are you proposing?" he asked warily.

Mo Ling regarded Chen Changsheng. This pretty boy might be intended as a gift, but a gift still needed to know its job. At minimum, the man should know how to show off his charms.

"Explain the plan to him," Mo Ling instructed, then added: "Oh, and prepare poison. If those two Immortals actually take a liking to him, we need to make sure he stays under our control."

One group went to prepare the poison while another laid out the plan for Chen Changsheng. He listened with his face growing darker by the second. Were the Black Water Serpent people out of their minds? Their strategy for dealing with the Purple-Scale Serpent was to seduce the Immortals at Qin Jiang's side?

Those women weren't seducible! And Qin Jiang wasn't a kept pretty boy—he was the one in charge! Try to seduce his women? Forget about Qin Jiang making a move—those women themselves would cleave him in two.

"Do you understand?" Mo Ling asked, looking at him with utmost seriousness.

Chen Changsheng fought the urge to facepalm. "Chieftain Mo Ling, I think you've got this backward. Those two Immortals follow Qin Jiang's lead. He's the one in charge."

He had to speak up now, or they'd actually ship him over.

"Qin Jiang? That pretty boy?" Mo Ling scoffed. "A mere Supreme commanding Immortals? He's obviously just a kept man riding on their favor. Trust me—I understand Immortals."

'You don't understand a damn thing!' Chen Changsheng bit back the curse that nearly escaped. He took a deep breath and tried again: "I know them personally."

Mo Ling paused, fixing him with a penetrating stare. "You know those two Immortals?"

"Yes," Chen Changsheng nodded. "One of them is a demonic cultivator—a demon that everyone should be hunting down. The other..." His voice faltered. He didn't actually recognize the second one; she wasn't the same Immortal from the Heavenly Pill Palace. "The other one, I don't know. But there's yet another Immortal in Qin Jiang's circle—a sword cultivator. Both the demon and the sword master follow Qin Jiang's command."

"What? There's another one?" Mo Ling was shocked.

The demonic cultivator part didn't particularly bother him—at their level, everyone had climbed over mountains of corpses. No one was truly "good." But a third Immortal? That demanded serious attention.

He eyed Chen Changsheng skeptically. "Why would Immortals follow a Supreme's orders?"

"Maybe because, despite his low cultivation, Qin Jiang holds a very high status?" Chen Changsheng suggested.

He didn't actually know Qin Jiang's true identity, but he was certain the man was the one calling the shots.

Mo Ling's brow furrowed deeply. Three Immortals, plus some young lord of extraordinary status. How was he supposed to compete with that?
