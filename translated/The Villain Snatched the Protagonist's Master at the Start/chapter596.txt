Zhao Sheng's eyes lit up at Yang Manman's words, a flicker of excitement stirring in his chest. Even now, in front of these people, she'd admitted to knowing him. She really did have feelings for him!

Yang Hong, on the other hand, felt his heart seize. He shot his daughter a look of frustrated disbelief—what are you doing opening your mouth at a time like this? He was terrified that Qin Jiang would punish Yang Manman because of Zhao Sheng.

"How do you two know each other?" Qin Jiang asked.

Yang Manman glanced at Zhao Sheng, then looked away. "He helped me once."

"Oh?"

"I ran into danger while I was out one day, and he came to my rescue."

As she spoke, Yang Hong's anxiety deepened into outright dread. This was deception—lying to her man for the sake of another. No man could tolerate that, let alone someone of Qin Jiang's stature. And worse, Qin Jiang very likely already knew everything. It was over. Finished. Yang Hong's body trembled. He could practically see rivers of blood flowing through the Yang estate.

"He saved you?" Qin Jiang's brow furrowed.

Yang Manman nodded, her beautiful eyes fixed on Zhao Sheng with something unspoken in them.

Zhao Sheng's fists tightened. He wasn't stupid—he immediately understood what she was doing. She was trying to save him. He lowered his head, not daring to say a word. Anything he said might drag down not just himself, but Liu-ge... and her.

Everyone fell silent, the atmosphere heavy and oppressive.

After a long while, Qin Jiang sighed. He looked at Zhao Sheng and waved dismissively. "Get lost. You saved Manman once, so we'll call the Immortal Emperor's legacy business even."

Even? His legacy had been stolen from him, and now they were calling it even? How was that fair? Zhao Sheng lifted his head and shot Qin Jiang a look, but all he dared do was seethe in silence.

Liu Xing tugged at his sleeve and whispered, "Let's go."

"...Yeah."

Zhao Sheng agreed, but his gaze lingered on Yang Manman, full of reluctance.

At that moment, Qin Jiang pulled Yang Manman into his arms and grinned. "Manman, I've repaid your favor for you. But now you owe me one in return."

"Oh, stop it~" Yang Manman flushed, swatting at him playfully.

Qin Jiang laughed, leaned down, and kissed her on the lips. Then he swept her up into his arms and carried her back inside the courtyard.

Zhao Sheng stood frozen, his heart throbbing with pain, his face blank with shock. He looked utterly devastated.

Black Dragon and Little Xu glared at him. "What are you staring at? Get lost!"

"We're going, we're going..." Liu Xing offered an apologetic smile, grabbed Zhao Sheng, and took off without looking back.

Outside the courtyard, Yang Hong was still in a daze. That was it? Nothing happened? The Yang family was fine?

"Relax, it was all just acting." Black Dragon clapped him on the shoulder with a chuckle.

Yang Hong blinked. "Acting?"

"That's right." Black Dragon pointed toward the courtyard and grinned. "Our Young Master loves putting on impromptu performances wherever he goes. We just play along."

Yang Hong stared at the courtyard, then back at Black Dragon. "So it was all an act? My daughter, Zhao Sheng, that True Immortal—all acting?"

"Well..." Black Dragon smacked his lips. "Zhao Sheng wasn't acting."

"And my daughter?"

"The Young Madam was probably in on it."

Even Black Dragon wasn't entirely sure.

While the two talked, inside the courtyard, Yang Manman looked up at Qin Jiang. "How was my performance?"

"Needs work. Your eye acting was terrible—you didn't convey the emotions at all."

Yang Manman rolled her eyes. She'd never acted before in her life. Getting through the whole scene in one piece was impressive enough. Eye acting? She simply couldn't do it. Besides, after seeing Zhao Sheng again, the feelings she'd expected to surface simply... didn't. Especially when she looked at Zhao Sheng, then at Qin Jiang—the gap was almost comical. One was an elegant nobleman; the other looked like a street beggar in comparison. She'd always imagined Zhao Sheng as being roughly on Qin Jiang's level, but standing side by side, the difference was immediately obvious. Asking her to act out lingering feelings under those circumstances was asking too much.

"Doesn't matter, though. That fool couldn't tell the difference," Qin Jiang chuckled.

Yang Manman nodded. Zhao Sheng had been completely played without noticing a thing. When she thought about it, his intelligence really was lacking. But she didn't want to dwell on Zhao Sheng right now. She wrapped her arms around Qin Jiang's neck, her eyes soft and shy. "You said I owe you a favor."

The so-called favor was fabricated, of course. But a debt was a debt, and she wasn't one to welch.

Qin Jiang's eyebrow arched, a wicked grin spreading across his face. "Right now?"

"Mm-hmm~" Yang Manman nodded slightly, her voice small. "I think I'm up to it this time. I should be able to... repay you properly."

"Well then, let's find out."

He carried her to the bedroom, and Yang Manman gave everything she had to settle the debt.

Meanwhile, far from the Yang estate, Liu Xing and Zhao Sheng finally stopped. Liu Xing glanced back over his shoulder, still shaken, and let out a long exhale. He clapped Zhao Sheng on the shoulder. "Man, we really owe you for that one."

"Heh." Zhao Sheng managed a hollow laugh. Their survival had nothing to do with him—it was thanks to Miss Manman. His beloved. And she'd saved them by sacrificing herself. The memory of that final scene sent a sharp pain through his chest. He didn't want to say a word.

Liu Xing could see it plainly. He sighed. "Come on, don't be down. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Once you're powerful enough, you'll have your pick of any woman in the world."

"Power..." Zhao Sheng echoed.

"That's right. In this world, strength is everything."

At those words, Zhao Sheng's fists clenched. He drew a deep breath and spoke with iron resolve. "You're right! Strength! Once I'm powerful enough, I'll take Miss Manman back!"

"..."

"She has feelings for me—I won't let her stay trapped under a tyrant's thumb! I'll save her!"

His gaze turned toward the Yang estate.

Liu Xing blinked, smacked his lips, and offered, "Well, good luck."

"I'll give it everything I've got!"

Seeing the fierce determination on Zhao Sheng's face, Liu Xing sighed and allowed himself a smile. "I'm sure she's giving it everything she's got too. The two of you, both working so hard."

She was giving it everything too?

Zhao Sheng's expression froze. Right—she was working hard as well. Repaying the favor.

At the thought, his fists tightened even harder.
