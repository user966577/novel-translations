Nearby, the Second and Third Ancestors nodded in agreement.

"It was the strangest thing—the bottleneck just seemed to vanish."

"Same here. I thought I was imagining it, but when I tried, I just... broke through."

Hearing their words, the Fourth Ancestor paused.

His own breakthrough had been nothing like that. And he'd been using Great Emperor laws rather than blood essence—if he'd had to rely on blood essence instead, he wasn't even sure he would have succeeded.

The Fourth Ancestor instinctively glanced at Qin Jiang. He had a feeling that whatever had caused their unusually smooth breakthroughs had something to do with him.

Qin Jiang flashed a grin.

Internally, he was quite certain that the three ancestors' effortless breakthroughs were thanks to the fortune transfer.

As for the remaining four drops of Great Emperor blood essence...

Qin Jiang looked at the other ancestral elders. Among them were several half-step Emperor experts. If they could obtain the blood essence, they had a real chance at breaking through.

At the very least, their cultivation would see a significant boost.

"First Ancestor, let's give the blood essence to the half-step Emperors. Who knows—we might gain two more Great Emperors for the family."

The First Ancestor glanced at the half-step Emperor elders, whose eyes were filled with eager anticipation.

"Might that be a bit risky?"

The Fourth Ancestor interjected.

"Four drops of blood essence—if we gave them to Nine Tribulations Supremes, they'd definitely reach half-step Emperor. But for half-step Emperors trying to break through to Great Emperor, the odds honestly aren't great."

Under normal circumstances, the Fourth Ancestor had a point. Nobody had anticipated how easily the First Ancestor and the other two would break through—even their worst-case projection had been that the ten drops would merely boost the three of them without guaranteeing advancement.

But now, with the Fortune-Sealing Stele in place, the Qin family's fortune was no longer draining. It was growing.

Qin Jiang felt confident that pushing two more Great Emperors was entirely achievable.

Besides, the First Ancestor's trio had already broken through—that alone was a massive win. Creating a few more half-step Emperors wouldn't meaningfully shift the family's power balance.

"Fourth Ancestor, let's give it a shot. The First Ancestor and the others already breaking through was pure profit. With four drops left, even if we only get one more Great Emperor, that's still better than four half-step Emperors."

Qin Jiang insisted on allocating the blood essence to the half-step Emperor elders.

Seeing his determination, the Fourth Ancestor relented. The blood essence was Qin Jiang's to begin with, and the First Ancestor had deferred the distribution rights to him.

Moreover, Qin Jiang's reasoning was sound—they were already ahead.

"Then let's go with the half-step Emperors. Who knows, maybe we'll see two more Great Emperors in the Qin family."

The First Ancestor laughed heartily.

Based on how they'd each needed only two drops to break through, the remaining four should theoretically produce two more Great Emperors.

But he suspected that their smooth breakthroughs had been aided by something unusual during that window—something that might not apply going forward.

The thought brought a twinge of regret. If all the family's half-step Emperors had attempted their breakthroughs during that same window, perhaps every one of them would have succeeded.

Of course, that was wishful thinking.

After spending some time in the rear mountain, Qin Jiang returned to his residence. Over the following days, he settled into a comfortable routine, enjoying life to the fullest.

He'd also installed the Void Divine Temple in his quarters. Under his modifications, the temple's interior now featured one enormous central chamber surrounded by a dense ring of smaller rooms.

Whether he'd ever fill all those rooms remained to be seen.

But to Qin Jiang, it was better to have more than enough. After all, he'd be dealing with Children of Destiny for the foreseeable future—who knew how many fortune heroines he'd need to rescue.

One day, Qin Jiang was lounging in a chair while Ye Ling'er stood behind him, her delicate hands working the tension from his shoulders. Beside him, Yan Yun carefully sliced fruit and fed pieces to him.

Huo Qing'er and Chen Ningbing, meanwhile, were engrossed in a game of chess.

This kind of leisure was making Qin Jiang feel like he was going soft.

He half-closed his eyes and told himself:

'I can't keep slacking like this. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to train hard!'

A mental flag was planted.

The very next moment:

"Ling'er, a little harder."

And just like that, several more days slipped by, with Qin Jiang swearing each day that tomorrow would be different.

But the allure of comfort always proved stronger.

Every time, it effortlessly dragged him back. Eventually, Qin Jiang gave up entirely.

Train? For what?

With his background, his talent—did he really need to try that hard?

Finally...

Half a month later, Qin Jiang was forced to leave his paradise and report to his parents' residence.

"Dad, Mom, what's up?"

Qin Jiang rubbed his eyes, looking like he'd just rolled out of bed.

Qin Hao's brows were knitted tight. He wanted to scold his son, but after opening and closing his mouth several times, he gave up with a sigh of resignation.

Li Xueyi, on the other hand, looked genuinely worried.

"Jiang'er, you haven't been overdoing it these past few weeks, have you?"

"Huh?"

Qin Jiang blinked, then shook his head.

"No?"

"You really should pace yourself. While you're young it's fine, but at your father's age..."

"Ahem!!!"

Qin Hao coughed loudly, cutting her off.

Qin Jiang, meanwhile, stared at his father in surprise.

"Brat, what are you looking at?"

Qin Hao's face reddened.

Qin Jiang grinned and produced a jade bottle.

"Here, Dad—good stuff. Try it tonight."

He'd refined a batch of Kidney Treasure Pills. He didn't need them personally, but since his old man seemed to be having some... issues, these were perfect.

Sensing the implication, Qin Hao glared.

"Don't talk nonsense!"

Despite his bluster, his hands were remarkably honest, swiping the jade bottle from Qin Jiang's grasp.

Qin Jiang chuckled.

"Dad, you still haven't told me why you called me over."

"Oh, right."

Qin Hao remembered the actual purpose of the summons. He tucked the pills away before continuing:

"Your father-in-law is here."

"Huh?"

Qin Jiang was momentarily confused, then asked:

"Which one?"

Qin Hao's cheek twitched. But it was true—Qin Jiang had more than one father-in-law.

"The Holy Sword Sect Master—Bai Jingyun."

"Bai Jingyun? Bai Susu's father?"

Qin Jiang shook his head.

"Took him long enough. If he hadn't shown up soon, I was going to visit the Holy Sword Sect myself."

Seeing his utterly nonchalant demeanor, Qin Hao felt compelled to offer a warning:

"He's here to raise hell. After all, you snatched his daughter—we're in the wrong here. And technically speaking, he's your father-in-law."

"Got it."

Qin Jiang nodded.

"Where is he? I'll go see him."

"In the guest wing. Want me to come along?"

"No, no."

Qin Jiang waved him off. Having his father there would only cramp his style.
