The Imperial City. The palace.

News of Long Yu's identity as a demonic cultivator had reached the capital. The Dragon Emperor's face was black as thunder.

His most beloved son had fallen to the demonic path!

He sat in dark silence. Long Yu had definitely not been a demonic cultivator while in the Imperial City—which meant his fall had happened recently, after being sent to the frontier. Could it be that his own estrangement had planted the seeds of resentment, ultimately driving Long Yu down this road?

The thought made the Dragon Emperor even angrier. 'With mental fortitude that fragile, he'd have been unfit for the throne even without being pushed away!'

He took a deep breath, looked up, and dismissed the assembled ministers with a wave. Moments later, the First Patron and the other Imperial Patrons materialized at his side.

"Need me to handle it?" the First Patron asked.

The Dragon Emperor sighed and nodded. "Go bring that traitor back."

"Understood."

The First Patron departed without another word.

Meanwhile, rumors were spreading like wildfire across the Divine Dragon Continent.

"Hey, did you hear? The Dragon Emperor's favorite prince—turns out he's a grand demon!"

"Really?"

"I'm serious, listen. Those demonic cultivator attacks at the frontier that killed all those people? Every single one was orchestrated by the Ninth Prince. I heard he cultivates some demonic technique that requires living sacrifices to grow stronger. Who knows how many people he's sacrificed over the years. This time, he set his sights on the frontier army itself—that's how he finally got caught. But even so, the frontier forces suffered massive casualties."

"That's insane! The Ninth Prince was that evil?"

"And that's not all. I heard he's actually a reincarnated grand demon. His entire purpose this life was to destroy our Divine Dragon Empire!"

"That's terrifying. A grand demon, sitting right there as the Emperor's favorite son. What a disgrace!"

"He has to be executed! Otherwise our entire continent is in danger!"

"But he's a prince..."

"So what? If we all stand united, even the Dragon Emperor can't defy the will of an entire continent."

These rumors swept across the Divine Dragon Continent with staggering speed. Countless cultivators demanded Long Yu's head. The frontier garrison joined the chorus—Long Yu's actions had cost them dearly. Some border cities had been massacred, nearly a million civilians slaughtered. All of it traced back to Long Yu.

The frontier Commander-in-Chief, along with every general under his command, submitted a joint memorial demanding Long Yu's execution.

On the other side, the First Patron had already located Long Yu.

In a dark, narrow gorge, Long Yu looked up at the First Patron. His pitch-black eyes flickered with something feral, his body wreathed in demonic qi. All around him—every plant, every animal—had been drained of life.

The First Patron's pupils contracted. He hadn't expected Long Yu to have fallen this deep into corruption. At this level, there was absolutely no chance of redemption.

He took a steady breath. "Ninth Prince, come back to the Imperial City with me."

"Back to the Imperial City?" Long Yu laughed coldly, his voice carrying an unsettling chill. He fixed the First Patron with an unblinking stare. "When you people banished me to the frontier, did anyone think about keeping me in the Imperial City? And now you want me back? What—is our 'glorious' Emperor planning to execute his own son to show off how righteous he is?"

Every word dripped with mockery. Under the demonic qi's corruption, his mind grew more volatile by the minute, and his hatred toward the Dragon Emperor deepened with it. At this point, he feared nothing.

The way he saw it, the Dragon Emperor was the root cause of his fall. If the Emperor had named him heir, would he have ever needed to take such desperate risks? Would he have ever fallen to the demonic path?

It was all the Dragon Emperor's fault!

Long Yu's expression grew increasingly savage. Demonic qi raged around him, its malevolent aura making even the First Patron frown.

"Ninth Prince, if you come back with me, there may still be a chance to save you," the First Patron said.

Long Yu scoffed. "I don't need anyone to save me. If you want to take me back, then fight me! Emperor—so what?"

The First Patron shook his head. 'He's completely lost it.'

A Yin-Yang Realm cultivator, challenging a Great Emperor? If not for Long Yu's status as a prince, the First Patron would've swatted him dead already.

"Since you refuse to cooperate, I'll have to take you by force."

"Then try me!"

Long Yu flared his full power for the first time since embracing the demonic path. A sensation of invincibility swelled within him, inflating his ego to dangerous proportions. With a cold snort, he stomped the ground and launched himself at the First Patron.

Demonic qi blanketed the sky, warping the very space around them. Long Yu threw back his head and laughed. "Let me see the power of a Great Emperor!"

The First Patron stared at this display, utterly unimpressed. He raised one hand and flicked it casually.

The demonic qi scattered. A single finger-flick later, Long Yu's body seized mid-air, his expression freezing in place.

Blood sprayed from his mouth as he cratered into the ground.

His mind went blank. "How is that possible?" he mumbled in a daze. He couldn't even withstand a casual strike? "Am I really this weak?"

The First Patron appeared before him. Hearing Long Yu's bewildered muttering, he couldn't help but roll his eyes. 'When exactly did the Ninth Prince become an idiot?'

A mere Yin-Yang Realm cultivator failing to block a Great Emperor's casual blow—how was that surprising? It would've been bizarre if he could.

"Ninth Prince, come with me."

The First Patron grabbed Long Yu by the scruff of his neck. The overwhelming force left Long Yu with no room to struggle. Just like that, the First Patron carried him off toward the Imperial City like a sack of grain.

In the Imperial City. Inside the Void Divine Temple.

The Demon Hall Founder was still sealed, though she could now move freely. She trailed after Qin Jiang, her gaze tinged with resentment as she glanced at Jian Yao.

"When are you going to have her remove my seal?"

"Removing the seal isn't a problem," Qin Jiang said with a light smile. "I'm just worried you'll do something foolish afterward. Losing a little loli from my side would be quite the pity."

The Demon Hall Founder's brows pinched together. She studied Qin Jiang's smiling face and felt a chill run through her. If she sought revenge after having the seal removed, Qin Jiang would very likely kill her. And she had no doubt whatsoever that he had the ability to do it.

Qin Jiang was full of mysteries. From the moment he'd offered to help unseal her, the Founder had recognized that much.

"If you want it removed," Qin Jiang continued, "we can do it now. I'm heading to the Nine Heavens in a few days. You should recover your strength as soon as possible."
