"Xiao Yun, you actually rescued Weiwei-jie?"

A bright, energetic voice rang out as a woman in red rushed to the front of the crowd. She spotted Yue Weiwei and broke into a brilliant smile, latching onto her arm.

"Weiwei-jie, you're safe! That's wonderful!"

Then her gaze found Nangong Yun — and instead of relief, she saw grief. Haunted eyes, hollow expression, as if his soul had been wrung out.

The woman in red frowned. "Xiao Yun, Weiwei-jie is right here. Why do you look like that? Aren't you happy she's back?"

Nangong Yun didn't answer. He swept his arm, and the bodies of the two Great Emperors materialized before the crowd. Every face went slack.

The woman's mouth fell open. She knew both of them — the alliance's strongest fighters. Dead?

"Xiao Yun... what happened?"

Two Great Emperors — the backbone of the anti-Huaxia alliance. Their loss was devastating.

But Nangong Yun only shook his head. He said nothing.

Senior Sister violated. Brothers slain. Everything since last night felt like a nightmare he couldn't wake from.

He hoisted both corpses onto his shoulders and staggered toward a nearby peak, waving off anyone who tried to help. These were his brothers. They'd died because of him. He would carry them home personally.

The crowd fell silent, parting to let him through. Tears streaked his face as he murmured, "Brothers... I'm bringing you home."

The rest of the alliance trailed after him.

Watching the procession, Qin Jiang let out a sigh. The anti-Huaxia alliance — surprisingly tight-knit.

"Weiwei, let's follow. Pay our respects to those two."

Yue Weiwei shot him a look. He'd ordered those two killed, and now he wanted to attend their funeral. Shameless didn't begin to cover it.

Beside her, the woman in red was studying Qin Jiang with undisguised curiosity. She'd noticed him the moment they arrived — in a place like this, his looks alone made him impossible to miss. But it was more than just his face. His bearing, his effortless magnetism, the bevy of stunning women around him — he and his companions seemed to exist in a different reality than the rest of the alliance.

What struck her most, though, was how intimately he addressed Yue Weiwei. And Weiwei hadn't objected. She'd even responded with a sultry, teasing glance — practically flirting.

She'd never seen Yue Weiwei act that way around any man.

"Weiwei-jie, who are these people?"

"Hello. I'm Weiwei's man."

Qin Jiang answered for her. He smiled at the woman in red, nodding approvingly to himself. Not bad at all.

Xue Yue's jaw dropped. She turned to Yue Weiwei in disbelief. But Weiwei just smiled and took Qin Jiang's arm.

"This is my husband, Xue Yue. And these are my sisters."

She didn't give his name. Few people knew Qin Jiang's face, but across the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, his name was known to every living soul. The Grand Sovereign's decree had singled him out specifically.

After the introductions, Xue Yue was reeling. A few days. Weiwei-jie had been gone a few days, and she'd not only found a man but was sharing him with other women. Handsome as he was — and Xue Yue's own heart had skipped at the sight of him — looks couldn't be everything. Sincerity, devotion — those were what mattered.

In a few short days, what sincerity could anyone demonstrate? She knew for a fact that Nangong Yun's devotion to Weiwei was absolute. He'd spent months proving it. And Weiwei had chosen a stranger over him.

She couldn't understand it. She didn't know that on the road to a woman's heart, there existed a shortcut — and Qin Jiang had taken it.

Now his gaze lingered on her, already plotting his route to the next shortcut.

"Let's go. We should see those brothers off."

The group joined the procession. Qin Jiang and his women brought up the rear, murmuring among themselves, the picture of casual intimacy. Xue Yue walked nearby, her expression conflicted.

Up ahead, Nangong Yun set down the bodies. Then, with his bare hands, he began to dig.

Others moved to help. He pushed them away. These brothers had died because of him. He would bury them himself.

Xue Yue watched him, a twinge of heartache surfacing — only to be disrupted by Qin Jiang's laughter and the women's playful protests drifting from behind her. Some of his whispered comments were positively scandalous, and he made zero effort to keep his voice down.

Her ears burned, but this wasn't the time to say anything. She could only mutter under her breath: "Scoundrel."

"Your junior brother really is pitiable," Qin Jiang said, turning serious as he watched Nangong Yun dig. A genuine note of sympathy entered his voice.

Yue Weiwei nodded. He was pitiable. But he'd chosen to stand against Qin Jiang, so his misery was self-inflicted. In her view, the fact that Qin Jiang hadn't simply killed him was already mercy.

"Still," Qin Jiang continued, "anyone who opposes Huaxia and lives to tell about it is already lucky. But I suspect his luck won't last much longer."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

Xue Yue bristled, snapping at him without thinking. This man was cursing Xiao Yun now?

Qin Jiang shrugged, his tone light. "Exactly what it sounds like. The anti-Huaxia alliance is a grasshopper in autumn. It won't be hopping much longer."
