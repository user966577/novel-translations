An Immortal King sword. Qin Jiang wasn't interested. More to the point, it housed three old men. If they'd been beautiful women, he might have reconsidered.

He gave the Chaos Sword another tap, observed Li Yang writhing in agony, and felt a flicker of boredom. This Child of Destiny hadn't even begun to develop. No point squeezing a dry sponge — better to let him grow and harvest later.

He was about to land another kick when Li Qingqiu pulled him back, brow furrowed. "Why are you bullying a piece of trash?"

"He annoys me."

"Then go easy. If he bleeds, ruining your clothes would be one thing — you can throw those out. But if it splashed on your skin? Disgusting."

"..."

Qin Jiang stared. This girl didn't speak often, but when she did, every word was a critical hit. He glanced at Li Yang with something almost resembling pity.

Li Yang had heard every word. Li Qingqiu had... defended him? But her concern wasn't whether *he* was hurt. It was whether his blood might dirty *Qin Jiang*.

Pain lanced through his heart — sharper than the agony in his eyes. She'd called him trash without a second thought. The man kicks him, and she worries about stains.

Qin Jiang laughed, pulled Li Qingqiu close, and leaned in with a playful look. "If his blood gets on me, will you ban me from the bed tonight?"

"Yes."

He'd been joking. She was completely serious. If Qin Jiang actually got splattered, she'd probably scrub a layer of skin off him.

"Well then — can't risk it. Missing a night with you in my arms isn't worth it." He swept a hand, and a wave of force launched Li Yang out of sight.

Li Qingqiu paid Li Yang no further mind. She scanned Qin Jiang's body for anything dirty, found nothing alarming, then looked down at his shoes. Those would need to be thrown out.

Qin Jiang caught her gaze and pinched her cheek. "I'll take a long bath when we get back. Happy?"

"Mm."

His eyes gleamed. "Want to bathe together?"

"No!" Her cheeks flushed. They'd bathed together before, actually — but this man was impossible. Hands everywhere, constant mischief, and at one point his antics had literally caused the water level to rise. Mortifying.

"Come on, don't be shy. It's not like it's our first time."

"You—!"

"How about this: I'll seal both my hands. Won't touch you at all. Deal?"

Li Qingqiu hesitated. Sealed hands meant he couldn't do anything. And if his hands were sealed, *she* could do whatever she wanted. Everything he'd done to her — she could pay it all back.

Her eyes sparkled. She nodded reluctantly. "Fine. But you wash yourself first. After kicking that trash so many times, you're definitely contaminated."

"No problem."

They headed back hand in hand. Li Yang, still sprawled on the ground, watched them go with bloodshot eyes. He'd heard every word. Each one was ice water through his veins.

She called him trash without blinking. Touching him was "dirty." No wonder she'd never so much as glanced his way — she'd been afraid of contaminating her eyes.

But worst of all: they'd been together barely days and were already bathing together. And it clearly wasn't the first time. If they'd reached that point... everything else had surely happened too.

Li Yang forced his head up, willing the tears not to fall. Looking at his goddess was already an impossible luxury — and someone else had...

He watched the direction they'd gone. A bath together. Then a clean bed, and then—

*My goddess! Defiled! And the one who defiled her isn't me!*

The Chaos Sword trembled. "Kid. Go home. Now."

Home. Right — home was where he could cry without an audience.

He staggered to his courtyard, shut the gate, and let the tears pour. Three spectral figures emerged from the sword, frowning at the weeping boy.

"Stop crying!"

"It's one woman. Get stronger and you'll have your pick. Think about *why* Li Qingqiu chose him — he's a Human Immortal! If you had that kind of power, would she look down on you?"

"Enough. Dry your eyes."

Under their scolding, Li Yang wiped his face, though misery still clung. "That man... is a Human Immortal?"

"Yes. And absurdly young for one." They could sense Qin Jiang's age — far too young for his cultivation level. But a more pressing concern nagged at them. He'd seemed to *notice* them. The deliberate kicks to the sword, that knowing look...

"He's found us," one said. "We all felt it."

"What?"

"When he hit you, he kicked the Chaos Sword on purpose. And his eyes — like he was seeing straight through us."

"If he knows what we are, he knows the sword's grade. So why didn't he take it?"

"Maybe he doesn't care?"

"Impossible. A true Immortal King weapon — possibly the only one in all the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Who wouldn't want it?"

Li Yang's heart clenched. The Chaos Sword was his most precious possession. The three True Immortal sword spirits were his only hope. Without them, he'd be a waste for life.
