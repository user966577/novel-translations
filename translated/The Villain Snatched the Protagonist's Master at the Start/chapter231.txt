The Azure Lotus Divine Palace.

Amid a sea of flowers stood a small but exquisite wooden cottage, fronted by a flowering tree. Beneath it, a wooden table, two chairs, and two beautiful women sharing tea and conversation—though the topic was entirely at odds with the serene setting.

"Qing Chan, I just received some news that I think you'll find very interesting." One of the women spoke with a smile.

She was Ning Xue'er, Palace Master of the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. Across from her sat the palace's ancestor—Qing Chan. Despite the gap in their positions, they spoke like sisters.

"News I'd find interesting?" Qing Chan took a sip of tea, then immediately spat out some leaves. She unslung the wine gourd at her waist, took a proper swig, and grimaced. "I'll never understand what's so good about this wretched tea."

The tea had been Ning Xue'er's contribution. Qing Chan set down the cup, swirled her gourd, and looked at her. "Well? Let's hear it."

Seeing her fine tea go to waste, Ning Xue'er pouted and stuck out her hand. "Tea money first."

"Oh? The little brat dares extort her big sister?"

"Hehe, who told you to be so rich?"

Qing Chan waved her off. "I'll cover your tea bill for the entire year. Happy? Now tell me—what's this news?"

"Big sister is so generous." Ning Xue'er gave a thumbs-up, then flipped her palm. A scroll materialized, and she unfurled it to reveal a portrait of Qin Jiang. "Remember him?"

Qing Chan's eyes lit up. She snatched the portrait and studied it admiringly. "Of course I do. That's the handsome young man who killed an Immortal at the Heavenly Pill Palace. I wasn't there at the time—what a shame. I'd have snatched him right up. Then after I got the news, I couldn't find a trace of him."

Regret was written across her face. As a devoted lover of beauty, she'd gone hundreds of thousands of years without finding a man who met her standards. Hence her status as the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's eternal bachelorette.

When Qin Jiang had killed the Ghost Immortal, many major factions took notice. Qing Chan couldn't have cared less about the killing itself, but Qin Jiang's portrait was arrestingly handsome. She'd even suspected the portrait was enhanced, but subsequent images proved it didn't do him justice. That was when the idea had taken root.

She'd sent people to the Western Regions to find him, all to no avail.

Looking up from the portrait, she asked Ning Xue'er, "You have a lead?"

"Hehe—looks like big sister might finally get hitched." Ning Xue'er grinned. "Our disciples spotted him in the Central Regions."

"He's in the Central Regions?" Qing Chan's eyes blazed. She set the portrait aside and rubbed her palms together. Time to grab herself a bed-warmer.

Elsewhere, Chen Changsheng was also studying portraits—of the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's leadership. His plan was to seduce one of them. Getting the palace's backing would simplify everything.

"True Immortal Qing Chan." His gaze lingered on her portrait. As the ancestor, she was also a True Immortal. Win her over, and the entire Azure Lotus Divine Palace was his.

But after a moment, he gave up. She was too strong. He couldn't handle a True Immortal, no matter how much charm he poured on.

"I'm still too weak. Even with all the charisma in the world, enchanting a True Immortal is a tall order." He sighed, then turned to another portrait. "Palace Master Ning Xue'er. Human Immortal level..." He gauged his chances. His face might give him an edge here.

His gaze drifted across the other portraits—each one stunningly beautiful. If he won the Palace Master, he'd get to see them every day. He thought of Qin Jiang, surrounded by gorgeous women, drawing strength from them. If Qin Jiang could do it, why couldn't he? Ten lifetimes of reincarnation, and he'd never taken a dao companion—not because he couldn't, but because he hadn't bothered. Now that he wanted one, it should be effortless.

"Qin Jiang has plenty of Immortal-level women—I won't be outdone!" He jabbed his finger on Ning Xue'er's portrait. "You're the one!"

Back in the Chaos District, Qin Jiang finished a satisfying meal and decided to take Dan Yu for a stroll—see the Central Regions' sights.

He opened the door—and a woman was standing right there.

"Excuse me—"

"Come here!" She flicked her wrist, locking him in place. In the next instant, both vanished.

"Qin Jiang!" Dan Yu shrieked.

Jian Yao, Mo Mo, and Yan Shiya materialized instantly, faces dark. Under their very noses, someone had taken Qin Jiang. Their razor-sharp gazes swept the area, energy surging—but there was no trace.

They exchanged grim looks. "Nothing."

"Whoever it was, they're powerful. We didn't sense a thing before they appeared."

"Split up. Find Qin Jiang. If he's been harmed, we burn the Central Regions to the ground."

Before they could move, Dan Yu spoke up. "I think I've seen that woman before."

"What?"

She furrowed her brow, cycling through her memories under the three women's intense stares. Finally, her eyes brightened. "I remember! She's the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's ancestor!"

"The Azure Lotus Divine Palace? You're sure?"

Dan Yu nodded, then ran back inside. She returned moments later with Qing Chan's dossier, spreading it before the three.

"True Immortal!" Their expressions tightened. They took a steadying breath. "A face-lover?"

That detail eased some of their anxiety.

"We have no quarrel with the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. And the abductor didn't show any killing intent—a True Immortal who wanted us dead could have done it easily."

"Even if there were a grudge, an ancestor wouldn't act so casually."

"You don't think... Qin Jiang was kidnapped to be a bed-warmer?"

Three pairs of eyes locked on the word "face-lover" in the file.

"If that's true, it's very plausible. Qin Jiang's looks do hold up."
