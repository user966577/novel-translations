The Black Water Serpent warriors didn't warrant a second glance from Qin Jiang. Ancient Emperors at best—no real threat.

"Mo Ling isn't among them," Yu Lan observed.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. Mo Ling — the Black Water Serpent chieftain, the one who'd orchestrated the poisoning of Yu Lan's bloodline. With four Immortals bearing down on his clan, he hadn't even shown his face?

Mo Mo let out a light laugh. "There's a little black snake trying to escape. Ancient Emperor level."

"That'll be Mo Ling," Yu Lan said.

"Drag him out," Qin Jiang ordered.

A mere Ancient Emperor, trying to flee under the noses of four Immortals? Fool.

Mo Mo nodded and flicked her wrist. A streak of dark energy shot out like a vengeful specter, boring straight into the Black Water Serpent compound.

A burst of Ancient Emperor-level aura erupted from within — and was snuffed out almost instantly.

Mo Mo beckoned, and the dark energy returned, dragging Mo Ling with it and dumping him before the group.

"It's him!" Yu Lan's eyes flashed with killing intent.

What should have been a normal competition had spiraled into vicious conflict because of this despicable man. The Purple-Scale Serpent faction had suffered greatly.

"Want to do it yourself?" Qin Jiang asked.

Yu Lan nodded and was about to strike when a surge of Immortal-path auras swept in from the distance. One of them felt distinctly similar to the Black Water Serpent's energy signature. Moments later, five figures materialized before Qin Jiang's group.

All Immortals. The leader was none other than the Black Serpent Ancestor.

Mo Mo and the others tensed immediately, going on alert.

The Black Serpent Ancestor's expression was cold, confirming his worst fears—they'd come for revenge.

He sneered, sweeping his gaze over the assembled cultivators until it settled on Qin Jiang. "That's him—that's Qin Jiang!"

The other four Immortals studied Qin Jiang as well. They had a passing acquaintance with the Black Serpent Ancestor, but friendship alone wouldn't have been enough to pit them against four opposing Immortals. What tipped the scales was the Ancestor's claim that Qin Jiang possessed a treasure capable of helping Immortals advance to the next level.

Among all the yao race, only the Wolf Race's ancient Wolf King had reached the level of True Immortal. That was precisely why the Wolf Race sat unchallenged atop the Demon Domain hierarchy. Every other Immortal was merely a Human Immortal. The Black Serpent Ancestor had promised that Qin Jiang held a treasure that could help them break through, and given the reports of Qin Jiang using a treasure to slay an Immortal, there was a kernel of plausibility to the claim.

The chance of advancement dangled before them. They were tempted. And with five Immortals gathered, even failure carried minimal risk.

Qin Jiang noticed their appraising gazes. His brow furrowed.

"Ancestor! Save me!" Mo Ling's shriek shattered the tense silence.

Yu Lan looked at Qin Jiang, her own expression grave. She hadn't expected the Black Serpent Ancestor to gather five Immortals to his cause.

Qin Jiang glanced at Mo Ling, then spoke. "Lan Lan. Kill him."

"Alright." After a brief hesitation, Yu Lan nodded. Bound by Mo Mo's power, Mo Ling had no way to resist. She brought her palm down and crushed his skull. His primordial spirit was obliterated alongside him.

"Stop!" The Black Serpent Ancestor roared.

But Yu Lan didn't pause, didn't even acknowledge him. One strike, and Mo Ling was dead.

The Ancestor's face darkened. He'd gathered five Immortals, and they still didn't take him seriously? Killing intent flickered in his eyes as he turned to his companions. "Friends, hold off those Immortals. I'll grab Qin Jiang and hand him over to you."

"Wait." Two of the five raised their hands.

Their gazes had fallen on Hu Xian'er. Amid all these Immortals, the little fox was easy to overlook—but these two recognized her. They were Fox Race elders.

The pair exchanged bewildered glances. What was this little ancestor doing at the Snake Race?

Hu Xian'er had noticed them too. She tugged at Qin Jiang's sleeve and pointed. "Qin Jiang, they're Fox Race elders."

"Fox Race elders?"

Well, this was awkward. A classic case of allies accidentally ending up on opposite sides. All family, as it turned out.

A smile crept onto Qin Jiang's face. He gave the two elders a friendly wave. "Heh, Elders—I think you're standing on the wrong side."

"???"

The elders blinked, still not clear on Qin Jiang's relationship with Hu Xian'er.

The Black Serpent Ancestor glanced at the two Fox Race elders, a sinking feeling forming in his gut. They knew each other.

"What are you two standing around for? Get over here, or I'm telling Daddy!" Hu Xian'er planted her hands on her hips and pointed at the elders.

As the White Fox Tribe chief, Hu Xian'er held a naturally elevated status within the Fox Race. And her father was the Fox Race chieftain himself.

The elders coughed awkwardly and shot the Black Serpent Ancestor an apologetic look. "Brother Black Serpent, about this..."

They were about to explain when they sensed a familiar aura nearby. Their expressions shifted.

The chieftain was here too?

If so, this Qin Jiang clearly had deep ties to the Fox Race.

Without another word, they crossed over to Qin Jiang's side.

"So, uh..."

"Heh heh, Elders—we're all family here," Qin Jiang said with a grin, pulling Hu Xian'er close. "I'm the Fox Race's son-in-law. Personally approved by Chieftain Hu Yan!"

Hu Yan — Hu Xian'er's father.

Understanding dawned on the elders' faces. No wonder the chieftain had come in person. The clan's little ancestor had brought home a husband.

"Oh my, what a misunderstanding! Family, we're all family!" the elders laughed.

Unlike Hu Yan, they were quite pleased with Qin Jiang at first glance. Handsome, clearly talented—a perfect match for their little Xian'er. And his track record spoke for itself: he'd killed an Immortal, and he had multiple Immortals at his side. As the Fox Race's son-in-law, he could bring tremendous benefits to the clan.

The only question was whether the Black Serpent Ancestor's claim about Qin Jiang possessing an advancement treasure was actually true.

On the other side, the Black Serpent Ancestor was left with only two Immortals. Their expressions had turned distinctly unfriendly as they glared at him.

'You summoned allies, and somehow managed to recruit two for the other side as well. Real fair of you. Called in two for yourself and gifted two to the enemy. What a pal.'

They looked at Qin Jiang's side—six Immortals now—and then back at their group of three. Add in the fact that Qin Jiang could slay Immortals...

The situation looked grim.
