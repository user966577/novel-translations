Looks were justice.

One glimpse of Qin Jiang and every shred of resentment evaporated. He was gentle, devastatingly handsome, and he'd just promised they could stay by his side. Joy lit up every face.

All that nervousness on the way here, the trembling courage it had taken to march into the restricted zone—and it turned out to be this simple. He really hadn't forgotten them.

The woman in his arms blushed and asked softly, "So... does this mean we're your women now?"

"Now?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow and flashed a roguish grin. "Not quite yet."

"Huh?"

"Becoming my woman requires a certain... process."

"What process?"

"Heh, want to find out?"

The implication was crystal clear. Twelve faces turned scarlet. They all nodded anyway—nervous, yes, but the anticipation far outweighed the nerves.

"Well then, let's go get better acquainted, shall we?"

Qin Jiang led them to a reasonably spacious room—not the main chamber. That one was in a state of disarray that might traumatize the uninitiated. Better to let them build up some experience first.

Inside, the women fidgeted, stealing glances at each other before looking at Qin Jiang. "All of us... at once?"

"The more the merrier!"

They turned beet-red. Lively, sure—but for something like this?

They'd grown close during their years at the academy, but this was a different kind of intimacy entirely. Still, they didn't want to disappoint him. Small fists clenched in private acts of self-encouragement.

Seeing their tension, Qin Jiang chuckled. "Relax. I'm just teasing. See those other rooms? Pick one each, leave one person here, and I'll come find the rest of you afterward. Better?"

"Yes~" Relief swept through the group. Immediate, emphatic relief.

For their first time, they each wanted to be alone with him. A longer wait was a small price to pay.

After a brief huddle, they settled on an order, and eleven of them filed out, leaving one behind—a woman whose shyness deepened without her companions as a buffer.

Qin Jiang drew her close. "I remember you. You're Mei'er, right?"

"Mm~" She nodded, a ripple of delight passing through her. He remembered her name. Her eyes softened further as she slipped her arms around his neck. "Can we start... getting acquainted?"

"Heh, of course."

He kissed her gently, then swept her up and carried her to the bed, laying her down before settling beside her. In his arms, Mei'er was stiff with nerves, completely unsure what to do.

He kissed the tip of her nose, then her lips, whispering, "Mei'er, relax."

"Mm~"

She closed her eyes, returning his kiss as the tension gradually left her body. After a while, their lips parted and Qin Jiang smiled. "Ready to begin?"

"Okay~"

She looked at him and swallowed hard, trembling slightly from sheer nervousness. He smoothed her brow with gentle strokes, patiently putting her at ease. Under his touch, layer after layer of clothing fell away until she curled shyly against his chest.

"Mei'er, here we go."

"Mm~"

A small gasp, a tightening of her grip, a slight furrow of her brow. His kiss found her lips again, and the discomfort melted away.

After a moment, he pulled back. "How do you feel?"

"Okay~"

"Does it hurt?"

"Just a tiny bit. I can handle it. Let's keep going."

Qin Jiang shook his head with a smile, pinching her cheek gently. "I'm not going anywhere. There's no rush."

"Oh~" Warmth flooded her chest. Pressed against him, she felt safe and warm in every sense.

Her body and mind relaxed completely. After a while, she looked up at him expectantly. He raised an eyebrow. "Ready?"

"Mm~"

He didn't hesitate, moving forward while coaching her through it. Mei'er proved an eager student, though her stamina left something to be desired—less than two hours in, she was spent.

He held her as she rested, then pinched her cheek. "Get some sleep, Mei'er."

"Mm~"

As he started to rise, her hand shot out and caught his arm. She gazed at him, eyes shimmering. "Could you stay a little longer?"

"Of course."

He lay back down, gathered her into his arms, and kissed her cheek. "Mei'er, you can always tell me what you want. Just now, wanting me to stay—all you had to do was ask. I'm more than happy to."

"Really?"

"Absolutely." He tightened his embrace. "You're so soft and warm. I'd hold you all day if I could."

"Then hold me a little longer," she said with a happy laugh, nestling deeper into his chest, her head on his heart. She looked up at his face and smiled contentedly.

He really was wonderful. Around him, she didn't have to be so formal. She could be a little selfish—like asking him to stay just a little while more.
