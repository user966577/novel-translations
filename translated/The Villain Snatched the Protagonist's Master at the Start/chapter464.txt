After half a month of cooking, Chef Qin had finally fed everyone to satisfaction. He walked out of the room, stretched, and collapsed into a lounge chair beneath the shade.

His consciousness drifted into the system space. 'Not bad — Villain Points have been climbing nicely. Nangong Yun's been having quite the time.'

Dealing with Fortune Heroines required his personal attention, but Children of Destiny were a different matter entirely. A few subordinates could handle them with ease. Nangong Yun was being played like a puppet on strings.

The same was true of Li Yang at Huaxia Academy, who'd devolved into Ye Xuan's complete lapdog — the kind with no independent thought. Whatever Ye Xuan said, he obeyed, like a puppet on strings. Even when he witnessed her being intimate with other men, he'd rationalize it for her. He'd even stand guard at the door. For his loyalty, Ye Xuan occasionally rewarded him — by letting him sniff her feet.

The degradation was absolute. And Li Yang was happy about it.

Qin Jiang had to hand it to Ye Xuan — her training methods were something else. She'd turned a Child of Destiny into a literal dog. Not that he cared about the details, as long as the Villain Points kept flowing. Keep up the good work.

Nangong Yun was holding up better. Despite constant humiliation, his dao heart remained firm. His resolve to avenge his brothers hadn't wavered — even after becoming a girl.

Qin Jiang organized his rewards and opened his eyes. "Two Children of Destiny aren't enough."

At this rate, he could barely fund his women to the levels he wanted. He'd burn through every last point with nothing left for the Heavenly Domain. That was unacceptable.

Unfortunately, Children of Destiny were an endangered species. He'd already killed quite a few, and finding more across the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands would take serious luck.

He shook his head, stood, and flickered outside the courtyard.

"Young Master." Black Dragon and Little Xu bowed.

"How's it going?"

"Everything proceeded exactly as you instructed." Black Dragon presented a full report, then produced the Mystic Yang Divine Stone.

Qin Jiang inspected it and nodded. "Perfect." The stone was for Mu Yunxiao's fire-origin reinforcement. He couldn't dedicate all his treasure to one woman — the others would riot. Besides, the stone represented a major fortune event for Nangong Yun. Stealing it meant system rewards on top of the practical benefit. Two birds with one stone.

He pocketed it. "What about the Zhou family?"

"Completely cooperative. They follow your every directive without hesitation."

Qin Jiang smiled. The Zhou family was connected to the Blood Tribe through marriage — specifically, Xue Yue's arranged marriage had been with a Zhou scion. That was why he'd pinned the blame on them in the first place, intending to pit them against the Child of Destiny. He hadn't expected them to be so obedient. Every order, executed flawlessly. It was making it hard to find an excuse to crush them.

Now that he'd established Huaxia, he couldn't always act on whim. If he destroyed a family this compliant, every other faction in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands would assume surrender was pointless and fight to the death instead.

He sighed. His reputation was the problem. People saw him as a bloodthirsty maniac, a lecherous fiend, a murderous lunatic — nothing flattering. They feared that submission would just lead to arbitrary slaughter. In truth, he'd always treated his own people well. But public perception was hard to change.

"The branch that married into the Blood Tribe — you have the full roster?"

Black Dragon produced a substantial list. "The intermarried branch isn't the main line, but it's a strong collateral bloodline. About a hundred thousand people, including one Human Immortal."

"A hundred thousand isn't many." For a major clan that reproduced across millennia, millions of descendants were standard. Most were nominal relatives with diluted blood. The real core rarely exceeded a few hundred thousand. This list contained tens of thousands with concentrated bloodline, though. Losing them all would sting.

He skimmed the list and tossed it back. "Have the Zhou family make preparations."

"Yes, sir."

After chatting briefly with his two old retainers, he sent them off and returned to the courtyard. The women were still in the room — probably digesting. He shook his head and looked up at the miniaturized airship hovering nearby.

Some women remained aboard, including a few fox cubs still in seclusion — and Chen Ningshuang. He wondered how they were developing.

He rubbed his hands together. "Puberty is crucial. I should pay more attention. Time for a checkup."
