"A few days ago, Jiang'er sent word. He wants us to dispatch people to the Divine Dragon Continent," Qin Hao said. "Going forward, we can develop in partnership with them."

The great-grandfather's eyes widened. "The Divine Dragon Continent? One of the Ten Lands, same as us?"

"That's right. Based on his message, he's essentially taken control of the Divine Dragon Continent. Our visit is just a formality. After that, we'll use the alliance with the Divine Dragon Continent as a springboard to conquer some of the smaller realms. Our growth rate has been too explosive—the Qin Domain's resources alone can't sustain it much longer."

The great-grandfather nodded. These were decisions for the ancestral elders. He didn't have the standing to weigh in.

He turned to Qin Hao with a curious look. "What realm is Jiang'er at now?"

"He didn't say exactly, but the Fourth Ancestor sent word—Jiang'er's already reached Saint Realm. And Lian'er is at Yin-Yang Realm."

At the mention of his children, a proud smile spread across Qin Hao's face. Both were a source of immense pride.

"Jiang'er's a Saint already," the great-grandfather marveled, then couldn't help glancing at the old man.

The old man had been listening with mounting disbelief. But hearing that Qin Jiang had reached Saint Realm genuinely shocked him. "That brat broke through to Saint?!"

"Hm?"

The great-grandfather's face darkened. "Brat? Careful with that tongue of yours, or you'll be picking up your teeth."

The old man: "..."

Watching his father get put in his place, Qin Hao stifled a laugh. The old man whipped around and glared at him. "You want a smacking too?"

Qin Hao: "..."

Three generations of Qin men. Filial piety at its finest.

On the Divine Dragon Continent.

Qin Jiang arrived at the palace and got straight to the point with the Dragon Emperor. "I'm leaving."

"When? Is there anything you need from me?" The Dragon Emperor maintained his warm demeanor.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Within the next day or two. And I've notified my family—someone will be coming."

"Oh?"

"Just one Divine Dragon Continent is a bit limiting for the Empire's growth, don't you think?"

"What are you planning?"

"What else? Unifying the entire realm."

Qin Jiang smiled faintly, making no effort to hide his ambition. Perhaps influenced by his ancestors in a previous life, he had a profound appetite for unification.

The Dragon Emperor was stunned. In his view, unifying a single continent was already the pinnacle of achievement. But unifying the entire realm?

"You're... serious?"

"Absolutely." Qin Jiang smiled. "But we're nowhere near strong enough yet. We'll develop quietly, start with the smaller realms, build up our forces. Once we've accumulated enough, we can move on the Ten Lands—and eventually, the Nine Heavens."

The Dragon Emperor fell silent. He was an ambitious man himself, but unifying the entire realm was beyond anything he'd dared to imagine.

"You don't really have a choice," Qin Jiang added lightly. "If you decline, I'll resort to less pleasant methods. The Divine Dragon Empire's strength can't withstand what I have at my disposal. So there's only one answer."

The Dragon Emperor's mouth twitched. Qin Jiang had immortal-path cultivators—the Empire genuinely couldn't resist.

He let out a bitter chuckle and nodded. "I'll cooperate."

Against someone this unreasonable and this powerful, he had absolutely no leverage.

Qin Jiang nodded, satisfied. He briefed the Dragon Emperor on several matters, then paused at the door. "About Long Yu—I'd suggest you forget about it. Think carefully about what matters more: one prince, or your entire empire."

He'd known the Dragon Emperor had been watching from the shadows when he destroyed Long Yu's primordial spirit. The man's restraint in not intervening—and his ability to still converse calmly afterward—was genuinely impressive.

The Dragon Emperor's smile faded slightly. He met Qin Jiang's gaze, was silent for a moment, then spoke. "Don't worry. I know what's at stake."

"Good. A prince who could fall to the demonic path—even if you pulled him back, he'd still be useless. He's not worth the trouble."

With that, Qin Jiang left.

Back in the Void Divine Temple, Qin Jiang made his way to the Demon Hall Founder's chamber. She was still in seclusion, racing to restore her peak strength.

His arrival roused her. She opened her eyes with a sweet smile. "You're here."

Gone was the initial frost—she'd discarded it entirely. Qin Jiang smiled and asked, "How's the recovery going?"

"About thirty percent."

A few days to thirty percent was remarkable progress, and the Founder was clearly pleased.

"Did you need something?"

She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and batted her lashes at Qin Jiang. Not far away, Jian Yao—who'd been watching the Founder like a hawk—let out a cold huff. She stalked over and nestled against Qin Jiang, glaring.

Qin Jiang wrapped an arm around Jian Yao's waist, gave it a reassuring squeeze, and then produced a pill on his palm.

The Heavenly Demon Pill. Already infused with his blood essence. Once the Founder consumed it, she'd develop an instinctive affinity toward him—one that would deepen over time.

He offered it to the Founder. Dense demonic qi wafted from the pill's surface, and the Founder's eyes widened with interest. She could feel that this pill would benefit her enormously.

"What is this?"

She took the Heavenly Demon Pill, examining it curiously.

"An immortal-grade pill. The Heavenly Demon Pill," Qin Jiang said.

"Immortal-grade?" The Founder gasped.

Even as an immortal-path powerhouse, she'd never encountered an immortal-grade pill. And this one seemed tailor-made for her. Just holding it made the demonic qi in her body stir with excitement. If she consumed it, the effects would be extraordinary.

"For me?" She looked at Qin Jiang in disbelief.

He nodded with a smile. "The Heavenly Demon Pill only reaches its full potential in the hands of a demonic cultivator. You're the perfect candidate."

For a moment, the Demon Hall Founder felt genuinely moved. She looked at Qin Jiang with softened eyes—a warmth that came from somewhere deep and sincere. For the first time, she felt truly cared for.

She didn't know, of course, that this caring came packaged with a little scheme.
