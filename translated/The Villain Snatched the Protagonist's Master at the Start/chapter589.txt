After enslaving Tianji, Qin Jiang returned to the immortal ship.

Mengjin, Mengqian, and Mo Shanshan were all aboard. With the Grand Elder ousted and his loyalists enslaved via True Spirit Slave Seal, the Third Elder had been promoted to the new Grand Elder's position. Nearly every loose end had been left for the Third Elder to handle, while Mengjin—the Empress—had been indulging in nightly revelry, thoroughly neglecting her royal duties. Fortunately, the Merfolk tribe was stable enough to weather an absent ruler without falling into chaos.

Aboard the immortal ship, several days passed. Without a hint of surprise, Qin Jiang emerged triumphant once again, having thoroughly conquered everyone. Surveying the exhausted women around him, he rubbed his chin and mused that he really ought to find them more sisters. There simply wasn't enough challenge anymore.

"Tianji's former fiancee is nice," he muttered to himself. "And there's that woman on Zhao Sheng's side too. I'll need to claim them both."

After a moment's thought, he decided to handle Zhao Sheng's situation first. Those two were supposedly in love—if he didn't move quickly, Zhao Sheng might actually win her over. As for Tianji's fiancee, there was no rush. The Dao Covenant was still in play, Tianji was right under his thumb with the True Spirit Slave Seal, and the two had no chance of reuniting. Besides, her faction was powerful enough that he'd need proper preparations.

By comparison, Zhao Sheng's side was much simpler. One Human Immortal patriarch—Qin Jiang's arrival would leave the man beside himself.

Decision made, Qin Jiang wasted no time. He gathered Black Dragon, Little Xu, and Tianji—whom he'd brought along for safekeeping despite the seal—and set off for Zhao Sheng's territory.

In under half a day, the four arrived near the Zhao family estate. Rather than show themselves, they covertly summoned Liu Xing.

"Greetings, Manor Lord." Liu Xing bowed respectfully.

Qin Jiang smiled and lifted him up with a wave of energy. "Liu Xing, right? You've done excellent work."

"Thank you for the praise, Manor Lord." Liu Xing's face lit up. Then, eager to report, he added, "Manor Lord, while staying with the Zhao family these past few days, I made another discovery."

"Oh?" Qin Jiang raised a brow. "What discovery?"

"Heh heh. I heard from Zhao Sheng that he's got a woman he's after, but she belongs to a rival faction. I snuck over to take a look these past few days, and... well, a woman like that is only fit for someone like you, Manor Lord."

Qin Jiang didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Apparently, everyone under him had figured out his weakness for beautiful women and kept trying to funnel them his way. Still, the woman Liu Xing mentioned was almost certainly his actual target.

Seeing Qin Jiang's expression, Liu Xing's excitement dimmed. He asked tentatively, "Manor Lord, are you not interested?"

"It's not that. I just came here specifically for her."

"Huh?" Liu Xing blinked, then deflated slightly. There went his credit—the Manor Lord had already known. But no matter. He'd keep trying. Sooner or later, he'd spot one the Manor Lord hadn't found yet.

Taking a steadying breath, Liu Xing produced a scroll. "Manor Lord, here's her portrait. It also lists her preferences and habits—all compiled by Zhao Sheng. Should be accurate."

Qin Jiang took the scroll and unfurled it. Even he couldn't help the flash of admiration in his eyes. A fortune heroine—naturally stunning. As for the listed preferences, he didn't bother reading them. Since when did he need to court anyone?

Rolling up the scroll, Qin Jiang smiled at Liu Xing. "Good work. Head back. Once this mission wraps up, you can pick any Immortal King-grade treasure you want."

"Thank you, Manor Lord!" Liu Xing was elated. An Immortal King-grade treasure would dramatically boost his strength, and with greater strength came greater assignments, more merit, and even more power—a virtuous cycle. Who knew? He might eventually reach Black Dragon's level.

Without lingering, Liu Xing bowed and departed, returning to the Zhao family compound.

Qin Jiang's group, meanwhile, headed for the other family—the Yang family, where the woman resided.

Like the Zhao family, the Yang family was something of a local power within a few hundred miles. But as the Zhao family rose, the Yang family's influence had steadily waned, breeding deep resentment. They provoked constant friction, yet couldn't actually do anything about it—the Zhao family was at least their equal, if not slightly stronger. The crux of the issue was potential. While the Yang family had produced a talented scion of their own, they still couldn't match Zhao Sheng. It made for a frustrating existence.

Within fifteen minutes, Qin Jiang's group arrived at the Yang family estate. Compared to the Zhao family, it had a more ancient feel—the Yang family had clearly occupied this territory far longer. This had been their domain, and the Zhao family were relative newcomers who'd somehow overtaken them.

"Let's go have a look." Qin Jiang smiled.

The city was under Yang family control—a decent-sized settlement with the family compound at its center. The streets weren't exactly bustling, but neither were they deserted. Ordinary, peaceful.

As they strolled along, Qin Jiang ended up carrying a basket of spirit fruit. One should bring gifts when visiting, after all. He walked right up to the Yang compound as if he owned the place. The guards at the gate barely had time to react before Black Dragon and Little Xu laid them out flat.

Tianji twitched at the corner of his mouth. This brand of thuggery was still taking some getting used to. He hung back, following at a distance.

With zero resistance the entire way, they soon located the woman's residence after making a few inquiries. It was in a rather remote corner of the estate—clearly, she'd fallen out of favor. Understandable enough. Because of her, a family elder had been prevented from disrupting Zhao Sheng's breakthrough, allowing the Zhao family to surpass the Yang family.

'Just one look at the guy, without ever exchanging a single word, and she'd stood against her own family for him. Total lovesick fool,' Qin Jiang mused. Of course, there was a strong chance the Child of Destiny's fortune aura had influenced her.

Qin Jiang smiled, spirit fruit in hand, and approached her gate. He raised his hand and knocked politely—several gentle raps. Rather courteous of him, actually.

No response came from inside. He waited a moment, briefly hesitated, then lifted his foot and kicked the gate open.

Inside the courtyard, a composed young woman looked up in stunned surprise.
