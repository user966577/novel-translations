The students settled into their quarters. Elite residences occupied the campus's prime real estate — private courtyards, each one distinct, numbered one through thirty.

Ye Xuan's was Courtyard One. The best of the best.

She'd barely finished unpacking when a knock came at the gate. She opened it to find Zhao Juncai, beaming.

"Congratulations, Miss Ye Xuan! Your entrance performance was the finest of anyone. The academy will certainly invest heavily in you."

"Zhao Juncai — hello." She smiled warmly. "You did wonderfully yourself. Thirty elites, and you're one of them. That's nothing to dismiss."

"I'm nowhere near your level." He waved off the compliment. "You placed first. I'm dead last among the elites — number thirty. The gap is enormous."

"You're too modest."

They chatted easily in the doorway. Meanwhile, not far away, Li Yang hid behind a wall, watching the scene with a sour expression.

As a remedial student, he didn't even have a room. He was supposed to build one himself. But the moment he'd been released, he'd come straight here — worried that Ye Xuan might be harassed, given that she and Zhao Juncai lived in the same elite district.

And here they were, chatting like old friends.

The sight made him feel like a man wearing a green hat.

"Could you three listen in on what they're saying?" he whispered to the sword spirits.

He stared at the pair, but they were too far away to overhear. He didn't dare draw conclusions — not about Ye Xuan. Not without proof.

"Kid, do you know where you are?" one of the sword spirits snapped. "This is Huaxia Academy — True Immortals, maybe even an Immortal King. We're already taking a risk masking your aura. If anyone detects us, can you guarantee the Chaos Sword stays in your hands?"

"Romance is clouding your judgment," another added. "Don't let it consume you."

"But she's been so kind to me!" His fists clenched.

They hadn't known each other long, but the warmth, the attention, the care — these were things he'd never experienced before. He genuinely wanted to be with Ye Xuan. He felt more for her than he'd ever felt for Li Qingqiu.

The sword spirits fell silent. They'd watched Ye Xuan's behavior, too. She had indeed looked after Li Yang throughout the trials.

What they hadn't noticed were the moments of undisguised contempt she'd hidden behind his back.

"Fine. One quick scan. But that's it."

The spirits extended their senses for a brief moment, then withdrew.

"Well, well. Looks like you really did strike gold, kid. That girl went to talk to him specifically to help you."

"Help me?"

"Yep. Sounds like she's worried about you. She knows you don't have a room, so she's asking that Zhao kid to let you bunk with him. And she put in a good word — said that even though you're remedial now, you have real potential to climb. Kid, this girl may not match Li Qingqiu in looks, but the way she treats you? You won't find better. Don't let her slip away."

Gratitude surged through Li Yang, followed by a wave of shame. Just moments ago, he'd been doubting her — and all along, she'd been advocating for him.

During the exam, Ye Xuan had been visibly disgusted by Zhao Juncai. But now she was swallowing her discomfort, engaging him pleasantly — all for Li Yang's sake.

Watching her silhouette from his hiding spot, he wanted to slap himself. He didn't deserve her.

"The Zhao kid will probably offer to room with you. The elite quarter's spiritual energy is far denser than the remedial zone — way better for cultivation. Accept it."

"Room with Zhao Juncai?" Li Yang frowned.

The elite quarter was undeniably superior. But he and Zhao Juncai had history, and the thought of living with the man felt like accepting charity.

"She swallowed her pride to get you this opportunity, and you're turning up your nose?"

"But—"

"What — you'd rather live with her?"

His face reddened. He'd be lying if he said the thought hadn't crossed his mind. Proximity bred affection. If they lived under the same roof, their relationship would deepen quickly, and then maybe...

"Listen to yourself. She's a young lady who went out of her way to arrange this for you. You want to repay that by being greedy? Step one is getting into the elite quarter. That puts you close to her. Once your relationship develops further, you can move in together naturally. Get it?"
