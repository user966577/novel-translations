The woman trembled from head to toe. This man was a deviant.

But she couldn't exactly stop resisting, could she? Yet the more she fought, the more excited he became. No matter what she did, the outcome was already decided. Despair filled her heart. She couldn't even take her own life—she could only endure his violation.

Barely fifteen minutes in, and she was already losing strength. What made it worse—far worse—was that her body had begun responding.

Qin Jiang noticed the change immediately. He paused, assessed the situation, then grinned. "Looks like we're ready for the real thing."

"No—" she pleaded, but her voice now carried a hint of softness that undermined her protest.

Qin Jiang ignored her. They'd come this far—there was no stopping now. The arrow was nocked; it had to fly.

She felt it coming and her eyes went wide with terror. Her small hands clamped onto his arms, voice shaking. "Please—don't—"

The words had barely left her mouth when a pained gasp escaped her. Her body went rigid, then completely limp, all resistance draining away. She stared up at the ceiling, tears streaming silently. Her pale cheeks made for a pitiable sight.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang tended to her with his energy. Before long, color returned to her face and the weakness began to fade. She clenched her fists and bit her lip, trying not to make a sound—but those soft, treacherous sounds escaped anyway.

Only when Qin Jiang pulled her into a tight embrace did her eyes go hazy, and she wrapped her arms around him in return.

"Enjoying yourself?" He brushed the tangled hair from her face and kissed her cheek gently. She whimpered softly but didn't answer. Her body told him everything he needed to know. He smiled and let his actions speak for themselves.

Four hours later.

The woman lay spent on the bed, cheeks flushed, a trace of fatigue in her expression. But tears were still slipping from her eyes. Everything was gone—taken by this stranger who'd appeared out of nowhere.

"Still crying? Don't you like it?" Qin Jiang reached for her tears.

She turned her head away, avoiding his touch. He arched a brow, clicked his tongue—then gripped her chin and turned her face back toward him. The force was a touch much; a flash of pain crossed her features. Qin Jiang wiped her tears away gently, his expression tender.

"Be good. No more crying."

He leaned in and kissed her softly. She tried to resist, but she had no strength left. Qin Jiang released her, dressed himself, and then began dressing her.

"Don't touch me!" She started resisting again.

In response, Qin Jiang tossed her clothes aside, tore off his own again, and smirked. "That's it—keep fighting. It's my favorite."

"You—"

She went still. She hurried to curl up in the corner of the bed, but there was no escaping him.

Another hour passed.

This time, when Qin Jiang helped her dress, she cooperated. Quietly, obediently. He pinched her cheek and smiled. "Good girl."

He picked her up. She instinctively started to struggle, then remembered the consequences and went docile, looping her arms around his neck. He carried her out of the room and toward the courtyard gate.

"Where are you taking me?"

"Just going out for a bit."

"No!" Her face turned scarlet. She was fully dressed, but being carried by him was mortifying enough. Being seen would be unbearable. "Put me down. I'll walk."

Qin Jiang studied her, then set her on her feet. The moment she touched the ground, her legs buckled—every step brought searing pain, and her whole body felt boneless. She gritted her teeth and tried to tough it out.

Qin Jiang swept her up again. "Don't push yourself. Just be a good girl."

She genuinely didn't dare resist. She could only let him carry her and pray they wouldn't run into too many people.

The moment they stepped through the gate, however, she saw a dense crowd gathered outside. Three of them were Qin Jiang's companions. The rest were all Yang family members—and her father stood at the very front. The man who was usually so commanding, so domineering, was hunched over with a sycophantic smile plastered across his face.

She stared, stunned. In that instant, she understood: the man holding her was someone of extraordinary standing.

"Young Master." Black Dragon and the others bowed.

Her father scurried over, flicked a quick glance at her—then looked away immediately, bowing deeply. "Yang Hong of the Yang family, at your service."

"At ease." Qin Jiang smiled, then glanced at the woman in his arms. "As things stand, you could say I'm your father-in-law now."

"I wouldn't dare presume!" Yang Hong's servility bordered on groveling. "For my daughter to receive your favor is her great fortune. That I've had the honor of meeting you is already more blessing than I deserve."

His deference ran deep. It had started when some clan members reported being knocked unconscious. He'd traced the incident here and found three True Immortals standing guard outside—and these three were just the doormen. The real figure of power was inside the courtyard, with his daughter...

While it might be unfortunate for his daughter, for the Yang family, this could be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Or it could be catastrophe—powerful men were capricious, and one wrong move could mean annihilation. So Yang Hong didn't dare show the slightest discourtesy.

In Qin Jiang's arms, the woman watched her father's groveling display. Her heart ached. She looked up at Qin Jiang, her gaze tinged with resentment. Was this why he'd brought her out? To show her this?

She took a deep breath, swallowed her bitterness, and spoke. "What exactly do you want?"

"Isn't it obvious?" Qin Jiang smiled and jerked his chin toward the Yang family crowd. "I'm using them to keep you in line. If you misbehave..." His voice dropped. "One word from me, and they all die."
