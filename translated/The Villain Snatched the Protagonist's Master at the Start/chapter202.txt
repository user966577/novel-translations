Within the sealed space, terrifying power surged and churned.

The Black Water Serpent powerhouses went rigid, their gazes fixing on the petite girl with undisguised horror.

"The Immortal path..." one Emperor managed, his throat bobbing as he forced the words out.

Chen Changsheng had already noticed Mo Mo. He'd witnessed her strength before and knew she was an Immortal-path cultivator. The moment she stepped forward, he quietly retreated, doing everything he could to minimize his presence.

Sensing the panic around her, Mo Mo let out a sweet giggle. She extended her pale, slender hand and squeezed.

Every heart in the vicinity clenched at once.

Agonized screams erupted as the weaker Black Water Serpent cultivators had their hearts explode outright, blasting gaping holes through their chests. In a single instant, nearly ten thousand Black Water Serpent fighters were cut down to a fraction, their blood flowing freely and staining the earth crimson.

The surviving Black Water Serpent cultivators were gripped by even deeper terror. Several Great Emperors didn't hesitate for a second—they turned and fled.

But...

"Think you can run?" Mo Mo murmured to herself.

She flicked her wrist, and the spilled blood of the fallen rose into the air under her control, coalescing into gleaming blood arrows that shot outward in every direction. Anyone below the Supreme Realm who touched one died instantly. Even the Supreme-level cultivators couldn't fully resist—the slightest contact left them grievously wounded.

Mo Mo ignored these ants entirely. Her beautiful eyes locked onto the fleeing Great Emperors with unwavering focus.

The Emperors felt her gaze like a blade at their backs, scattering in desperate panic like fish that had slipped through a net. As the death toll climbed and the surrounding blood-qi thickened, Mo Mo whispered, "It's been a while since I've used the Blood Curse."

The ambient blood-qi began to converge, forming several eerie, pulsating runes. Yu Lan and the others watched, their scalps prickling.

The runes trembled once, then vanished.

In the next instant, the fleeing Emperors froze mid-flight. Their faces flushed an unnatural crimson, and blood blisters erupted across every inch of exposed skin. Their bodies convulsed violently. The blisters on their faces burst one after another, spraying flesh and blood outward, and—most horrifying of all—the blood itself was boiling.

"AHHH!" The Emperors howled in agony.

Their blood boiled. Their flesh dissolved. No matter what techniques they employed, nothing could stop it. The pain was absolute. The terror, beyond measure.

"A demon! She's a demon!" one Emperor screamed.

These were unmistakably demonic techniques.

Mo Mo pursed her lips. So what if she was a demon? Even demons were loved by someone.

She shifted her hand seal, and the blood within the Emperors went completely berserk. With one final, convulsive shriek, every last Emperor detonated where they stood, their life force snuffed out in an instant. As for the rest of the Black Water Serpent forces, they'd already been annihilated by the blood arrows.

"All done!" Mo Mo said, nodding with satisfaction.

Yu Lan and the others stared at her. None of them had expected her to be a demonic cultivator.

"What you've seen today doesn't leave this group," Yu Lan ordered.

An Immortal-path demon—if word got out to the wrong people, she could become a public enemy of all Azure Cloud Heaven.

The Purple-Scale Serpent clanspeople nodded solemnly. Righteous or demonic, Mo Mo had fought on their behalf. That was what mattered.

But besides the Purple-Scale Serpent faction... there was still one outsider present.

---

Chen Changsheng lurked nearby, watching the entire spectacle unfold. He'd discovered that Mo Mo was a demonic cultivator, and the revelation sent a spark of excitement through him. A demon! This was something he could use. He'd finally found a way to defeat Qin Jiang.

But just as his mind was racing with possibilities, a tremendous force seized him, wrenching him from hiding and slamming him into the ground.

Yu Lan stared down at Chen Changsheng, killing intent flickering in her beautiful eyes. He was an unstable variable.

"Qin Jiang, are you sure we shouldn't just kill him?" she asked, glancing at Mo Mo as she spoke. Mo Mo, for her part, seemed unconcerned. Her demonic identity being exposed wasn't something she particularly feared. In her prime, she'd turned the world upside down all on her own. Now she had Qin Jiang by her side, plus that madwoman and Xue Mei. If it came to a real fight, they might very well flip all of Azure Cloud Heaven on its head.

Qin Jiang looked at Chen Changsheng and shook his head. "Just rough him up a bit to blow off some steam. This guy's still useful."

He could sense that Chen Changsheng's Reincarnation Law had grown somewhat, but it still wasn't complete. The man clearly hadn't been putting in the effort. A good beating would give him some hatred to fuel his motivation.

At Qin Jiang's words, Yu Ru cracked her knuckles, practically bouncing with excitement. But Yu Lan caught her arm.

"Don't bother dirtying your hands," she said, then turned to several of their Great Emperor elders. They understood her meaning immediately. With synchronized nods, they closed in on Chen Changsheng.

"You—" Chen Changsheng's expression darkened.

He'd heard every word of their conversation. He didn't know why Qin Jiang had chosen to spare his life, but staying alive was obviously preferable. The only catch was the beating he was about to receive.

The Great Emperor elders surrounded him, and on Yu Lan's orders, they proceeded to pummel him with kicks and punches. Chen Changsheng barely fought back. Enduring a beating in exchange for his life? Seemed like a fair trade.

Until someone's foot found a very unfortunate target.

Chen Changsheng's face flushed crimson. He threw his head back and howled, then curled into a ball, clutching himself between the legs. Some sneaky bastard had kicked him square in the groin.

The searing pain made him see red. He raised a trembling hand—it was covered in blood.

"Blood..." His vision swam. 'Please don't let it be crushed,' he thought desperately. Beyond the pain, he couldn't feel anything at all.

In a burst of fury, he tried to fight back, but against multiple Great Emperors, his resistance was swatted down instantly. The beating only intensified.

It wasn't until Qin Jiang called a halt that the elders finally stopped, all smiles. "Master Qin, was that satisfactory?"

Chen Changsheng lay on the ground, drenched in blood, looking like a dead dog.

Qin Jiang walked over, clicked his tongue in sympathy, then casually kicked Chen Changsheng, launching him into the distance like a soccer ball. Who knew how far he flew.

He probably wouldn't die. And maybe he'd stumble into some fortunate encounter that would accelerate his mastery of the Reincarnation Law.

"Chen Changsheng, you'd better pick up the pace," Qin Jiang muttered.

Wanting to pluck the fruit but wishing it would ripen faster—that was Qin Jiang in a nutshell.

With Chen Changsheng dealt with, the next order of business was the Snake Race itself. He turned to Yu Lan. "Lan Lan, let's head straight back to the Snake Race."
