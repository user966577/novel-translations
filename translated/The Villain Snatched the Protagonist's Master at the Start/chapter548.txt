He glared at Little Xu and swung back. Little Xu caught his hand, then delivered another resounding slap with the other. Simultaneously, his aura erupted, blasting the man backward. The other Skyreach City enforcers scrambled to catch him.

Two handprints—one on each cheek—made for a comical sight.

He flung his colleagues away, seething, but didn't dare retaliate. All he could do was rage. "You bastard! How dare you hit me? Do you know who I am?"

"Like I care." Little Xu rolled his eyes. With the Young Master backing him, why would he fear a measly True Immortal?

"Fine. Fine! Fine!" The man laughed in fury, jabbing a finger at Little Xu. "I'm telling you—you're finished! My brother-in-law is the lord of Skyreach City! You've made an enemy of the entire city!"

"The lord of Skyreach City?" Little Xu blinked and glanced at Qin Jiang—whose eyes were sparkling even brighter.

He had connections.

Qin Jiang wasted no more time. With a wave, he sealed every one of the Skyreach City enforcers. "Tie them up."

Black Dragon and Little Xu moved with practiced efficiency, binding the captives in moments.

"You—! How dare you! Do you realize what you're doing?! My brother-in-law won't let this go!" The man continued his threats.

Qin Jiang ignored him entirely. He turned to the other captives. "Is his brother-in-law really the city lord?"

Though angry, they could read the situation. They nodded reluctantly. One managed a warning: "You'd better release us. Otherwise, there won't be a place for you in the entire Heavenly Domain."

"Heh." Qin Jiang chuckled. He freed one of them with a flick and said, "Go tell your city lord—if he wants his brother-in-law alive, he can send his wife to make the trade. Heh heh. I've always had a thing for married women."

The Skyreach City people's faces went rigid. But inwardly, they breathed a sigh of relief. Once the city lord heard this, he'd be livid enough to come personally—which meant reinforcements.

"Fine. Just you wait!" The freed man shot toward Skyreach City at full speed, terrified Qin Jiang might change his mind.

Skyreach City itself was relatively deserted—nothing more than a waystation. Most travelers passed through quickly. The only lively area was the city lord's manor.

The messenger navigated layers of protocol before reaching the city lord—a burly man whose face darkened the instant he heard the report.

"What?!"

"They're from the lower realms, my lord. They were fighting within our jurisdiction. When we tried to enforce the rules, they showed no respect whatsoever! They insulted Skyreach City, and—" the messenger hesitated "—they even insulted you personally, my lord. We couldn't let that stand and tried to apprehend them, but their strength exceeded expectations. After a fierce battle, they ambushed us. I barely escaped with my life."

"Unforgivable!" The city lord slammed the table. "They dare disrespect Skyreach City? Send men immediately! Bring them back in chains—I'll make them pay!"

"My lord, there's a message. They said..." The messenger glanced nervously at him, swallowed, and continued in a small voice, "They said to send your wife in exchange for your brother-in-law. Otherwise, they'll kill the hostages."

BOOM!

The city lord's aura exploded outward. Rage contorted his features. "Arrogant! This is a direct insult! They're dead!"

"The leader also said he has a thing for married women, and he wants your wife to—"

Before he could finish, the city lord's palm smashed into his chest. Fury radiated through the entire city.

The messenger crumpled to the floor, trembling with terror and regret. He'd embellished too much. He watched the city lord, praying the man wouldn't kill him outright.

The city lord's burning gaze fell on him. Just as the messenger opened his mouth to beg, the city lord seized him by the collar.

"Take me there. I'll deal with them myself!"

"Y-y-yes, my lord..."

He stuttered and nodded frantically. They burst from the city. The city lord spotted the ships from a distance and hurled the messenger aside, charging straight for the flotilla.

He'd considered smashing the lead ship outright, but remembered his brother-in-law was aboard as a hostage. He forced his rage down and stopped before the vessel, aura churning.

"Release my people! Or die!"

"Die? Heh. Bold words for a mere Immortal King."

A cool voice drifted from inside the ship. In the next instant, the city lord's towering aura melted like snow under the sun.

His face froze. Immortal Emperor!

Without an instant's hesitation, he tried to retreat to the city. Inside those walls, even an Immortal Emperor couldn't touch him. But he'd already arrived—it would be rude to leave without sitting down.

Overwhelming Emperor's pressure engulfed him. In a heartbeat, every drop of his power was suppressed. Terror flooded his face. An irresistible force dragged him onto the ship and slammed him down on the deck.

After the world stopped spinning, the city lord lifted his head. A cluster of bound enforcers lay to one side. And standing around him—

One Immortal King. Two. Three. Four. Five...

Eight Immortal Kings.

And, of course, one Immortal Emperor.
