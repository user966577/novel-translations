"You..."

Long Xin'er stared at Qin Jiang in shock. How did he look even more relaxed than her?

Could he be a descendant of the founder too? Impossible, right? If he were, then their bloodlines would be...

A bit taboo.

For a moment, all sorts of strange thoughts flickered through Long Xin'er's mind.

Then Qin Jiang took her hand. The instant he did, the pressure bearing down on her receded like a retreating tide.

"Let's go."

He smiled easily.

Inwardly, he was forming a much clearer picture of the Immortal King Seal's power. He hadn't even drawn on its energy—he'd simply taken it out of his system space and tucked it against his chest. That alone had been enough to nullify the stairs' pressure entirely, as though the ancient restriction didn't dare press against the Seal.

Long Xin'er stood dazed for a moment. Then Qin Jiang's hand closed around hers, and she let him lead her upward. No pressure at all.

This clearly had nothing to do with bloodline.

Her bright eyes fixed on Qin Jiang, glittering with admiration. From their initial transaction to now, she'd discovered more and more of his remarkable qualities. Some unhinged ones too, admittedly. But on balance, those hardly mattered.

To her, Qin Jiang was the finest man she'd ever met. Worthy of a lifetime's trust.

Before they knew it, Qin Jiang had led Long Xin'er past the majority of climbers. The imperial scions gaped at the sight of him. How had he gotten up here? And why was he ascending faster—and more effortlessly—than any of them?

Their eyes went blank, feet stalling. They stared after Qin Jiang. Whose home turf was this, exactly? Because it certainly didn't feel like theirs anymore.

Up ahead, Long Yu glanced back. His eyes nearly popped from their sockets.

Qin Jiang. Again.

He was dumbfounded. All the earlier fortunes that had been stolen, he could accept—but the Dragon Palace was different. Only imperial bloodline could set foot on these stairs. This was supposed to be his arena.

He'd come in brimming with confidence. This time, victory was assured.

But who could have predicted that Qin Jiang would waltz right up?

An outsider. How was he on these stairs?

For a moment, Long Yu questioned reality. Was the empire's most sacred treasure really about to be carried off by a foreigner?

"No!" He gritted his teeth and whipped around, pouring every ounce of strength into climbing.

He had to beat Qin Jiang to the top.

But while Long Yu huffed and puffed his way up the staircase, Qin Jiang and Long Xin'er strolled past him as if on flat ground. Qin Jiang even turned, flashed him a thumbs-up, and said:

"Good pace. Keep it up!"

Watching Long Yu's slack-jawed expression, Long Xin'er couldn't help but laugh. Qin Jiang really knew how to twist the knife.

But it felt wonderful.

She'd always detested Long Yu. Now, finally, someone could put him in his place.

Past Long Yu, the rest of the ascent was smooth sailing. Qin Jiang and Long Xin'er arrived at the palace gates. She beamed at the grand doors before them.

"Let's go in."

Qin Jiang stepped forward and pushed. The gates swung wide.

A flash of light—Qin Jiang squinted as a golden sphere rocketed toward the exit. He flung out a hand, devouring force erupting from his palm. The golden sphere lurched to a halt, trembling in midair.

Long Xin'er's face lit up. "Is that the Dragon Pearl?"

"Should be. Your founding ancestor's legacy. Though..." Qin Jiang kept the sphere locked in his grip. Had the thing just tried to escape? Or rather, it had already chosen its heir.

He relaxed his hold slightly. Instantly, the Dragon Pearl broke free, streaking past them and shooting downward toward the stairs.

Qin Jiang snorted, leapt after it, and snatched it out of the air.

"A glorified marble thinking it gets to pick its own master?"

Pearl in hand, he returned to Long Xin'er's side. She frowned. The Dragon Pearl didn't seem to accept her.

"Qin Jiang, this Dragon Pearl..."

"No worries. I'll educate it."

He waved her off, stowed the Dragon Pearl in his system space, and pulled out the Immortal King Seal. A few solid whacks later, the Dragon Pearl was quaking.

After a suitable period of discipline, he retrieved it. The difference was obvious—even without restraints, the pearl sat meekly in his palm, not daring to twitch.

"There we go."

He smiled and handed it to Long Xin'er. As a bearer of the dragon bloodline, she could draw out the Dragon Pearl's full potential. Long Yu's bloodline was purer, technically—but the Ninth Prince was a Child of Destiny, so that disqualified him on principle.

Long Xin'er accepted the pearl, eyeing it curiously. One moment it had been wild and defiant; a few seconds later, docile as a lamb. What had he done to it?

She toyed with it briefly. Satisfied it wasn't fighting back, she tucked it away. The two entered the palace proper, where everything gleamed and sparkled.

Dragons loved to hoard shiny things. Black Dragon had quite the collection himself. Useless, the lot of it—but to their kind, it was beautiful.

"Doesn't seem like there's much else here," Long Xin'er remarked. The glittering junk didn't interest her.

Qin Jiang nodded but swept it all up anyway. Who knew what a Child of Destiny might dig out of this rubbish?

"Might as well take the whole palace," he muttered.

Just then, Long Yu and a crowd of imperial scions appeared at the gates. Qin Jiang blinked—then understood. The stairs' pressure had come from the Dragon Pearl. Now that it was gone, the restriction had vanished.

"Where's everything?" Long Yu surveyed the empty interior, his face darkening. Cleaner than a burglary.

Qin Jiang flicked his wrist dismissively. "Shoo. As of now, this Dragon Palace belongs to me. Stop trampling my property."

Long Yu: "..."

The imperial scions: "..."

"Qin Jiang, this was left by our founding ancestor—"

"Your ancestor's been dead for ages. Finders keepers."

Qin Jiang sent them all flying with a single palm strike, then looped an arm around Long Xin'er's waist and leapt down from the palace. He set her aside, then crouched and gripped the base of the staircase.

"Up we go!"

With a thunderous rumble, the Dragon Palace shuddered and tore free of the ground. He heaved, wrenching it skyward.

"Heavy," he grunted. He remembered Fourth Ancestor hauling an entire mountain—by comparison, one palace was child's play.

A few experimental hefts later, Qin Jiang willed it into his system space.

"Done!"

Uprooted, root and stem. Let the Child of Destiny find treasure now.

The onlookers stood frozen. Long Yu's face twitched, fury blazing behind his eyes. Not even a hair left for him.
