On that day, six Great Emperors of the Qin family stepped into the world.

Six. The remaining four drops of Great Emperor blood essence had successfully produced two more, bringing the total to six.

They strode across the land, their auras vast and domineering, hammering against the hearts of every living being on the continent. Ancient powerhouses all across Heavenly Mystery Continent gazed upward in horror at the six majestic figures.

"Great Emperors! How is this possible—Great Emperors vanished from the continent ten thousand years ago!"

"They're all from the Qin family. Six Great Emperors, hidden all this time!"

"When did they break through? Six of them? Good heavens!"

"Damn it—the Qin family is this powerful? How do they have so many Great Emperors?"

Shock rippled across the continent.

And then the six Great Emperors did something that sent that shock spiraling into outright terror. Their cold gazes swept toward several directions. Hands rose, and in that instant, the heavens and earth warped, as though the continent had been claimed by its new masters.

A single palm strike fell.

Screams erupted across the land.

"Qin family! What are you doing?"

"Damn you—you dare attack us?"

"No—please, mercy!"

The entire continent shook. In a heartbeat, several powerful clans were reduced to ash. Every witness went deathly pale.

The six Great Emperors showed no signs of slowing. Palm after palm rained down, and within a few breaths, dozens of clans had been annihilated—some that had clashed with the Qin family, some that the ancestors simply found distasteful. With the secret out, they might as well go all in.

"Done. Now handle Jiang'er's matter," the ancestors ordered.

The Qin family's forces mobilized. Over a hundred Supreme Realm cultivators fanned out across every corner of Heavenly Mystery Continent. Their mission: to resolve Qin Jiang's petty jealousy.

A trivial personal grudge—yet it was enough to drench an entire continent in blood.

Such was power. A casual whim from those at the peak could plunge countless ordinary people into despair.

Qin Jiang, of course, didn't care.

For three full days, the continent held its breath in deathly silence. People watched as Qin family Supremes descended upon clan after clan, naming individuals and making a single demand: death. Any clan that refused found a colossal palm smashing down from the sky, erasing them entirely.

Terror gripped the populace.

No one knew when the Qin family might come knocking.

After three days, the Qin family's Supremes gradually returned home, but the atmosphere across the continent remained suffocating. No one knew why the Qin family had gone on this rampage—some of the clans they'd destroyed seemed to have no connection to the Qin family at all. There was no telling if another wave of slaughter was coming.

Then a rumor began to circulate.

"The Qin family went on a killing spree because certain members of those clans once courted the Qin family young master's woman!"

Silence.

Most people refused to believe it. Just for that? A lovers' quarrel? The Qin family had unleashed six Great Emperors over a junior's jealousy? Impossible.

But as more details emerged, the silence deepened. The rumor was true.

The tragedy of it all. People lamented, and the common folk seethed—but no one dared voice their anger.

Every major clan issued immediate decrees: any woman the Qin family's young master fancied was to be avoided at all costs. You couldn't even look at her twice. And if he took a liking to your own wife? You'd hand her over with a smile and stand guard outside.

The Qin family's young master was not to be provoked. Period.

At the Holy Sword Sect, the leadership sat in stunned silence. They understood the full story better than anyone. None of them had imagined the Qin family was this powerful. Six Great Emperors.

The thought alone was terrifying. Even ten thousand years ago, the Qin family hadn't boasted this many.

On the bright side, Liu Shuwan—though technically a member of the Holy Sword Sect—had been so famously cold and unapproachable six thousand years ago that none of the sect's own people had dared go near her. Otherwise, they had no doubt Qin Jiang would have dragged their ancestors out for execution too.

'A beauty that launches a thousand calamities,' they sighed.

Qin Jiang's residence was perhaps the most peaceful place on the entire continent. He'd commandeered Little Red from Qin Lian'er and was absentmindedly poking at the little phoenix.

Qin Lian'er, meanwhile, was bragging about the family. "Hehe, Sis, isn't our Qin family amazing? Marrying into us—not a bad deal, right?"

She'd had no idea the family was this powerful. They could conquer the whole continent! She was bursting with pride.

Liu Shuwan and Bai Susu wore matching expressions of helplessness. Qin Lian'er had been going on about it for ages and still hadn't run out of steam.

To her credit, though, Qin Lian'er was considerate. She didn't overstay her welcome—soon enough, she reclaimed Little Red from Qin Jiang and left the residence.

A few more days passed.

There was no point lingering at the Holy Sword Sect any longer. Qin Jiang sent word to Bai Jingyun, then departed with Liu Shuwan and Bai Susu.

Watching the Void Beast vanish into the sky, the Holy Sword Sect's leadership could barely contain their tears of relief.

He was finally gone.

Qin Jiang, gazing down from the void, caught the scene and sighed. "They really can't bear to see me leave."

Liu Shuwan and Bai Susu both rolled their eyes, silently thinking the same thing: 'You have zero self-awareness.'

Qin Lian'er was more direct. She peered down at the celebrating elders and said, "Brother, I think they're thrilled you're leaving. Look—they've hung up lanterns. And are those firecrackers?"

Little Red nodded in agreement.

Qin Jiang shot her a look and rapped his knuckles on her forehead. "Don't talk nonsense. They're using smiles to mask their grief. How thoughtful of them, really."

Qin Lian'er fell silent.

As the traveling palace hurtled through the void, Qin Jiang watched the scenery rush by and reflected. The only regret from this trip was not encountering a new Child of Destiny.

Had Qin Lian'er's ability stopped working? No—more likely, she'd already been to Holy Sword City and triggered it once. They probably just needed to go somewhere new.
