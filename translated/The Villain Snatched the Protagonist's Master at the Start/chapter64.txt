The Holy Sword Sect arranged a dedicated residence for Qin Jiang. A procession of elders visited him there, approaching like juniors seeking guidance on matters of the sword. The stream of visitors didn't taper off until evening.

Once the last elder had departed—though Bai Jingyun still lingered—Qin Jiang asked, "Uncle Bai, I've heard the Holy Sword Sect has a place called Sword Valley?"

Bai Jingyun nodded, a note of pride in his voice. "That's right. Sword Valley was left behind by our sect's founding ancestor. Between you and me, our founder was also a Sword Emperor—and a Great Emperor on top of that." He chuckled. "Would you like to visit?"

"I'm curious," Qin Jiang said.

"If you're interested, I can take you tomorrow. It's too late today—get some rest with Susu and the others first."

"Sounds good."

The next day, Bai Jingyun and a contingent of elders escorted Qin Jiang to Sword Valley. Along the way, Bai Jingyun explained its history.

"Sword Valley was created by our founder as a training ground for swordsmanship. Cultivating the sword inside is twice as effective as outside, and it can even help disciples break through bottlenecks in their sword comprehension. It's our sect's most sacred site—and the very reason we've endured for ten thousand years."

"Sounds like quite the place," Qin Jiang said with an appreciative nod.

Before long, they arrived. Sword Valley was enormous—a vast chasm that plunged to unfathomable depths. Far below, Qin Jiang could make out dozens of Holy Sword Sect disciples practicing their swordsmanship.

"The valley extends about 30,000 feet down," Bai Jingyun continued. "The entire depth is infused with our founder's sword comprehension. Inside the valley, raw cultivation matters less—only mastery of the sword allows you to move freely. The deeper you go, the more profound the sword comprehension required. Anyone who goes beyond their level suffers backlash."

He laid out the tiers: "Disciples who haven't achieved Sword Intent can descend roughly 10,000 feet. After achieving Sword Intent, about 20,000. A Sword Force master—a king of swordsmen—can reach 27,000 feet. The final 3,000? No one in our sect's history has ever reached them."

Bai Jingyun looked meaningfully at Qin Jiang. "We believe only a Sword Heart master could reach the very bottom."

"Interesting." Qin Jiang studied the valley with genuine interest. The system's spoilers had shown Lin Chen descending into Sword Valley during the one-year plot—he'd barely reached the 27,000-foot depth, never achieving Sword Heart. And it was down there, near the bottom, that he'd encountered the sect's ancestral elder. That half-Emperor beauty.

"Would you like to give it a try?" Bai Jingyun offered.

Qin Jiang nodded. "A Sword Emperor's legacy? Naturally I want to see it."

"With your Sword Heart, you should be able to reach the very bottom," Bai Jingyun said, then rubbed his hands together. "There's a persistent rumor within our sect that the founder left something behind at the deepest point. If you do make it down there, we'd appreciate you keeping an eye out for it."

"Is that so?" Qin Jiang gave him a sidelong look. "Afraid I might pocket whatever I find?"

"Heh heh, of course not! We're family. I would never doubt you."

In truth, Bai Jingyun had raised the topic precisely because he feared Qin Jiang might discover something valuable and simply keep it. By mentioning it now, Qin Jiang would presumably feel awkward about taking anything.

"I won't lie to you," Bai Jingyun continued, his expression turning serious. "According to our records, whatever the founder left behind could potentially cultivate another Sword Emperor."

Qin Jiang frowned. "You seem awfully confident. If there's nothing down there, are you going to ask me to compensate you?"

"Uh..." Bai Jingyun's face stiffened, realizing he'd oversold it.

The Grand Elder stepped in. "You're overthinking it, Holy Son. As a Sword Emperor yourself—the leader of all sword cultivators—something that helps others reach Sword Heart would hardly tempt you. Besides, we trust you completely. Otherwise, we wouldn't have brought you here."

"Now that's what I like to hear." Qin Jiang shot Bai Jingyun a pointed look.

Bai Jingyun laughed awkwardly and flashed the Grand Elder a grateful glance.

"Alright, I'll head down and take a look. But let me be clear—if there really is something down there that catches my eye, I'm keeping it. Treasures of heaven and earth belong to whoever has the ability to claim them."

He made no effort to conceal his intentions. Before Bai Jingyun could respond, the Grand Elder nodded with a smile. "Holy Son, you are a member of our Holy Sword Sect. Any treasure you obtain naturally belongs to you. Even if you have no use for it, the right to distribute it is yours alone."

With that settled, Qin Jiang stepped into Sword Valley. The moment he entered, he felt a faint sword will pressing against him—but it was so weak it posed no obstacle whatsoever. After briefly taking its measure, he began his descent.

His figure quickly vanished from Bai Jingyun and the others' view. As soon as he was out of sight, the Grand Elder's smile faded. She turned a stern gaze on Bai Jingyun and the assembled elders.

Bai Jingyun instinctively shrank. The Grand Elder's authority rivaled his own, and as his senior, she'd disciplined him often growing up. The conditioned response was deeply ingrained.

"Jingyun. Young Patriarch Qin is our Holy Son and your son-in-law. And you're acting suspicious of him? What—are you afraid he might actually develop fond feelings for our sect?"

Bai Jingyun stood there, chastened, with nothing to say.

After dressing him down, the Grand Elder swept her sharp gaze across the other elders. "All of you, remember this. Qin Jiang is not only the Qin family's young patriarch—he is our Holy Sword Sect's Holy Son. With Susu at his side, our two factions are essentially allies. From now on, treat Qin Jiang as a true member of this sect. Am I understood?"

Her eyes were razor-sharp. The elders nodded hastily, none daring to object. They had no personal aversion to Qin Jiang—as a Sword Emperor, he commanded their respect. They'd merely been cautious because of the Qin family connection, unsure how close they should get. With the Grand Elder's explicit directive and the Sect Master's tacit approval, they had no reason to hold back.

"Furthermore," the Grand Elder added, "pass the word to every disciple. Anyone who crosses the Holy Son will be expelled from the sect on the spot. The same goes for any of you."

"Understood," they chorused.

While the Grand Elder was laying down the law above, Qin Jiang was making his way deeper into Sword Valley. Compared to ordinary disciples, the valley posed him absolutely no challenge—he strolled through it as though taking a walk in a park.
