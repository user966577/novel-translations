"But Zhao Juncai and I..."

Li Yang still felt uncomfortable. He'd just been competing with the man over a girl — and lost. Who could shamelessly move into their rival's home after that?

The three old monsters urged him on. "That young lady swallowed her pride for your sake, and you — a grown man — can't endure a little humiliation?"

"I..."

Conflict flickered across Li Yang's face. He gazed toward Ye Xuan in the distance. She was all smiles, chatting animatedly with Zhao Juncai, but Li Yang understood — it was all for him.

He drew a deep breath, clenched his fists, and murmured, "For Miss Ye Xuan, what's a little humiliation?"

With that, he stopped hiding and walked straight toward them. The three old monsters stopped masking his aura as well. Both Ye Xuan and Zhao Juncai sensed his approach immediately and turned to look.

Li Yang's expression was somewhat stiff, but by the time he reached them, he'd managed to squeeze out a smile. Ye Xuan's beautiful eyes lit up with delight. "Li Yang, what are you doing here?"

That flash of delight didn't escape him. Proof — her conversation with Zhao Juncai was entirely for his benefit, endured at her own expense. He looked at her with unmistakable tenderness, then glanced at Zhao Juncai before speaking. "Miss Ye Xuan, I heard from the academy teachers that we can go collect cultivation resources now. Would you like to come along?"

He'd rehearsed his excuse beforehand. After all, he couldn't just show up at a girl's door without reason.

Before Ye Xuan could answer, Zhao Juncai smiled. "Perfect timing. Ye Xuan and I were just about to collect resources too. Let's all go together."

Li Yang's brow furrowed. He looked at Ye Xuan — a hint of difficulty on her pretty face. He understood immediately. She'd befriended Zhao Juncai to help him, so she couldn't just brush the man off now. And he shouldn't put her in an awkward position either.

'Be generous. Be the bigger man.'

He consoled himself, then nodded. "Let's go together, then."

The moment he agreed, he saw Ye Xuan relax. She even gave him a playful wink, and his sour mood instantly lifted. He shot a smug glance at Zhao Juncai. The man might have Ye Xuan's surface-level attention, but her heart was genuinely, unmistakably his.

Total victory.

"In that case, let's head out. Plenty of students have already gone to collect their resources," Ye Xuan said with a smile.

She walked in the center, with Li Yang and Zhao Juncai flanking her on either side.

"Li Yang, you don't have a room yet, do you?" Zhao Juncai asked casually.

Li Yang's heart stirred. At the same time, Ye Xuan caught his eye and gave him a meaningful look. He knew — this was the opportunity she'd secured for him, at her own expense.

"Not yet," he said.

"Ha! Well, my quarters are pretty spacious — several extra rooms. Why don't you just move in with me?" Zhao Juncai laughed, then clapped his shoulder. Sensing Li Yang's hesitation, he pressed on. "I know we've had our differences, but we're both men here. No fight, no friendship, right? From now on, let's call each other brother."

"I..."

Though he'd already made his decision, Li Yang hesitated for show — preserving what little dignity he had left.

"Come on, Brother Li Yang. Don't be petty — you'll make Miss Ye Xuan think less of you."

The words hit their mark. Li Yang glanced at Ye Xuan, who spoke up gently. "Li Yang, you should move in. We're all friends here. If you're in the elite quarter, it'll be much easier for us to see each other."

Both pairs of eyes rested on him. This time, he didn't hesitate. "All right. In that case, thank you... Brother Zhao."

Since Zhao Juncai had offered the olive branch, he couldn't appear small-minded. He matched the man's tone and called him brother right back.

Zhao Juncai laughed heartily. "Ha! Don't mention it. Once we've collected our resources, I'll take you over. From today on, we're brothers."

They exchanged a look and shared a smile — but behind the warmth, each harbored his own agenda.

Ye Xuan's pretty face wore a smile too.

'Young Master Qin's assignment isn't so hard. Toying with an idiot is child's play.'

The academy's logistics department was where students collected cultivation resources. A long line had already formed. Li Yang frowned — with this many people, how long would it take?

He looked at Ye Xuan and Zhao Juncai with a wry smile. "Looks like we'll be waiting a while."

"Don't worry, Brother Li Yang. Ye Xuan and I are elite students — we can use the priority lane. Though..." Zhao Juncai glanced at Li Yang uncertainly. "I'm not sure if we can bring someone along. Want to try?"

Secretly, he hoped the answer was no — let Li Yang embarrass himself in front of Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan had no interest in standing in a long line with Li Yang either. "It should be fine," she said.

"Worth a shot." Li Yang agreed, though he had a feeling it wouldn't work.

He followed them to the priority lane, where Ye Xuan and Zhao Juncai produced their elite tokens. Li Yang could only stand there watching — he was too embarrassed to take out his remedial badge.

The registrar noticed him. "What are you standing around for? Show me your token."

Li Yang looked at Ye Xuan helplessly. Zhao Juncai stepped in. "He's a remedial student, sir. We'd like to bring him in with us."

"Remedial?" The registrar's expression darkened. "Remedial students wait in line. You two, go ahead. You — back of the queue."

"But sir—" Ye Xuan began, but the registrar cut her off. "Either he goes back, or all three of you do!"

"Sir, can't an elite student's privileges extend to a friend?"

"No!"

Ye Xuan's brows knit together in apparent frustration. She turned to Li Yang, looking indignant. "Li Yang, come on, let's all go back and—"

"Ye Xuan." Li Yang cut her off with a warm smile. "You two go ahead. I'll wait in line."
