In the guest wing!

A middle-aged man in black robes sat with an expression that commanded respect without anger. Even without releasing his aura, he exuded a sharp, blade-like intensity.

This was Bai Jingyun.

The Holy Sword Sect Master.

Besides Bai Jingyun, there was a retinue of attendants and one young man standing behind him.

"Chen'er, we've taken this long to track down Susu's whereabouts. Do you think she might have already..."

Bai Jingyun's eyes betrayed a hint of worry.

A flash of killing intent passed through Lin Chen's gaze, but his face wore a gentle smile.

"Master, please don't worry. The Qin family is, at the end of the day, a prestigious clan. Moreover, Susu is in the hands of the Qin family's young patriarch. With his status, as long as Susu is unwilling, he certainly wouldn't force anything. Besides, the Qin family knows who Susu is—our Holy Sword Sect isn't weak. They wouldn't make an enemy of us over a single woman."

His reassurance put Bai Jingyun somewhat at ease.

His plan had always been to marry Bai Susu to Lin Chen—that was how he intended to truly bind this once-in-a-generation genius to the sect.

But if Susu had already been...

Just then, the courtyard gate was pushed open. Bai Jingyun frowned. The Qin family's people certainly lacked manners!

Not even a knock before entering.

He turned to see a handsome young man strolling into the courtyard, wearing an easy, warm smile that naturally put people at ease.

"Heh, Uncle Bai, you've finally arrived. I've been waiting for you."

Qin Jiang looked at Bai Jingyun and smiled.

"You are..."

Bai Jingyun's gaze turned cold.

"You're Qin Jiang?"

Qin Hao had told him that Bai Susu was currently in Qin Jiang's care. He'd naturally assumed that Qin Jiang had been the one to abduct her, so his attitude was far from friendly.

Qin Jiang nodded.

Bai Jingyun let out a cold snort, then demanded:

"Where is my daughter Susu?"

"Susu?"

Qin Jiang's use of her name was conspicuously intimate. He chuckled.

"Susu's with me. Actually, I'd planned to send her back, but unfortunately..."

"What?"

"Sigh, Uncle Bai, it's all my fault. I didn't take proper... precautions. So..."

Bai Jingyun's heart skipped a beat.

Behind him, Lin Chen's body trembled, killing intent erupting in his eyes!

"You... you, you..."

Bai Jingyun pointed at Qin Jiang, his hand trembling, his lips quivering.

He'd considered the possibility that he'd arrived too late. But he hadn't imagined he'd arrived this late.

Susu had already...

"Hhh... hhh..."

He took several deep breaths. After a long moment, he managed to calm down somewhat.

"Where is Susu? Take me to see her!"

Qin Jiang shook his head.

"Susu isn't up yet. Last night was pretty tiring."

BOOM!

Bai Jingyun's eyes went wide, his aura exploding involuntarily. He stared at Qin Jiang, eyes blazing with fury.

"Susu is already in this state and you still... you..."

Animal! Absolute animal!

Looking at Qin Jiang's utterly unbothered expression, Bai Jingyun wanted nothing more than to slap him into oblivion. At the same time, guilt was tearing him apart. If only he'd come sooner, none of this would have happened.

Susu had suffered so much.

Bai Jingyun's heart ached to the point of tears. She was his only daughter—and his Dao companion had passed away shortly after giving birth.

Her final wish had been for Susu to be happy.

And he...

One moment of negligence, and his daughter had been cast into hell.

The self-recrimination nearly broke him. His eyes bored into Qin Jiang with undisguised hatred. If not for the last shred of reason holding him back, he would have already attacked.

There was also the matter of not knowing how Bai Susu felt about Qin Jiang. If the feelings were mutual, he'd be willing to accept it.

Moreover, he didn't want Bai Susu's child to grow up without a father.

That would be too cruel.

Just like Susu herself...

A torrent of emotions surged through Bai Jingyun's mind, but in the end, only a sigh remained. His voice came out tired, defeated.

"Take me to see Susu. Don't worry—I won't disturb her."

"Well..."

Qin Jiang hesitated, glancing at Lin Chen and the others behind Bai Jingyun.

"Are they coming too?"

Only then did Bai Jingyun remember Lin Chen. He glanced at the young man, suppressing an internal sigh. He knew Lin Chen had feelings for Bai Susu.

But now...

"I'll go alone."

Two reasons: too many people would disturb Susu, and he was worried Lin Chen might do something rash upon seeing her.

"Fine."

Qin Jiang nodded and led Bai Jingyun out of the guest wing.

A gaze heavy with killing intent bored into his back. His lips curved slightly. A Great Emperor's remnant soul? Even a real Great Emperor would have to behave in the Qin family's territory.

Neither man spoke along the way.

They soon arrived at Bai Susu's courtyard.

Qin Jiang pushed the door open without ceremony. Bai Jingyun followed close behind. Bai Susu, of course, was not sleeping as Qin Jiang had claimed.

Hearing the door, her body stiffened, and she spoke without looking up.

"Can I have a day off today..."

The words died as her face froze. She stared in disbelief at the figure behind Qin Jiang.

Father?

Father had finally come to save her!

Joy surged through her, but just as quickly, sorrow took its place. What good was being saved now? It was already too late.

"Susu..."

Bai Jingyun's voice trembled.

Especially Bai Susu's pleading tone just now—it made his heart clench.

He clenched his fists, glaring at Qin Jiang, and roared with grief:

"Qin Jiang! Susu is already like this, and you don't have an ounce of compassion? She's your wife, for heaven's sake! As her husband, all you care about is your own pleasure?"

"I—"

"You what?! Listen to me—from this day forward, you are not to mistreat Susu. Otherwise, regardless of who you are, I will not let you off!"

Bai Jingyun's voice was thunderous.

Qin Jiang opened his mouth. On the other side, Bai Susu was equally baffled.

She had no idea why her father had suddenly erupted.

His words were clearly full of concern for her, but the talk of "wife" and "husband" sent her face burning crimson.

"Father, Qin Jiang and I aren't... like that."

True, they were intimately familiar with each other. But as for their relationship...

To this day, she hadn't submitted. And Qin Jiang showed no intention of pursuing her feelings.

What he seemed to want was purely physical gratification.

Whether they loved each other didn't seem to matter to him.

Recognizing this left Bai Susu feeling oddly hollow. Yet her stubborn heart refused to yield. True, Qin Jiang visited her daily.

But for her, it was like completing a chore.

She'd gotten used to it.

Only... she couldn't explain why she found herself doubting Lin Chen more and more. In her spare moments, she kept turning over Qin Jiang's words.

She kept telling herself he was lying.

Yet she found herself agreeing with him more and more—perhaps even hoping that everything he'd said was true.

Because only then could she feel at peace with her daily "chore."
