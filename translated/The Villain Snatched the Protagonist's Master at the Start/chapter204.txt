Beauty in his arms, Qin Jiang demonstrated his considerable prowess.

Through their thorough exchange, Yu Lan found herself clinging to him all the more, her serpentine suppleness on full display. Boneless and fluid, she bent in ways no human woman could.

Bliss.

For several days running, Qin Jiang remained entangled within the Purple-Scale Serpent territory, as if coiled in place. He could hardly get out of bed.

Meanwhile, scouts from various serpent clans had been quietly observing the Purple-Scale Serpent faction. Yu Lan's people didn't bother chasing them off—they needed time to rest and recuperate. Besides, Qin Jiang had told them to let the scouts look all they wanted. No need for secrecy.

Even Mo Mo and Xue Mei made no effort to hide their presence. As a result, the news that two Immortal cultivators were stationed with the Purple-Scale Serpent faction spread like wildfire, sending shockwaves through the entire Snake Race.

In the Black Water Serpent great hall:

"Immortals? Where did these Immortals come from? Find out who they are—now!" Mo Ling roared.

Mo Ling was the Black Water Serpent's chieftain, and the faction's royal bloodline holder. To compete for the Snake Race chieftain's seat, he'd put aside his pride and seduced one of Yu Lan's handmaidens, using her to poison Yu Lan's bloodline. Lucky for him, it had worked. Unlucky for him, Qin Jiang had entered the picture. Even more unlucky—he wasn't a pretty woman.

Qin Jiang's personality shifted dramatically depending on whether he was dealing with beauties or men. Put plainly, he was shamelessly biased. He didn't care about right or wrong—only about looks.

So Mo Ling was in for a rough time. Unless he had the strength to fight back against Qin Jiang directly.

At his orders, the Black Water Serpent powerhouses could only grimace. "Chieftain, they're Immortals..."

They were Immortals! What did he expect them to do about it?

"So what?" Mo Ling snapped, then took a deep breath to calm himself. "Investigate! Find out what these Immortals like. Whatever they want, we'll provide it. If the Purple-Scale Serpent can win their allegiance, why can't we? Anything they can offer, we can match. Anything they can't, we'll still find a way!"

Against two Immortals, he wasn't stupid. Better to befriend them than antagonize them.

His subordinates exchanged glances, and one finally spoke up. "Chieftain, our clan doesn't exactly have anyone on par with Empress Yu Lan..."

Yu Lan was celebrated as the most beautiful woman in the entire yao race. The Black Water Serpent clan couldn't produce anyone who came close, and neither could most of the Demon Domain. Back when Mo Ling had poisoned her, the fact that he'd stopped at crippling her bloodline rather than doing worse was an act of restraint on his part—he'd been preserving her beauty. That he'd shown such mercy even at such a critical juncture spoke volumes about just how captivating Yu Lan was.

"Yu Lan..." Mo Ling's brow furrowed as her exquisite figure floated through his mind. He shook his head, forcing down the stray thoughts, and looked at his men. "Those two Immortals with the Purple-Scale Serpent are both women. You think they'd help Yu Lan because of her looks?"

"There's also a man," someone pointed out. "And he seems to be the one in charge."

Mo Ling examined the intelligence reports more carefully, including a sketch of Qin Jiang. "Handsome fellow," he conceded with a nod, then mused for a moment. "So that's it—this man is a pretty boy being kept by those two Immortals. He took a liking to Yu Lan, so that's why the Immortals are helping her."

The Black Water Serpent warriors glanced at each other. Was that really how it worked? Maybe. They nodded to themselves as they studied Qin Jiang's portrait. The more they looked, the more Mo Ling's theory made sense. The man was clearly just a pretty face.

"So those two Immortals have a thing for pretty boys!" Mo Ling said, waving Qin Jiang's portrait around. "Do we have anyone who fits the bill?"

"Uh..."

The Black Water Serpent powerhouses looked at one another—a sea of dark-skinned warriors, every last one of them coal-black. They shook their heads. "Chieftain... would a handsome dark-skinned guy work?"

Mo Ling: "???"

Deep in a mountain ravine, Chen Changsheng burst from the earth and threw his head back in raucous laughter.

"Ha ha ha ha! Qin Jiang, you never expected it, did you? You kicked me straight into a blessed land! Just you wait—when I achieve Emperor, that'll be the day you die!"

Beaten to a pulp, then punted away by Qin Jiang's casual kick—Chen Changsheng had stumbled into a hidden treasure ground. In mere days, he'd broken through repeatedly, reaching Four Tribulations Supreme. His Reincarnation Dao was also steadily progressing toward completion, though full mastery would require merging the power of all ten lives, which demanded Great Emperor-level strength at minimum. Once ten lives converged, his power would skyrocket.

"Hmph, so what if you have Immortals at your side? I've endured ten cycles of reincarnation—ten lifetimes of hardship. In this final life, with all ten merging together, even an Immortal can be slain!" he muttered, his voice dripping with killing intent.

Ten lifetimes of struggle, and never had it been this difficult. All because of Qin Jiang.

When the time came, he would kill Qin Jiang without question.

"This is merely the final trial before my ascension. I can endure it!" His expression hardened with resolve.

But then he thought of his disciple Linglong, and then of Yu Lan, and his face twitched involuntarily. He counted his blessings that across his ten lives, while he'd had close friends, he'd never taken a dao companion. Otherwise, he strongly suspected he'd have found a green hat on his head.

Even so, he couldn't shake the nagging feeling that he'd been cuckolded.

Taking a deep breath, Chen Changsheng clenched his fists, his eyes glinting. "I'll overcome this tribulation. One of the Immortals at Qin Jiang's side is a demonic cultivator—I can use that against him. And as for Yu Lan..."

His gaze turned cold at the memory of Yu Lan's insults and the beating from the Purple-Scale Serpent elders. His face twitched. It still hurt.

"Since you chose him, I'll choose the Black Water Serpent. Let's see who comes out on top. Yu Lan, I guarantee you'll regret this." He laughed coldly, then oriented himself and set off toward the Snake Race's territory.

He'd been driven out of the Heavenly Pill Palace. Now, in the Snake Race, he would reclaim everything he'd lost. This time, he would be the one to drive Qin Jiang away.

The wheel of fortune always turned. He, Chen Changsheng, would be the ultimate victor. Ten lifetimes of reincarnation had already proven as much.

Three days later, at the Black Water Serpent clan, a warrior rushed to Mo Ling's side, barely containing his excitement.

"Chieftain! There's a pretty boy outside asking to see you!"

"Oh?" Mo Ling's eyes lit up.

The entire Black Water Serpent clan was nothing but dark-skinned men. He'd just been racking his brain over where to find some pretty boys, and one had walked right up to his door.

"Bring him in! Let me inspect the merchandise."

Chen Changsheng was promptly escorted in—more accurately, dragged in—and deposited at Mo Ling's feet. Mo Ling studied him, then pulled out Qin Jiang's portrait for comparison. His brow furrowed.

"This one's a few grades below the original."
