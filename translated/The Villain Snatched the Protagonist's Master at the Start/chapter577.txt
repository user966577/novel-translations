While the two were talking, another figure appeared before them.

"Hey, Black Boss, Brother Xu." The newcomer bowed slightly—the same Huaxia operative who'd encountered Zhao Sheng.

Black Dragon raised an eyebrow. "What is it?"

"I know what triggered the statue."

"Oh? Tell me."

"Yesterday, I was hiding inside the statue, recording activity in the realm, when I ran into someone—a man who saw right through my illusion formation."

This got their attention. The illusion formations they used had been designed by An Xihe herself. Even an Immortal King couldn't easily see through them without actively trying. The operative continued without holding anything back, recounting every detail of his encounter with Zhao Sheng.

Finally, he glanced toward a particular direction. "The message stone I gave him has a tracking function. Right now, he's hiding over there..." He jerked his chin toward Zhao Sheng's hiding spot.

Black Dragon and Little Xu narrowed their eyes and casually glanced over. Indeed, there was a faint aura in that direction, carefully suppressed. Without specifically looking for it, they might have missed it entirely.

"And yesterday, after I left, he went back to the statue and stayed put until just before the anomaly erupted. I'm certain this was his doing."

Conviction rang in the operative's voice. Black Dragon and Little Xu nodded. The probability was high. They glanced toward Zhao Sheng's position again, trying not to be obvious about it. More than the legacy itself, what mattered most was the task Qin Jiang had assigned them. And this Zhao Sheng matched the profile perfectly.

"Good work," Black Dragon said. "If he turns out to be who the Young Master wants, you'll get first credit."

The operative's face lit up. He couldn't claim all the glory, but first credit was more than enough for a significant promotion.

"Thank you, Black Boss!"

Black Dragon waved the gratitude aside and corrected him with a mild frown. "You should thank the Young Master, not me."

"Of course—the Manor Lord is the one I'm most grateful to! But you're his right hand, Black Boss. Naturally, I need to show my appreciation."

That mollified Black Dragon. He nodded. "Fair point. Among all the Young Master's subordinates, the one he trusts the most is me."

"Absolutely! Everyone knows the Manor Lord treats you like family. Out of all his people, you're definitely the one he trusts most!"

"Don't exaggerate. I'm just his subordinate." Black Dragon waved it off—but his voice carried no annoyance, and a pleased smile tugged at his lips.

Little Xu rolled his eyes. "Him? He's the most trusted? Then where does that leave me?"

"Uh..." The operative's expression froze. He'd forgotten about the other big shot. "Brother Xu, of course the Manor Lord trusts you deeply too! It's just that you and Black Boss are different types. Black Boss is dependable and steady, which earns the Manor Lord's trust. As for you..."

"What about me?"

"Ahem—I'm not saying you're unreliable. It's just that your style tends toward a different kind of trust."

"What style?"

Little Xu pressed. The operative smiled weakly, scrambling internally. He had no idea what style he was talking about—he'd just been trying to smooth things over.

Just then, Black Dragon cleared his throat, rescuing him. "Enough, enough. We're all here serving the Young Master. No hierarchy, no rankings. He trusts all of us equally."

"Yes yes, exactly what Black Boss said!" the operative agreed hastily.

Little Xu shot Black Dragon a glare, still unsatisfied, but the operative jumped in before he could speak. "Black Boss, I have a plan. Think it could work?"

"What plan?"

"I want to befriend that man—become his inside man."

"Oh?" Black Dragon considered this, then nodded. "Could work. He kept your message stone, which means he's open to the idea."

"Since he's open to it, you've got a chance to embed yourself." Black Dragon's eyes glinted. He clapped the operative on the shoulder. "Leave this to me. I'll make sure you get in."

"Yes, sir."

Nearby, Zhao Sheng remained hidden. He watched the growing crowd, then carefully revealed himself, blending into the masses. Nearly everyone was focused on the statue—the only thing in this otherwise empty realm that might hold any value.

The prospect of an Immortal Emperor's legacy was irresistible.

Zhao Sheng surveyed the competition—the daunting array of prodigies among them—and felt his chances dwindling. But he touched his forehead. That streak of light might yet turn the tide.

Taking a steadying breath, he settled in to wait. The legacy hadn't activated yet. Patience was all he needed.

Then someone jostled him from behind. Before he could react, the person who'd slammed into him wheeled around, face contorted with rage.

"Are you blind? Didn't see me coming? Get out of my way!"

Zhao Sheng stood there, momentarily stunned. The man had bumped into him, and now was blaming him for not moving? Where was the logic?

Anger flickered across his face. He'd wanted to keep a low profile, but tolerating unprovoked aggression would make him a coward, not cautious. He met the man's glare evenly. "You ran into me."

"Oh, talking back now? Yeah, I ran into you—so what? You were in my way! I'll bump you, and I'll beat you too!"

The man raised his palm and brought it crashing down. Zhao Sheng's expression hardened. He threw up an arm to block. The blow was devastating—the force of a True Immortal sent half his body numb.

It was a True Immortal!
