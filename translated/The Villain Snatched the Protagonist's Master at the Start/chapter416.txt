A full month under Qin Jiang's attentive instruction, and every woman in the Azure Lotus Divine Palace had mastered the curriculum — able to adapt, innovate, and apply their knowledge in practical settings. Qin Jiang was proud.

One afternoon, he stood blindfolded in the palace courtyard, surrounded by laughter and teasing voices.

"Over here, husband!"

"No, come this way — there's a surprise!"

The women darted around him, dodging his reaching hands and occasionally letting themselves be caught for a moment of stolen fun. He laughed and lunged, thoroughly enjoying himself, when a rush of fragrance swept past. He pounced.

"Got you!"

He kissed whoever it was without hesitation — then the blindfold was yanked away.

"You seem to be having fun."

"Qing Chan?"

She was in his arms. Behind her stood An Xihe, Liu Shuwan, and the rest, all fixing him with reproachful stares.

"What are you all doing here?"

Qing Chan flicked his chest. "It's been a month. Were you going to forget about us entirely if we didn't come?"

"Never!" He shook his head vigorously. "I couldn't forget you if I forgot my own name. I've been thinking about you every single day."

"Sure you have." She eyed the palace women — all wearing the kind of airy clothing that left very little to the imagination. Obviously his doing. And these girls hadn't even tried to resist. No wonder he'd stayed an entire month.

Qin Jiang coughed, released her, and took her hand instead. He approached the others with a smile. "A whole month apart — didn't you miss me?"

They brushed past without answering, heading straight for their new sisters — while silently calculating whether their combined forces could finally overwhelm Qin Jiang.

Only Qing Chan remained, hand still in his.

"Didn't you miss me, Qing Chan?" He leaned in.

She swatted his chest. "No!"

"Liar."

"Want to test that?" She lifted her chin, teeth grinding, daring him.

He grinned. "Test what, exactly?"

"Scoundrel!" Her face reddened. "Dream on."

But internally — biting him was certainly tempting. She just couldn't actually bite hard. That would affect everyone's well-being. And she'd regret it too.

Her gaze drifted downward, then snapped back up. She had missed him. A month was the longest they'd been apart since getting together, and not just her — every sister had been going crazy. That's why they'd come.

Qin Jiang caught the look and smiled. He pulled her close; she settled against him, finding a comfortable spot.

After a moment, she lifted her face. "Want to find out how soft my lips are?"

"I thought they were stubborn?"

"Try them and see."

She tilted her head up, eyes fluttering closed, mouth puckered, fingers tugging at his collar in silent urging. He cupped her face and kissed her.

Definitely not stubborn. Very soft.

When he finally pulled back, Qing Chan's eyes opened slowly, cheeks glowing. "Soft?"

"A little."

"What do you mean, a little? My lips are very soft!"

He laughed and kissed her again. "Let me double-check."

"Mm..."

Her lips yielded completely this time, and by the time he released her, she was breathless, draped against him. He held her close, one arm around her waist.

An Xihe and the others returned. Seeing Qing Chan's state, they pursed their lips — not even five minutes and she'd already snuck a taste. Plastic sisters!

But they couldn't blame her. A month of abstinence plus Qin Jiang's provocations — a little taste was understandable. More importantly, with the Divine Palace women on their side, the odds looked much better. Qing Chan could serve as the vanguard.

Their eyes swept past her and fixed on Qin Jiang. Battle intent burned in every gaze. He met their stares, corner of his mouth lifting. They thought they stood a chance again.

"Rematch?"

"Rematch!"

Brief negotiations concluded, both sides proceeded to a grand hall — custom-built by the Divine Palace women in advance of Qin Jiang's visit. Their preparations had clearly been extensive.

The hall was equipped with the Space-Time Law. At this scale of engagement, conflicts could stretch months or even years — time acceleration was essential.

Everyone entered. Qin Jiang stood alone against the assembled host, not a trace of hesitation on his face. But he acknowledged the pressure — the numbers this time were truly daunting.

His opponents radiated confidence. This time, victory was theirs.
