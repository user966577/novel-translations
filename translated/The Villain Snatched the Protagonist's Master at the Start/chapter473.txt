Qin Jiang returned to the airship while the Zhou family mobilized. Black Dragon supervised.

The entire Zhou family deployed: one True Immortal, ten Human Immortals, and dozens of Ancient Emperors. They swept through the main compound first, slaughtering every member of the targeted branch. Then the True Immortal patriarch led the forces outward for the wider hunt.

From the airship, Qin Jiang and the women watched. Beside him, Xue Yue gazed at his profile. She remembered how he'd once threatened her -- how the entire Blood Tribe would suffer because of her. At the time, she'd believed it was just intimidation. But watching the Zhou family now, she understood: had she remained defiant, he really would have done it.

'Lucky this man had enough charm to make me fall for him. Otherwise, who knows what would have happened.'

At least the Blood Tribe was safe now. As for the Zhou family's marriage branch -- no saving them. 'Is it my fault they're dying?' She considered it. Not really. Her situation was just the pretext. Qin Jiang needed this branch as an example to cow the rest of the Zhou family. And it was working beautifully -- the other branches didn't resent Qin Jiang for the losses. They resented the branch that had brought this calamity upon them. Textbook fear logic: cower before the strong, blame the weak.

Qin Jiang looked down at her and drew her into his arms. "Yueyue, after this, let's visit the Blood Tribe."

"The Blood Tribe?" Her eyes widened. "You're going after them too?"

He laughed and pinched her cheek. "Relax. I mean as your husband. It's about time I visited your family."

"Oh, just a visit." She relaxed visibly. After watching him handle the Zhou family, she'd half-expected him to keep the killing going. She leaned against him and nodded. "Sure. It's been over a year since I've been home."

She'd left after running from the arranged marriage and had never returned. In the early days, Blood Tribe members regularly tracked her down, but once she'd founded the Anti-Huaxia Alliance and gone into hiding, constantly moving bases, they'd lost her trail.

What she didn't know was that the Blood Tribe had removed her from their registry the moment they learned about the Alliance. They'd publicly disowned her, desperate to sever all ties. The Zhou family's marriage branch had done the same. But isolated in the mountains, Xue Yue had never heard any of it.

Looking at her eager, unsuspecting face, Qin Jiang didn't have the heart to tell her. When they arrived, the Blood Tribe would fall in line. And they'd certainly never dare mention the disownment. But she'd find out eventually -- the Blood Tribe had broadcast it too widely for a quiet retraction.

Still, it wasn't a catastrophe. Any family in their position would have done the same. She'd be hurt, but with Qin Jiang there, not for long. He rubbed her head. "At the Zhou family's pace, they should finish in a few days. Then I'll take you home."

"Okay~" She perked up. "You know, the Blood Tribe is pretty strong -- not weaker than the Zhou family. We could help you."

"Then I'll be counting on Yueyue."

She pumped her little fist. "With me around, the Blood Tribe will definitely support you!"

Meanwhile, the targeted branch had received warning, but the Zhou forces arrived too fast, encircling them completely. Looking at the wall of their own kinsmen closing in, the branch members fell into despair. They'd never imagined that a political marriage meant to strengthen the family would become their death warrant -- carried out by their own people.

The branch's strongest fighter, a Human Immortal, gazed at the killing intent on familiar faces and felt only sorrow. He sighed and addressed the patriarch. "Ancestor, please -- spare just one bloodline from my branch."

The patriarch sighed and shook his head. "I'm sorry. That's something I cannot grant."

"Ancestor!" the Human Immortal cried out.

His kin trembled with terror. No one wanted to die. Some Zhou fighters felt a twinge of pity, but most wore cold expressions, convinced this branch had brought disaster upon them all. The blood was already thin between branches. For the Zhou family's survival, this sacrifice was necessary.

The patriarch took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and raised his hand. "Kill."

The slaughter was completely one-sided. The branch's Human Immortal tried to intervene, but alone against multiple peers, he was battered and broken within minutes. The patriarch restrained him personally. The wounded man gazed up with eyes full of anguish.

The patriarch sighed. "I'll grant you a swift end. You shouldn't have to watch what happens to your kin."

The Human Immortal offered no resistance. He was gone in an instant, leaving behind an intact body. Just as the patriarch had said -- some endings were better left unseen.
