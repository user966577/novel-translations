With matters on the Divine Dragon Continent wrapped up, Qin Jiang took his entourage on a brief sightseeing tour of the continent. After a few leisurely days, they boarded the airship and departed.

Accompanying them was the entirety of the Demon Hall's forces.

By now, the Demon Hall cultivators finally understood the truth: their grand destiny as Chaos Marauders was really just... being employees. Though some were disappointed, one look at the power surrounding Qin Jiang silenced any thought of dissent. Besides, Qin Jiang had distributed a batch of demonic cultivation pills among them, which did wonders for morale.

Being someone else's muscle wasn't so bad, all things considered.

Once they entered the Chaos, Qin Jiang produced three half-Emperor-grade airships and handed them over to the Demon Hall.

He addressed the assembled leadership. "Do well out here. In the Chaos, you are kings. If someone's weaker than you—one word: take. If you stir up trouble you can't handle, contact me."

"Yes, sir!"

The Demon Hall's upper echelon responded in unison. The prospect of being kings in the Chaos stirred real excitement. And knowing Qin Jiang had their backs removed any fear of retaliation.

Their new lives were going to be anything but boring.

Satisfied with their enthusiasm, Qin Jiang smiled. "Off you go. Your new life starts now."

He waved them off. The Demon Hall leaders bowed to the Qin family, then launched into the void. Their troops were already waiting aboard the airships. Looking out at their forces—hardened killers, every one—the leaders felt a surge of anticipation.

The Hall Master swept his arm forward. "Move out! Onward to our new future!"

The three airships roared to life and streaked into the depths of the Chaos, vanishing from sight.

Qin Jiang turned his gaze ahead. It was his turn now.

Destination: the Nine Heavens.

Using the coordinates Yan Shiya had provided, they set course for one of the Nine Heavens—Azure Cloud Heaven.

Qin Jiang's knowledge of the Nine Heavens was limited. Yan Shiya and Yan Yun had been born there, but both had been too weak at the time to know more than the basics. One thing was certain: immortal-path cultivators existed within the Nine Heavens.

The Yan family itself had no immortal-path powerhouses—Great Emperors at most. With the forces at Qin Jiang's disposal, rolling over them would be trivial.

The airship cruised steadily through the Chaos. The vast emptiness meant they encountered almost no one, though occasional hazards arose—chaotic currents, native Chaos creatures. None posed any real threat.

Two full months of travel passed before a continent finally emerged in the distance, a silent colossus resting in the void like a slumbering beast.

Standing at the airship's edge, Qin Jiang took in the sight. The oppressive aura radiating from the continent far surpassed the Divine Dragon Continent's. Brilliant light shimmered across its surface, like a beacon burning in the endless dark.

"Young Master," Black Dragon reported from behind him, "according to the coordinates, the continent ahead is Azure Cloud Heaven."

At Qin Jiang's command, the airship accelerated toward it.

Unlike the Divine Dragon Continent, Azure Cloud Heaven had no unified government. The borderlands were sparsely populated, and the airship's arrival drew almost no attention.

Once inside Azure Cloud Heaven's territory, Qin Jiang ordered the airship to land. He wanted to keep a low profile—this was the Nine Heavens, after all. The Qin family's current strength wasn't enough to steamroll an entire heaven.

After landing, Qin Jiang's group promptly seized a nearby city as their temporary base and renamed it Qin Family City. They then began gathering intelligence on Azure Cloud Heaven, with particular focus on the Yan family.

About two weeks later, Qin Jiang sought out Yan Shiya and Yan Yun.

The moment they saw him, both women pressed close, each claiming an arm. Among the women in Qin Jiang's life, the two of them held a comfortable position—together, they ranked firmly among his favorites.

He freed his arms and wrapped them around their waists instead. "I've finished the investigation into the Yan family. But since it's your clan, you two should decide how to handle it."

Yan Yun looked to Yan Shiya. She had no memories of the family and no attachment whatsoever—she'd been too young when they fled to Azure Cloud Heaven.

Yan Shiya was quiet for a long moment.

"Is anyone from our branch still alive?" she finally asked.

When their branch had fallen, she and Yan Yun hadn't been the only ones to escape. But survival had never been guaranteed. In those desperate hours, it had been every person for themselves.

"Since your branch lost power, the current main family has been hunting your people relentlessly. In recent years, there've been no sightings of anyone from your line," Qin Jiang said gently.

Some might still be alive—hidden so deeply even the main family couldn't find them, or perhaps fled to other continents entirely. Tracking them down would be extraordinarily difficult.

Yan Shiya's eyes dimmed. The people who'd escaped alongside her had been family—blood relatives. But she knew, rationally, that the odds of survival were vanishingly small. She and Yan Yun had been lucky to reach the Heavenly Mystery Continent at all. If she had to do it over, she wasn't sure she could escape a second time.

Qin Jiang didn't rush her. He simply tightened his arms, pulling her a fraction closer.

Yan Shiya came back to herself, her voice tinged with sorrow. "The Yan family's way of doing things is too cruel. No loyalty, no sentiment. Every succession is a bloodbath. A family like that shouldn't exist."

The current Yan family had virtually no blood connection to Yan Shiya and Yan Yun anymore. And to both women, the entire clan was the enemy.

"Understood," Qin Jiang said with a nod. "Then as of today, Azure Cloud Heaven no longer has a Yan family."

"Mm~" Yan Shiya nodded softly, her small hand reaching down to lace her fingers through his. "Thank you, Qin Jiang."

Back on the Heavenly Mystery Continent, she'd devoted herself relentlessly to growing stronger—every day driven by the dream of returning to Azure Cloud Heaven to avenge her family. But she'd always known, deep down, that her talent probably wouldn't be enough.

Her effort had been a way of not giving up.

Then she'd met Qin Jiang. She'd resisted at first, but now—even without the Seven Beauties Painting's binding—she'd willingly stay at his side.

He was lecherous, unfaithful, and more than a little deviant.

But at least, after claiming each woman, he treated every one of them with respect. Including her—a slave of the Seven Beauties Painting.
