Over the next few days, Qin Jiang remained at the Celestial Rabbit Tribe. He'd occasionally leak Tang Yin's location, sending the tribe's fighters to hunt him down. But a Child of Destiny truly was cockroach-level resilient—he escaped every single time.

Qin Jiang figured he'd have to handle it personally.

By the lake at the tribe's center, Qin Jiang lay in the grass with a blade of it dangling from his lips. Jian Yao and the other women sat nearby, chatting and lounging at ease.

Xue Mei, the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's ancestor—the beautiful mature woman—had warmed up to the group over these few days and joined their little circle. Qin Jiang observed the scene with a contented smile. Beautiful scenery always did wonders for the mood.

But aside from the women around him, there was another lovely sight waiting in the underwater chamber.

He propped himself up, gave the girls a wave, and dove into the lake.

Inside the chamber, Xiao Jiu's figure greeted him immediately.

'Almost done.'

He moved to her side and examined her condition. The immortal herb's energy had nearly been fully refined. Rather than leave, he sat cross-legged in front of her and admired the view. He'd been coming here for days now, but it never got old.

The herb seemed to have done more than strengthen her. Her skin had an ethereal luminance it hadn't possessed before, and her figure had filled out noticeably.

'Could be my technique, too,' he mused, flexing his fingers.

Just then, Xiao Jiu's lashes trembled, and her eyes slowly opened. The first thing she saw was Qin Jiang. She stared blankly for a moment, then her face lit up with joy and she threw herself into his arms.

"Qin Jiang, thank you."

She could feel it—after refining the herb, her physique had strengthened dozens of times over. Her bloodline no longer posed any threat to her body.

Qin Jiang caught her. The silky-soft sensation made his mind wander briefly, but he'd grown accustomed to it over the past few days and steadied himself quickly. He looked down at her. The pallor that had always marked her complexion was gone, replaced by a healthy, rosy glow.

He nodded with satisfaction, and then his hands instinctively...

...

"Qin Jiang~"

Her voice quivered.

He drew a deep breath and asked softly, "How does your physique feel? Can it hold up?"

Xiao Jiu lowered her head shyly. Before, her body had been so fragile it seemed like it might shatter at a touch. But now, strengthened by dozens of times over—she was sturdier than an ordinary celestial rabbit.

She gave a bashful nod.

Six hours later, Xiao Jiu's face was etched with exhaustion, pushed to her very limit. She looked up at Qin Jiang. "Is my physique... acceptable?"

"Not bad at all," Qin Jiang said with a satisfied nod.

Night had fallen by then. The women were all gathered in the little courtyard. When they saw Qin Jiang emerge carrying Xiao Jiu in his arms, every pair of eyes turned their way.

"Is Xiao Jiu...?"

Xue Mei approached. Xiao Jiu had already fallen asleep in Qin Jiang's embrace.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Don't worry. I ran a physique assessment on her. She's a bit tired from it. Fell right asleep."

"Physique assessment?"

"She just finished refining the immortal herb. I wanted to see how her body held up."

He delivered the line with a perfectly straight face.

Xue Mei rolled her eyes. One look at Xiao Jiu's state told her everything she needed to know. She'd been in the exact same condition not long ago.

"Is Xiao Jiu's physique issue resolved?"

Qin Jiang nodded, smiling. "Resolved. Her body can fully withstand her bloodline now. Once her physique stabilizes, I'll give her another boost."

Xue Mei breathed a sigh of relief. The Celestial Rabbit Tribe's most vexing problem had finally been solved. Although... the one who'd benefited most seemed to be Qin Jiang. He'd claimed not only Xiao Jiu—their future—but Xue Mei herself. All things considered, the tribe had come out on the losing end.

A resentful glimmer crept into her eyes. She'd preserved herself for hundreds of thousands of years, only to end up in the hands of this young scoundrel—and in such a... forceful manner.

The only consolation was that the scoundrel was genuinely formidable. Enough to satisfy her.

Catching her resentful look, Qin Jiang chuckled. "I'll put Xiao Jiu to bed first. I'll come find you tonight."

"Who wants you to come!" Xue Mei's cheeks flushed scarlet.

He laughed and carried Xiao Jiu into a room that had been prepared in advance. After a quick tidying up, he laid her on the bed, pulled the covers over her, leaned down, and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead.

"Rest well."

With Xiao Jiu settled, Qin Jiang rejoined the women for some lively banter before they each retired for the night. He sighed wistfully—he'd been hoping for more—then shook his head and slipped into Xue Mei's room.
