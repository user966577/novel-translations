Liu Shuwan sat with a frosty expression while Qin Jiang held her hand, channeling energy to treat her internal injuries. She could feel him kneading her fingers, and her brows knit together.

"Could you... do this a different way?" she asked.

"A different way? Sure." Qin Jiang nodded with a smile. "For my energy to enter your body, there has to be physical contact. So... where would you prefer I touch?"

His eyes gleamed as they swept over her from head to toe.

Liu Shuwan: "..."

His gaze made her skin crawl. She suppressed a shudder. "Never mind... this is fine."

He'd already held her hand yesterday—one more time wouldn't make a difference. As for the kiss earlier, she'd just pretend a dog had licked her. She hadn't felt anything anyway. Though, now that she thought about it, she was a bit annoyed. That was her first kiss, and she hadn't even gotten to experience it properly. All Qin Jiang's fault!

About an hour later, Qin Jiang finally released her hand. Liu Shuwan shot him a look. "Had enough?"

"Excuse me? I was healing you! And you're questioning my motives?" Qin Jiang's eyes went wide with feigned indignation.

But Liu Shuwan wasn't buying it. "Your motives don't need questioning—they're written all over your face."

"Really?" Qin Jiang touched his cheek. "That obvious?"

'Obvious? You weren't even trying to hide it!' Liu Shuwan huffed and stood to resume her cultivation—only to realize something.

"Qin Jiang, give me back my cushion!"

She'd spent thousands of years on that cushion, and it carried her scent more than anything else she owned. And this pervert had claimed it as a "reward."

Qin Jiang produced the cushion. A faint fragrance still clung to it, which only excited him further. Seeing his leering grin, Liu Shuwan's body went rigid. Why on earth had she let this deviant into her home? Regret! Massive regret!

Qin Jiang hugged the cushion and grinned at her. "I won this fair and square. Why should I give it back?"

"You..."

His shamelessness left Liu Shuwan speechless, her face flushed with anger.

"How about... you use the bed instead?" Qin Jiang suggested, pointing at the stone bed.

Liu Shuwan's cheeks puffed out. She couldn't exactly sit on the bare floor—she was a lady, after all. Glaring at Qin Jiang's unrepentant face, she stamped her foot and settled cross-legged on the stone bed.

Qin Jiang smiled and left her alone. Only after she'd entered deep meditation did he carefully creep over. "Cultivating every day... how exhausting," he murmured.

He produced a stick of calming incense, lit it, and let the tendrils of smoke fill the room. Before long, Liu Shuwan's rigid posture softened, and she began to slump. Qin Jiang caught her just in time.

"Poor thing—so exhausted she passed out. Better let her get some proper rest."

He carried her to the bed, then realized he felt a bit tired himself. And so, the two of them drifted off to sleep nestled together.

The next day, Liu Shuwan opened her eyes, still groggy. That meditation session had been unusually comfortable—like she'd had a wonderful night's sleep. She tried to lift her arm but found something pinning it down. She tried to raise her head but felt a tug on her hair—it was pinned too.

Her eyes flew open. She turned her head slightly, and her lips met something warm.

Qin Jiang?

She tilted her head back, but her hair was trapped under him. The tug of pain made her instinctively lean back toward him—and her lips met that warmth again. What made it worse was that Qin Jiang's eyes chose that exact moment to open. Their gazes locked.

"Ahh—!"

She'd been holding back her scream to avoid waking him, but now— Her shriek barely escaped before Qin Jiang silenced it with his lips.

"Mmph—"

Liu Shuwan went rigid, her mind going completely blank. A good while later, Qin Jiang finally pulled away, though his arms remained wrapped around her. Liu Shuwan stared at him, dazed, until he reached out and playfully flicked her nose. She snapped back to reality, her face flooding with color, and pouted, "What are you doing..."

"Just now—did you make the first move?" Qin Jiang licked his lips, watching her teasingly.

Liu Shuwan buried her burning face in his chest. The kissing had actually felt rather nice... and she may have, for just a moment, taken a tiny bit of initiative. Though her technique needed work.

Her shyness set something stirring in Qin Jiang. Liu Shuwan sensed the shift and looked up at him in alarm, not daring to move. "Don't do anything rash—I..."

Her voice trembling, she surprised them both by leaning in and pressing her lips to his. But before Qin Jiang could deepen the kiss, she pulled back. "I'll... let you kiss me from now on," she said quietly. "But nothing else. We're not right for each other."

"Nothing else? What does 'nothing else' include?"

Liu Shuwan could feel his temperature rising—literally. She grew flustered. "It means... I mean... Oh, you know! You horrible rogue—you keep bullying me!"

This was only his third day here, and she'd already been run through the wringer. At this rate, who knew what he'd try next? Ground rules were needed. She knew Qin Jiang was unreliable, but even a flimsy agreement was better than nothing.

Qin Jiang appeared to give her proposal serious consideration. After a pause, he spoke. "We'll table the rest for now. But... you'll let me kiss you whenever I want?"

"Mm-hmm."

"Hehe. Then let me start now."

He leaned in with a grin. After a brief hesitation, Liu Shuwan met him halfway. But she quickly realized something was off—Qin Jiang's lips had migrated away from her mouth.

"That's not how kissing works!" she blurted.

But Qin Jiang ignored her protests and continued doing as he pleased. Liu Shuwan's fists clenched, her body going weak. This wasn't what she'd agreed to at all.

An hour later, Qin Jiang stood beside the stone bed. Liu Shuwan glared at him with reddened eyes. Technically, he'd only been kissing her... but his interpretation of "kissing" was outrageous.
