Watching Qin Jiang zone out, Huo Ying'er assumed he was deliberating. But his prolonged silence made her anxious.

She'd agreed to marry Huo Lie for two reasons: the mounting pressure he'd been putting on the Martial Division, and the opportunity to assassinate him on their wedding night. Qin Jiang had given her a far better option. If he agreed, Huo Lie was as good as dead. If he refused, her chances of success were almost nil.

"Young Master Qin, have you decided?"

Qin Jiang snapped back from the system spoiler and looked at her with a smile. "Huo Lie is a nobody. Killing him would be trivial."

Huo Ying'er's spirits soared, but then she tensed. She understood the implication—Qin Jiang could eliminate Huo Lie whenever he pleased. The timing, however, depended on her.

She bit her lip, cheeks flushing. Though she'd offered herself as the price for Huo Lie's death, now that the moment had arrived, she couldn't help feeling nervous.

"You know what happens after the wedding ceremony, right?" Qin Jiang strolled toward the bed. Huo Lie had genuinely spared no expense on the furnishings—the man had real feelings for Huo Ying'er, that much was clear.

As Qin Jiang drew closer, Huo Ying'er's body went rigid. Her lashes lowered.

"I've... never done this before. If Young Master Qin wants to... I'll cooperate." Her voice was barely a whisper. Then, cheeks reddening further, she added, "I'm a little afraid of pain. Could you... be gentle?"

Her slender fingers twisted together, betraying her nerves.

"For Huo Qing'er?" Qin Jiang asked.

Huo Ying'er's head snapped up, staring at him in shock. "How do you know?"

"Qing'er told me."

Her eyes went wide, then erupted with joy. "You know Qing'er? She's alive?"

"Want to see her?"

"Yes! Yes!" She nodded frantically, so overcome with excitement that she unconsciously grabbed Qin Jiang's arm.

He smiled and clasped her hand. Only then did she realize what she'd done. A blush crept across her face, but she didn't pull away. Whether it was killing Huo Lie or seeing Huo Qing'er, she needed Qin Jiang for both.

"Let's break the ice tonight. In a few days, I'll take you to Qing'er. Wouldn't want you to be overwhelmed all at once."

He pulled her into his arms.

She trembled slightly, face burning. "Break the ice how...?"

Qin Jiang commandeered Huo Lie's meticulously prepared newlywed suite. No one was to approach.

The next morning, Qin Jiang emerged from the chamber, stretching languidly in the sunlight.

Huo Lie, who'd been hovering at a distance, scurried over with a deferential bow. "Young Master Qin."

His gaze flicked toward the chamber behind Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang smiled and clapped him on the shoulder. "Nice chamber. Great ambiance..."

Huo Lie's jaw clenched. He kept his head down, hiding the fury in his eyes. "Glad Young Master Qin enjoyed it."

"Oh, I did. I hear Ying'er is the Fire Tribe's greatest beauty, after all."

The chamber door opened. Huo Ying'er stepped out, her cheeks still tinged with pink, and walked to Qin Jiang's side. She took his arm and didn't spare Huo Lie a glance.

Huo Lie's eyelid twitched. His own bride, in his own bridal chamber, with another man—and now she clung to that man's arm right in front of him.

The humiliation. The rage. But he was powerless.

Qin Jiang kissed Huo Ying'er's forehead without a shred of self-consciousness, then looked at Huo Lie. "This residence is mine now. No one sets foot inside without my permission."

When you were strong enough, everywhere was home turf.

Huo Lie agreed.

Satisfied, Qin Jiang nodded. The Void Beast's enormous head materialized beside him. He led Huo Ying'er onto the beast and into the traveling palace.

The first person Huo Ying'er noticed inside was Huo Qing'er. That familiar face brought instant tears to her eyes.

Huo Qing'er smiled warmly and stood. "Ying'er. It's been a while."

"Qing'er..." Huo Ying'er's voice cracked, and she flung herself at her friend.

The two women held each other tight. Huo Qing'er's own eyes glistened.

"I thought... I thought you were..." Huo Ying'er wept openly, barely able to form words.

Huo Qing'er patted her back, murmuring gentle reassurances.

Nearby, Qin Lian'er was perched with a handful of sunflower seeds, whispering to Little Red while stealing curious glances at the reunited friends.

Then Qin Jiang walked over.

"Brother!" Qin Lian'er greeted him with a grin.

He nodded and studied her. "You went out yesterday?"

"Huh?" Her expression froze, a flicker of guilt crossing her face. "I had guards with me."

"Did you run into anyone unusual, or anything out of the ordinary?"

She nodded, fishing out a piece of white jade. "Brother, I'm telling you—this is definitely something good! I sna—bought it. Total bargain."

At the sight of the jade, Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. He'd seen this item in the spoiler. He nodded. "You're right. There's an Emperor Technique sealed inside."

"An Emperor Technique?" Qin Lian'er's eyes went round. Then she beamed and thrust the jade toward him. "For you, Brother!"

But Qin Jiang shook his head. "It's a fire-attribute technique. Keep it—I can't be bothered to learn it."

The system's techniques he could master instantly. Anything else required too much time and effort.

"Fire-attribute..." Qin Lian'er turned the jade over in her hands. That ruled out her brother. "So how do I get the technique out?"

"You didn't know?"

"Nope."

"Then how did you know it was valuable?"

She tapped the spot between her brows. "It told me."

The Immortal Fire again. Could it actually be a sentient flame? If so, it might pose a risk to Qin Lian'er.

He studied her for a long moment, then turned his attention to the jade. "Burn it with fire and the technique will emerge. But at your current cultivation level, be careful when practicing it."

"I'll be careful~" She grinned.

But she didn't extract the technique right away. Instead, she turned to watch Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er's tearful reunion. Emperor Techniques could wait—drama like this didn't happen every day.
