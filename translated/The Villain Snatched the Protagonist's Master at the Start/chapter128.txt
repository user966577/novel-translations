Over the following days, Qin Jiang led the women on what amounted to a sightseeing tour. Using the spoilers, he picked up a few minor fortunes along the way.

Leisurely and pleasant.

Finally, five days later, a massive gateway appeared in the sky—the Dragon Nest was closing. Figures shot upward from every direction, diving through the portal to escape.

Back in the imperial palace's throne hall, the permanent gateway that had been humming with energy finally stirred. One by one, figures poured out.

The Dragon Emperor and all four Patrons had been waiting. They watched the young disciples emerge, most showing modest improvements in strength, and nodded approvingly.

Something was off, though. The Dragon Emperor noticed that the majority looked distinctly unhappy.

That mystery resolved itself when Qin Jiang's group walked out, all smiles. He tossed the Dragon Emperor a casual wave, didn't bother lingering, and led his women straight out of the hall.

The Dragon Emperor didn't think much of it.

After a while, everyone had returned and the gateway closed. The Dragon Emperor turned his gaze to Long Yu. His most beloved son wore a dark expression, not a trace of a smile. Frowning, the Emperor offered a few perfunctory words of encouragement, urged everyone to train hard, then dismissed the crowd.

"Yu'er, stay."

He kept Long Yu behind. Once the hall had cleared, the Dragon Emperor studied his son. "Bad haul?"

Long Yu nodded glumly. Before Qin Jiang's arrival, everything had gone smoothly. Since then, setback after setback—not a single advantage gained. The hits to his confidence had been devastating.

And then there was the worst of it.

"Father, the Dragon Palace is gone."

The Dragon Emperor blinked. "What do you mean?"

"The entire Dragon Palace. Qin Jiang took it—building and all. Every treasure inside, gone."

Remembering the scene made Long Yu's cheek twitch. Qin Jiang had been utterly ruthless. Long Yu had been slogging up those stairs, the summit almost in reach, only to be beaten to the punch. Not a scrap left behind.

The Dragon Emperor's face darkened. The Dragon Palace was the founding ancestor's legacy. No one had ever reached the top, and now a foreigner had walked off with the whole thing.

"Wait." Something didn't add up. "Non-royals can't even set foot on those stairs. How did Qin Jiang take it?"

"No idea." Long Yu shook his head. "All I know is he walked right up like it was nothing—and brought Third Sister with him. He cleaned out the inside, then packed up the entire palace."

The Dragon Emperor: "..."

Their founder had been an immortal-path powerhouse. The rules she'd laid down couldn't be broken by even a Great Emperor. Yet Qin Jiang had bypassed them entirely. At his cultivation level, that should've been impossible—which meant one thing.

He'd used a treasure. And to override an immortal's restrictions, that treasure had to be immortal-grade.

A gleam passed through the Dragon Emperor's eyes, but he quickly shook his head, wariness flooding his expression. If Qin Jiang possessed an immortal treasure, then behind him stood an immortal-path powerhouse. His caution toward Qin Jiang deepened further.

A single immortal could annihilate an entire continent.

Taking a steadying breath, he looked at Long Yu. "Yu'er, Qin Jiang is no ordinary person. He's also our empire's son-in-law now. Whatever you do, don't provoke him."

"Mm." Long Yu nodded, frustration and resentment simmering beneath the surface. The taste of failure was unbearable.

Satisfied with his son's compliance, the Dragon Emperor relaxed slightly and managed a smile. "Tell me about your time in the Dragon Nest."

"The Dragon Nest..." Long Yu's mouth twitched. The entire experience had been the Qin Jiang Show. What was there to tell?

But under his father's expectant gaze, he nodded and began a simple recounting—from the Myriad Realms Tower through to the Dragon Palace. The starring role in every episode: Qin Jiang.

"Number one on the Myriad Realms Tower..."

The Dragon Emperor was shaken. He'd challenged the tower himself and understood its difficulty. Long Yu making the top hundred had been a point of pride. But then hearing that Qin Lian'er and Little Red had bumped his son out of the top hundred drew a grimace, and learning that Qin Jiang had claimed the number one spot left him thoroughly stunned.

This confirmed it. Qin Jiang had to be the heir of the most elite clan above the Nine Heavens. Absolutely not to be crossed.

He even suspected that Qin Jiang's visible entourage wasn't his full strength—there might well be immortal-path guardians lurking in the shadows.

His eyes glimmered. Perhaps, starting now, the policy shouldn't just be "don't provoke." It should be "actively cultivate friendship." A single casual favor from a peak Nine Heavens clan could catapult the Divine Dragon Empire to new heights.

And with his own daughter in the picture, befriending Qin Jiang shouldn't be difficult.

Only...

The Dragon Emperor looked at Long Yu, brow furrowing. He'd always known Long Xin'er and Long Yu were at odds, and he'd sided with Long Yu—deliberately distancing himself from Long Xin'er. Had he not done so, her talent alone would have warranted serious investment. Aside from Long Yu, she was the most gifted among all the royal children.

Two supremely talented children, born enemies. He'd chosen Long Yu.

But now, courting Qin Jiang's favor meant leveraging Long Xin'er. And doing that meant Long Yu's position...

The Dragon Emperor rubbed his temples. Was he really going to abandon the heir he'd groomed for years?

Long Yu was still talking: "The founding ancestor's Dragon Pearl—Qin Jiang subdued it and gave it to Third Sister."

"Hm?" The Dragon Emperor's brows rose. "Xin'er obtained the Dragon Pearl?"

"I saw it with my own eyes." Long Yu's fist clenched. With his bloodline, he could have reached the palace summit. But Qin Jiang had beaten him there.

The Dragon Emperor stroked his chin, eyes deep in thought. If that was the case, pivoting to Long Xin'er wasn't unreasonable at all.

The Dragon Pearl—the crystallized cultivation of an immortal founder. If Long Xin'er refined it, she had at least an eighty percent chance of reaching the immortal path.

A future immortal versus someone a future immortal despised—the choice wasn't difficult.

After Long Yu finished, the Dragon Emperor nodded and waved him off. "That'll do. Go rest."

"Huh?" Long Yu was mildly surprised but didn't dwell on it. He nodded and left.

Watching his retreating back, the Dragon Emperor shook his head and murmured:

"Yu'er, don't blame your father. As a member of the imperial family, the big picture must come first. Right now, Xin'er is the better choice."
