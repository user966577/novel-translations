Qin Jiang fled desperately while the old man chased relentlessly, throwing the entire Qin estate into chaos.

"You rebellious brat, stop right there!"

The old man roared.

Qin Jiang didn't dare stop. He dodged his grandfather's belt while running toward the back mountain, crying for help the entire way.

"Great-grandfather! Great-great-grandfather! Ancestors! If you don't come out soon, I'm going to be beaten to death!"

Qin Jiang shouted.

The old man's beard bristled with rage. He raised his belt and swung.

"You rebellious brat, you dare call for backup? Watch me beat you to death!"

"Rebellious son, stop right there!"

Just then, a figure appeared in front of Qin Jiang, grabbing hold of the old man's belt.

"Wahh, Great-grandfather, you're finally here! This old man's trying to kill me!"

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. He immediately started complaining pitifully.

The old man's face twitched.

"Father, I..."

"Shut up!"

Great-grandfather glared at him. Then he turned to look at Qin Jiang, his expression softening.

"My dear grandson, are you hurt?"

At his words, Qin Jiang rolled up his sleeve to reveal a red welt left by the belt. He said nothing, but his aggrieved appearance immediately made Great-grandfather's heart ache.

His expression turned furious as he looked at the old man.

"You bastard! Rebellious son! You dare strike my dear grandson? Watch me beat you to death!"

With that, he raised the belt and began whipping the old man.

The old man's face changed. He kept dodging.

"You dare dodge?"

Great-grandfather's eyes bulged. His mighty pressure burst forth, locking the old man in place. The belt showed no mercy as it struck again and again.

Qin Jiang watched from the side. The old man's face alternated between green and white—at his age, his father wasn't giving him any face at all.

And in front of his own grandson, no less.

After venting his frustration, Great-grandfather snorted coldly and released the old man.

Feeling the stinging pain across his body, the old man grimaced and bared his teeth. He even glared at Qin Jiang.

"Great-grandfather, he's glaring at me!"

Qin Jiang immediately tattled. Then he glared back at his grandfather with an arrogant expression.

"Try me! I'll call out all the ancestors!"

The old man: "..."

Qin Jiang really could summon all the ancestors. After all, when Qin Jiang was born, he'd drawn the attention of the ancient ancestors. His position as young master had been decided by the ancestors themselves.

"Enough."

Great-grandfather waved his hand and looked at the old man.

"Rebellious son, tell me—why were you hitting my dear grandson?"

The old man also felt somewhat wronged.

"Father, you know. Ten years ago, when I went out and encountered danger, one of our vassal families paid a tremendous price to save my life.

"At that time, I arranged an engagement with them as repayment. But then..."

He looked at Qin Jiang, anger in his voice.

"Then this little bastard privately took people to break off the engagement and demolished their entire estate!

"How could I not be angry?

"This is damaging our Qin family's reputation!"

Listening to the old man's account, Qin Jiang curled his lip dismissively.

"There are plenty of ways to repay a debt. Why did it have to be marrying off Lian'er?

"You want to repay your debt? Don't drag Lian'er into it."

"Bastard! Rebellious grandson!"

The old man was furious.

But Great-grandfather shot him a glare, and he immediately deflated.

Great-grandfather spoke calmly, "Jiang'er is right. If you want to repay a debt, there's no need to sacrifice little Lian'er's happiness.

"Besides, even without that vassal family, you wouldn't have died—just suffered a bit more."

"Exactly, exactly."

Qin Jiang nodded in agreement. Then he added consolingly, "But Grandfather, don't be angry. Although Lian'er's engagement is void, I brought back a girl from the Xiao family to repay your debt. That's basically an engagement too."

The old man: "..."

Great-grandfather: "???"

Both of them stared at Qin Jiang. Was that his justification for kidnapping a woman?

Under their gazes, Qin Jiang laughed awkwardly.

"I really did bring that girl back to help Grandfather repay his debt."

The old man exhaled a turbid breath.

"Then I really must thank you."

"Well, you are my grandfather after all."

Qin Jiang waved his hand dismissively.

The old man ground his teeth. This shameless creature was actually his descendant!

Great-grandfather's expression turned strange. He cleared his throat.

"Jiang'er, as the Qin family's young master, your future dao companion isn't something to be trifled with."

"Can I only have one dao companion?"

Qin Jiang asked curiously.

Great-grandfather and the old man exchanged glances. Then they simultaneously smacked their foreheads. Right—for a great clan like theirs, having multiple wives and concubines was perfectly normal.

It was just that...

Both of them were henpecked husbands who'd only ever had one dao companion their entire lives.

Thinking of this, they couldn't help but feel a bit sour.

They looked at Qin Jiang and sighed in unison.

"Jiang'er, you're more capable than us."

Qin Jiang chuckled, but before he could respond, the old man suddenly frowned.

"Wait!

"The information I received said the girl you brought back is the Ye family's princess!"

Great-grandfather was also taken aback.

The Ye family's princess... she could barely be considered a match for Jiang'er.

Qin Jiang nodded.

"That's right.

"The Ye family's princess, lost since childhood, was picked up by the Xiao family. Before she could even return to her clan, I brought her back."

"And she apparently doesn't even like you."

"Right.

"I threatened her, and that's the only reason she came back with me."

The old man: "..."

Great-grandfather: "..."

"Why do you look so proud of yourself?"

The old man's mouth twitched.

Qin Jiang blinked.

"I, the Qin family's young master, casually snatched a woman and she turned out to be the Ye family's princess. Shouldn't I be proud?"

Hearing his words, both elders were stunned.

For a moment, they couldn't decide whether Qin Jiang was right or wrong.

One thing was certain, though—the Qin family's education of Qin Jiang had gone somewhat astray.

Seeing them frozen in place, Qin Jiang waved his hand.

"Well then, if there's nothing else, I'll be going."

"Wait!"

The old man stopped him. After a moment's thought, he asked, "What do you plan to do with the Ye family princess?"

"Submit, or die."

Qin Jiang said casually.

With that, he turned and left.

Watching his retreating figure, the two elders exchanged glances. Great-grandfather sighed with emotion.

"The little one's grown up."

"Isn't he being a bit too ruthless?"

"Ha ha ha! Being ruthless is good! If he's not ruthless, how can he control our massive Qin family?"

Great-grandfather laughed heartily.

Then he looked at the old man, his face filling with disdain.

"It's been so many years and you still haven't broken through to Saint. Go to Reflection Cliff now. You're not allowed to leave until you reach the Saint realm!"

The old man: "..."

He was being put in confinement?

"Right now, Hao'er has already caught up to you. If you don't break through soon, Jiang'er will catch up too. Where will you put your face then?"

Great-grandfather finished speaking and drifted away.

The old man's whole body trembled. He really did need to break through soon. Having his son catch up to him was embarrassing enough. His rebellious grandson's talent was even more formidable—he really might catch up.
