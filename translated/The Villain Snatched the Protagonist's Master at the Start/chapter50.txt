Qin Lian'er closed her eyes gently. Her aura remained unchanged, but the flames she was emanating suddenly spiked in temperature.

The Phoenix Egg seemed to grow even more excited, bouncing around in the fire and greedily absorbing the flames. Its shell grew brighter and more luminous with each passing moment.

Soon, Qin Lian'er opened her eyes, looking thoroughly bewildered.

Qin Jiang asked immediately:

"How do you feel? Any gains?"

Qin Lian'er touched her forehead. Qin Jiang followed her gaze and saw a flame mark had appeared there, looking as vivid as a real flame.

"What is..."

"Brother, it's the pearl. It turned into a flame."

As she spoke, the flame mark on Qin Lian'er's forehead trembled and materialized, hovering before her.

Qin Jiang frowned. In Xiao Fan's spoiler, there had been nothing like this. Or rather, in the timeline he'd seen, Xiao Fan hadn't possessed the ability to trigger this kind of transformation in the Fire Spirit Pearl.

Qin Lian'er extended her small hand, and the flame darted into her palm.

Playing with the fire casually, she turned to Qin Jiang with curious eyes.

"Brother, this fire is telling me it's an Immortal Fire. What's an Immortal Fire?"

"Immortal Fire? Immortal?"

Qin Jiang's eyes widened, a flash of delight crossing his face as he stared at the flame.

By now, he had a vague sense that above the Great Emperor realm lay what was known as the Immortal level. Currently, the only Immortal-grade treasure in his possession was the Time-Space Disc.

And it was only two fragments.

Other than that...

There was only the Immortal Fire in Lian'er's hand!

His gaze turned heated, though of course he'd never take it back from his sister. Besides, this Immortal Fire could only reach its full potential in Qin Lian'er's hands.

Qin Jiang took a deep breath, his expression turning grave.

"Lian'er, this Immortal Fire—don't use it unless absolutely necessary. And don't let anyone else find out what it is."

He didn't know whether others on the Heavenly Mystery Continent were aware that Immortals existed, but anything touching on the Immortal level would undoubtedly drive people mad.

Because it very likely represented something beyond the Great Emperor.

If someone recognized this flame for what it was, it could bring serious trouble.

And right now, the Qin family wasn't strong enough to openly possess an Immortal-grade treasure.

A precious gem invites disaster.

Hearing how serious Qin Jiang sounded, Qin Lian'er nodded obediently. She always took her brother's words as gospel.

"Put it away."

Qin Lian'er nodded and withdrew the Immortal Fire.

They turned their attention to the Phoenix Egg. It wouldn't hatch anytime soon, so Qin Lian'er stored it away as well, planning to continue the incubation process back in her quarters.

After seeing Lian'er home, Qin Jiang returned to his own residence.

Ye Ling'er and the others rushed to greet him.

Another passionate night followed.

The next day, after a brief rest, Qin Jiang produced a small cauldron.

It was Ye Xuan's treasure.

He'd been mulling over something: Xiao Fan's natal treasure had turned out to be Immortal Fire. As another Child of Destiny, could Ye Xuan's little cauldron also be an Immortal-grade treasure?

He examined it from every angle, knocking and tapping, even feeding it various valuables. It seemed that... apart from being able to refine anything into pure energy, the cauldron was completely useless.

Qin Jiang curled his lip and tossed it aside.

This piece of junk wasn't even as good as his Taotie Divine Body.

"Whatever. Let the family disciples use it."

He summoned Black Dragon and had him take the cauldron to the Qin family's training arena, with instructions to let any disciple who wanted to use it do so.

At the very least, it could raise the overall cultivation level of the family's younger generation.

That settled, Qin Jiang's brow furrowed slightly. A nagging feeling had crept in—the Qin family was too weak. They couldn't even openly possess a single Immortal-grade treasure without needing to keep it hidden.

If the Qin family had an Immortal-level powerhouse, would they need to be this cautious?

"I need to find a way to strengthen the family."

Qin Jiang murmured to himself.

On the Heavenly Mystery Continent, the Qin family was already at the pinnacle. But above the continent lay the Nine Heavens, and the other Ten Lands were no weaker either.

In the grand scheme of the world, the Qin family's strength was unremarkable.

"System, has Xiao Fan's fortune been transferred to the Qin family yet?"

Qin Jiang suddenly remembered the previous system mission—transferring Xiao Fan's fortune to the Qin family.

But nothing seemed to have changed.

【No.】

Qin Jiang's eyes bulged.

"System, that's dirty! You weren't going to transfer it unless I asked? Were you planning to pocket it?"

The system was silent for a moment before responding:

【The Qin family's fortune is currently bleeding away. Are you sure you want to transfer it now?】

"Hm?"

Qin Jiang was startled.

"The Qin family's fortune is bleeding away?"

【Yes.】

"What the hell? Who's doing this?"

Fury blazed in Qin Jiang's eyes. Someone was tampering with the Qin family's fortune?

Fortune was a nebulous concept, yet it was undeniably real.

Children of Destiny were people with an abundance of fortune—they could stumble off a cliff and land on a treasure.

But if someone's fortune was completely drained? They probably wouldn't last long.

The same applied to families.

【It's not just the Qin family. Most families on the Heavenly Mystery Continent are experiencing a drain on their fortune...】

The system's words gave Qin Jiang a jolt.

Most families' fortune was draining?

That meant...

His eyes flashed. He looked upward.

"Is it the Heavenly Dao?"

【The Host is quite perceptive.】

"Don't tell me the Heavenly Dao is siphoning fortune from the major families to nurture Children of Destiny?"

A terrible suspicion took shape. Qin Jiang couldn't hold back a curse.

【Yes.】

With the confirmation, Qin Jiang was seething. Was the Heavenly Dao out of its mind? Draining the ancient clans' fortune to raise up Children of Destiny, then having those same Children of Destiny destroy the clans...

What kind of sick game was this?

【What prospers must decline. This is the rule the Heavenly Dao has set.】

The system explained.

Qin Jiang's brow creased.

"You mean that when a family stays powerful for too long, the Heavenly Dao perceives them as a threat and decides to reshuffle the deck? Topple the old guard and prop up new forces that aren't a threat?"

【The Host truly is the Host—figuring out the Heavenly Dao's scheme so quickly.】

Qin Jiang was unimpressed by the flattery.

He frowned.

"But how do I stop the fortune from bleeding away?"

【Ahem. The Host might want to check the system shop. There may be something useful.】

Qin Jiang blinked, immediately grasping the hint. He pulled open the shop.

【FLASH SALE — Fortune-Sealing Stele. Only costs Villain Points!】

A line of enormous red text practically leaped off the screen.

"A Fortune-Sealing Stele? It can seal and protect fortune, preventing it from draining?"

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up.

For this? Villain Points well spent.
