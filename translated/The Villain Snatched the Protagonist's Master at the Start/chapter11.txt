Over the following days, Qin Jiang stabilized his cultivation while familiarizing himself with the Taotie Divine Body.

He flipped his palm, and a devouring force appeared at its center—dark and unfathomable. Just gazing at it felt as though one's soul might be drawn in.

Streams of spiritual energy surged continuously into his palm. Rather than absorbing them, Qin Jiang condensed the power. As the energy accumulated, the surrounding space began to tremble.

The corner of Qin Jiang's mouth curled. He hurled the condensed energy toward a corner of the room.

A thunderous blast rang out, and violent force churned through the air. But immediately, another power appeared, smoothing his attack away entirely.

"You little brat—did you do that on purpose?"

The Fourth Ancestor emerged from the corner, cursing under his breath.

Qin Jiang grinned.

"Fourth Ancestor, how was my attack? What realm could it reach?"

The Fourth Ancestor considered briefly. That strike meant nothing to him personally, but for someone at Qin Jiang's cultivation level, it was genuinely impressive.

"Barely touching the threshold of the Yin-Yang Realm. With your talent, unleashing an attack one major realm above your own isn't exactly something to brag about."

The Fourth Ancestor said dismissively.

But Qin Jiang was quite satisfied. That strike had been a simple application of the Taotie Divine Body—he hadn't drawn on his own power at all, let alone pushed the Divine Body to its limits.

He estimated that at full power, instantly killing a Yin-Yang Realm expert shouldn't be a problem.

The only downside was that the windup was a bit slow.

But that wasn't without solutions.

Withdrawing the devouring force, Qin Jiang looked at the Fourth Ancestor.

"Fourth Ancestor, I'm planning to head out."

"Suit yourself. We've agreed not to interfere with any of your decisions. Do whatever you want—no need to ask us. And if you ever need anything, just say the word."

This was the collective decision of all the ancestors.

For a once-in-an-eternity genius like Qin Jiang, the best cultivation was total freedom.

Of course, his safety still had to be ensured.

So besides the Fourth Ancestor, the guards around Qin Jiang had all been replaced with far more formidable ones—every last one at least Yin-Yang Realm, with no shortage of Unity Realm experts among them.

There were also two Saints and one Supreme.

And those were just the ones in plain sight. More powerhouses lurked in the shadows, protecting Qin Jiang at all times.

This force, combined with the Fourth Ancestor, could annihilate some of the weaker ancient clans outright.

Leaving the residence, Black Dragon fell into step behind Qin Jiang. During this period, Black Dragon had refined the Ancestral Dragon Blood Essence, evolving his bloodline and vaulting his cultivation straight to the Unity Realm.

It was precisely for this reason that he hadn't been replaced and still served at Qin Jiang's side.

The two walked one behind the other until they reached a secluded courtyard.

Qin Jiang pushed the door open without hesitation.

His gaze swept the yard. Spotting a graceful figure beneath a tree, a smile spread across his face.

"Young Patriarch, you've come."

Ye Kuan hurried forward to bow.

Ye Ling'er turned to look. A flicker of emotion crossed her beautiful eyes. Her pretty face remained cold, but being under someone else's roof, she offered a slight curtsy.

"Young Patriarch."

"No need for formalities."

Qin Jiang smiled, reaching out to help her up—and conveniently taking hold of her small hand. He asked with concern:

"Is Ling'er settling in well with the Qin family?"

Ye Ling'er's delicate brows knit together. She tried to pull free, but Qin Jiang's strength wasn't something she could match. No matter how she struggled, he stood immovable.

Moreover, his familiar way of addressing her made her skin crawl.

"Young Patriarch, please show some restraint."

Her voice was cold.

But Qin Jiang's expression didn't change as his fingers kneaded her palm. Off to the side, Ye Kuan studied the sky, then studied the ground—anywhere but at his own lady.

Ye Ling'er's face darkened. Such intimate contact was something even Xiao Fan had never dared.

"You want to see Xiao Fan, don't you?"

Qin Jiang said lightly.

Ye Ling'er's pretty face stiffened, tension flooding through her.

"What are you going to do?"

"Heh, I just thought I'd take you to see him. You pine for him so much every day—it breaks my heart."

He pinched Ye Ling'er's chin.

His voice was gentle, but hearing it sent chills through her entire body.

"No—don't go looking for him!"

Her voice carried a plea.

In her mind, Qin Jiang intended to use Xiao Fan to threaten her. That was partly true—but he was also going to change the storyline.

Xiao Fan had already left the Xiao family.

Much earlier than in the original plot, and leaving the Xiao family marked the beginning of his rapid growth period. Several fortuitous encounters awaited him, and Qin Jiang intended to snatch them first.

Two hours later, Qin Jiang departed from the Qin estate. This time he kept a low profile—his entourage was small, consisting only of Ye Ling'er, Black Dragon, and Ye Kuan. Everyone else remained hidden.

Ye Ling'er's beautiful eyes were rimmed with red. She'd pleaded at length, but couldn't sway Qin Jiang's decision. All she could do was follow him. If Qin Jiang moved against Xiao Fan, perhaps she could intercede.

And if it came down to it, she would have no choice but to...

Give herself to Qin Jiang.

At the thought, tears welled in her eyes.

They traveled at a leisurely pace, like tourists enjoying the scenery. Three days later, Qin Jiang walked into a small town, Ye Ling'er's hand in his.

By now, she'd grown numb to being led by the hand.

Habit, it turned out, was a terrifying thing.

Ye Ling'er surveyed the town. This wasn't where the Xiao family was based.

Could it be that Qin Jiang wasn't looking for Xiao Fan after all?

She glanced at him, puzzled.

"Want to watch a good show?"

Qin Jiang looked at her with a smile.

She averted her gaze without answering. She had no say in the matter regardless.

Seeing her reaction, Qin Jiang chuckled softly and led her toward the center of town.

About an hour later, Qin Jiang arrived at the upper floor of a restaurant. He opened a window overlooking a stage set up below, surrounded by a sizable crowd.

A large banner hung across the stage—Tournament for a Bride.

Ye Ling'er glanced at the stage without interest.

Standing by the window, Qin Jiang slipped his arm around her waist. She squirmed uncomfortably for a moment before giving up resistance, silently enduring his liberties.

Perhaps if she tolerated this, her pleas on Xiao Fan's behalf would carry more weight.

She consoled herself.

Qin Jiang pointed at the stage and said softly:

"The woman holding this tournament is the city lord's daughter. They say she's the most beautiful woman within thousands of miles. Quite a few men have shown up, hoping to win her heart."

"You too?"

Ye Ling'er looked surprised.

Qin Jiang nodded earnestly.

"The thought has crossed my mind. But there should be another surprise in store.

"Before long, you might even beg me to get up there and steal the bride."

Ye Ling'er's brows furrowed. Looking at Qin Jiang's enigmatic smile, an uneasy feeling stirred within her.

Just then, a gong rang out, marking the start of the tournament. A breathtakingly beautiful figure descended from a restaurant on the opposite side, drifting gracefully down to the stage.
