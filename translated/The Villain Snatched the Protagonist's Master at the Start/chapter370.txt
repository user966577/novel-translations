They arrived at the Zhao family's main estate swiftly. Hovering in the sky, Jian Yao raised her sword — she'd been building power since they left the Sword Sect.

No hesitation. She brought it down.

A sword beam a thousand feet tall split the heavens and crashed toward the estate below. Every Zhao within the compound looked up in horror. The killing intent alone was suffocating — death, descending from above.

But the Zhao family hadn't survived a million years on reputation alone. The instant the strike fell, a massive defensive formation blazed to life and absorbed the blow. Powerful auras erupted from within the compound.

"You dare attack the Zhao family? You're courting death!"

The fury was understandable — Jian Yao's opening strike would have leveled half the estate without that formation. Figures materialized in the sky, glaring at the intruders.

Their expressions shifted immediately.

Only five people. But the weakest among them was a Human Immortal, and the Zhao elders recognized every face. Huaxia's lord — Qin Jiang. The only Immortal King — An Xihe. Two True Immortals. And Jian Yao.

As one of Grey Cloud Heaven's hegemons, the Zhao family kept tabs on neighboring realms. When an Immortal King had emerged in Azure Cloud Heaven, they'd naturally investigated — and there, among the key figures, they'd found a painfully familiar face.

Jian Yao. Huaxia's lord's woman.

Zhao Xing, the current family head — the former young master who'd once demanded Jian Yao as his bride — had recognized her instantly. That day, his world had tilted. The woman his family had hounded to the edge of death had not only survived, but attached herself to the most powerful rising force in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

He'd spent every day since praying she'd forgiven the past, or that Huaxia's lord didn't care enough to act on it.

That prayer died on the spot.

Huaxia's lord had come personally, with an Immortal King and two True Immortals in tow. This was an extermination squad.

Zhao Xing took a steadying breath and forced a smile. "What an honor — the lord of Huaxia himself graces us with his presence. We've been remiss in our hospitality. Please forgive us."

"You know me?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. His reputation had clearly preceded him.

He smiled. "Since you know who I am, you know why I'm here. Let's not waste words. The Zhao family ends today."

Zhao Xing's smile froze. His kinsmen bristled with indignation. Who did Huaxia think they were? A new power — strong, yes, but the Zhao family was no pushover. A million years of accumulated might stood behind them. They glared at Qin Jiang with hostile defiance. A lifetime of dominance had left them incapable of humility, even when facing an Immortal King. They'd never encountered one before. They had no idea how vast the gap truly was.

Zhao Xing's expression hardened. "Lord Qin, you must be joking."

"Joking?" Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. "You obviously have no idea what you're dealing with."

"Huaxia may be strong, but so is the Zhao family!" Zhao Xing saw no way to avoid the fight. If war was inevitable, so be it. A million years of heritage — surely that could withstand a single Immortal King? "Let us see just how powerful an Immortal King truly is!"

Qin Jiang turned to An Xihe. "Interested?"

"Ants." She didn't even glance at them. A single Human Immortal wasn't worth her time. Her job was protecting Qin Jiang — in the women's minds, he was practically made of glass. Below Great Emperor? Let him play. Ancient Emperor? Caution. Human Immortal opponent? Full protection. And with a True Immortal on the other side, maximum vigilance was mandatory.

Qing Chan and Mo Mo exchanged a look. "We'll handle it. But the True Immortal is yours, Xihe."

They could manage the Zhao family's True Immortal in a fight, but killing one cleanly required An Xihe's power.

"I'll step in when it matters," An Xihe said.

The two True Immortals unleashed their power, and it enveloped the Zhao estate like a tidal wave. Zhao Xing bellowed at his people to form defensive arrays. Formations lit up across the compound, drawing on the full might of the clan.

An Xihe gave the arrays a single dismissive glance. Garbage.

Qing Chan and Mo Mo struck. The battle erupted.

Jian Yao moved to join, but Qin Jiang held her back. At this level of combat, a Human Immortal could easily be injured — and he'd worry. He turned to An Xihe. "Keep an eye out. Don't let Chan'er or Mo Mo get hurt."

"I know, I know. You're such a worrier. They'll be fine."

"Heh. I worry about you too, you know."
