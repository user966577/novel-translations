One month later, three immortal vessels departed from Huaxia, bound for the Heavenly Domain passage.

Over the past month, just over ten thousand people across all of Huaxia had passed the trial. They were now assembled aboard the three ships. With Huaxia's affairs settled, Qin Jiang led the entire delegation toward the Heavenly Domain. He and the women rode the central vessel, flanked by escort ships fore and aft.

Inside the passage, everything was a hazy grey—much like traversing the Chaos. They traveled for three full months before light finally appeared ahead.

Aboard the central vessel, Qin Jiang stood at the prow. "That should be the exit."

Within two hours of spotting the light, they emerged. The view opened up dramatically, and directly ahead stood a magnificent city, its name blazing in luminous characters: Skyreach City.

Scattered around the city were numerous other passages, apparently connecting to various realms across the Heavenly Domain. From one of them, a group emerged at the same moment. Spotting Qin Jiang's flotilla, they steered their vessel straight toward them and soon reached the lead ship.

Qin Jiang didn't think much of it. Making contacts early in the Heavenly Domain wasn't a bad idea. Then—

BOOM!

A violent explosion rocked the air, followed by a shockwave of energy.

"They're fighting?" Qin Jiang was mildly surprised. He wasn't a Child of Destiny—why would trouble find him the moment he arrived?

He shook his head and didn't intervene. The lead ship's personnel could handle energy of this level easily.

Sure enough, the disturbance died down moments later. Black Dragon appeared outside the vessel.

Qin Jiang stepped out to meet him. Black Dragon bowed immediately. "Young Master."

"At ease." Qin Jiang waved the formality away. "What happened?"

"A group from a Level One Domain. At first they were polite—wanted to travel together for mutual benefit. But when they found out we're from a Level Two Domain, they turned on us. Tried to seize our ships."

Indignation flashed across Black Dragon's face. Since following Qin Jiang, no one had ever looked down on him. But these Level One Domain people had been utterly insufferable.

Qin Jiang shook his head. So there was a pecking order between domains. Under normal circumstances, a Level One Domain would be considerably stronger than Level Two. The thing was, the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands was no ordinary Level Two Domain. One Immortal Emperor and eight Immortal Kings—that lineup met Level One standards and was formidable even among them.

These people had kicked an iron wall.

"All handled?"

Black Dragon nodded. "They only had three True Immortals. Once they saw our roster, they surrendered immediately. All detained. Your orders, Young Master?"

"We should keep a low profile in the Heavenly Domain." Qin Jiang paused. "So—kill them all."

"Yes, sir."

Black Dragon wasn't the least bit surprised. He'd served Qin Jiang long enough to understand his thinking. Low profile? Simple. Kill everyone, leave no witnesses. That's true discretion.

He was about to leave when Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, looking ahead, and shook his head. "Looks like staying low-key isn't an option."

Following his gaze, Black Dragon frowned. Another group was approaching fast, appearing before the ships in moments.

Qin Jiang waved. "Let's go have a look."

He stepped forward, Black Dragon close behind. Even before reaching them, Qin Jiang could see they wore matching uniforms with the characters for "Skyreach" emblazoned on their chests.

"Skyreach City's people?"

He glanced at the city in the distance. The brief skirmish had drawn their attention.

Skyreach City was, in fact, an organization—an official governing body of the Heavenly Domain, responsible for managing the passages from various realms. There were many such cities scattered across the Heavenly Domain, each functioning as a transit hub that also provided orientation to newly arrived cultivators. For a fee. A steep fee. And the service was mandatory—cultivators passing through had no choice.

A strong dragon shouldn't bully the local snake, as the saying went. But here, Skyreach City was the dragon, and the arriving cultivators were barely snakes. After millennia of fleecing newcomers, every Skyreach City was flush with wealth.

Qin Jiang's eyes glinted. He'd had his eye on Skyreach City before they'd even entered the Heavenly Domain. The problem was that the various cities were interconnected, and each was equipped with formidable defenses. One misstep could escalate badly. He'd wanted to keep a low profile here—he was not the apex predator in the Heavenly Domain.

But now Skyreach City's people had come to him. Opportunity.

"Fighting within Skyreach City's jurisdiction is prohibited! You've violated the rules. There will be a fine!"

Qin Jiang and Black Dragon heard the enforcers addressing Little Xu, who was handling negotiations and looking furious.

Spotting Qin Jiang, Little Xu's eyes lit up. "Young Master! You're here."

"Mm." Qin Jiang nodded.

Little Xu stood beside him and pointed at the enforcers, his face full of grievance. "Young Master, they're bullying us!"

"Hmph. Rules are rules," the lead enforcer snapped. He turned to Qin Jiang. "You're in charge here?"

The man was a True Immortal—and a freshly promoted one, judging by his aura. Little Xu was stronger than him.

Qin Jiang couldn't be bothered to engage. He turned to Little Xu and pointed at the enforcer.

"What are you waiting for? Slap him. Hard."

"Yes, sir!"

Little Xu answered eagerly and grinned with delight. This was the Young Master he knew—never one to take a loss lying down.

He flickered forward, materializing in front of the man, and delivered a thunderous slap across his face.

The enforcer was stunned. He was from Skyreach City—someone had actually slapped him. Since time immemorial, who had ever dared lay a hand on Skyreach City's people?

The stinging pain brought him back to reality. His eyes blazed with fury.
