Back at the manor, Li Qingqiu's little escapade was immediately discovered by the sisterhood. They surrounded her for a thorough dressing-down.

She kept her head bowed, looking contrite — but in truth, she was reliving every moment of Qin Jiang's gift in the grove.

After the scolding ended, the women exchanged knowing glances. Li Qingqiu wasn't the only one who'd snuck off for a private session — most of them had at some point. They just hadn't been caught. And from the deep flush on her face, it was clear the lecture had gone in one ear and out the other.

Qin Jiang sidled over with a sheepish grin, trying to smooth things over. "Heh, so—"

"You're the one who deserves the lecture!"

Every eye in the room locked onto him, and within seconds, he was surrounded. Round two of the tribunal commenced.

This time, Li Qingqiu joined the prosecution. She clung to Qin Jiang's arm and wailed, "He forced me!"

Qin Jiang's jaw dropped. This girl — throwing him under the chariot without a second thought! And he'd been about to cover for her! The betrayal stung. Especially since he hadn't forced anyone. "Lured," maybe. Li Qingqiu had caved all on her own. He was completely innocent.

"Obviously. Our Qingqiu is so well-behaved — she'd never sneak off unless you made her."

"I believe Qingqiu! He forced me too!"

"Wait — you also snuck off?"

"That's... beside the point! What matters is that we stand firm against sneaking and stealing. Look at what this scoundrel's become — bullying us every day!"

"Hear, hear! Down with sneaking and stealing!"

Their tirade went in one of Qin Jiang's ears and out the other. His eyes, meanwhile, roamed appreciatively, nodding to himself at intervals. The scenery before him was, without question, the most beautiful vista in all the realms. Reserved exclusively for him.

Truly a feast for the eyes. The scolding had transformed into eye candy.

The women knew it was mostly theater — a bit of playful ritual. After the lecture, they'd all go right back to sneaking.

Eventually their voices softened. Qin Jiang surveyed the group. "Tired?"

Lips pouted in unison as they pressed close. "Our lips are dry. Kiss us."

"Coming right up."

He went down the line, one by one. Their lips weren't dry anymore — but now his were parched. He eyed them expectantly, ready to have his own thirst quenched, when they scattered in a burst of laughter, leaving behind a single declaration:

"That's your punishment!"

He watched them flee, shook his head with a smile, and stretched. They wouldn't last. Someone would come back.

Sure enough, moments later, Lian'er poked her head around a corner and crept over. Qin Jiang beamed — there was nothing like family you'd raised yourself. He strode forward, arms wide, ready to embrace her — and she spoke.

"Big brother, we're heading to Azure Cloud Heaven. Coming?"

His face froze. So that's why they'd all run off — a trip to Azure Cloud Heaven, and no one had bothered telling him. Were they really going to leave him behind?

He grabbed Lian'er's hand and shot out of Huaxia Academy. Of course he was coming.

The immortal ship sat waiting in the Chaos. They boarded quickly, and he tracked the others' auras to a single location — the ship's hot springs.

Every woman was already soaking, draped in sheer silk that clung to their skin in the warm mist, outlining every curve. They splashed and played, and when they spotted Qin Jiang, called out in unison: "Come join us, husband!"

Beside him, Lian'er had somehow changed into matching sheer silk without him noticing. She threw herself into his arms. "Surprised, big brother?"

Extremely surprised.

Qin Jiang's eyes went wide. Clutching Lian'er, he dove into the spring at the women's beckoning. He wasn't leaving until the water level had risen significantly.

The ship was fast, but Qin Jiang deliberately throttled the speed. A journey that should have taken days stretched to a full month.

From his vantage in the hot spring, he surveyed the water level with satisfaction. Markedly higher than before. All his doing.

As for the women — they'd long since fled. The man was an animal. He'd used the hot spring as an excuse to work them over relentlessly.

Qin Jiang lounged contentedly when Liu Shuwan appeared at the spring's edge. "We've arrived at Azure Cloud Heaven. Are you getting out?"

Even the usually gentle Liu Shuwan looked miffed. She'd contributed to that water level herself, and he hadn't gone easy on her.

He rose reluctantly, stepped out of the spring, and stretched in front of her. Liu Shuwan's cheeks reddened. She pinched the soft flesh at his waist. "Get dressed! No — shower first. You've been soaking in that water for ages."

"Want to wash together?" He caught her hand with a grin.

She rolled her eyes. "I'm not showering. But I can wash you."

"That works."

Either way, what happened once they got started was not going to be her call.

Half a day later, the washing was done — in a manner of speaking. Liu Shuwan had started by washing him. Somewhere along the way, roles reversed, and Qin Jiang washed her instead — with extraordinary thoroughness and dedication.

He was a generous masseuse who added complimentary rounds without being asked and charged nothing for overtime. Liu Shuwan received several free hours of service.

Unfortunately, the client failed to appreciate his generosity. Rather than a tip, she chased him with intent to cause bodily harm.

This did not dampen his enthusiasm. Next time, he'd double the bonus. Love would eventually win over even the most difficult customer — perhaps she'd even help refill the water, easing some of his burden.

"Shuwan did help with the water," he mused, glancing at her. "She just doesn't appreciate the service."

"Shut up!" Liu Shuwan gritted her teeth, face burning, half-tempted to bite him.
