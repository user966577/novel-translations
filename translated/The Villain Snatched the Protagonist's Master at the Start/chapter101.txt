"Impossible!" Chu Hanyan shot back immediately. "Chu Yuan and I are... he would never think of me that way. Just because you're a pervert doesn't mean everyone else is."

Qin Jiang's face darkened. Was his reputation really that far gone?

"Care to make a bet?" he offered. "We'll bet on Chu Yuan's feelings for you. If I'm right, you cut ties with him completely."

"Fine!" Chu Hanyan agreed without hesitation. "But if you're wrong, you have to stop bullying my brother."

"Deal."

Qin Jiang nodded with a confident smile. Having read the spoilers, he had no doubt about the outcome. Of course, if he somehow lost, he could always refuse to honor the bet. He wasn't exactly burdened by scruples.

"So now, shall we..." Qin Jiang's grin turned mischievous. Chu Hanyan yelped, her cheeks flushing crimson.

The next day, the Thousand Year Mountain site was mostly deserted, with only a handful of stragglers still poking around—having come this far, they figured they might as well grab a fistful of dirt.

Qin Jiang emerged from the traveling palace, stretching lazily. Qin Lian'er appeared right on cue, brimming with excitement. "Brother, are we going after Lin Chen?"

He nodded and produced a tracking stone. On its white surface, a red dot and a black dot were visible—red for Lin Chen, black for himself.

"He moved fast. Only one day and he's already covered that much ground," Qin Jiang remarked with a chuckle. He patted the Void Beast. "Little Xu, full speed. Let's catch up to Lin Chen within two hours."

The Void Beast responded with a rumble and shot off in the direction Qin Jiang indicated. Its speed was beyond question—there was a reason Qin Jiang used it as his mount.

In less than two hours, Qin Jiang spotted Lin Chen. He hadn't yet crossed the plain, but seemed to think he'd put enough distance between them. His pace was unhurried, almost leisurely, as he strolled across the flatland.

Qin Jiang chuckled. At his command, the Void Beast concealed itself in a fold of space, slashed open a rift with one massive claw, and Qin Jiang stepped through with Qin Lian'er.

A spatial rift tore open directly in front of Lin Chen. Two figures stepped out.

"Lin Chen! Long time no see." Qin Jiang waved at him like an old friend he hadn't seen in years.

Lin Chen's face went pale the instant he saw Qin Jiang. "What are you doing here?"

"Chasing you, obviously. You're pretty quick—took me nearly two hours to catch up."

Lin Chen's expression darkened. Qin Jiang had come specifically for him. But why? Hadn't the beating from before been enough? Was he back for more?

"What... what do you want?" His voice wavered, tinged with fear.

Beside Qin Jiang, Qin Lian'er cracked her knuckles, bumping her small fists together. "Brother, let me beat him up."

When it came to tormenting Children of Destiny, Qin Lian'er was always eager to volunteer.

But Qin Jiang shook his head. "Girls shouldn't be so rough."

"Aww..." She nodded, disappointed.

He ruffled her hair, then turned to Lin Chen. "Nothing major. I just need to borrow something from you."

"What?" Lin Chen asked warily.

Qin Jiang looked him up and down. "You should have a Great Emperor Law inside you."

The words hit Lin Chen like lightning. His face contorted with shock and he lunged backward to flee—but a figure materialized behind him, swatting him back to Qin Jiang's feet with a single palm strike.

Qin Jiang stepped forward and planted his foot on Lin Chen's chest. Extending his palm toward Lin Chen's forehead, the Myriad Dao Stone appeared, trembling eagerly as if sensing something delicious. A torrential force engulfed Lin Chen.

Lin Chen's body went rigid. To his horror, he couldn't move—couldn't even access his own Great Emperor Law.

"Don't worry. It'll hurt a bit. Just bear with it."

Qin Jiang's calm voice sounded like a demon's whisper. Power flooded Lin Chen's primordial spirit, and the Great Emperor Law fused to it began tearing away.

"AAAAAGH!" The agony was beyond description. His eyes bulged, and screams ripped from his throat. In an instant, sweat drenched his entire body. This was pain at the level of the primordial spirit—no amount of willpower could endure it. He screamed and screamed, blacking out from the pain multiple times only to be jolted awake again, his body convulsing, his eyes bloodshot and weeping crimson.

The sight was grotesque.

Qin Lian'er watched from the side, unable to suppress a shudder.

A full fifteen minutes later, Qin Jiang retracted the Myriad Dao Stone. Lin Chen's restraints released, and he rolled his eyes back and plunged into deep unconsciousness.

Qin Lian'er leaned in to examine him. Compared to fifteen minutes ago, he'd aged dramatically—blood streaming from his eyes, his face withered and ancient. Her mouth fell open.

"Brother, are you secretly a demonic cultivator? Did you drain his life force?"

She watched as his features continued to age, hair turning white, skin wrinkling. The sight made her shiver. She definitely did not want to get old.

Just then, Qin Jiang turned to her with an eerie smile. "Little Lian'er, you've discovered my secret. What should I do with you?"

"Eek!" She clutched herself protectively. "Brother, I'm your sister! You can't use yin-yang harvesting on me!"

Qin Jiang stared. Yin-yang harvesting? His face went black and he flicked her forehead.

"What goes on in that head of yours?"

"Huh? You're not harvesting people?"

"Give me a break..."

He rolled his eyes at her, then turned back to Lin Chen. The body was actually decomposing. Qin Lian'er noticed too, wrinkling her nose in disgust. "Gross."

She looked away and fixed her gaze on Qin Jiang's face instead. Her brother was much easier on the eyes.

Qin Jiang frowned. The real Lin Chen had died long ago. This body had only been sustained by the Great Emperor's power forcibly injected into it. Now that Qin Jiang had extracted the Great Emperor Law, "Lin Chen" could no longer maintain any vitality. The body was rotting before their eyes. In a little while, nothing would be left but bones.
