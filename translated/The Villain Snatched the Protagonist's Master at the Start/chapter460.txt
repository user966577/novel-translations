Inside the pocket world, spiritual energy churned violently, coalescing into a vortex that funneled straight into Nangong Yun's body. His aura climbed steadily — Nine Tribulations Supreme, ascending toward Great Emperor. The torrent lasted an entire day.

His eyes snapped open with a low shout. His aura surged. Great Emperor.

The energy stabilized. He exhaled slowly, a smile spreading across his face. He clenched a fist, testing his new power. "So this is what a Great Emperor feels like."

He rose and threw a punch into the void. Space rippled across the small world. He nodded, satisfied. "Powerful indeed."

Remembering the Great Emperors who'd butchered his Alliance, killing intent flashed in his eyes. He'd felt their strength during the massacre — compared to him now, they were far inferior. Not even in the same league. He could crush them head-on.

His plans shifted. Originally, he'd intended hit-and-run strikes against a few. Now, feeling the magnitude of his power, he decided to kill every last one. He was a genius. Unrivaled at the same level.

"But first — the treasure here."

He looked up at the blazing sun overhead. Even in this miniature world, a sun hung in the sky. During his breakthrough, he'd sensed that most of the energy had flowed from it. It had even strengthened his yang-attribute origin. A supreme treasure, without question.

He launched himself skyward. As he drew closer, the heat grew punishing — his spiritual energy caught fire. He gritted his teeth and pressed forward. Sweat evaporated the instant it formed. His energy drained at alarming speed, and before long, he was forced to retreat.

He rested, then tried again. Closer this time, but not close enough. He repeated the cycle, each attempt inching nearer. The constant tempering stabilized his freshly advanced cultivation in the process.

Ten full days passed.

At last, he reached the sun. The enormous sphere was mostly radiant light; at its core sat a palm-sized stone. He plunged his hand through the brilliance and seized it. The stone's heat seared his palm instantly, but he held on. Gradually, the glow dimmed and the heat faded until it lay in his hand, warm as an ordinary rock.

'It acknowledges me?'

The stone thrummed with dense yang energy. Refining it would massively boost his cultivation. "This stone — Master could also use—"

His face fell. He'd been expelled. The stone went into his storage with a sigh.

He shook off the melancholy. Vengeance came first. With the stone removed, the small world's light dimmed and its temperature plummeted — the stone had been its power source. No reason to stay.

He returned to the cave and noticed signs of disturbance. Someone had searched it. "They found this place?" He was lucky. If he'd tried to break through here instead of in the pocket world, they'd have caught him mid-advancement.

But now, he was a Great Emperor. Time for payback.

"Zhou family — the avenger has arrived."

He stepped outside. No pursuers in sight. Had they given up? If they'd returned to the Zhou family compound, he couldn't follow. Their territory housed True Immortals and multiple Human Immortals. A Great Emperor had no business challenging the immortal path.

He cursed under his breath. Alone, he had no way to track them down. But just then, a figure streaked across the sky — one he recognized instantly. A Zhou family member. One of the ones who'd slaughtered his brothers. They were still searching for him.

Without hesitation, he launched himself upward. His attack slammed into the target with murderous intent. The man stumbled, recovered, and looked at him. Recognition sparked. "Nangong Yun!"

"That's right." Nangong Yun's aura blazed. "Now we're both Great Emperors. Time to pay."

"Great Emperor?" The man blinked.

Nangong Yun struck first, and the two clashed furiously. They fought to a draw.

Nangong Yun's expression darkened. Something was wrong. When he'd been a Supreme fleeing for his life, this man hadn't been nearly this strong — otherwise a Supreme could never have escaped him. Where had this power come from?
