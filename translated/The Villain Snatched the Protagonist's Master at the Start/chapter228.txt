News of Chen Changsheng's arrival in the Central Regions reached Qin Jiang quickly. He'd been relaxing long enough—time to get moving.

He was preparing to depart for the Central Regions when a stunning woman appeared at his door.

"Linglong?" Qin Jiang blinked. Before he could react, Pill Emperor Linglong threw herself at him, crashing into his arms. Fortunately, she was soft enough that the impact, while considerable, was manageable.

"Linglong, what are you doing here?" He held her, genuinely surprised. As a Pill Emperor, shouldn't she be busy? She hadn't even come back with him last time.

"Hehe, I handed all the Heavenly Pill Palace affairs over to Yu'er. Let her experience what it's like to run things." She grinned.

"Isn't that just bullying Yu'er?"

"Oh? Feeling sorry for her already?" Linglong shot him a look and huffed. "If you feel sorry for her, go visit the Heavenly Pill Palace more often. You've been gone so long without stopping by." Her tone turned reproachful.

He coughed awkwardly. "I've been busy. I was actually planning to visit the Heavenly Pill Palace after wrapping up here—but you beat me to it."

That was true. He'd planned to stop by on the way to the Central Regions since it was along the route. Couldn't neglect his own woman, after all.

"Fine, you're forgiven~" The little emperor was easy to appease. She held out her hand, placing a storage ring before him. "Here. Medicinal pills—every type and grade. You can use them to cultivate your forces."

The Heavenly Pill Palace had nothing if not pills. Though Qin Jiang was a skilled alchemist himself, he was still one person and couldn't match the output of an entire palace. So before coming, the little emperor had raided the Heavenly Pill Palace's reserves and brought her husband a dowry. She could still picture the elders' teary-eyed faces as she walked out.

He peered into the ring. "This many?"

He refined pills occasionally and received them as system rewards, but his entire stockpile didn't amount to one percent of this. Had she emptied the palace's coffers?

"All yours," Linglong said without a trace of reluctance. The ring was top-tier—enormous interior—and she'd stuffed it to bursting with every variety of pill imaginable.

"I can't even use this many," he protested. The Qin family's Azure Cloud Heaven contingent wasn't that large. This many pills would last centuries. Enough to drown everyone in medicine.

"Save them for later." She waved dismissively. "We have plenty of people to refine more. Just tell them to get to work."

Overtime. Lots of it.

Qin Jiang chuckled, bent down, and kissed her forehead. "Then I'll keep them."

"Okay~" Her cheeks flushed. She hugged him and whispered, "So many pills... don't I deserve a few billion kisses?"

"???"

He scooped her up with a roguish grin. "A few billion? Not nearly enough. However many you want!"

With the Space-Time Temple, time was no longer an issue. A quick trip inside, and when they emerged, the little emperor's face was gloriously red. Worth every pill.

Hand in hand, walking through the Void Divine Temple, Qin Jiang said, "I'm heading to the Central Regions. Want to come along, Linglong?"

"Sure!" She thought for a moment. "We could stop by the Heavenly Pill Palace on the way. Yu'er misses you."

"Sounds good."

The travel party didn't need to be large—someone had to watch the home front. Jian Yao, Mo Mo, and Yan Shiya were essentials: the Central Regions teemed with powerhouses, and even three Immortals felt thin.

Liu Shuwan was still in seclusion, unfortunately, so she'd have to catch up later. He left word that if she emerged, she should head to the Central Regions to find him. Beyond the three Immortals, Linglong was coming, Hu Xian'er refused to be separated from him, and Zi Fu—in the throes of new romance—was clinging to him like glue.

Black Dragon had already been deployed to the Central Regions ahead of time. Once they arrived, the dirty work would fall to him. It was Black Dragon who'd reported Chen Changsheng's movements in the first place.

With the roster set, Qin Jiang had originally planned to travel by Void Palace, but the Void Beast was still only a Supreme. In Azure Cloud Heaven, a Supreme-level mount was embarrassing. He tossed the lazy creature into the knockoff Space-Time Temple with strict orders: don't come out until you're a Great Emperor.

He handed the pills Linglong had brought to Fourth Ancestor with one instruction: use them freely, use them generously—but by the time I get back, everyone's cultivation had better have improved dramatically.

With preparations complete, the group departed Qin Family City. Midway, Qin Jiang made a detour to the Heavenly Pill Palace. Jian Yao and the others graciously stayed behind, giving little Dan Yu some private time with Qin Jiang. The gesture moved Dan Yu to tears—she was utterly devoted, hanging on his every word.

When it came time to leave, though, her puppy-dog eyes were too much. He caved and brought her along. As for the Heavenly Pill Palace, it wouldn't fall apart without a palace master. Just give the elders a little more responsibility. They were only a few thousand years old—prime working age.

Qin Jiang also specifically instructed them to ramp up pill production. He had ambitions of dominating the myriad realms one day, and medicinal pills were a critical resource. Looking at the elders' pained expressions, he offered a few words of encouragement, then departed with Dan Yu in tow.

When they regrouped, Linglong stared at Dan Yu. "You brought Yu'er too?"

Dan Yu glanced between her teacher and Qin Jiang, then hugged his arm tight. Teacher was mean; Qin Jiang was nice!

He laughed, pulling Dan Yu close. "I hadn't seen her in months. I missed her. I can't just stay one day and leave, can I?"

"Yeah! Exactly!" Dan Yu nodded vigorously. The Heavenly Pill Palace was exhausting and Qin Jiang-less. Boring. Life with Qin Jiang was far more fulfilling and colorful.

"Fine." Linglong relented. "But keep Yu'er safe. The Central Regions are crawling with powerhouses—don't let her get hurt."

"When have I ever let you down?" Qin Jiang said confidently. Dan Yu's cultivation was lower, so she'd simply stay by his side at all times. No harm would come to her. And surely, she'd prefer being at his side anyway.
