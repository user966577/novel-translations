After leaving the village, a smile crossed Ye Qingtian's face. He looked toward the Ye family's direction:

"Little brother, let big brother teach you how to be a proper family head."

He murmured, then vanished.

Two hours later, Ye Qingtian returned to the valley.

He'd been in good spirits after securing the deal, but the moment he stepped into the valley, his stride faltered. His brow creased sharply, and spiritual energy surged through his body.

Clap, clap, clap!

A round of applause rang out:

"Impressive—the man who can manipulate multiple ancient clans really does have sharp instincts."

Ye Qingtian's pupils contracted. He whipped around to find a young man watching him with a casual smile.

"Qin Jiang!"

Ye Qingtian's eyes narrowed.

None other. He recognized Qin Jiang instantly.

"How did you find this place?"

Ye Qingtian asked, on guard.

His mood soured. Had his plan been exposed before it even began?

The thought galled him.

Qin Jiang smiled:

"I think you need me right now. So I took the initiative."

Ye Qingtian's expression flickered. After a beat:

"The one who needs you is Ye Lingtian, not me."

"Is that so?"

Qin Jiang leaned against a tree trunk:

"Then your own strength is enough to see your plan through?"

Ye Qingtian's face changed. He stared hard at Qin Jiang, then forced a cold laugh:

"Don't tell me you're offering to help destroy the Ye family."

Qin Jiang shook his head and met his gaze squarely:

"I'm talking about your real plan."

Ye Qingtian's fists clenched.

Qin Jiang smiled:

"Don't bother denying it. I know every detail of every plan you have.

And I also know that on your own, you can't pull it off. You'll need help eventually—so here I am."

"How do you know all this?"

Ye Qingtian demanded, brow furrowed.

To ensure nothing leaked, he'd never told a single soul. He even sealed his own mouth when he slept, terrified of talking in his dreams.

There was absolutely no way anyone else could know.

And yet Qin Jiang's demeanor—his utter certainty—suggested that he actually did.

Qin Jiang pointed at Ye Qingtian and said mysteriously:

"I can read minds."

Ye Qingtian: "..."

"Then you heard me cursing you just now?"

Qin Jiang: "???"

His face darkened:

"Forget it—I'm not helping. Do it yourself!"

"Wait!"

Ye Qingtian dropped his facade and blocked Qin Jiang's path:

"Are you seriously willing to help me?"

"You cursed me. Deal's off."

Ye Qingtian: "..."

"Ahem. I was joking. If you could really read minds, you wouldn't have heard me cursing you, right?"

'I can't read minds at all, you old fox,' Qin Jiang fumed inwardly. Ye Qingtian had clearly seen through the bluff—the man was sharper than a fox.

"Fine, fine. Just notify me when you're ready to move."

Qin Jiang waved him off.

Ye Qingtian blinked:

"You don't want to hear my plan?"

"I already know it."

"You really know?"

"Obviously."

Seeing Qin Jiang's confidence, Ye Qingtian felt uneasy. What if there was a miscommunication at a critical moment?

"I think we should sync up first."

Ye Qingtian said seriously.

After a moment's thought, Qin Jiang nodded. He couldn't be certain the plot hadn't shifted—a misunderstanding at the wrong moment would be genuinely embarrassing.

Their discussion confirmed that Qin Jiang truly did know every detail. Ye Qingtian was astonished but didn't pry—everyone had their secrets.

Finally, Ye Qingtian asked:

"Why are you helping me?"

"I think you're more likable than Ye Lingtian."

That was nice to hear.

A rare smile broke across Ye Qingtian's face. He nodded approvingly:

"A man after my own heart."

"Your son, on the other hand—I find extremely unlikable."

The smile froze. A pained look crossed Ye Qingtian's face. He wasn't alone in that sentiment—even he found Ye Xuan exasperating. The boy seemed to have no common sense.

Worse, Ye Xuan's hatred toward the Ye family was genuine.

Ye Qingtian sighed:

"I failed him as a father."

Qin Jiang patted his shoulder:

"Bad luck in the family. My condolences."

Ye Qingtian's eye twitched. 'Condolences? My son's a bit dim, but that doesn't mean the family's cursed.'

"Right then, Old Ye. I'm off. Send word when it's time."

With that, Qin Jiang departed.

Ye Qingtian watched him go, a flicker of emotion in his eyes. 'Who would have thought—the person who understands me best is this kid.'

"With Qin Jiang's help, the plan should go perfectly."

---

Qin Jiang didn't return to the Ye estate. He went to Rose Casino instead.

He had Yan Yun set up a room, looked around, and called out:

"Fourth Ancestor? You there?"

A brief silence. Then the air shivered and the Fourth Ancestor materialized:

"What do you want, brat?"

He shot Qin Jiang a glare—apparently still sore about the head-betting incident.

Qin Jiang grinned sheepishly:

"Fourth Ancestor, you must have heard my conversation with Ye Qingtian?"

"So? Want me to intervene?"

Qin Jiang nodded:

"You're the only one around me with the standing to handle this. Everyone else would just be cannon fodder."

Flattered by the praise, the Fourth Ancestor's lips twitched upward—but his expression quickly grew serious:

"If the other clans truly intend to destroy the Ye family, the forces they deploy won't be weak. I alone might not be enough."

"Fourth Ancestor, you're being too modest."

Qin Jiang smiled and held out his palm:

"With this—do you think one man is enough?"

The Fourth Ancestor's eyes flew wide at the sight of a Great Emperor law resting in Qin Jiang's hand. His aura nearly broke containment. His voice trembled:

"Is that...

A Great Emperor law?"

"It is."

Qin Jiang nodded:

"Fourth Ancestor, if you refine this, breaking through to Great Emperor shouldn't be a problem, right?"

The Fourth Ancestor exhaled slowly, his expression grave:

"Where did you get this?"

"Well...

Last night I dreamed about a Great Emperor law. When I woke up, it was just... there."

Qin Jiang lied through his teeth.

The Fourth Ancestor: "..."

He knew it was nonsense but didn't press. He waved, drawing the law before him. It was extraordinarily pure—untainted by any foreign aura.

His expression grew complex. He waved again, sending the law back to Qin Jiang:

"Keep it. Use it when you attempt your own breakthrough to Great Emperor."
