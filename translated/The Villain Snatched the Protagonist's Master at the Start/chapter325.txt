Qin Jiang's creditors weren't limited to Chu Hanyan, so the repayment session quickly expanded.

Long Xin'er, Xia Qianling, and Xiao Jiu didn't wait for him to come to them. They'd already emerged from seclusion and marched straight over to collect.

Owing many debts was no different from owing one — paying back one or paying back four, the process was the same. Qin Jiang pulled them all in and settled up at once.

Chu Hanyan breathed a sigh of relief, shooting the three newcomers a grateful look. The debt was simply too much for one person. She felt overfull.

She glanced down at herself — she looked practically pregnant. Gritting her teeth, she shot Qin Jiang a resentful look. Did this beast not understand that over-fertilizing could ruin the crops?

Thankfully, she had reinforcements. With the three women taking over, she quietly slipped aside to tidy up and rest. The remaining debt could be collected later — but she was definitely writing it down.

The three women's intervention was, in truth, little better than moths flying into flame. A few days later, they too lay limp on the bed.

Qin Jiang shook his head and turned to Chu Hanyan, who'd had ample time to recover. A smile crept across his face.

Her body tensed. She pouted and sidled up to him, wrapping both arms around his. "Hubby~ We've been playing for days. I need to go refine my puppets. Once I'm done, I'll come keep you company again, okay~?"

She put on her best aggrieved expression, small hand gently shaking his arm.

Qin Jiang smirked and swept her into his arms. Her face fell. It was over. This beast still wasn't letting her go.

But just then, a surge of immortal-path energy erupted from within the Space-Time Temple.

Qin Jiang's brow rose. With a thought, the light orbs appeared before him. "It's Ningbing."

One orb showed Chen Ningbing, who had been in seclusion for quite some time. She'd officially stepped onto the immortal path.

In his arms, Chu Hanyan's face brightened. Ningbing had broken through — that meant a fresh body for the grinder. Surely this beast would spare her now?

"Hubby, Ningbing broke through!"

"Mm."

"She'll probably come over, right?"

"Mm."

"Then... let Ningbing keep you company first. I'll—"

Before she could finish, Chen Ningbing's figure vanished from the light orb and materialized before them.

Chu Hanyan snapped her mouth shut. Selling out her own sister was best done silently.

"Qin Jiang~" Chen Ningbing's face broke into a brilliant smile as she launched herself at him. "Hehe, I knew you'd be here."

He gathered her into his arms, and she turned to greet the others. "Yan'er, you're here too~ Xin'er, Qianling, Jiu'er..."

The others responded with barely enough energy to wave.

Seeing their state, Chen Ningbing understood — Qin Jiang had put them through the wringer. It seemed his prowess had grown considerably.

Her gaze turned to him, eagerness flickering in her eyes. She'd sworn that once she broke through to the immortal path, she would overpower him — pin him down. She wondered if she was finally strong enough.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang was studying her in return. She'd refined the Poison Dao Law, and it had subtly altered her appearance.

Not for the worse — quite the opposite. She'd gained a seductive edge. Her formerly jet-black hair had turned dark emerald. A matching verdant mark adorned her brow, faintly luminous, almost scale-like. Her features had sharpened slightly, while her figure had grown more voluptuous. All in all, she'd traded a touch of innocence for an alluring, almost exotic mystique.

Under his scrutiny, Chen Ningbing felt a twinge of anxiety. She knew her looks had changed — nothing drastic, and not unattractive — but what if he didn't like it?

"Ningbing, can you revert to how you looked before?"

Her face went white. A tremor ran through her. He really didn't like the new her?

Her eyes reddened instantly, tears brimming. Before they could fall, Qin Jiang dipped his head and kissed her.

She froze. Wait — didn't he just—?

The warm press of his lips brought her back. She threw her arms around his neck and returned the kiss with abandon.

When he finally pulled back, she was breathless. He licked his lips, clearly wanting more, then dipped in for one more peck. "Ningbing, the way you look now... I can't help myself."

Relief flooded through her. She swatted his chest with a huff. "You jerk, you scared me to death~"

She'd almost thought he was rejecting her. But that kiss — the fierce, consuming possessiveness behind it — told her everything. As if he wanted to devour her whole.

She breathed out, about to say something, when she glanced around. "Where did Yan'er and the others go?"

The massive bed was now empty.

Qin Jiang spread his hands. "They ran."

While he'd been kissing Chen Ningbing, the other four had made their escape. He'd noticed, but comforting Ningbing took priority. Besides — one had fled, but one remained. A sacrifice, of sorts.

Chen Ningbing blinked, unbothered. Good riddance — she'd planned to conquer Qin Jiang single-handedly anyway. This was her chance.

Her eyes blazed. She stared him down like prey.

Seeing that look, Qin Jiang smiled. This was the real Chen Ningbing. When they'd first reunited, he'd noticed something behind the eagerness in her eyes — a flicker of uncertainty, of careful guardedness. It hadn't taken him long to realize the cause: the change in her appearance.

So he'd addressed it head-on. One kiss. One sentence. That was all it took to dissolve her insecurity.

"Qin Jiang~" She pressed herself against him. The Poison Dao Law had been very good to her figure — she now rivaled Jian Yao.

Sitting on his lap, she drew herself up, looking down at him from above. She tilted his chin up with one finger and grinned. "I told you — once I break through to the immortal path, I'm pinning you down. The time has come."

Qin Jiang had seen plenty of swagger. Every single one of them had ended up begging for mercy — Human Immortals, True Immortals, even the Immortal King. No exceptions.

And Chen Ningbing was merely a Human Immortal. The outcome was never in doubt.
