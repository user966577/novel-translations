One day, a petite young woman strolled out of the Chaos District.

She wore a white dress, a playful smile lighting up her face. Her steps were light and bouncy, her bright eyes sparkling with an air of youthful innocence—everything about her radiated the freshness of youth.

"He's still at the Human Dao Sect. That's a bit far, isn't it?" she murmured to herself.

The next instant, she vanished.

At the Human Dao Sect, Chen Qi'er had tracked down Chen Wuming and was relieved to see the boy in one piece. Chen Wuming, for his part, was brimming with enthusiasm.

"Hehe, Brother Chen! I'm so glad to see you again!" He grinned from ear to ear.

Chen Qi'er frowned and said coolly, "Didn't I tell you not to come find me until you'd mastered the cultivation method?"

"But I have."

Under Black Dragon's guidance, Chen Wuming had already achieved a solid grasp of the technique Chen Qi'er left him. He was genuinely grateful for that. Black Dragon was the real good person here—unlike Chen Qi'er, who'd tossed him a method and disappeared without a word. And worse, the man had ulterior motives.

"Already?" Chen Qi'er was stunned. It had barely been a month.

Chen Wuming nodded, then demonstrated his progress with a grin. "No problems, right, Brother Chen?"

Chen Qi'er stared. This wasn't merely an initial grasp—in barely a month, the boy had reached a level that was genuinely impressive. His talent exceeded all expectations. In time, he would absolutely become someone formidable. Perhaps even useful in the fight against Qin Jiang. But that would require careful nurturing, pushing him to grow as fast as possible. Chen Qi'er gave a satisfied nod. "Very good."

"Hehe." Chen Wuming chuckled, a calculating gleam flickering in his eyes. He spoke with studied casualness. "Brother Chen, you and your sister must be a couple by now, right?"

Chen Qi'er's face went dark. The last thing he wanted to discuss was Chen Baizhe.

"Brother Chen?" Seeing the look on his face, Chen Wuming called out tentatively.

Chen Qi'er took a deep breath. "I haven't gone to see her yet," he said flatly. Before, he'd boasted to Chen Wuming that Baizhe had rejected countless men for his sake. But now... his heart clenched. He couldn't bring himself to say the truth.

"Oh, I see." Chen Wuming nodded, then pressed on. "So when are you going to find her?"

"We'll see."

"Don't wait too long, or someone might steal her away," Chen Wuming teased.

Chen Qi'er's expression twitched. Back at the ruined temple, this kid had warned him the same thing—that someone might move in while he hesitated—and it had actually happened. The boy was a jinx. He fixed Chen Wuming with a dangerous stare, but the kid didn't notice. His mind was already turning. If he could get Chen Qi'er to introduce him to his sister, he'd find an opportunity to pass her information along to Black Dragon's mysterious boss. Then he could finally break free of Chen Qi'er's clutches. But from the look of things, Chen Qi'er was in no hurry at all. For someone who'd seemed so passionate at the ruined temple, this was disappointing. Typical—all talk, no follow-through.

Meanwhile, the woman in white stood before the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's traveling palace, studying it for a long while. Then she lowered her gaze, her eyes cold as she looked down at the subordinates kneeling at her feet.

"What kind of useless plan was that? 'Stage a chance encounter, get acquainted with Qin Jiang first'? Look around! Where's the opportunity? That man stays inside the palace all day, every day. It's been days and I haven't seen him once! Am I supposed to stroll into their palace for a 'chance encounter'?"

This was the mistress of the Chaos District—the sealed True Immortal. She had altered her appearance and suppressed her aura to look like a naive young girl experiencing the world for the first time. Her subordinates had assured her this was the ultimate "dream girl" look, guaranteed to stop Qin Jiang in his tracks the moment he saw her.

But they'd overlooked one critical detail: Qin Jiang never left the palace. He had no chance to see their "dream girl" in the first place.

The subordinates trembled. 'That's what the romance manuals said,' they thought desperately. 'Encounter a dream girl in white, fall head over heels. But reality seems... different.'

The woman in white bit her lip, glaring up at the traveling palace. She touched her own cheek. Strictly speaking, she hadn't disguised herself so much as reverted to a younger version. Her true appearance was like a ripe red apple—the kind that made you want to take a bite the moment you saw it. Right now, she was more like a slightly unripe one—but one that stirred an irresistible urge to help it ripen.

Just then, she felt someone watching her. Without an instant's hesitation, she struck.

Two figures tumbled out of concealment—Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming. The watching eyes had been Chen Wuming's. He'd been wandering the mountains with Chen Qi'er when he spotted a figure among the trees. A beautiful woman. His first instinct was to report her to Black Dragon and earn favor with his mysterious boss.

But a single glance was all it took to give him away. Her casual backhand had left even Chen Qi'er stumbling. Chen Wuming's heart pounded with alarm—and excitement. A woman of this caliber would surely impress Black Dragon's boss. But their current situation was dire. Judging by Chen Qi'er's expression, this woman was not someone to trifle with.

"Brother Chen, what do we do?" Chen Wuming whispered.

Chen Qi'er's eye twitched. He'd noticed the woman too, but had been careful not to stare. This idiot, on the other hand, had been gawking openly. Of course they'd been spotted.

The woman's eyes went ice-cold. She was already in a foul mood, and now two more ogling fools had appeared. Her aura surged, straining against her suppression. Chen Qi'er raised his guard, his own energy roiling. He no longer cared about stealth—this woman felt incredibly dangerous.

Just as she was about to strike, several figures burst from the traveling palace, drawn by Chen Qi'er's flaring aura. The woman in white's gaze locked onto Qin Jiang instantly.

Her subordinates exchanged a look. Then they clenched their jaws, slammed fists against their own chests, and forced blood from the corners of their mouths. Throwing themselves in front of their mistress, they bellowed with theatrical anguish:

"Protect the young lady! Even if we die here, these two degenerates will not lay a finger on her!"
