Looking at Qin Jiang, the Pill Emperor's eyes wavered with uncertainty. Could he really be her master?

But... how could her master have done that to Dan Yu?

She watched Qin Jiang closely, still doubtful. He didn't press her, and for good reason—the system spoiler had given him plenty of secrets that only Chen Changsheng and the Pill Emperor shared.

"I see you really have forgotten," he sighed, his expression wistful. "But your master still remembers. When you were eight, you successfully refined your very first pill. Your master rewarded you with a pill furnace. You were so happy about that furnace, you couldn't stop smiling for days."

He said it with practiced nostalgia.

The Pill Emperor's aura softened, and a distant look crossed her face. She remembered that furnace. She'd kept it all these years.

"You really are... my master?" she whispered, her voice fragile with disbelief.

Her doubt was almost gone now. This too was something only the two of them knew. Suspicion still lingered because of Dan Yu, but it was fading fast.

"My alchemy should speak for itself. And Dan Yu can confirm that," Qin Jiang said with a shrug.

Beside the Pill Emperor, Dan Yu had been completely stupefied. If Qin Jiang was telling the truth, then he was her grandmaster—her master's master.

'That's impossible. From what Master's told me, her teacher was refined, gentle, and kind. This man is vile and depraved.'

Yet his alchemy was undeniably extraordinary—possibly even surpassing her master's.

The Pill Emperor glanced at Dan Yu. With one look, she could tell that Dan Yu's body had been claimed, and Qin Jiang was the only candidate. It was precisely this fact that kept her from fully accepting him as her master. Chen Changsheng would never have forced himself on a woman—especially not his own grand-disciple.

"Dan Yu..." The Pill Emperor's tone carried an implied question.

Dan Yu snapped back to attention. She understood what her master was asking, and after a glance at Qin Jiang, she answered: "Master, his alchemy... is the most impressive I've ever seen. It may surpass even yours."

That settled another layer of doubt. Qin Jiang appeared young, which aligned with a reincarnated Chen Changsheng, and his alchemy was at or above the Pill Emperor's level.

It was looking more and more certain.

Ten thousand years. Her master had been away for ten thousand years, and she'd been waiting all this time for his return. But she hadn't imagined that his first act upon returning would be to...

She looked again at Dan Yu—pale-faced yet oddly flushed, carrying a new sort of allure—and her heart twisted.

'How am I supposed to acknowledge him after this?'

She studied Qin Jiang for a long moment, her lips parting as if to speak, but every prepared word died in her throat. Her master had changed. Drastically.

Seeing her struggle, Qin Jiang offered a rueful smile and turned to Dan Yu. "Go back to your master."

Dan Yu looked between the two of them, her mind a tangled mess. The relationship between them was beyond complicated. If Qin Jiang really was her grandmaster, then she was now technically her master's...

'Senior?'

Dan Yu's face contorted at the thought. She never imagined she'd live to see the day she'd leapfrog her own master in the generational hierarchy.

Of course, she only dared think it. Saying it out loud would get her expelled from the sect.

But the current situation would certainly create awkwardness between her and her master.

She sighed inwardly. This was way beyond her ability to resolve. She'd leave it to her master to figure out. Or perhaps...

Her eyes drifted to Qin Jiang, and a sudden thought struck her. He clearly intended to pursue her master as well. If that happened...

It might actually solve the problem.

Whether her master could accept it was another matter entirely.

She studied the Pill Emperor and thought about how long her master had been alone. It really was time she found a dao companion. No one else was worthy of her master—but this "grandmaster" of hers? He had the looks and the power.

Sure, the relationships were a bit tangled. But cultivators were supposed to be free spirits, unbound by petty conventions.

Dan Yu's bright eyes blinked rapidly as her nimble mind began scheming ways to help Qin Jiang win over the Pill Emperor. She was, in every sense, a devoted disciple—looking out for her master's happiness.

While Dan Yu was lost in her fantasies, the Pill Emperor tore her gaze from Qin Jiang and left without a word. Dan Yu scrambled to follow, though every step sent a twinge of pain through her body, making her wince.

"Take it easy when you get back, little Yu'er," Qin Jiang called after them.

The Pill Emperor's stride hitched. She glanced back at Qin Jiang, then at the grimacing Dan Yu, and reached out to grab the girl's arm. In a flash, they both vanished.

Once the Pill Emperor was gone, Liu Shuwan and the others swarmed Qin Jiang.

"What was that all about?"

"Yeah—how did you become her master?"

"Don't tell me you're actually a reincarnated soul? You were her teacher in a past life?"

"You've been hiding this the whole time!"

They peppered him with questions, brimming with curiosity.

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes at their wild theories. "Relax. I'm not her master. I was messing with her."

"What?"

"Then how do you know her secrets?"

Qin Jiang flipped his hand, and the Divination Compass materialized on his palm. The women recognized it immediately and knew its capabilities.

"I used this to divine everything," he said with a grin. "The Pill Emperor really does have a master who reincarnated, and he's somewhere in Pill City right now."

That explained it. Seeing the Compass, their suspicions evaporated.

"So you're impersonating her master?" someone asked.

"Exactly."

"That's way too much trouble. Just tell me where the real one is and I'll kill him. Then I'll drag the Pill Emperor back for you. Problem solved—nice and obedient." That was Jian Yao, naturally. She was a woman of action, and her temper ran hotter than even Mo Mo's.

Before Qin Jiang could respond, Mo Mo scoffed. "You violent lunatic. Where's the fun in that? The way Qin Jiang's doing it is much more exciting. Capturing a woman's heart is half the appeal—just snatching her ruins the whole point. Men live for the thrill of conquest. Right, darling~?"

"Who are you calling a lunatic, you little runt? You wanna fight?"

"Bring it!"

"Let's take this outside!"

The two women were at each other's throats again—something only Qin Jiang could defuse. He rubbed his temples and seized both their arms in one motion.

"If you two have that much energy, fight me instead!"

Jian Yao: "..."

Mo Mo: "..."

That kind of "fighting" would get very inappropriate very fast.

The two exchanged a glance, then looked at Liu Shuwan and the rest. In perfect unison, they called out:

"Sisters—team up!"
