After thinking it over, Qin Jiang brightened. "We passed by all the major True Immortal factions during our tour, right?"

"Yes. Mystic Cloud Heaven originally had 15 True Immortal factions. The Nangong family was destroyed, the Zhou family and Blood Tribe submitted. That leaves 12. We've cruised past all of them."

"Perfect." A sly grin spread across his face. "I believe my wife went missing near their territories."

The women stared. Then understanding dawned. Then came the collective eye-roll.

His energy was apparently limitless. With this many women already, he still wasn't satisfied. Though, to be fair, none of them had ever managed to wear him out.

"It's a valid pretext," Liu Shuwan agreed. No one objected.

The announcement went out: Manor Lord Qin's wife had gone missing near various territories. Each faction had 15 days to locate and return her. Failure would result in Huaxia conducting the search personally.

Three identifying features were provided. One—beautiful. Two—beautiful. Three—also beautiful.

The factions were not amused. But power dictated terms. No one wanted Huaxia forces on their soil, so they began searching for "Qin Jiang's wife."

The subtext was transparent. He wasn't looking for a lost wife—he was demanding tribute. Their worst fears had been realized.

The airship anchored at the center of Mystic Cloud Heaven. Five days later—ten days ahead of the deadline—all 12 factions arrived.

Qin Jiang was surprised. That fast? He'd expected them to deliberate until the last moment, carefully selecting their most beautiful woman. Five days suggested a lack of effort.

He stepped out of the airship. The faction leaders lined up, each accompanied by a striking woman. They bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Manor Lord Qin."

"At ease." He waved them up and examined the women behind them. Attractive, certainly. Mature. Sophisticated. And oddly familiar.

Then it clicked. He'd reviewed dossiers on every faction. These women were the clan leaders' own wives.

They'd brought him their own wives?

One clan leader stepped forward, voice carefully steady. "Manor Lord Qin, this is your lost wife. I've brought her to you." He gestured at the woman beside him—his own wife—who obediently began walking toward Qin Jiang. The clan leader's eyes glistened with unshed tears.

"Whoa, whoa. Hold on!" Qin Jiang backpedaled, staring. "Isn't that YOUR wife?"

The man froze. She was. But didn't you want her? Was she not satisfactory?

Qin Jiang looked at the others, pointing at their wives. "These women—they're all your wives? These are what you found?"

The realization spread. Something had gone very wrong. The clan leaders exchanged uneasy glances.

Qin Jiang threw up his hands. "Everyone out. You have ten more days."

They vanished so fast they might have teleported. Fastest departure of their lives.

Qin Jiang stood there, baffled, trying to figure out where the miscommunication had occurred.

Liu Shuwan and the others came up, barely suppressing their laughter.

"What went wrong?" he muttered.

She slipped her arm through his. "It's the Murong Qing thing. Word got around that you took the Blood Tribe chief's wife. They assumed you wanted theirs. You have to admire the commitment, honestly."

He blinked. That actually made perfect sense. But he'd only taken Murong Qing because of her connection to Xue Yue—the mother-daughter bond was the real draw. She was also genuinely beautiful, far more so than these clan leaders' wives. Without a personal connection, random women held no appeal.

He shook his head. "Ten more days. Let's see if they can do better."

"Those factions definitely have beautiful women. You're serious about this?" Liu Shuwan asked.

He grinned. "Depends on what they bring me."

His true aim was twofold. One—he genuinely appreciated beauty. Two—somewhere among those major clans, there might be fortune heroines. Children of Destiny were hard to find, but fortune heroines were more common and tended to come from powerful families.

Worth a shot.
