A pair of slender white hands gripped the curtain, her voice tinged with nerves. Qin Jiang paused, his hand shifting from the gossamer veil to her fingers instead.

Her subordinate had already told him—An Xihe had reverted to her true appearance, the face of the Celestial Formation Fairy. The mature, captivating version from the system's visions flashed through his mind, and warmth stirred in his chest. Between the youthful disguise and the real thing, he far preferred the original—ripe, alluring, every movement radiating effortless magnetism.

On the other side of the curtain, An Xihe felt her tension ease slightly when his hand found hers. She bit her lip. "Qin Jiang, can you tolerate deception?"

"Deception?" He knew exactly what she meant—she was worried about the disguise. He smirked.

"The one thing I despise most in this world is deception."

Her hand went rigid. The air around them trembled, space itself rattling.

His heart lurched. 'Damn. Is she the type to destroy what she can't have?'

"However—" He pivoted smoothly. The trembling stopped at once. Relieved, he continued with a light chuckle: "If it's from you, Xihe, I'm sure there's a good reason."

"Then... can you accept it?"

After a deliberate silence, his voice came low and gentle: "Xihe, have you really deceived me?"

He sounded almost hurt. Fortunately, the curtain hid his grinning face.

"Not really," she whispered. With her free hand, she took his and drew the curtain aside.

Qin Jiang immediately schooled his features into perfect solemnity.

An Xihe appeared before him inch by inch—bare feet, slender calves, a crimson dress that made her flawless skin glow. She lay on her side, legs crossed, one delicate foot tracing her calf. Her waist was impossibly narrow, and above it, the dress revealed far more than it concealed. A swan-like neck flushed pink. And her face—exquisitely sculpted, striking the exact balance between beauty and allure—held his reflection in her glistening eyes.

She was even more breathtaking than the system's projection. He feigned a stunned pause, staring as if spellbound. Best to let her feel confident. He didn't want a repeat of the Qing Chan situation—where uncertainty led to something drastic.

"You... you're Xihe?" The words came out suitably dazed. Her figure was more enticing, her face largely the same but with a radically different aura—mature instead of girlish—making her seem like an entirely different person.

His reaction made her heart sing. She still had it. She cast him a bashful glance and lowered her eyes. "Do you like it?"

After another moment of "processing," Qin Jiang's hand was still holding hers. "This was the deception you meant?"

"Mm." She nodded, then gently tugged him down to sit on the edge of the bed. "The truth is, I'm actually—"

Before she could explain, he pulled her into his arms and kissed her.

An Xihe's body went stiff, her eyes flying wide, her face burning crimson. Every ounce of strength seemed to drain from her limbs. After what felt like an eternity, the formidable True Immortal nearly collapsed from a kiss. Qin Jiang lifted his head.

"If this is the kind of deception we're talking about, I'd welcome more of it."

She hadn't recovered. Her gaze was unfocused, her breathing uneven. Somewhere during the kiss, he'd climbed onto the bed. Her dress was disheveled—torn in places.

Just a kiss, and things had already gotten this intense?

She'd meant to explain her identity, but now her mind was blank. All she knew was that he clearly didn't mind the change. Good. She wouldn't need to kidnap him.

And yet... a tiny part of her was disappointed. If he had minded, she could've taken him by force and had him all to herself.

Her eyes cleared. Seeing the heat in his gaze, something fluttered in her chest. She opened her mouth to speak, but he kissed her again.

The second time went better. She wasn't purely passive anymore—she responded, clumsily, earnestly. Meanwhile, his hands seemed to have a mind of their own, and she trembled at their navigation.

So that was how her dress had gotten torn. She'd been too dazed to notice before. And this warmth spreading through her—she'd assumed Qin Jiang had used some water-attribute technique to combat the dry air. Turned out she'd been the source all along. An involuntary reflex, apparently. But not unpleasant.

She offered no resistance. If anything, she leaned in, cooperating with every unspoken request.

Then, suddenly, her eyes flew open, brow pinching. Pain flashed through them. She clung to him, and her lips found his—seeking distraction.

After some time, she exhaled shakily. Sweat-dampened hair clung to her face, which Qin Jiang gently brushed aside before pressing a light kiss to her forehead.

"Xihe, relax. You're too tense. It's affecting the, ah... progress."

"Mm..." Her face was scarlet. She was trying—but some things were beyond her conscious control. The beast had a mind of its own. Proud and willful, it refused to cooperate even at its owner's command.

In the end, Qin Jiang took matters into his own hands. As a master beast-tamer, no creature was too wild to be brought to heel—no matter how fierce.

Of course, the beast's rebelliousness had consequences for its mistress. For the first time in countless millennia, An Xihe experienced genuine exhaustion. She wanted to rest.

But Qin Jiang was still going strong.

Looking at him, she silently thanked her past self for not trying to take him by force. She would not have survived the experience.
