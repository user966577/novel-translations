The Empress was sated and Qin Jiang's thirst was quenched. They lay together, limbs intertwined.

He looked down at her. "Those things you agreed to earlier—still count?"

"Huh? What things?"

It took a moment for her to remember. She'd been dazed at the time, just agreeing to whatever he said. Something about... giving herself to him?

Color rose in her cheeks. She ducked her head and nodded shyly. "Mm. They count~"

What was done was done. And honestly, Qin Jiang ticked every box—looks, strength, background. If none of that were true, she wouldn't have stayed five days ago.

Drugged and fleeing, she could have left. Her only option would have been finding a random man—and compared to that gamble, staying with Qin Jiang had been the obvious choice.

So the moment she'd remained, her decision was already made. And after five days of experiencing what he could do... she was more than satisfied. Even if someone tried to drag her away now, she wouldn't go. After tasting paradise, going back to the bland life she'd known? Unbearable.

Hearing her answer, Qin Jiang beamed. He cupped her face and planted a smacking kiss on her lips. "Then you're my wife now?"

The title made her blink—unfamiliar, but not unwelcome. She nodded.

Peering up at him, she breathed, "Darling~"

"Heh heh. Good wife."

He pinched her cheek. "Your real name is Mengjin, isn't it?"

"Mm~"

She wasn't surprised he knew. Someone of his status would have investigated everything about the Merfolk before arriving. That thought led naturally to another: if he'd investigated everything, then he must have known about the Grand Elder's plot. Which explained his perfectly timed entrance.

He'd waited for her to be drugged on purpose.

She fixed him with a look. He blinked and touched his own face. "What? Stunned by how handsome I am?"

"I was just thinking," she said, her voice softer than he'd heard it, threaded with something like amused exasperation. "Five days ago, darling showed up at exactly the right moment. Not too early, not too late—right when I was at my most desperate. Was that fate?"

He coughed. She was sharp. But guilt? Not a trace. He grinned. "Clever girl."

"Hmph~"

She pouted. So she'd been right—he'd timed the whole thing. She wasn't angry, though. The outcome suited her just fine, and he had rescued her in the end.

Still, as his woman now, she was entitled to a little sulking.

"You're terrible~"

She swatted his chest, soft and playful.

He caught her hand and said with a straight face, "Everything I did was for you, Jiner. If the Grand Elder hadn't drugged you, I don't know when I'd have found a chance to get close."

"You came to the Merfolk tribe for me?"

Her eyes lit up. He nodded earnestly. "Of course. What else would bring me here?"

"Then..." Her gaze slid sideways to where Mengqian lay sleeping, still recovering from her exertions. "What about her?"

"I came for both of you."

"I heard you spent three days and three nights with the Third Elder's granddaughter without leaving her room."

His smile froze. So Mengjin had people inside Mo Li's household. She knew everything.

He smacked his lips. "For all three of you, then."

"Shameless!"

She rolled her eyes. The man made things up on the fly without the slightest hint of embarrassment.

He laughed and shrugged. "Fine. The truth is, I heard Merfolk women were extraordinarily beautiful—especially the Merfolk Empress. So I came to see for myself. Saying it was for you isn't really a lie, is it?"

"You really came because of me?"

"Absolutely. I'm just lustful."

She stared. Who said that about themselves?

She didn't yet grasp the full scope of his lustfulness. Once she met the harem, she'd realize he'd been utterly sincere.

"Don't believe me?"

She shook her head. Someone of his caliber, making a detour for beauty? Surely cultivation mattered more than women.

He smiled. "You will."

Then his eyes gleamed and he licked his lips. "Want me to demonstrate just how lustful I am? Right now?"

"No!"

Five days of nonstop intensity—even an Immortal Emperor had limits. She scrambled away and hugged herself defensively. "I'm tired~"

"You're an Immortal Emperor!"

"Even Immortal Emperors get tired. Look—" She showed him the damage, and he had to admit it was serious.

He sighed, mildly disappointed. Mengjin pointed toward Mengqian. "How about... you let her take over?"

Mengqian was her guard captain. Running interference was literally her job.

The girl was asleep nearby, lips smacking occasionally, drooling slightly—clearly dreaming about something appetizing.

Qin Jiang followed Mengjin's gaze and swallowed. He'd been dreaming about that appetizer too.

She'd been resting long enough. She should be fine.

Seeing his attention successfully redirected, Mengjin breathed a sigh of relief. "I'm going to rest. Do whatever you want with Mengqian."

She fled.

Qin Jiang watched her go with mild exasperation. Was that really necessary? He wasn't going to eat her.

Shaking his head, he turned to Mengqian. Well—he was going to eat someone.

He lay down beside her and slid an arm under her body, pulling her against him.

"Mm~" She stirred, bleary-eyed, and saw his face. "What~"

"I'm hungry."

The instant the words registered, her eyes flew wide open. "No!"

"I'm hungry."

"You—"

She was scared. The man was insatiable. It had been exhausting.

She looked around frantically. "Where's the Empress?"

"Resting. She told you to feed me."

"!!!"

Her jaw dropped. Feed him? Her? Five days of being fully conscious had shown her exactly what Qin Jiang was capable of. Making her satisfy him was impossible.

"I don't believe you. The Empress would never say that!"

Regardless of whether the Empress had said it, Mengqian knew she couldn't handle him alone.

"Whether you believe it or not—Jiner is my wife now, and you're the handmaiden that came with the deal. Feeding the master is your duty."

"???"

"What? Jiner—your Empress—is my wife? We're together now."

"You—"

He tilted her chin up with a smile. "What's the matter? Not happy with the arrangement?"

"I..."

Mengqian bit her lip. She didn't doubt that part—the circumstances made it inevitable. But handmaiden? She didn't want to be a handmaiden.

"Really not happy?"

She lifted her chin, pouting. "That's right. Not happy."

"Alright." He sighed. "If you don't want this, I won't force you. I'm a gentleman. I'll tell Jiner about your decision."

"???"

She gaped. Just like that? After everything they'd done, he was discarding her?

And what was that about not forcing? He loved forcing people!

A sting of hurt welled up, misting her eyes. She looked at him—and caught the mischief dancing in his gaze. His arm hadn't loosened around her one bit. If anything, his grip had tightened.

The rotten liar. He was teasing her.

Hmph. Jerk!
