"Bring him over," Qin Jiang told the brocade-robed manager.

The man nodded frantically, scrambled to his feet, and rushed toward Chen Qi'er. He seized the beggar by the collar and hauled him up. "You filthy beggar—I let you into my casino out of the goodness of my heart, and you repay me by cheating my honored guests? Get over there, now!"

He shoved and dragged Chen Qi'er across the floor, and when the man walked too slowly, kicked him in the rear for good measure. Chen Qi'er whipped his head around—despite the black cloth over his eyes, a flash of something fierce and piercing radiated from behind it, making the manager flinch.

"Son of a—" The manager recovered and landed another kick. "You dare try to scare me!"

After more shoving and kicking, he deposited Chen Qi'er in front of Qin Jiang, then dropped obediently back to his knees. "My lord, he's here."

Qin Jiang glanced at the manager. Serviceable, this one.

With a faint smile, he studied Chen Qi'er. The man was dressed like a beggar, sure, but his bearing was anything but. Still carrying himself with dignity, even now.

Qin Jiang walked up to him, step by step. Chen Qi'er stood in silence, his expression utterly impassive.

Then Qin Jiang's foot lashed out—a full-force Supreme-level kick, no restraint whatsoever. It sent Chen Qi'er flying, crashing through several gambling tables before slamming into the far wall. The casino's walls were sturdier than expected; they only cracked rather than crumbling. Qin Jiang had half-expected to punt the man clean through.

The kneeling manager's pupils contracted. He'd felt the force behind that kick. If it had landed on him without any defenses... it might have killed him outright.

And Chen Qi'er...

He stole a glance. The beggar slid down from the wall, a thin line of blood at the corner of his mouth, but otherwise appeared largely unharmed. He stood straight as a ramrod.

'This Chen Qi'er is someone serious too!' the manager realized.

Zi Fu's expression tightened as well. She'd noticed the same thing—this beggar was masking his true strength.

"I knew it," Lian'er muttered. The first time they'd encountered him, her Supreme-level guard hadn't been able to budge him. She'd sensed something was wrong even then. And now her brother had figured it out too, with just one look. Her brother was amazing!

She gazed at Qin Jiang, worship written all over her face.

Mo Mo pursed her lips. He'd just said the man was "just a beggar." If he were really just a beggar, that kick would've reduced him to a fine red mist.

Still, Qin Jiang clearly knew something she didn't.

Chen Qi'er coughed several times, spitting out a mouthful of blood. His face darkened with cold fury. He was an Immortal. Even in the midst of his heart-tempering, this kind of humiliation was intolerable.

His fists clenched, and behind the black cloth, his hollow eyes fixed on Qin Jiang. Anger surged through him.

But Qin Jiang wasn't finished. He strolled over at a leisurely pace, Mo Mo following close behind. She'd sensed a flicker of threat from the beggar and stayed on guard.

"Tough body you've got there," Qin Jiang remarked.

Standing before Chen Qi'er, he reached out and began slapping the man's face—casually, one palm after another. Slap. Slap. Slap.

"You're courting death!" Chen Qi'er snarled.

He grabbed Qin Jiang's wrist, but with his power sealed, his strength was far inferior. Qin Jiang backhanded him across the face, sending him sprawling. His skull rang like a bell.

Qin Jiang planted a foot on his face and felt, faintly, the man's aura beginning to churn—surging, building, on the verge of breaking free.

'Going to unseal himself?'

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow and said coolly, "Quitting halfway would waste a hundred years of bitter cultivation."

Chen Qi'er had been tempering his heart in the mortal world for a century. He was close to completion. But if he broke the seal now, all that progress would be lost.

The words hit home. Chen Qi'er went rigid, humiliation written across every line of his face. The churning aura slowly subsided.

"Who are you?" he rasped, his voice like sandpaper.

Qin Jiang's words had made it clear—he knew Chen Qi'er's true identity. And an Immortal had no shortage of enemies.

Fortunately, this young man didn't seem intent on killing him. Of course, if it came to that, seal or no seal, Chen Qi'er would break it without hesitation.

"Who I am doesn't matter," Qin Jiang said. "What matters is that a very close friend of mine was wronged by you once."

"Who?"

"Oh? Planning revenge already?" Qin Jiang smiled disdainfully. "My friend has been cultivating a divine technique. He's nearly finished, and once he is, even with your seal released, you won't be his match. So I'll tell you freely. Remember the name: Chen Changsheng."

"Chen Changsheng..." Chen Qi'er frowned. He didn't recall having an enemy by that name.

Wait—"his current name"? That meant the man had used a different name before. Changing identities was trivial for an Immortal. Perhaps this really was an old foe.

Chen Changsheng. He committed it to memory.

"He's in the Central Regions right now," Qin Jiang went on. "Doesn't have the time to deal with you personally. But since I happened to run into you, I figured I'd collect a bit of interest on his behalf. The rest of the grudge—he'll settle himself."

With a cold snort, Qin Jiang ground his foot against Chen Qi'er's face one final time, then kicked him clean out of the casino.

It was a good while before Chen Qi'er picked himself up outside, staring after Qin Jiang's retreating back with a face like a thundercloud.

"Chen Changsheng... the Central Regions..." he murmured. "My red dust tempering is nearly complete. If I start walking toward the Central Regions now, I should arrive right on time. Heh, Chen Changsheng—I'll find out exactly who you are."

Meanwhile, Chen Changsheng was still on the road when a sudden chill raced down his spine. He shuddered.

"What was that?"

He scanned his surroundings, instantly on alert. After ten reincarnations, his instinct for danger was razor-sharp. This kind of feeling usually meant something bad was coming.

He stayed vigilant for some time, but detected nothing. Still, unease gnawed at him.

"Don't tell me Qin Jiang is coming to the Central Regions too," he muttered. Lately, only Qin Jiang could make him feel this way. He took a deep breath, forcing down the creeping dread, and snorted. "Come, then! I refuse to believe you'll be this lucky in the Central Regions. This time, you lose!"

Outside the casino, Lian'er and Zi Fu both stared intently at Qin Jiang.

"Brother, is that how you got your King of Gamblers title?" Lian'er asked.

"Why did you call me your wife?" Zi Fu demanded.

Both spoke at almost the same time. Qin Jiang blinked, looking from one to the other.

"Whose question do I answer first?"

"Zi Fu's," Lian'er said, blinking innocently. Between the two, Zi Fu's question was sharper.

Qin Jiang turned to Zi Fu. He didn't bother hiding what was in his heart. "Because you're beautiful."
