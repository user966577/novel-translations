Days slipped past in easy contentment.

All of Azure Cloud Heaven had fallen under Huaxia Manor's dominion, and Qin Jiang took his women on a leisurely tour of the realm, surveying his territory while drinking in the raw, untamed beauty of nature.

One afternoon, atop a soaring mountain peak, Qin Jiang gazed out over an ocean of clouds and allowed himself a moment of reflection. A few years ago, when he'd first left Qin Domain for Azure Cloud Heaven, his forces had been thin and every step demanded caution. Now, the entire realm lay at his feet.

Lord of Huaxia. Master of Azure Cloud Heaven.

Quite the title.

A quiet smile played at his lips. This feeling was satisfying beyond words.

He turned around. Scattered across the mountainside, his women were doing what they did best — some sat cross-legged discussing the dao, some played chess over steaming cups of tea, some chased each other through fields of wildflowers. Every scene was a painting come to life.

"Brother! Come help me grill fish!"

Lian'er's voice drifted from nearby. He looked over to find her surrounded by a few plump, freshly-caught fish skewered on sticks, a campfire crackling beside her. Next to the fire sat a pile of ash... and what appeared to have once been a fish, now charred completely black.

Lian'er's face was streaked with soot like a kitten that had gotten into the fireplace.

Qin Jiang chuckled and walked over. "This is your handiwork?"

He picked up the carbonized fish. It was burnt clear through.

He dabbed some ash on his finger and dotted it on Lian'er's nose. "Charcoal, not fish."

"I don't know how!" Lian'er pouted. Beside her, Zi Fu, Little Red, and Bai Susu all sported similarly sooty faces. They eyed the blackened fish with sheepish expressions.

At their cultivation levels, none of them actually needed to eat. Today's outing had been a whim — they'd caught some fish on impulse and discovered that catching fish was trivially easy, but grilling them was an entirely different challenge. Pampered ladies, every one of them. None had ever cooked a meal. Temperature control was a foreign concept, and this burned specimen was actually their best attempt. The earlier ones had been incinerated to ash.

"Little Red, get a fire going. I'll handle the grilling."

Little Red nodded eagerly, and with a wave of her hand, summoned the Crimson Blaze. The ambient temperature spiked immediately. She clamped down on the intensity, but even at its lowest, the Crimson Blaze was far too powerful for grilling ordinary fish.

At least now Qin Jiang understood why the fish looked the way they did. These were normal fish — not even yao beasts. Using Crimson Blaze to cook them was like bringing a cannon to a candle-lighting. The fact that anything fish-shaped remained was a testament to Little Red's control.

"Use regular fire," Qin Jiang said, gesturing at a nearby stand of trees. A pile of firewood materialized before them. "Light this with a basic fire-control technique."

Little Red grumbled but complied, dismissing the Crimson Blaze and igniting the firewood with the simplest spell she knew.

Qin Jiang checked the temperature. Acceptable. He threaded spiritual energy into the flames for fine-tuned control, set up a proper rack, and got to work. It was just like pill refining, really.

"We need seasoning," he murmured, and purchased a selection of spices straight from the system.

Technology and effort. Delicious effort.

He gave them a sniff and nodded with satisfaction. Sure, they were a little... enhanced. But with his women's constitutions, mild toxicity was a non-issue. All that mattered was taste. Nobody was getting sick.

The rich aroma drew Lian'er and the others in close, eyes wide, mouths watering. Even the women who'd been discussing the dao or sipping tea wandered over.

"That smells incredible!"

"Grilled fish? Qin Jiang, you have hidden talents! Is it ready yet?"

They clustered around him. Cultivators didn't need food, but that didn't mean they couldn't enjoy it. And compared to the delicacies they usually sampled, this system-seasoned fish was in a different league entirely.

Lian'er eyed the growing crowd. Too many mouths, not enough fish.

"Brother, hold on — I'll go catch more!" She dashed off with Little Red, returning shortly with an armload of fat fish.

The first batch was done. Qin Jiang surveyed the eager faces. Not enough to go around. Better not to choose.

"Help yourselves. I'll grill more."

He left them to it and started cleaning the new catch, getting the next round going. Lian'er, ever thoughtful, grabbed the finished fish and distributed them without hesitation.

Nobody argued. Whoever Lian'er handed a fish to simply smiled, said thank you, and dug in.

"Hm? These spices — that's what makes it smell so good."

Linglong had picked up the seasoning blend, intrigued. She took a delicate sniff, and her eyes widened.

"Some of these ingredients are mildly toxic."

Every head swiveled toward Qin Jiang. Poisoning them? Some kind of drug?

He shrugged. "Slightly toxic, sure, but at our level, it's harmless. It just adds flavor."

"True — anyone with a shred of cultivation wouldn't even notice it." Linglong was already deep in analysis. All mundane ingredients, all mildly toxic... but what if she substituted immortal-grade materials? Could she create a poison potent enough to kill an immortal?

Her eyes gleamed. Standard pill refining was getting stale. This opened an entirely new avenue of research.

The other women looked on with faint disappointment. So it wasn't drugged after all.

Lian'er was the most crestfallen. The instant she'd heard "toxic," she'd grabbed a fish and bitten into it. But it wasn't the kind of toxin she'd been hoping for.

"With this seasoning, it really is delicious."

"Mmm, darling, I want more..."

"Hehe, husband, you should cook for us from now on!"

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. Cook for all of them? He'd be manning the grill every waking hour. He was the Lord of Huaxia, not a househusband!

Absolutely not.

Though... if it were congee, he wouldn't mind. He'd happily cook that variety every single day.
