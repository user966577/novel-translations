The Chaos District. Inside a great hall, Qin Jiang sat in the seat of honor while a crowd of underlings knelt before him.

"Boss, you've got to avenge the Second Boss!"

"Boss, they bullied us something awful!"

"Second Boss, so pitiful..."

The underlings wailed and sobbed. In their midst lay a figure swathed head to toe in bandages—Black Dragon, Second Boss of the River Dragon Gang.

With Qin Jiang's backing, Black Dragon had founded the River Dragon Gang here in the Chaos District. Qin Jiang was installed as First Boss while he ran things day-to-day as Second Boss. Starting with tens of thousands of underlings, the gang had swept through the Chaos District like a storm, ballooning to hundreds of thousands of members in just a few days, becoming the second-largest faction in the district.

Then, yesterday, the largest faction had issued a warning. Black Dragon, of course, refused to submit.

One rallying cry later, hundreds of thousands of gang members charged into a no-holds-barred brawl with the top faction. The battle was apocalyptic—until the other side cheated. Their leader turned out to be an Immortal.

Black Dragon was thrashed. Nearly half his people switched sides mid-battle, and even some of his closest confidants betrayed him. Only Qin Jiang's contingency plan saved his life. He'd limped back to base and immediately sent word.

Listening to the account, Qin Jiang's face darkened. He'd been away for a few days and Black Dragon had managed to cause this much trouble.

Hundreds of thousands of recruits? In the Chaos District, ninety-nine percent of people were fair-weather friends. Black Dragon had actually trusted them? No wonder they'd flipped.

He waved the underlings away, walked to the center of the hall, and gave Black Dragon a kick. "Get up, or I'm burying you."

Black Dragon shuddered, burst free of his bandages, and scrambled to his feet. He stood sheepishly before Qin Jiang. "Heh heh... Young Lord..."

He scratched his head. With Qin Jiang's protective measures, he hadn't actually been hurt that badly. He'd been faking the whole time. But he also realized he might have gotten a tad carried away.

"Talk. What happened?"

Black Dragon hesitated, then explained. "The broad strokes are like they said. But there's something off about the confidants who flipped. A few of them practically worshipped you and were utterly loyal to the gang. When they turned, it was like they'd lost their minds—no awareness, like puppets being controlled."

Qin Jiang frowned. The River Dragon Gang was mostly for fun, but the inner circle had been carefully vetted—people with genuine talent and proven loyalty, worth investing in. Yet they'd betrayed him. And it sounded like mind control.

"The other side has Immortals?"

Black Dragon nodded, fear flickering in his eyes. "The biggest faction in the Chaos District is the Chaos Sect. According to our intelligence, their strongest was supposed to be an Ancient Emperor. None of us expected them to have an actual Immortal."

"An Immortal..."

At that moment, Qing Chan appeared at Qin Jiang's side. Black Dragon immediately bowed. "Greetings, Mistress."

Qing Chan acknowledged him with a nod and said matter-of-factly: "The Chaos District having an Immortal is hardly a secret."

Black Dragon lowered his head. Among the top echelon, that was common knowledge. But for someone at his level...

"However," Qing Chan continued, "the mind-controlled confidants were very likely puppeted by someone."

Qin Jiang looked at her. She clearly knew who was behind it.

Qing Chan met his eyes. "Before you came here, you studied the Chaos District, right?"

"Somewhat. I heard there's a True Immortal sealed beneath it."

"Correct. But it's not a seal imposed from outside—she sealed herself."

"???"

That was different from what he'd been told.

"What you heard is the common version, not the truth." Qing Chan had been part of the original events. "Back then, Azure Cloud Heaven had eight True Immortals—one in each of the four cardinal regions, and four in the Central Regions. The eight maintained a balance, coexisting without much conflict.

"But one of the Central Region True Immortals—the one sealed here—secretly laid a grand formation across the entire Central Regions, planning to concentrate its power to break through to Immortal King.

"While the rest of us were perfectly content being True Immortals, she wanted to flip the table. Naturally, we intervened. But she'd anticipated that. A secondary formation was hidden within the first, and when things went south, she sealed herself inside it.

"As for the main formation—it wasn't impossible to destroy, but it benefited the Central Regions, so we three remaining True Immortals of the Central Regions decided to preserve it. The other four True Immortals from the outer regions objected, but our sides were evenly matched. Neither wanted an all-out war, so we compromised: modified the formation slightly, and left it standing."

Qin Jiang frowned. "So the True Immortal down there could emerge whenever she wants? And the Chaos District is essentially her territory?"

"It is her territory. But she can't come and go freely—we added a secondary seal after she shut herself in. It can't hold her for long, but if she tries to break out, we'll know immediately."

Qing Chan paused, then added: "Still, she's a True Immortal. Even through the seal, the entire Chaos District is under her control. The Chaos Sect is her puppet organization.

"This time, your people caused too big a stir on her turf. She only issued a warning—that was already generous. Then your man here led hundreds of thousands of gangsters to attack. That was pushing it."

Black Dragon: "..."

Qin Jiang sighed. So the Chaos District had an owner after all.

"One more thing," Qing Chan said, fixing Qin Jiang with a look. "Don't come to the Chaos District without me."

"Why?"

"Think about it. You carry my aura now. That woman sealed herself partly because of me, and she can't do anything to me directly—but she might take it out on you. Why do you think I insisted on coming along?"
