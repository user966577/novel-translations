Using the pill on his own wives was out of the question—at least not this particular one.

At the immortal level, most drugs were useless. Anything potent enough to affect a True Immortal came with genuine toxicity: physical damage and a form of neural hijacking that amounted to forced control. Far from pleasurable, it would be agonizing.

Looking at Chen Baizhe's eager, slightly flushed expression, Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow and smirked. "Thinking naughty thoughts again?"

"No..." She shrank back slightly, still recovering from yesterday's ordeal. Her cheeks reddened. "I just wanted to know if... with the pill... I could actually keep up with you for once."

She looked at him with those hopeful, blinking eyes.

He shook his head, smiling ruefully. "This one would do more harm than good. Trust me."

Back in the early days in the Qin Domain, low-stakes enhancements had been harmless fun when his women's cultivation was still modest. But now, nothing mild could get past their defenses. Even his own Kidney Treasure Pills—his personal staple—had gone through several reformulations as his power grew. Each new version demanded rarer ingredients. He couldn't pop them like candy anymore.

Not that he needed to. His natural prowess, built on years of alchemical investment, was more than sufficient.

Chen Baizhe's face fell. She'd harbored a secret dream of one day flipping the script—being the one in control, for once. Apparently, that wasn't happening.

Qin Jiang laughed and drew her close. "With all those sisters backing you up, you're still not satisfied?"

"Hmph." She shot him a look. Given the choice, she'd rather have him entirely to herself. Sure, it would be exhausting, but the exclusive claim would be worth it. Reality, however, had other plans—a man this exceptional attracted women like moths to a flame.

She settled against him with a soft sigh and kissed his jaw. "Let's go home. And remember—gentle."

"You have my word."

Dao Zhen found Chen Changsheng's recovery progressing well. He made small talk, checking in on the young man's condition, then casually produced a handful of medicinal pills—with Qin Jiang's special addition mixed in among them.

Chen Changsheng was overwhelmed by the gesture. "Senior, please—I have my own medicine. There's no need for you to—"

"Take them!" Dao Zhen's expression hardened. "These are from me. Don't you dare refuse."

"I..." Chen Changsheng's eyes shone with gratitude. He accepted the pills. "Thank you, Senior."

"Go on, take them now," Dao Zhen urged with practiced nonchalance. "Your external injuries are nearly healed. These should finish the job. As for the turmoil inside you—that's beyond medicine. You'll have to work through it yourself."

Chen Changsheng nodded. His wounds genuinely weren't that severe, and the origin essences inside him were already doing most of the repair work. The pills were technically unnecessary—but refusing a senior's kindness would be rude.

He examined them briefly. Nothing seemed off. He swallowed them all.

The healing pills worked quickly, saving him a bit of origin power. But the real priority was refining that power and completing the Reincarnation Law.

Dao Zhen watched him take the medicine, exchanged a few more pleasantries, and left.

Chen Changsheng stared after the retreating figure and murmured to himself, "Complete the Reincarnation Law first. Once it's finished, refining the origin essences will go twice as fast. It won't take long now."

Giving himself a pep talk, he retreated to his room and dove into cultivation.

Chen Qi'er was in bad shape.

True Immortal-level power had invaded his body, wreaking havoc. His own pills barely made a dent—he was too poor to afford anything effective. Most of the healing would have to come from his own resilience.

Chen Wuming stood watch. On the way back, he'd spotted Black Dragon's signal. He needed to step out.

He studied Chen Qi'er's ashen face and hesitated for a moment. "Master, wait here. I'll go find you some medicine."

He was out the door before Chen Qi'er could stop him. The man could only shake his head—exasperated but touched. For all his faults, this disciple had a good heart.

Following the signal, Chen Wuming arrived at an apothecary. The shopkeeper—another of Black Dragon's people—handed him several pills. One was identical to what Chen Changsheng had received. The rest were healing pills, though low-grade ones.

Chen Wuming understood: these were meant for Chen Qi'er.

He returned and presented them. Chen Qi'er took one look and sighed. The quality was laughable—pills this weak would do essentially nothing for someone at his level.

But looking at Chen Wuming's earnest, hopeful face, he swallowed them anyway. His disciple's cultivation was low; finding even pills of this caliber had probably been a challenge. The thought behind it mattered more than the medicine.

It was the most precious gift he'd received in a long time.
