"Oh? You actually admitted it?"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, then waved his arm. "Beat him."

A pack of guards descended on Chu Yuan like wolves. Every one of them was at least a Yin-Yang Realm cultivator. A puny Golden Body Realm kid had zero chance of resistance. Without Qin Jiang's order, of course, they held back from anything lethal—but the beating was savage and thorough.

Chu Yuan screamed in agony, but between the blows, he still managed to shout: "Qin Jiang, why can't I like my sister? You'd better kill me, because if you don't, I swear I'll take her back from you!"

Provocation? Qin Jiang was about to order the guards to hit harder when Chu Yuan bellowed again: "If you dare kill me, my sister will hate you for the rest of her life!"

The words had barely left his mouth when Chu Hanyan stepped out from hiding, appearing at Qin Jiang's side.

Her expression was glacial. She stared at Chu Yuan with undisguised fury and disappointment. She was Chu Yuan's biological sister. How could he harbor such thoughts? It was worse than an animal—it was beneath one.

"Sis..." Chu Yuan's eyes widened, panic flooding his face. She'd been here the whole time?

Qin Jiang pulled Chu Hanyan close by the waist. With a casual wave, the guards withdrew.

Chu Yuan crawled to his feet, bruised and swollen, staring at Chu Hanyan in helpless desperation.

"Sis, I..."

"Don't call me that."

Chu Hanyan's voice could have frozen stone. She'd never imagined that Chu Yuan actually harbored such feelings. She was his own flesh-and-blood sister.

Despicable. Worse than despicable.

"Are you telling me all that obedience, all that sweetness you showed me over the years—it was all an act?"

Complicated emotions warred in Chu Hanyan's heart. Her own brother having those kinds of thoughts about her made her skin crawl. She wanted nothing more than to beat him to death herself.

But Chu Yuan was her only family. Her fists trembled at her sides. In the end, all she could manage was a long, weary sigh. She turned to Qin Jiang.

"Let's go. From now on, Chu Yuan is no longer my brother. I won't see him again."

"Sis!" Chu Yuan's face contorted. He couldn't stop himself from shouting: "You'd abandon your own brother for a man?"

"You still know you're her brother, do you?" Qin Jiang scoffed.

Chu Yuan flinched, but the hatred in his eyes only deepened—especially when he watched Qin Jiang's hand trailing along Chu Hanyan's waist. His possessiveness surged, and with it, the darkest parts of his desire.

He refused to accept this.

So what if he was her brother? They were both human. Why couldn't a brother love his sister?

The twisted logic swallowed him whole, drowning out what little reason remained. But he was still lucid enough to understand that right now, he was no match for Qin Jiang. So he'd endure. He'd wait.

One day, when he was strong enough, he'd take his sister back.

Seeing Chu Yuan fall silent, Qin Jiang signaled his guards with a look, then turned and left with Chu Hanyan. Behind them, the sounds of fists and feet on flesh resumed, accompanied by Chu Yuan's howls.

Chu Hanyan forced herself not to look back.

Qin Jiang leaned close, his lips brushing her ear. "Relax. I'll let him live."

"Mm." She nodded, cheeks flushing at the warm breath against her skin.

The confrontation with Chu Yuan had dramatically altered Chu Hanyan's attitude toward her brother—and the shift in the story's trajectory triggered another system reward.

This time, however, the rewards weren't aimed at strengthening the Qin family. Instead, they were resources useful in Chaos—thirty half-Emperor-grade airships and an assortment of other supplies.

"The system's thoughtful," Qin Jiang mused. "Knows I'm about to leave the Heavenly Mystery Continent, so it's loading me up with ships."

Supreme-level cultivators could technically cross the Chaos under their own power, but it was slow and draining compared to flying an airship. With an airship, even an ordinary mortal could traverse the Chaos safely, and the energy cost was far more manageable.

The Qin family already owned a few airships, but nothing impressive—the best was merely half-Emperor grade. Thirty more at that level? That was enough to transport the entire Qin family. It was practically an invitation to become Chaos Marauders.

The Chaos wasn't a peaceful place. Besides the native Chaos creatures, there were Chaos Marauders—essentially bandits who preyed on travelers between continents. They were powerful and ruthless. Anyone capable of entering the Chaos was no ordinary cultivator, which meant rich pickings for anyone bold enough to rob them. The profits from a single heist could be staggering.

Of course, plenty of marauders met their end that way too.

With this many airships, the Qin family could literally pack up and live in the Chaos, raiding to their hearts' content. But the reputation wouldn't be flattering, and Qin Jiang still cared about appearances.

Several days passed.

Delegations began arriving at the Qin estate. The family made no effort to be subtle—they declared outright that from this day forward, the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent would acknowledge the Qin family's supremacy. Any who refused would be exterminated without mercy.

Most factions submitted immediately. The Qin family's strength was overwhelming, and at the end of the day, it mattered little who ruled the continent. These smaller powers had always been under some ancient clan's thumb; swapping one overlord for another changed nothing.

A few holdouts—sworn loyalists of various ancient clans—refused to declare allegiance without their patrons' blessing.

Half a month later, the first ancient clan capitulated.

The move shocked everyone: they surrendered eighty percent of their accumulated reserves and pledged fealty to the Qin family. Within days, over a dozen more ancient clans followed suit, each presenting their own reserves as tribute. They were terrified that the Qin family wouldn't accept.

What the clans didn't know was that the Qin family had been entirely unaware of their secret plot. Or rather, the Qin family simply hadn't considered them worth worrying about. The attitude was straightforward: scheme all you want—we'll crush you regardless.

Still, gifts were gifts. The Qin family accepted them graciously. And once the major ancient clans had set the precedent, the remaining holdouts had no choice but to fall in line. Send over your reserves, everyone—let's not be rude.

Over the course of a full month, virtually every ancient clan and major faction on the continent made the pilgrimage to the Qin estate, bearing tribute and swearing loyalty.

Not a single soldier was deployed.

The entire Heavenly Mystery Continent had been brought to heel. No one dared oppose the Qin family. Under the family's iron-fisted authority, the continent was formally renamed—the Qin Domain.

Every ancient clan became a vassal of the Qin family. Resentful? Perhaps. But survival demanded submission.

The Qin family then issued a series of sweeping reforms, reshaping what had been the Heavenly Mystery Continent—now the Qin Domain—as if it were their private estate.

As the days turned to weeks, ordinary citizens and independent cultivators alike accepted the new order. The various factions gradually settled into their roles. The age of the Qin family had begun.
