Both Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng scowled at Qin Jiang's remark. Chen Qi'er, feeling somewhat emboldened, let out a derisive snort — though he was careful not to push too far.

Qin Jiang smiled and looked down at Chen Baizhe. "Want to do it yourself?"

"You go ahead." She shot him a look, then turned to Chen Qi'er with a sigh and a small shake of her head. She said nothing more. From the moment he'd turned his killing intent on Qin Jiang, this outcome had been inevitable. And Qin Jiang had given him chance after chance — yet instead of showing gratitude, Chen Qi'er had kept coming. He'd brought this on himself.

Their exchange carried clearly to Chen Qi'er's ears. He stiffened. A chill crawled through him. 'Do it yourself?' That sounded like... sending him on his way.

Beside him, Chen Changsheng's blood ran even colder. He was now certain — Qin Jiang was going for the kill.

His eyes flickered, and he quietly edged behind Chen Qi'er. The man's combat strength was genuine — killing him wouldn't be easy. That window would be Chen Changsheng's chance to run.

Qin Jiang noticed the little maneuver but didn't care. He raised his hand in a casual sweep. A terrifying force coalesced and locked onto both of them instantly.

In the shadows, Dao Zhen's eyes widened. The power was overwhelming — for a split second, it made even him feel like an ant. When Qin Jiang had first coerced him, it hadn't felt anything like this.

'Another hidden card,' he murmured to himself. Whatever lingering schemes he'd been harboring died in that moment. Forget fortune and destiny — Qin Jiang was more terrifying than any Child of Destiny alive.

Chen Qi'er struggled against the invisible bindings, panic setting in. Chen Changsheng fared even worse. Both were horrified — Qin Jiang commanded forces that utterly dwarfed their own.

"What are you doing?" Chen Qi'er shouted.

Qin Jiang's expression was mild. "Seeing you off."

"What?"

His body went rigid. Qin Jiang was actually going to kill him. But how — Chen Baizhe was right there, and she wasn't stopping it? Had she truly abandoned every last scrap of feeling?

He looked at her. Her beautiful eyes held nothing but frost. She glanced at him once, then turned to gaze at Qin Jiang's profile, and the coldness melted instantly into tenderness.

That single gesture nearly broke him. Moments ago, he'd sworn that Chen Baizhe would never abandon him. Now his own words slapped him across the face.

Shock, fury, and shame flooded his features. "Chen Baizhe!" he roared. "Have you truly cast aside every last bit of feeling?"

"Watch your mouth." Qin Jiang's brow creased. A telekinetic slap cracked across Chen Qi'er's face, knocking out teeth, swelling his cheek in an instant.

Chen Baizhe's expression hardened. "You've tried to kill my husband again and again. That I'm not doing this with my own hands is already more mercy than you deserve. Anyone else who threatened him wouldn't get off this easily."

In her mind, a clean death was generous. Had it been anyone but her brother, she would have ensured they suffered far worse. Threatening Qin Jiang warranted nothing less.

"You..." Chen Qi'er was stunned. They were going to kill him, and she called that mercy?

"Shut up!" Chen Baizhe's eyes flashed with killing intent. "One more word and I'll do it myself."

Qin Jiang smiled, ruffled her hair, and kissed the top of her head. "Don't get worked up — I'll handle it. You shouldn't have to dirty your hands. Those two didn't exactly spend their time apart doing anything clean."

Both Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng were filthy — Qin Jiang didn't even want to get close. His gentle tone calmed Chen Baizhe immediately. She nodded, then after a moment's hesitation: "Make it quick. As a final kindness."

"Done."

Qin Jiang turned back to Chen Qi'er. He extended his hand and slowly clenched it. The force imprisoning Chen Qi'er surged inward. Bones shattered with wet, grinding cracks.

Chen Qi'er screamed, his body beginning to deform under the crushing pressure.

Behind him, Chen Changsheng went pale. Qin Jiang's power was far beyond anything he'd imagined. Once Chen Qi'er fell, he'd be next — and he had absolutely no way to resist.

Despair settled over him like a shroud. He closed his eyes, resigned to death.

Then, through the agony, Chen Qi'er bellowed: "Chen Baizhe! Grant me one last request!"

Qin Jiang relaxed his grip slightly and glanced at Chen Baizhe. Before she could respond, he spoke: "What request?"

Chen Qi'er swallowed a mouthful of blood, fighting through the pain. He turned his head toward Chen Changsheng. "He was my first man. Let me have him one last time."

Qin Jiang blinked. His expression turned deeply strange.

Chen Changsheng's eyes flew open, face draining of color. Again? He looked at Qin Jiang in desperation. "Don't agree to that! Qin Jiang — kill me! Just kill me now!"

He'd rather die than endure that again. Even as he pleaded, the memories surged up unbidden, and his stomach heaved.

But Chen Qi'er's eyes burned bright and earnest. "This is my dying wish."

Qin Jiang actually considered it. The man did seem sincere. Well — in the spirit of honoring a brother-in-law's final request...

He was about to nod when Chen Baizhe grabbed his arm. "He's disgusting. Just kill him."

"Yes — kill him immediately," Liu Shuwan chimed in from the other side.

Both women's faces were pinched tight with revulsion, their gazes on Chen Qi'er dripping with contempt. Even on death's door, he insisted on being revolting.

Qin Jiang blinked, sighed, and gave Chen Qi'er an apologetic look. "Sorry. Looks like your dying wish isn't happening."

"No!!!"
