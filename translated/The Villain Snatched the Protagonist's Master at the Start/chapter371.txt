Qin Jiang held An Xihe's hand, flirting shamelessly — though he hadn't forgotten Jian Yao. Keeping things fair was his golden rule.

Meanwhile, under the two True Immortals' onslaught, the Zhao family was crumbling. Zhao Xing's expression was grim. The clan had a True Immortal ancestor, true, but this was his first time facing True Immortal-level opponents in actual combat. Even rallying the full might of the Zhao family, they were being pushed back at every turn.

If it were an Immortal King instead... He shuddered. Perhaps he'd underestimated what an Immortal King really meant. Could the Zhao family actually stand against one?

Blown back yet again, he forced down the churning qi in his blood and surveyed the estate. Formations lay shattered everywhere. Disciples littered the ground. Several Human Immortals were in full retreat. His face darkened, but there was nothing left to try. Only a show of sufficient strength could hope to deter Huaxia.

Zhao Xing drew a deep breath, dropped to one knee facing the compound, and roared: "Zhao family head Zhao Xing begs the ancestor to enter the battle!"

Silence. Qin Jiang's gaze shifted to the compound. Not a sound. A long moment passed. Still nothing. Zhao Xing was bewildered. He hesitated, then bellowed again: "I beg the ancestor to enter the battle!"

Nothing.

Amusement flickered across Qin Jiang's face. "Seems your True Immortal has some self-awareness after all."

"I beg the ancestor to enter the battle!" Zhao Xing kept shouting, but his face was going white. He'd already guessed the truth — the ancestor didn't dare. The old man lacked the courage to face an Immortal King. "Ancestor — please! Enter the battle!" He ground his teeth and called out over and over, each attempt answered only by deeper despair.

While this played out, Qin Jiang's Immortal King Killing Formation had already enveloped the entire estate. He never underestimated an enemy. The moment they'd arrived, he'd begun deploying it in silence. His gaze settled on a particular spot within the compound — a terrifying aura, desperately suppressed. The Zhao family's True Immortal.

"Can't stay hidden forever," he murmured, and sent the formation's power crashing down.

A violent explosion reduced the location to rubble — but no body emerged. Qin Jiang blinked. "Where'd he go?"

All eyes converged on the ruins. An Xihe's brow creased. She swept her hand through the air and the debris scattered, revealing a single figure seated cross-legged beneath. "A fake!" Her expression went cold. She slammed down and the decoy shattered.

Qin Jiang's frown deepened. He'd locked onto that aura the moment they arrived. A decoy? The old bastard must have swapped himself out and fled while they weren't looking.

Everyone froze. Zhao Xing's jaw dropped. Their ancestor had... run? Left behind a fake body. No wonder his calls had gone unanswered. But with the ancestor gone, what now?

Zhao Xing's face was ashen. He turned stiffly toward Qin Jiang. Would begging for mercy even work? Qin Jiang's expression was glacial. An Xihe's was worse. A mere True Immortal had slipped away right under her nose. Fury blazed in her eyes. She snorted, turned her gaze on what remained of the Zhao estate, and brought her palm down.

The entire compound turned to dust.

Every formation, every ward — useless. The Zhao family's main estate was annihilated in a single strike. Only a handful of Human Immortals remained, trembling in the sky. At last, they understood what an Immortal King truly meant.

But destroying the estate hadn't vented An Xihe's anger. She turned to the surviving Human Immortals, reached through the void, and crushed them one by one — each bursting into a cloud of red mist. Just as she'd said: ants. Not a shred of resistance.

Zhao Xing's legs gave out. He finally understood why the ancestor had fled. An Immortal King was beyond anything they could fight. A shame the realization came too late. Before the thought even finished forming, a terrifying force locked him in place. Then his consciousness went black.

Qing Chan and Mo Mo both shrugged. They'd been fighting for half a day, and An Xihe had accomplished more with a single flash of temper.

Mo Mo eyed the clouds of blood mist drifting nearby and beckoned with one hand. "Xihe, that guy won't escape. I can find him." As a demonic cultivator, she had no shortage of bizarre methods. Blood that could kill through bloodlines could also track through them. She gathered the mist and shaped it into a crimson serpent. It circled once, then shot off like an arrow.

"After it," Mo Mo said.

They gave chase. After the better part of a day, the blood serpent dove into the territory of another power.

"The Zhao family's ally? Did that old man run here for help?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. This faction looked strong — probably no weaker than the Zhao family.

Jian Yao blinked, then frowned. "That's not right. This is the Li family — they're the Zhao family's blood enemies. Why would that old bastard come here?"

"Blood enemies?"

Qin Jiang paused, but An Xihe didn't care about politics. She'd already sensed the Zhao True Immortal's aura inside the Li compound. Without hesitation, she struck.

The Li family's protective formation blazed to life and shattered in the same breath. The Zhao True Immortal's hiding spot was obliterated. An Xihe reached through the air and snatched a figure from the wreckage. At the same time, another figure — dusty, disheveled, and thoroughly bewildered — rose into the sky. A True Immortal. He took one look at Qin Jiang's group, and his pupils contracted. He knew exactly who they were.

His face went dark. He rounded on the Zhao True Immortal, teeth bared. "You motherf— I *knew* something was off when you started sending gifts out of nowhere! You piece of shit — you were trying to drag us down with you! You goddamn—"

He hopped in place, jabbing a finger at the Zhao ancestor, spittle flying everywhere. After a thorough bout of cursing, he finally composed himself, turned to Qin Jiang's group with a pained smile, and said: "Ha ha, esteemed friends from Huaxia — this piece of garbage has absolutely nothing to do with our Li family. Kill him, skin him, do whatever you like..."
