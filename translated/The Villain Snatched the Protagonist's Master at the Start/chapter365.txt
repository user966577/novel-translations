Jian Yao waved her arm and erected a barrier of her own, just as Liu Shuwan had done. Her place of rebirth was equally sacred — no strangers allowed.

Qin Jiang took her hand. "Yao Yao, before long, we should visit Grey Cloud Heaven."

"Grey Cloud Heaven..." Jian Yao paused.

She wasn't native to the Heavenly Mystery Continent. She'd come from one of the Nine Heavens — Grey Cloud Heaven, home of the Sword Sect. She'd been its Saintess, the pride of a declining power beset by enemies on all sides. When the Sword Sect's leadership decided to buy breathing room through a political marriage — offering Jian Yao to the young master of a powerful clan — she'd refused.

She'd stormed the main hall. Raged at the elders. Even fought them — though the Sword Sect, weakened as it was, still outmatched her. Fortunately, when combat and protest both failed, Jian Yao had the good sense to run.

Both the Sword Sect and the groom's family sent pursuers. Grey Cloud Heaven became too dangerous, so she fled entirely — but not before sustaining heavy injuries from repeated ambushes. After countless close calls, she'd arrived at the Heavenly Mystery Continent.

Burning with indignation, she'd founded the Holy Sword Sect to eclipse the original, dreaming of returning one day to settle the score. But the Ten Lands' resources couldn't compare to the Nine Heavens. Growth was slow, and her injuries worsened without proper medicine. By the time they became fatal, all she could do was leave behind Sword Valley and hide a fragment of her soul within the Sword Heart, hoping a worthy successor would one day carry on her legacy and avenge her.

Of course, her planning had a blind spot. The deepest part of Sword Valley required Sword Heart mastery to enter, and the reward for entering was... the Sword Heart. In the Ten Lands, Sword Heart cultivators were virtually nonexistent. The valley would have stayed sealed forever if not for a certain shameless young man who'd broken every rule on his way down.

"We have the power now to sweep across all Nine Heavens and Ten Lands," Qin Jiang said, squeezing her hand. "Everyone who wronged you — we're paying them back."

Jian Yao's eyes blazed. She pumped her fist. "Yes! Every single one!"

"When do we go?"

"A few days. Once we're back from the Holy Sword Sect, we'll bring Xihe and Mo Mo along."

Mo Mo was also from Grey Cloud Heaven — banished over a million years ago after terrorizing the place. She'd been chased out by half the continent's strongest cultivators. She'd wreaked havoc elsewhere afterward, but eventually met her match on the Divine Dragon Continent, where the empire's founder had sacrificed himself to seal her for hundreds of thousands of years. Heroic from one perspective, tragic from Mo Mo's — though in the end, her enemy was dead and she was alive. She'd come out ahead.

As for returning to Grey Cloud Heaven? She was a True Immortal now. A triumphant homecoming. Everyone who'd ever crossed her would answer for it.

But that was future business. Right now...

"Yao Yao, since I'm helping you get revenge, shouldn't there be some compensation?" Qin Jiang grinned.

Jian Yao snorted, exchanging a look with Liu Shuwan and Bai Susu. "Girls — attack!"

"Heh, bring it on!"

Three against one — not that it mattered. A few exchanges and Qin Jiang had the upper hand, then claimed his "compensation" at leisure. Plus interest. For a full day. Only then did he pronounce himself satisfied.

Jian Yao lay with him afterward, idly wondering what it would be like once they had children. Probably the same scene, she mused — just with a smaller, less demanding version of Qin Jiang.

She pressed a finger to his forehead. "Had enough?"

"Nope."

She pouted but didn't push him away. "At this rate, when we have kids, there won't be anything left for them."

"Heh, I have faith in you, Yao Yao. You'd never leave a child hungry." He gave an appraising look and nodded with confidence.

Off to the side, Liu Shuwan and Bai Susu both snuck a glance, then looked down at themselves and shook their heads. They couldn't compete. Among all the sisters, Jian Yao was the most... prominent. And yet it suited her perfectly — no awkwardness whatsoever, just effortless proportionality.

Everyone had their own perfection. At least, that's what Qin Jiang always told them.

After collecting ample interest, Qin Jiang finally rose — though his gaze lingered. Jian Yao rolled her eyes and didn't bother covering up. They were all family. And with assets like hers, showing them off was only fair.
