Qin Jiang looked at Ye Ling'er with a smile.

"If I'm not mistaken, you already know all of this."

Ye Ling'er stared at Qin Jiang in shock.

The Xiao family members were equally stunned. None of them had imagined Ye Ling'er possessed such a background.

"The Ye family... is that the ancient Ye clan?"

Xiao An murmured.

"You..."

Ye Ling'er fixed her gaze on Qin Jiang, her expression somewhat nervous.

"How do you know all this?"

"Heh. Did you think my Qin family were just sitting around doing nothing?"

Qin Jiang sneered coldly. Then he looked toward a particular spot in the void.

"Ye family member—stop hiding."

As his words fell, the void trembled slightly. Moments later, a figure revealed itself.

"Ye Kuan of the Ye family greets Young Master Qin."

It was an elderly man. Upon appearing, he cupped his hands toward Qin Jiang in a slight bow.

At the same time, Black Dragon stepped forward, watching the old man warily. This old man's strength was a level above his own.

"Ye Kuan—the patriarch of the Ye family's most loyal follower. Cultivation at the perfected Yin-Yang Realm. Your illustrious reputation precedes you."

Qin Jiang smiled.

Ye Kuan responded with a faint smile of his own. He was, after all, a powerful figure. The fact that he'd taken the initiative to greet Qin Jiang was already giving the Qin family considerable face.

After speaking, Qin Jiang turned to Black Dragon.

"Think you can take him?"

Ye Kuan: "..."

His expression froze. Then his eyes narrowed slightly.

"Young Master Qin, there's no enmity between my Ye family and the Qin family."

"There is now."

Qin Jiang's gaze remained fixed on Black Dragon.

Black Dragon's expression grew solemn. He carefully sized up Ye Kuan, took a deep breath, and nodded firmly.

"Young Master, in a fight to the death, I can kill him!"

His realm was at the peak of Yin-Yang—one minor stage below Ye Kuan.

But he had absolute confidence in his combat prowess.

"In that case..."

"Young Master Qin, please wait!"

Before Qin Jiang could finish, Ye Kuan cut him off. He'd sensed a dangerous aura from Black Dragon. Beyond that, he truly didn't want to become enemies with the Qin family.

Thirteen years ago, the Ye family's internal strife had cost them dearly.

And the Qin family was one of the most powerful ancient clans—significantly stronger than the Ye family.

Provoking the Qin family was not a wise choice.

"Does Young Master Qin wish to bring our young miss back with him?"

Ye Kuan asked.

He'd been hidden in the void the entire time and knew everything that had transpired.

Qin Jiang nodded.

Upon hearing this, Ye Kuan's heart stirred.

"I can accompany the young miss and follow Young Master Qin back. I only hope this won't cause enmity between our Ye family and the Qin family."

When he'd found Ye Ling'er, he'd wanted to take her back to the Ye family immediately. But Ye Ling'er was worried about Xiao Fan and refused to return.

Moreover, through his observations during this time, he'd sensed that Ye Ling'er seemed to have special feelings for Xiao Fan. And Xiao Fan was nothing but a worthless waste.

How could he possibly be worthy of the young miss?

This had been giving him headaches. But unexpectedly, Qin Jiang had now shown up with his sister to break off an engagement.

Most importantly, Qin Jiang seemed to have taken a liking to the young miss.

Perhaps...

Ye Kuan looked at Qin Jiang. Compared to Xiao Fan, Qin Jiang cut an impressive figure. Even among the younger generation of the ancient clans, he could be considered a top-tier genius.

No matter how you looked at it, he was leagues beyond Xiao Fan.

So Ye Kuan began scheming.

Whether in talent or family background, he was a match for the young miss.

"What does Young Master Qin think?"

Ye Kuan's voice carried a hint of anticipation.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. Why did this old man seem so eager to hand Ye Ling'er over to him?

Was this guy actually a traitor to the Ye family?

Ye Ling'er was even more dumbfounded. She stared at Ye Kuan in shock. During this time, Ye Kuan had constantly lectured her about how men were no good, how she was still young and shouldn't rush into relationships, and so on.

But now...

"Uncle Kuan, what are you doing!"

She scolded angrily.

Qin Jiang looked down at Ye Ling'er and chuckled softly.

"He wants to form ties with the Qin family to help resolve the Ye family's predicament."

"Form ties with the Qin family?"

Ye Ling'er snorted coldly.

"My Ye family is also an ancient clan. Our strength is no less than the Qin family's. Why would we need to rely on the Qin family's power?"

"Heh. It seems you don't know much about your own family."

Qin Jiang sneered.

"Forget about now—even thirteen years ago, before your Ye family's internal strife, you weren't qualified to compete with the Qin family.

"Now, after that conflict, the Ye family has suffered considerable losses. On top of that, although your father successfully took power during the infighting, the eldest son of the Ye family didn't actually die.

"In fact, there are still loyalists to the eldest son within the Ye family.

"At this point, if someone were to offer a bit of support to the eldest son... heh heh..."

As he spoke, he looked at Ye Kuan.

"If I'm not mistaken, some other ancient clan has already been secretly supporting the eldest son, correct?"

Ye Kuan fell silent for a moment, then smiled bitterly.

"Young Master Qin's foresight is truly remarkable."

"You want Ye Ling'er to come with me partly to borrow the Qin family's power. But also...

"You're worried about Ye Ling'er's safety. Am I right?"

Ye Kuan nodded again.

The current Ye family was not stable. Otherwise, he would have forcibly taken Ye Ling'er back long ago.

"Unfortunately, your young miss doesn't seem willing."

Qin Jiang smiled faintly.

"Perhaps my Qin family should reach out to the eldest son of the Ye family instead."

Ye Kuan: "..."

This was a blatant threat!

He looked at Ye Ling'er. After a moment's hesitation, he spoke.

"Young miss, if you could please..."

Although he didn't finish the sentence, everyone understood his meaning.

For a moment, Ye Ling'er felt lost and helpless.

She'd thought she could use the Ye family's reputation to help Xiao Fan. But now, not only couldn't she help him—she was going to be dragged into this mess herself.

Even the Ye family was being threatened.

She felt incredibly wronged. When Ye Kuan had found her, he'd said the Ye family was powerful, one of the most elite forces on the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent.

But now, a single ancient clan could threaten the Ye family.

Her illusions about the Ye family shattered completely.

"Young miss, if you act willfully now, it won't just be our Ye family that suffers—the Xiao family will be implicated too..."

Ye Kuan said softly.

Having lived away from the Ye family for over a decade, Ye Ling'er might not feel much attachment to them. But she still cared about the Xiao family.

So when she heard Ye Kuan mention the Xiao family, her delicate body trembled slightly.

She couldn't help but look at Xiao Fan. But she also knew that Xiao Fan couldn't save her. He couldn't even save himself.

Ye Ling'er closed her beautiful eyes and nodded.

"Fine. I'll go with you."

"Ling'er!"

Xiao Fan couldn't believe it. Ye Ling'er had actually agreed.

Ye Ling'er gave a sorrowful smile but said nothing more.

Ye Kuan waved his hand. A force wrapped around Ye Ling'er, and together they stepped onto Qin Jiang's palace-carriage.

He gave Qin Jiang a slight nod, then moved to the side.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang looked down at Xiao Fan. He still hadn't gotten that ring.
