Qin Jiang flipped casually through the registration lists. Then, under the nervous gazes of the entire crowd, he tossed the vast majority of them into the air.

"These are eliminated."

His tone was perfectly indifferent.

The crowd stared at the fluttering pages in stunned silence. This was too reckless, wasn't it? Even Dao Kun's cheek twitched.

He coughed quietly and leaned in. "Young Master Qin, I understand the selection is mostly a formality, but could we at least try to look legitimate? If we handle it this carelessly, who's going to bother showing up for next year's selection? We need to leave the outer disciples some hope."

Qin Jiang glanced at him. "Those names were randomly drawn. Being picked means their luck ran out. Luck is important, you know. Unless Sect Master Dao Kun wants to recruit a bunch of unlucky losers into the inner sect? That'll drag down the sect's fortune."

Dao Kun paused. Fortune—it sounded abstract, almost mystical, but it was undeniably real. Every senior cultivator here had survived countless life-or-death situations on the path to where they stood. Beyond talent, luck had been indispensable. They all understood its importance. In fact, for cultivators, fortune might be the single most important thing. Fortune could defy fate itself.

Dao Kun nodded, finding Qin Jiang's logic surprisingly compelling. These unlucky ones absolutely could not be admitted. They'd contaminate the sect's fortune.

"Heh, my mistake. Please continue, Young Master Qin."

Nearby, leaders from the visiting sects overheard Qin Jiang's reasoning and fell into quiet contemplation. Perhaps they should try this approach when recruiting their own disciples—screen out the unlucky ones first. Then again, what if they accidentally screened out a genius? The Human Dao Sect wasn't lacking for talent, but most sects were. The visiting leaders wrestled with the dilemma.

Meanwhile, the outer disciples' hearts were in their throats. Qin Jiang had thrown away at least half the lists with a single wave of his hand. Nobody could be sure whether their name was among the discarded. Even Chen Changsheng's expression darkened. With this kind of selection, he had no confidence he'd pass. His luck had always been decent, but every time he encountered Qin Jiang, it seemed suppressed—he'd been so unlucky he could choke on a glass of water. He felt as though he and Qin Jiang were natural opposites, destined for a fight to the death. And at present, he held no advantage whatsoever.

Qin Jiang continued sorting through what remained. This name looked annoying—tossed. That one didn't sit right—tossed. Page after page fluttered to the ground. The outer disciples' hearts were shattering. They'd prepared for so long, and this was the exam? Was this a joke?

Finally, only three pages remained before Qin Jiang, densely packed with just over a thousand names. "How about... we go with these?"

He placed them in front of Dao Kun, who stared blankly at the sea of discarded lists covering the ground. "Why were all those eliminated too?"

"Some of the names were annoying to look at."

Dao Kun's mouth twitched. He coughed delicately. "Perhaps... you could phrase it more diplomatically?"

"Diplomatically?" Qin Jiang thought for a moment, glanced at the pages on the ground, and gave a slight pulse of energy. Every last discarded list disintegrated into dust.

Dao Kun: "???"

"Oops, those lists got accidentally destroyed. Making new ones would be a real hassle, wouldn't it?"

Dao Kun's cheek spasmed. You call that diplomatic? But remaking all those lists really would be too much trouble. Fine. Whatever.

He eyed the three remaining pages in Qin Jiang's hand and spoke carefully. "Should I hold those for you?"

"Here, take a look. Think we should trim it down further?" Qin Jiang handed the lists over. A thousand-plus candidates was still over budget. He was just worried Qin Jiang would eliminate every last one—accepting zero recruits would be hard to explain.

The outer disciples were in complete despair. With this few remaining, what were the odds their names were still there? Practically zero.

Dao Kun hesitated. They'd planned to accept about a hundred inner sect disciples this cycle. A thousand was well over budget. "Perhaps Young Master Qin could narrow it down a bit more?"

Qin Jiang nodded and reached for the lists, ready to cross off more names.

"Wait, wait!" Dao Kun stopped him, somewhat exasperated. "How about... we handle this last part ourselves?"

"Oh, I see." Reading his expression, Qin Jiang smiled. "You want to pick some people with actual ability?"

Obviously. Dao Kun kept the thought to himself. They were one of the three great powers of the Central Regions. Inner sect disciples needed at least some competence.

He nodded.

Qin Jiang grinned. "I understand completely. How about this—I'll personally test them. Anyone on those lists who can take a single blow from me passes. Sound fair?"

Dao Kun studied him. Qin Jiang was a Nine Tribulations Supreme now. Not a single outer disciple had reached Supreme Realm. Who could possibly survive one blow?

"I'll suppress my strength," Qin Jiang added.

With all his women protecting him, he hadn't personally fought in ages. His hands were itching. This was the perfect venue—no real danger. Just a nice session of bullying weaklings.

Dao Kun hesitated, then nodded. "Then we'll trouble Young Master Qin."

"No trouble at all."

Qin Jiang waved dismissively and walked to an open clearing, signaling Dao Kun to start calling names.

One by one, names rang out. Each person called surged forward in excitement, only to be dispatched with a single blow and sent stumbling away in dejection. Dozens went down without surviving a single strike. Dao Kun's face was twitching.

"Young Master Qin, our Human Dao Sect really doesn't have such strict requirements," he transmitted privately.

Qin Jiang got the message immediately—time to go easy. He nodded and picked a few candidates he found pleasant-looking, pulled his punches just enough, and let them pass. The people behind them were instantly energized. One after another threw everything they had into surviving Qin Jiang's strike.

But it all came down to whether Qin Jiang found them agreeable. Disagreeable? Gone. Agreeable? He'd ease up. And most of the ones who passed... were girls.

Dao Kun's expression grew darker and darker. He'd watched several promising talents get swatted away, their faces crushed with defeat. Their dao hearts were probably on the verge of shattering.
