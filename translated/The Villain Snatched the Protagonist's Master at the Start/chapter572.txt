Qin Jiang didn't linger long in the Dream Cloud Sea. He soon brought Mengjin, Mengqian, and Shanshan aboard the immortal ship to introduce them to the rest of the family.

The three women froze when they saw the crowd of sisters waiting to greet them. Qin Jiang had mentioned he had quite a few women, but he hadn't said this many.

Looking at Qin Jiang, Mengjin finally believed it. This man really was purely driven by lust. He might actually have come to the Merfolk tribe for them after all.

While the three newcomers stood in stunned silence, An Xihe walked over. She glanced at Mengjin and offered a warm smile. "Hello."

"It's you?"

In the Merfolk Royal Palace, An Xihe had briefly appeared, though Mengjin had been completely lost to the drug's effects at the time and hadn't noticed her. But before that, she'd sensed An Xihe's presence and had even probed her a few times. So now, meeting An Xihe face to face, she recognized her immediately.

Showing no surprise, Mengjin returned the greeting. "Hello."

"From now on, we're all sisters," An Xihe said with a smile. "When you have time, we should compare notes on the Dao."

"Of course."

As fellow Immortal Emperors, the gap between them wasn't vast. Exchanging insights might lead to unexpected breakthroughs for both.

As the two chatted, Liu Shuwan approached from the other side, gathering Mengqian and Shanshan to introduce them to the group.

"Come on, let me introduce you to everyone too," An Xihe said.

Mengjin nodded and followed her over to Liu Shuwan. They exchanged greetings and began introductions all around. As Mengjin looked over the assembled women, a flicker of surprise crossed her face. They weren't merely beautiful—their strength and talent were all remarkable, each one a prodigy in her own right. Several of them were impressive enough to make even Mengjin feel a touch inferior.

All these extraordinary women, and every single one belonged to that scoundrel. Then again, with his looks, strength, and background, it wasn't unreasonable that they'd all been drawn to him. Still, encountering this many exceptional women—his luck was truly something.

What Mengjin didn't realize was that assembling this harem hadn't been luck at all. It was the result of Qin Jiang's tireless effort. The sheer amount of energy he'd invested was staggering.

While the women got acquainted, Qin Jiang boarded a separate ship. Black Dragon and Little Xu stood before him.

"Young Master, we've located the Immortal Emperor's secret realm. It's ready to be opened at any time," Little Xu reported. During the days Qin Jiang had been attending to business, they hadn't been idle either. They'd pinpointed the secret realm's exact location.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded approvingly. "Good work."

"Heh heh, Young Master—this Immortal Emperor's secret realm? We might be able to claim it all for ourselves."

"Oh?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

Little Xu grinned. "The secret realm is sealed behind a spatial barrier, but it's nearly worn through. Even without outside interference, it would emerge on its own soon. If we slip inside before it opens to the public, we can take everything."

"Can you get in?"

"Not yet," Little Xu admitted with an awkward scratch of his head. "But once the barrier thins a bit more, I can pass right through."

"Do it," Qin Jiang said with a nod. "Go in first, strip it of everything valuable. But don't damage the realm itself—I have uses for the shell."

"Yes, sir."

His report concluded, Black Dragon spoke up next. "Young Master, the person you wanted found—we've located him. We have people watching."

"Still in Dream Cloud City?"

"Still there," Black Dragon confirmed. "He's even set up a stall, doing fortune readings for people. Made quite a few friends over the past few days."

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. A Child of Destiny making friends—perfectly normal. And those friends were probably anything but ordinary.

"Let's go. Take me to Dream Cloud City for a look."

He leaped down from the ship, Black Dragon and Little Xu close behind. The ship was anchored off the Dream Cloud Sea—a short trip ashore to reach Dream Cloud City.

At the gates, the Immortal King enforcing the blockade spotted Qin Jiang and immediately rushed over. "Master, you're here."

"Mm." Qin Jiang gave a brief nod and waved his hand. "As you were. Keep the blockade."

"Yes, sir."

The Immortal King acknowledged the order and escorted Qin Jiang into the city before returning to his post.

Under Black Dragon's guidance, Qin Jiang soon arrived at a bustling marketplace. The most conspicuous feature was a stall surrounded by a thick crowd.

"Young Master, that's the one." Black Dragon pointed toward the circle of people. "He's probably doing readings again. Apparently he's quite accurate—people have been coming from all over to have their fortunes told."

"Let's go join the fun."

Qin Jiang smiled and headed over, curious to see what the Child of Destiny would divine for the great villain himself.

Black Dragon and Little Xu flanked him, shouldering through the crowd to clear a path. Anyone who objected received a casual slap to the face, and the boldness of it made the onlookers think twice about protesting.

In the crowd, the young Daoist looked up. Qin Jiang arrived at that exact moment and sat down across from him. Their eyes met.

The young Daoist went rigid. His heart lurched violently. In that instant, he felt his fate convulse—as if some invisible hand had seized its threads and twisted.

It was him.

Staring at Qin Jiang, the young Daoist knew with absolute certainty: the dragon that had appeared in Dream Cloud City was the man sitting before him. And the malice he'd sensed was directed squarely at him.

Worse still, in Qin Jiang's presence, he couldn't muster even a shred of defiance. It was like a mouse coming face to face with a cat.

Qin Jiang smiled faintly. Seeing the young man freeze, he could tell the fellow had sensed something. This one was no ordinary person—an heir to the Celestial Secrets tradition, capable of reading the heavens above and the hearts of men below. Practically omniscient.

Days ago, Qin Jiang had ordered Mengjin to seal Dream Cloud City precisely because he'd worried this one would divine the danger and bolt. Tracking him down afterward would have been a headache. Fortunately, he hadn't gotten away.

"Heh, sir, what would you like me to divine?" The young Daoist recovered himself and offered a strained smile.

The surrounding onlookers blinked in surprise. Over the past few days, they'd never seen Master Tianji display such a servile attitude. Even when facing disciples backed by Immortal Emperors, he'd maintained an air of calm detachment. Yet now, he was practically groveling.

Their gazes shifted to Qin Jiang. Just who was this man?
