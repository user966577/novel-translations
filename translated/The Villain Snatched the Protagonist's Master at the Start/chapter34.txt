Today, watching Qin Jiang casually produce a Great Emperor law and blood essence, her shock had surpassed even the Fourth Ancestor's. After all, she was the one who'd been at his side every single moment.

His every action, she'd witnessed.

She was certain—Qin Jiang had a secret. A big one.

So all things considered, being his woman was definitely not a losing proposition.

Beyond that, there was another reason. Because she'd been at his side constantly, whenever Qin Jiang was with other women...

She could hear everything.

The damned ring had zero soundproofing.

Subjected to those sounds day after day, a certain... longing had crept into her heart.

Qin Jiang studied the Fire Tribe woman:

"Come to think of it, I don't even know your name."

"Huo Qing'er."

"Qing'er. Nice name."

Qin Jiang murmured.

Huo Qing'er huffed and looked at him:

"Your turn. What do you want?"

Qin Jiang pondered, hesitated, then ventured:

"How about...

You try resisting a little?"

"You—"

Huo Qing'er's face flushed crimson:

"Have you always been this twisted?"

Qin Jiang scratched his head sheepishly:

"Not always. Sometimes it goes the other way too."

Huo Qing'er: "???"

'What are you even saying?'

She gaped, breathing hard. Talking to Qin Jiang required industrial-grade patience.

After composing herself:

"Just help me restore my body first."

"Can do."

Qin Jiang nodded and pulled out the Seven Beauties Painting:

"If you become one of the Seven Beauties, you'll not only get your body back but also advance to the Supreme Realm."

But Huo Qing'er recoiled, shaking her head:

"I don't want to be one of the Seven Beauties."

She'd been listening when Qin Jiang explained the painting to Yan Shiya. She refused to trade her freedom for a body—becoming his servant was out of the question.

Seeing her reaction, Qin Jiang didn't push:

"In that case, I'll refine a Body-Shaping Pill for you."

A Body-Shaping Pill could help a disembodied spirit reconstruct a physical form—a Supreme-level medicinal pill. Qin Jiang had recently received Supreme-level alchemy skills as a system reward.

"A Body-Shaping Pill? You'll make it?"

Huo Qing'er asked in disbelief.

Qin Jiang just smiled, pulling a pill furnace and the necessary ingredients from the system.

Under Huo Qing'er's astonished gaze, he settled cross-legged before the furnace, looking every bit the master alchemist.

"You really know alchemy?"

Huo Qing'er couldn't help asking.

Her Fire Tribe's greatest specialty was alchemy. Though their overall strength didn't match the ancient clans, their arts commanded deep respect from even the most powerful families.

"Alchemy? Child's play!"

Qin Jiang waved his arm, conjuring a flame that he fed into the furnace.

Huo Qing'er's eyes widened. 'He really can?'

Under her watchful gaze, Qin Jiang entered a state of complete focus. Despite this being his first time refining pills, he moved with the precision of a grandmaster, executing every step flawlessly.

Her expression shifted from intense concentration to shock, then to blank-faced amazement.

At this level... even in the Fire Tribe, you'd struggle to find three people this good.

After about two hours, Qin Jiang struck the furnace. A perfectly round pill shot out, which he snatched from the air:

"Done! Packing it in!"

He turned to Huo Qing'er. She still hadn't snapped out of her daze. The impact was enormous—even more staggering than when he'd produced the Great Emperor law.

"Hey, snap out of it."

Qin Jiang waved his hand in front of her face.

Huo Qing'er startled back to awareness, staring at him with undisguised reverence:

"Your alchemy... it's incredible!"

Noticing her expression, Qin Jiang blinked. Just demonstrating alchemy had transformed her this much?

There was truly zero challenge left. She was gazing at him like an adoring fangirl.

"Stop staring. I'll set you up somewhere to go into seclusion and restore your body."

He handed her the Body-Shaping Pill.

Huo Qing'er nodded eagerly, taking the pill, though her eyes remained glued to him.

"Ahem. Could you maybe tone it down?"

Qin Jiang coughed.

Her intensity was a bit much, even for him.

She nodded earnestly:

"Don't worry. Once the pill does its work, I'll have my body back soon..."

Her voice trailed off to a whisper, tinged with unmistakable anticipation.

Qin Jiang: "..."

He sighed inwardly. 'Any woman's coldness is just a mask for indifference. Show her someone she's truly drawn to, and she burns hotter than anyone.'

The casino had secure rooms. Qin Jiang led Huo Qing'er inside:

"Go into seclusion here. I'll have guards posted—no one will disturb you."

Huo Qing'er nodded:

"As soon as my body is restored, I'll come find you."

After settling Huo Qing'er, Qin Jiang spent some time with Yan Yun, then left Rose Casino.

On the street, Black Dragon spoke up from behind:

"Young Lord, someone's been following you."

"Oh?"

"It seems to be... the man from the dice game at Rose Casino."

Ye Xuan?

The idiot had actually come back?

But what for? Was he planning an assassination?

Should he just kill the fool?

But the leek hadn't been fully harvested yet. Killing him now was wasteful.

Then again, this particular leek was painfully stupid—nowhere near Xiao Fan's level.

At least Xiao Fan knew better than to provoke someone he couldn't beat. Ye Xuan just kept throwing himself at danger.

Speaking of Xiao Fan, Qin Jiang actually missed the guy.

'Sigh. Brother Xiao's face got ruined. I wonder if he'll pull through.'

He felt a twinge of sympathy.

"Young Lord, how should we handle this?"

Black Dragon asked.

Qin Jiang thought it over. Ye Xuan wasn't just a leek—he was his good friend's son.

"Don't kill him.

Capture him, seal his cultivation, then find some men with... particular tastes. Lock them in together."

Black Dragon's entire body shuddered. A chill crawled up his spine. 'That's... worse than killing him.'

"What are you standing there for? Want to join them?"

Qin Jiang glanced at him.

Black Dragon trembled violently:

"I'll get right on it!"

He fled, terrified of being drafted into the arrangement. He'd sooner die.

Watching Black Dragon carry out the order, Qin Jiang silently gave himself a thumbs-up for his own benevolence:

'I really am too kind.

Old Ye, your son owes me his life. Someday, you'll need to repay that debt on his behalf.'
