Xue Yue's icy refusal caught Nangong Yun off guard — he'd never seen her like this. Unwilling to give up, he stepped forward and reached for her hand. He'd always known she had feelings for him; he'd simply never reciprocated because he'd been pursuing Weiwei. But now that Weiwei was taken... for the sake of the alliance, he could make sacrifices. Even with his body, if necessary.

But Xue Yue pulled away, stepping back to avoid his touch. Her expression remained frozen. She remembered Weiwei mentioning that Qin Jiang had a severe possessive streak — as his woman, she shouldn't let any other man touch her. Even if they were just pretending, she should behave as if it were real.

"If there's nothing else, please leave. I'm tired."

Nangong Yun's hand hung in the air, his expression stiff. He scratched his head, tugged at his sleeve, rubbed his hands together — people always found things to fidget with when they were embarrassed. He opened his mouth to try again, but her coldness told him there was no point. 'Maybe she's just in a bad mood. She did get poisoned, after all. I'll try again in a few days.'

"I'll head out, then." He hesitated, then produced a pill. "This is an antidote pill. Take it."

He set it down and left. Xue Yue watched him go, her cold expression gradually softening. "Thank goodness for that jerk," she murmured. "Otherwise the Blood Tribe might really have been dragged down by Nangong Yun."

She eyed the antidote pill — a bottom-tier remedy, useless to a Supreme. Back in the Blood Tribe, she wouldn't have spared it a second glance. But the Anti-Huaxia Alliance was dirt poor. She'd even donated her own savings to the cause, and this was all Nangong Yun could manage in return. She crushed the pill with a slap and went inside, already looking forward to her next session with Qin Jiang.

Nangong Yun, rebuffed on both fronts, headed back to Weiwei's courtyard. The gate was sealed, the barrier up. He couldn't even get close. Day after day, and that man still hadn't stopped? Could his senior sister even take it?

His fists clenched in anguished sympathy. This time, he simply sat down outside the gate and resolved to wait.

Hours passed before the gate finally opened. He scrambled to his feet.

It was Weiwei — but Qin Jiang was right behind her, arm around her waist. He raised an eyebrow at Nangong Yun. "Something you need?"

Nangong Yun ignored him, staring at his senior sister. Fatigue was etched into her face, and the way she walked — slightly bowlegged — told him everything he feared. His eyes filled with pain. 'That brute. He probably doesn't even let her sit down.'

His fists shook with the urge to fight, but he couldn't ruin everything his senior sister had sacrificed. 'Endure! She's doing this for me. Someday I'll tear down Huaxia, and when I do, I'll marry her.'

Forcing a smile, he looked at Qin Jiang. "Senior brother, there's something I'd like to ask of you."

Qin Jiang noted with inner amusement that the Child of Destiny really knew how to swallow his pride. 'Once I've squeezed every Villain Point out of you, I won't leave you alive. Complete soul destruction — no second chances.'

Outwardly, he beamed like a gracious nobleman. "What is it?"

"Senior brother, you know my two brothers were killed. As the alliance's leader, I owe them vengeance, but I have no idea who the killer is..."

Qin Jiang nearly laughed. The man had come to the murderer asking the murderer to find the murderer. Swallowing his amusement, he asked, "You want me to look into it?"

"Yes! With your connections, something like this should be easy."

"It is." He nodded. Nangong Yun's eyes lit up. "Then—"

"Leave it to me."

"Thank y—"

"However." Nangong Yun's gratitude died in his throat. "I have one condition. Until I've gotten results, stop coming around to bother us. Weiwei hates being interrupted mid-session."

He dipped his head and kissed Weiwei's lips. She blushed, swatted his chest, and scolded, "Stop making things up!"
