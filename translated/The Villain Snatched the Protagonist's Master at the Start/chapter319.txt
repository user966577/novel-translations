Lian'er and Little Red resumed training. Qin Jiang left them to it.

Besides those two, plenty of other women were cultivating in the Space-Time Temple, pushing themselves to keep pace with him. Whenever he was away, they devoted every waking moment to cultivation.

He swept his arm, and a constellation of light orbs appeared before him — each representing a woman in seclusion.

Since returning, he'd already given gifts and immortal-path laws to the women who'd been out of seclusion. Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er had both received immortal-path laws. After some quality time with Qin Jiang, they'd headed straight into closed cultivation, vowing not to emerge until they'd reached the immortal path.

Yan Yun had received one too, though the girl had a lazy streak a mile wide. She was still only at the Saint Realm. But that was Qin Jiang's doing — he'd spoiled her rotten. Lazy was lazy. He had more than enough resources to brute-force her to immortality. Besides, he'd cultivated the Yin-Yang Dao now. Some joint cultivation practice would count as training for her too.

He'd given her one of the system's attributeless laws, convertible to any element. With a little guidance, he could steer her toward the Yin-Yang Law — complementary to his own. They'd amplify each other, and he could essentially carry her.

Aside from those three, the 360 Songstresses had their own unique cultivation methods. In the month since his return, he'd spent most of his time among them. Their cultivation had surged — every one of them had reached at least the Supreme Realm, with the strongest at Ancient Emperor. Combined, they could challenge a Human Immortal. Yet even that wasn't enough to match Qin Jiang alone.

Now he examined the remaining light orbs. Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er were mid-seclusion — couldn't disturb them. Yan Yun had received her law but hadn't even bothered entering the temple yet. Chen Ningbing already had her law and was close to breaking through to the immortal path — shouldn't be much longer.

Zi Fu had also just entered seclusion. She'd had her law for a while but had chosen to stay by Qin Jiang's side rather than cultivate. Only now was she getting serious about it. As a natural genius — one of the best among his women — her breakthrough shouldn't take long.

Mo Mo had gone into seclusion the moment they'd returned. She was aiming for True Immortal. Between the demonic energy she'd absorbed during the Azure Cloud Heaven chaos and a True Immortal-grade demon pill Qin Jiang had bought from the system, she was confident in the attempt.

The rest of the women who'd traveled with him weren't in seclusion. Their cultivation wasn't at a stage where short-term gains were possible. Instead, they were helping him plan the new faction.

He scanned the orbs one by one, then stopped at Ye Ling'er.

She was outwardly delicate, but underneath, steel. Despite her fragile appearance, she was tenacious beyond measure. According to Yan Yun, Ye Ling'er hadn't left the Space-Time Temple once since he'd departed. Not a single time.

He'd expected her to be around the early Supreme Realm. But she'd reached Seventh Tribulation Supreme. Impressive.

He teleported to her cultivation chamber.

She wasn't truly in closed seclusion — just ordinary training, but relentlessly so. Every moment of Qin Jiang's absence had been poured into practice.

He walked up and dispersed the ambient spiritual energy with a wave. Ye Ling'er's brow furrowed, and moments later, her eyes opened. Before she could react, arms wrapped around her.

The familiar scent told her everything. Joy lit up her face.

"Qin Jiang~"

She hugged him back, beaming.

"Ling'er's amazing. It hasn't been long, and you're almost at Great Emperor."

He praised her warmly, though inwardly, he sighed. Ye Ling'er had been the first woman at his side. But as the gap in their cultivation widened, her time with him had grown shorter. Even when they were together, other women were usually present.

He couldn't remember the last time they'd been alone.

Guilt flickered in his eyes. He brushed the hair from her forehead and kissed between her brows. "Ling'er. Did you miss me?"

"Mm~" She ducked into his chest, cheeks pink. She'd always been shy — especially with others around.

In the beginning, she'd tried to wait for private moments with him. But gradually, she'd realized those moments were achingly rare. So she'd mustered her courage and joined the group. It felt awkward every time, but for Qin Jiang, she endured.

She could tell he appreciated it. And Chen Ningbing's gentle encouragement had helped her adapt.

Now, looking up at his face, she smiled. They were alone again. She didn't know how long it would last, but she'd treasure every second.

"Did you really miss me?" he asked again.

"Hm?" Confusion. Wasn't that obvious?

He leaned close, lips at her ear. "If you missed me, shouldn't you show me?"

"Ah?" Her face flushed crimson. She knew exactly what he meant. Her gaze drifted downward. Her hand reached out, and she swallowed.

It had been so long.

One arm circled his neck. The other found the key and turned it.

Her eyes shimmered. Soft lips parted.

"Husband... Ling'er missed you so much~"

"I missed you too."

He kissed her. After a long time, he pulled back and rearranged her slightly disheveled hair, tying it into twin tails.

His eyes burned. A grin tugged at his lips.

"Ling'er. Show me how your water-attribute technique has progressed."

"Okay~"

She rose on tiptoe, pressed a kiss to his lips, then turned around.

She knew what the twin tails meant.
