The interior was laid out similarly to before, but everything was brand new. Not a single familiar item remained.

Xue Yue looked around. The place felt utterly foreign. The chief had followed her in, guilt written across his face. In his panic to distance the tribe from her, he'd destroyed everything so thoroughly that even a reconstruction couldn't recreate the feeling of home.

"This is my house?" she asked. Renovation shouldn't change things this much.

"It's been a while since you've been here," he said with a forced laugh. "Things just feel unfamiliar."

She shook her head. Rebuilt was rebuilt. No point dwelling on it—nothing truly irreplaceable had been lost. The new place was fine. What she'd really come home for was to see her parents. Her father was here, looking the same as always. But...

"Where's my mother?"

She scanned the crowd. Nearly every Blood Tribe leader was present, but her mother was nowhere in sight.

The chief's face went rigid. After the Anti-Huaxia Alliance incident, everything connected to Xue Yue had been purged. Her mother hadn't been eliminated, but she had been placed under house arrest. She'd only recently been released, and she'd been furious with the tribe ever since—harboring real resentment over what they'd done to her daughter. Now that Xue Yue was back and seemingly unbothered, things were manageable. But the moment she saw her mother, everything could change.

And the chief didn't dare stop her. Not with Qin Jiang standing right there, and multiple auras locked onto him at all times, each one as powerful as his own. One wrong move and the Blood Tribe would face a devastating response.

"What's wrong? Did something happen to her?"

"She's fine," the chief said quickly. "Perfectly fine."

He started to make an excuse, but Qin Jiang's gaze stopped him cold. He swallowed whatever he'd planned to say and managed, "She misses you too. Go see her."

"Mm!"

Xue Yue grabbed Qin Jiang's arm. "Let's go together, husband~"

They left the Blood Tribe leaders standing there, exchanging uneasy glances.

The couple arrived at a quiet, secluded courtyard. "My mother likes peace and quiet," Xue Yue explained. "I used to come stay with her often."

She knocked. The door opened to reveal a striking woman—cold beauty, mature features, bearing a seven or eight tenths resemblance to Xue Yue, but taller and more curvaceous.

"Mother!" Xue Yue's face split into a grin as she launched herself forward.

Murong Qing's cold expression melted the instant she saw her daughter. Shock, then joy—she caught Xue Yue in her arms on reflex, standing frozen for a moment before it registered.

"Yueyue!"

"Hehe, did you miss me?" Xue Yue nuzzled into her mother's embrace. They were clearly close.

"Yueyue." Murong Qing's eyes glistened. She held her daughter tight. She'd spent every day since the expulsion sick with worry. First the Alliance, then being locked up, unable to help. When she'd finally heard that Xue Yue was with Qin Jiang, the fear for her safety had eased. But she'd never stopped wanting to see her daughter with her own eyes.

They held each other for a long time before Murong Qing pulled back, wiping her tears. "I'm just glad you're safe."

"What could possibly happen to me? I've been fine the whole time." Xue Yue dried her mother's tears. "Why are you crying? Did something happen?"

The signs had been accumulating—the tribe's strange atmosphere, the chief's evasiveness, and now her mother's tears. Xue Yue wasn't stupid.

Murong Qing composed herself and managed a smile. "I'm fine."

Then she noticed Qin Jiang. The legendary lord of Huaxia, the "Great Lecher." But the man before her looked perfectly respectable—handsome, composed. Rumors were clearly unreliable.

"Mother, this is my husband, Qin Jiang."

"I've heard much about you." Murong Qing nodded.

Qin Jiang stepped forward with a smile. "Pleasure to meet you."

He extended his hand. Murong Qing hesitated briefly, then accepted with a polite shake. Her first impression was favorable. More importantly, he was her daughter's husband—a man of unparalleled status. With him around, Xue Yue would never be mistreated. Even the Blood Tribe had to defer to her now.
