The next day, a piece of news rocked the Divine Dragon Empire. Straight from the palace, with no preamble or buildup—just a cold, curt decree.

The Dragon Emperor had named the Third Princess as his heir.

No one saw it coming.

At the Third Princess's mansion, the announcement arrived before Long Xin'er had even woken up. Qin Jiang received it on her behalf.

Reading the Dragon Emperor's edict, he chuckled. "Got to hand it to Long Aotian—the man's decisive."

This did mean Long Yu was about to have a very bad day.

Meanwhile, the system's reward for altering the plot arrived on cue. Qin Jiang skimmed it and promptly forgot about it. His standards had risen—only immortal-grade treasures merited a second look.

Unfortunately, the odds of pulling something immortal-grade were painfully low. Robbing a Child of Destiny outright was more efficient—their core fortunes were generally on par with immortal treasures.

"Probably because these Children of Destiny are too low-level," he mused. Each one he encountered was stronger than the last, but relative to him, they were all still too weak to offer any real challenge.

With that thought, he produced the Seven Beauties Painting and tried to contact Jian Yao. Still no response—she likely needed more time. Until she broke through, he wouldn't rashly ascend to the Nine Heavens.

"Is there a way to speed things up?"

He murmured to himself, eyes glinting. The Myriad Realms Tower had taught him something: inside, time flowed at a different rate.

He flipped his hand, and a collection of Time-Space Disc fragments appeared.

"Given the name, these should be able to alter the flow of time. But they're all fragments. Can they even work?"

Scratching his head, he tentatively channeled spiritual energy into them. Nothing. He tried Primordial Spirit Power. Still nothing.

He kept experimenting.

When he pulled out the Immortal King Seal, the Time-Space Disc fragments erupted into violent vibration. Every shard shot toward the Seal, and before Qin Jiang's astonished eyes, they began fusing together.

Moments later, roughly half a Time-Space Disc floated before him. The Immortal King Seal's energy had diminished slightly.

"So these fragments are picky eaters—immortal energy only?"

At the same time, he sensed a faint connection forming between himself and the disc. He tried manipulating it and got a response. Encouraged, he probed deeper, attempting to control time itself. After some effort, he stiffened. A flash of light swept across the disc's surface.

"It actually worked!"

Elation surged through him. For that one instant, he'd distinctly felt time freeze—but the cost was staggering. That single moment had drained half his strength.

He studied the half-formed disc, brow furrowing. It could indeed manipulate time, but the energy consumption was...

"What about the tower energy?"

He still had substantial reserves of the energy he'd siphoned from the Myriad Realms Tower, sealed within his body. High-grade stuff, presumably.

He fed some into the disc. It lit up immediately, and the surrounding space warped.

His eyes gleamed. As expected—top-tier energy. It powered the disc with barely any drain.

He practiced until he had the controls down, then enveloped the Seven Beauties Painting in temporal energy and tossed it into his system space.

Set it and forget it.

Across the city, Long Yu had received the news from the palace. His expression was thunderous, his eyes wild with fury.

From birth, the Dragon Emperor had told him he would be the empire's heir. He'd devoted everything to that end. Before Qin Jiang's arrival, his path had been smooth and certain. Everyone had accepted him as the future emperor.

And then Qin Jiang came. First his grandmother—killed because of Qin Jiang. Then the Dragon Nest, where fortune after fortune was snatched from his grasp. And now this.

Long Yu had no doubt: the Dragon Emperor's decision was entirely because of Qin Jiang.

"Damn it all!"

The rage was uncontainable. A person who'd never known failure, suddenly thrown from the pinnacle—his psyche was warping under the strain.

Just then, a cold laugh echoed from the void:

"Well, well. If it isn't the Ninth Prince—the Divine Dragon Empire's heir..."

Long Yu's eyes went cold. "Show yourself!"

Another chuckle drifted through the air, laced with mockery. A figure cloaked entirely in black materialized before him.

"Does the Ninth Prince remember an old acquaintance?"

Long Yu's brow creased as he stared at the black-robed figure. "Demon Lord."

"The prince has an excellent memory. Though compared to our last meeting, you seem to have fallen on... harder times. Grandmother dead, inheritance stripped..."

"Silence!"

Long Yu's roar cut through the air. Every word was a knife in an open wound. Seeing his rage, the Demon Lord simply shrugged, unfazed.

Long Yu drew a deep breath to steady himself. His voice went frigid. "What are you doing at my estate?"

"Heh. Our Demon Hall's intentions should be quite familiar to the Ninth Prince by now..."

"You still want me as your Holy Son?"

Long Yu scoffed. The Demon Hall had been a cancer on the Divine Dragon Empire for years. Over a decade ago, when Long Yu was still a child, this same Demon Lord had approached him, trying to seduce him into betraying the empire and joining the Demon Hall as their Holy Son.

But the Demon Lord had underestimated him. Not only had the ploy failed, Long Yu had turned the tables and nearly trapped the Demon Lord within the Imperial City.

Since then, they'd clashed multiple times. The Demon Lord always came out worse. If Long Yu ever grew to his full potential, the Demon Lord was as good as dead. But now...

The Demon Hall's intelligence network had picked up on Long Yu's situation. They saw an opening—perhaps the perfect moment to recruit a fallen prince.

So the Demon Lord had come again.

Red light pulsed beneath his black hood. Long Yu's frown deepened, and he snorted. "Demon Lord, your little tricks couldn't touch me a decade ago. They're even more useless now."

The red glow receded.

The Demon Lord studied Long Yu and spoke: "This time, as before, we hope the Ninth Prince will join the Demon Hall as our Holy Son. Given the prince's current... circumstances, might you be willing?"

"Hmph!"

Long Yu's contempt was sharp. The bastard kept rubbing salt in the wound—reminding him at every turn that he was no longer the empire's heir.
