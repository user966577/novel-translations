Outside the courtyard, Qin Lian'er had her ear pressed against the door, eavesdropping on the conversation within, her little face scrunched up in confusion.

"What does all that mean?"

She was completely lost.

Before long, a series of sounds drifted out...

Qin Lian'er blinked, her face full of curiosity.

Were they consummating the marriage?

Big brother sure was efficient—moved right in for the kill!

And so, Qin Lian'er stationed herself at the door, standing guard to make sure nobody disturbed Qin Jiang.

Several hours passed.

"Waaah, you liar! You promised you wouldn't touch me there, waaah~"

Bai Susu was sobbing so hard she could barely catch her breath. The look she gave Qin Jiang was full of shame and fury.

She was brimming with grievance.

But what was done was done—none of it mattered anymore.

She sniffled softly, tears falling without end, growing more and more aggrieved the more she thought about it.

She'd already done so much, and in the end, she still couldn't escape. If she'd known it would come to this, she might as well have just...

Her face was flushed crimson, her emotions in turmoil.

"Alright, I did this to help you."

Qin Jiang looked at Bai Susu, her beautiful eyes red and swollen from crying. Instinctively, he reached out to wipe away her tears.

Bai Susu didn't dodge.

What was done was done, what shouldn't have been done was also done. She couldn't be bothered with propriety anymore.

She sniffled once, then glared at Qin Jiang.

Help me? Who helps someone like that?

"I had people investigate you. The daughter of the Holy Sword Sect Master—quite the distinguished identity."

On the Heavenly Mystery Continent, the ancient clans were undoubtedly the most powerful, but apart from them, there were several hegemonic forces that didn't exist in the form of families.

The Holy Sword Sect was one such power.

It was also the Heavenly Mystery Continent's holy land of swordsmanship—a lineage just as ancient and time-honored, with tens of thousands of years of heritage and depth no less than the ancient clans.

And Bai Susu was the Holy Sword Sect Master's daughter.

Her status within the sect was likely equivalent to Qin Lian'er's within the Qin family.

Though Qin Jiang was somewhat puzzled—how had Lian'er managed to capture her?

Bai Susu, for her part, wasn't particularly surprised by his words. With the Qin family's resources, investigating her identity would be trivially easy.

Seeing that she wasn't responding, Qin Jiang continued:

"I also know that you have a senior brother. Currently, he should be the Holy Sword Sect's Holy Son. Heh, I must say, your sect hides things quite deep. An Innate Sword Body—tsk, if he were to die young, I wonder if the Holy Sword Sect would be heartbroken..."

"You—"

Bai Susu's body went rigid, her expression suddenly tense.

"What are you planning to do?"

"Oh? That eager to protect him? Seems like this senior brother of yours is the one you love."

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

Bai Susu's face went white. Under normal circumstances, hearing someone tease her like this would only make her blush. But right now, Qin Jiang's voice was laced with killing intent.

And given what had just happened between them...

She swallowed the bitterness in her heart and summoned her courage to face Qin Jiang.

"My senior brother is the Holy Son of the Holy Sword Sect—the hope of the entire sect! If you dare touch him, the Holy Sword Sect will throw everything it has into a war against your Qin family!"

"Are you threatening me?"

"Hmph, I'm stating facts."

Bai Susu snorted coldly.

Qin Jiang nodded, stroking his chin thoughtfully.

"Let me ask you something... When I send you back to the sect, if you happen to be carrying my child, do you think your father would still throw everything into a war over your senior brother?"

Bai Susu's eyes went wide. What kind of twisted logic was this?

And getting her pregnant?

She couldn't help but shudder. The way she looked at Qin Jiang was filled with genuine fear now.

If Qin Jiang really did what he described, knowing her father's temperament, he might actually...

Besides, her earlier words had been nothing but a bluff. Even without her in the picture, if the Qin family truly killed her senior brother, the odds of the Holy Sword Sect waging all-out war for revenge were slim.

Her face grew paler and paler, a sense of sorrow welling up inside her. Who could have imagined that the daughter of the Holy Sword Sect Master would one day fall to such a state?

Just then, Qin Jiang's gentle voice fell into her ear.

"Have you ever considered that there might be something wrong with your senior brother?"

"Hm?"

Bai Susu looked up sharply.

Qin Jiang gave a faint smile.

"From what I know, three years ago, your senior brother was just an outer sect menial disciple—completely unremarkable. It wasn't until the inner sect examination that he suddenly revealed his talent and caught the attention of the sect's leadership. Later, they discovered he possessed an Innate Sword Body. Your father took him as a personal disciple and appointed him Holy Son. But... didn't any of you find his transformation a bit too sudden? And the Holy Sword Sect tests every disciple's physique upon entry. How does someone with an Innate Sword Body get overlooked during admission? Doesn't that strike you as suspicious?"

As Bai Susu listened, her alarm grew. Qin Jiang knew so much about the Holy Sword Sect and about her senior brother—there had to be a mole in the sect's upper ranks.

As for Qin Jiang's doubts, she'd genuinely never considered them. Within the Holy Sword Sect, she'd only ever seen her senior brother's brilliant side. As for his past...

She'd subconsciously overlooked it.

As for her father—he may have had his suspicions, but a disciple with an Innate Sword Body was not one he could afford to let go.

She looked at Qin Jiang, uncertainty swirling in her beautiful eyes. Could there really be something wrong with her senior brother?

"What did you find?"

The question left her lips before she could stop it. The moment she said it, she regretted it—she'd just chosen to trust this scoundrel over her own senior brother.

A faint smirk tugged at the corner of Qin Jiang's mouth.

"Based on the cultivation methods he uses, his martial techniques, his personal habits—everything about him resembles someone from ten thousand years ago."

"A reincarnated powerhouse?"

Bai Susu's eyes went wide.

Qin Jiang shook his head.

"More likely... possession."

"Impossible!"

Bai Susu rejected the idea outright. She couldn't accept that the man she loved was actually some ancient monster wearing a stolen body.

But thinking it over carefully, her senior brother's transformation really had been too dramatic.

Starting from three years ago, it was like he'd become an entirely different person.

A chill ran through her body. Imagining that behind her senior brother's youthful face lurked an ancient monster, goosebumps erupted across her skin.

A wave of revulsion washed over her.

"The Qin family still has a portrait of that man from ten thousand years ago. Would you like to... see what he really looks like?"

Qin Jiang spoke up, a teasing grin on his face.
