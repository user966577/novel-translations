At Li Yang's insistence, Ye Xuan and Zhao Juncai entered the priority lane. Li Yang returned to the back of the queue and waited patiently. For once, he didn't feel aggrieved — in fact, he was almost happy. He could feel Ye Xuan's care for him.

True, she'd gone ahead to collect her resources first, but her willingness to fight for him had moved him deeply. Meeting a woman like this was a blessing across three lifetimes.

Before long, Ye Xuan and Zhao Juncai emerged. Based on Zhao Juncai's elated expression, the academy's resource packages were clearly generous. They spotted Li Yang in line and walked over. His portion of the queue still stretched far ahead — at least another hour's wait.

"Got your resources?" Li Yang asked with a smile.

Ye Xuan nodded. "The academy is very generous. A thousand top-grade spirit stones alone, plus a selection of ten spiritual plants and medicinal pills. And that's just one month's allotment."

"That much?"

Zhao Juncai added, "That's the elite package. Remedial students probably get less."

Li Yang understood — the tiers existed for a reason. But if elites received this much, remedials shouldn't get too little, right? He felt a twinge of anticipation.

Ye Xuan glanced at the line and clearly didn't want to wait around. Neither did Zhao Juncai, whose eyes flickered with an idea. "Brother Li Yang, my room still needs tidying up. Why don't you stay here while Ye Xuan and I go get it ready for you? Once you've collected your resources, you can head straight over."

"Well... all right."

He'd already declined to make Ye Xuan wait once. Now that she'd collected her resources and was offering to prepare his room, he certainly couldn't ask her to stand around in line.

"Shall we head back, Miss Ye Xuan?" Zhao Juncai smiled.

"Mm."

Ye Xuan nodded. This Zhao Juncai did have some awareness, at least. She could throw him a small reward for that. She waved at Li Yang with a bright smile. "We'll go on ahead!"

"Sure. I'll come find you once I have my resources."

Li Yang waved back and continued waiting while Ye Xuan and Zhao Juncai returned to the elite quarter — heading straight to Zhao Juncai's dorm. Courtyard Thirty wasn't as prestigious as Ye Xuan's Courtyard One, but it was still elite housing and perfectly comfortable. More than enough room for Li Yang.

"Let's get a room ready for Brother Li Yang," Zhao Juncai said.

Ye Xuan agreed, and together they began a simple tidy-up. In truth, the newly built dorms were essentially move-in ready — there was nothing to clean. But Zhao Juncai made a show of staying busy to maximize his time with Ye Xuan, and in the close quarters, physical contact was inevitable.

Ye Xuan didn't resist. She'd been with more men than she could count on both hands — a little skin contact was nothing.

Zhao Juncai's spirits soared. Seeing no objection, he grew bolder, engineering one bump after another. Ye Xuan played along, acting coy — a few breathless protests, a half-hearted shove, an expression that said no while her body said maybe. Zhao Juncai swallowed hard.

Ye Xuan's eyes flickered. She sensed Li Yang's aura approaching fast. Her mission was to toy with him — why not give him a little blow?

Zhao Juncai was too fixated on Ye Xuan to notice Li Yang's approach. As Li Yang drew near, Ye Xuan's eyes flashed. She deliberately stumbled, toppling into Zhao Juncai's arms. He froze — a beauty in his embrace — then instinctively held her tight.

"Hey! What are you doing?" she cried out, pressing her small hands against his chest in feigned resistance. But there was no real force behind it.

Zhao Juncai's pulse hammered. The soft body in his arms nearly shattered his reason. "Miss Ye Xuan, I want to..."

"Want to what?"

"I want... to kiss you. Just once."

"No!" She shook her head, pushing harder. "No — let go of me!"

"Just one kiss, please..." He trembled but wouldn't release her. An opportunity like this — he'd never forgive himself for wasting it.

"Let me go!" Her voice rose. Panic spread across her face. "Zhao Juncai, don't do this!"

"Stop resisting. I really like you."

"No. Li Yang will be back any moment."

"Li Yang?" Zhao Juncai paused, then pulled her closer. "You don't actually care about Li Yang, do you? Tell you what — if you won't let me kiss you, he can forget about living here."

"You—"

Just then, the door burst open. Li Yang stood in the frame, face contorted with rage. "Zhao Juncai! Let go of her!"

He charged forward, but Zhao Juncai swatted him away with a single blow. In the same instant, Ye Xuan wrenched free and appeared at Li Yang's side in a flash.

"Li Yang, are you okay?" Tears glistened in her eyes, her face a mask of worry.

Li Yang wiped the blood from his mouth and shook his head. "I'm fine. Did that animal hurt you?"

His heart ached for her. He'd heard everything from outside — Zhao Juncai forcing himself on Ye Xuan, using Li Yang himself as leverage when she refused.

Zhao Juncai's expression twisted with regret. Why had he been so impulsive? He'd been making progress, and now it was all ruined. What he regretted even more was his hesitation — he should have just kissed her.

His eyes darted to Ye Xuan, and he swallowed, remembering her alluring posture. He couldn't help stepping forward...

"What do you think you're doing?" Li Yang snarled.

He struggled to his feet and planted himself between Ye Xuan and Zhao Juncai. The latter glared with open contempt — until Ye Xuan unleashed her Great Emperor aura.

Zhao Juncai's blood ran cold.

By force? He wasn't strong enough.
