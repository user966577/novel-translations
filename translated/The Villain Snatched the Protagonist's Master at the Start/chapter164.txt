The Pill Emperor's gaze lingered on Chen Changsheng. Qin Jiang had told her this man was likely her master.

But his face was dark and sullen—nothing like the warm, gentle teacher she remembered.

She shook her head and murmured to Qin Jiang: "That Chen Changsheng... he's probably not my master."

"Oh?"

"My master was always kind. But that man looks perpetually gloomy. And—" She squinted. "He keeps staring at us. His expression doesn't look friendly at all. Is he an enemy of yours?"

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. He shot Chen Changsheng a glance. The man was probably stewing over how close Qin Jiang was to the Pill Emperor.

"Never met him. Maybe he's got a grudge against the Heavenly Pill Palace."

The Pill Emperor frowned. That wasn't impossible—any organization this large was bound to have enemies.

"Anyway, let's get started," Qin Jiang said.

The Pill Emperor nodded and swept her gaze across the plaza one final time, searching for any trace of her old master. Nothing.

With a resigned sigh, she announced the rules and prizes, then formally declared the Grand Refinement open.

The hundred alchemists didn't rush. Each one fine-tuned their mental state to perfection before beginning.

Qin Jiang and the Pill Emperor sat together on the platform, exchanging quiet words. He teased her from time to time, making her blush and shoot him looks of feigned annoyance.

"Qin Jiang, none of these people feel like my master. Do you think he was eliminated?"

"Could be," Qin Jiang agreed with a smile, swallowing a laugh. Chen Changsheng had ten lifetimes under his belt—even without being a Child of Destiny, he wouldn't have been knocked out so easily.

"Maybe."

"I'm starting to think I should just stop looking." The Pill Emperor sighed. It had been ten thousand years. She was tired. And with Qin Jiang at her side, the motivation to search had evaporated.

Sensing her mood, Qin Jiang took her hand.

The Pill Emperor startled—they were in public. She glanced around nervously. From their vantage point, only the elders could see them. And every single elder had their eyes fixed rigidly on the competition below, noses pointed at their navels.

She was fairly certain they'd noticed. They just didn't dare look.

Qin Jiang leaned in close and whispered: "If you don't want to search anymore, then don't. From now on, you've got me."

His warm breath on her ear made her cheeks flush. She wanted to pull away, but the sensation was too pleasant to resist.

Down in the Myriad Pill Plaza, Chen Changsheng had been watching the platform the entire time.

The moment he saw them like that, his already dark expression twisted into something uglier. He'd started his refinement, but with his emotions spiraling out of control, his flame surged erratically.

The batch was ruined.

And it wasn't just Chen Changsheng who'd noticed the couple's intimacy. Many spectators had caught it too. But unlike Chen Changsheng, they simply felt awe, envy, and perhaps a tiny pinch of jealousy.

They knew the Pill Emperor was out of their league. Seeing her with someone was surprising, sure—but not devastating.

Not the way it was for Chen Changsheng.
