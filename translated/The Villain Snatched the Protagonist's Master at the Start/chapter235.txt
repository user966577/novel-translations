Ning Xue'er waved dismissively, utterly disinterested. A mere Supreme? She didn't have time to play house—unless he happened to be as handsome as Qin Jiang, in which case she'd consider it.

But there probably wasn't another one like that in all of Azure Cloud Heaven. Qing Chan had gotten the jump on her.

A twinge of regret flickered through Ning Xue'er, though she consoled herself: Qing Chan was older, having spent hundreds of thousands of years alone. She herself had only endured a few tens of thousands. She could still hold out.

Hearing her refusal, Lin Lin pouted. "You won't even go take a look, Palace Master?"

She'd wanted to watch the show.

Ning Xue'er shook her head, but then Linglong spoke up. "Is that a pill in the vial?"

"Mm, it's some kind of pill."

Linglong took the vial, opened it, and tipped the pill into her palm. A rich, potent fragrance wafted out immediately.

"Oh?" Ning Xue'er raised an eyebrow. That was actually rather impressive.

The other women gathered around. "What kind of pill is it?"

"An Ancient Emperor Pill." Linglong looked surprised. "I didn't expect a mere Supreme to be able to produce something like this."

She explained its effects: a Great Emperor could use it to rapidly break through to Ancient Emperor, and an Ancient Emperor might even touch the threshold of the immortal path.

The women shook their heads. All the gawkers aside, Ning Xue'er and the palace leadership were Human Immortal-level at minimum. An Ancient Emperor Pill was useless to them.

"And here I thought it was something special." Ning Xue'er curled her lip and lost interest.

Linglong smiled. "A Supreme who can produce an Ancient Emperor Pill must have an extraordinary background—and he's quite generous. Xue'er, are you sure you don't want to at least see him?"

"Yeah, yeah, go take a look!" Lin Lin chimed in eagerly.

The other disciples joined in, and Ning Xue'er looked around at their expectant faces. She hesitated, then sighed.

"Fine. Let's go see."

Not like she had anything better to do. Might as well find some entertainment.

Outside the palace, the crowd had grown massive—word had spread that someone was courting the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's Palace Master, and people had flocked over to watch.

Chen Changsheng stood outside the Matchmaking Temple, ignoring the whispers and pointed fingers. Ten lifetimes of reincarnation had tempered his composure well. Mockery was nothing. A man with grand ambitions couldn't afford to let petty ridicule shake his resolve.

He waited with a calm smile.

Finally—

"The Palace Master is coming!"

Every eye turned to the palace gates. Chen Changsheng looked too.

Ning Xue'er emerged, radiant as a painting, stunning beyond words. A smile tugged at his lips. A woman of this caliber was a worthy match.

But the smile froze before it could spread. Behind Ning Xue'er, he spotted a line of painfully familiar figures.

'What are they doing here?'

A chill of foreboding ran through him. Had Qin Jiang beaten him here too?

"Palace Master, that's him!" Lin Lin pointed at Chen Changsheng, whose expression had gone rigid.

Ning Xue'er glanced over, appraising him briefly. Nothing stirred in her. Just an ordinary-looking man.

Jian Yao and the others recognized Chen Changsheng instantly. They all knew Qin Jiang was keeping close tabs on him. They exchanged a look. What a coincidence—was this fool actually trying to poach what was already Qin Jiang's?

A bit above his pay grade.

Jian Yao sent a private message to Ning Xue'er: "This man has a grudge against Qin Jiang."

"Oh?" Ning Xue'er turned, curiosity in her eyes. A Supreme who had a grudge against Qin Jiang? She'd forgotten that Qin Jiang was also a Supreme.

"You don't know who he is?" Jian Yao was surprised. "Didn't you investigate Qin Jiang? Back at the Heavenly Pill Palace, this man tried to help the Immortal that Qin Jiang killed."

"Ah, him?" Ning Xue'er nodded. The intelligence had mentioned someone who'd tried to side with the Ghost Immortal, only to get beaten senseless and tossed out of Pill City. A minor character no one had paid attention to.

Yet here he was in the Central Regions, sending her gifts.

"Should I kill him?"

"No," Jian Yao replied. "Qin Jiang says to keep him alive—he's still useful. But feel free to mess with him. Just don't let him die."

Their telepathic exchange went unnoticed by the crowd, who waited eagerly for Ning Xue'er's response. Chen Changsheng's face darkened. Unless he was very much mistaken, his plan was about to fail.

"Mess with him?" Ning Xue'er murmured. She glanced around—quite a large audience.

She turned to Chen Changsheng. "What's your name?"

"Chen Changsheng." He took a deep breath. All he could do now was take it one step at a time.

"Chen Changsheng..." Ning Xue'er tapped her forehead, then brightened with recognition. "I remember now. At the Heavenly Pill Palace's assembly not long ago—weren't you the one who got thrashed in front of the entire audience during the final round?"

"..."

Chen Changsheng's face went black. He could ignore mockery from nobodies—they were beneath him. But Ning Xue'er's jab stung, especially delivered in public, ripping open old wounds.

The crowd buzzed with whispers. Quite a few had heard about the Myriad Pill Assembly, and they zeroed in on Chen Changsheng.

"I heard about that too—some clown at the Assembly tried to suck up to the Ghost Immortal, and after the Ghost Immortal got killed, the clown got the beating of his life."

"Hey, I was actually there! I thought he looked familiar. I still have the recording—this guy's face was swollen up like a pig's head. Give me a second, I'll find it."

"Hurry up, let's all have a laugh!"

Moments later, a projection materialized in the air—a recording from the Myriad Pill Assembly, featuring a face beaten beyond recognition. The crowd compared it to Chen Changsheng's current appearance. The resemblance was unmistakable.

And the state he'd been in... truly pitiful.
