The Puppet Sect was regarded as a symbol of evil. Whenever an heir surfaced, endless pursuit and slaughter followed.

Chu Hanyan stared at Qin Jiang, tense with fear. Her parents had been Puppet Sect heirs. After their deaths, they'd passed down the art of puppet mastery to her, along with the puppets they'd controlled. Over the years, she'd learned to wield those puppets, and it was only through them that she'd survived the many dangers she'd faced. But she couldn't use them freely—her identity as a Puppet Sect heir meant that anyone who witnessed her puppets had to die.

Yet somehow, word had still leaked. Qin Jiang knew who she was.

A wave of resignation washed over her. She looked at him. "If you're going to kill me, then kill me. But my brother has nothing to do with the Puppet Sect. Please spare him."

"Who said anything about killing you?" Qin Jiang waved dismissively. "Other factions fear the Puppet Sect because they're afraid you'll rebuild and come for revenge. But the Qin family? Even at the Puppet Sect's peak, you wouldn't have posed a threat. So why would I bother killing you?"

Chu Hanyan fell silent. His words were insulting to the Puppet Sect, but they were also true. Besides, she had no attachment to the Puppet Sect—it had been destroyed long before her time. She'd never even seen it at its height.

"Then why do you want me?" she asked, confused. Aside from her Puppet Sect heritage, she couldn't think of anything about herself that would interest someone like Qin Jiang.

He laughed and gave her an appraising look. "Don't overthink it. I'm simply attracted to beautiful women."

Chu Hanyan blinked. A young lord of an ancient clan, forcibly taking a commoner's girl just because he was attracted to her? Surely not... But looking at his eyes, she thought it might not be entirely out of the question.

"What about my brother?" she asked hesitantly. If Qin Jiang truly wanted her, then Chu Yuan was technically his brother-in-law. Shouldn't he look after him?

"Don't worry, I'll have people take care of him. Although..." Qin Jiang rubbed his chin. "I've discovered that Chu Yuan has a special talent. So he might need a special kind of care."

"What kind?"

"Bullying him."

"What?"

Chu Hanyan was dumbfounded. Bullying Chu Yuan? What kind of "care" was that?

"Young Master Qin, that's not—" Her parents had left her with only one family member. But before she could protest, Qin Jiang waved her off.

"Trust me. His talent works in a way that the harder he's pushed, the faster he grows."

Chu Hanyan stared at him. Was he serious? What kind of talent thrived on being oppressed? Unless he was some kind of—

She bit back her retort and could only manage a skeptical, "Will that... really work?"

"Give it some time and you'll see my good intentions," Qin Jiang said with a smile.

Chu Hanyan sighed inwardly. Her brother would have a rough go of it for a while. But on the bright side, he'd never known luxury anyway. He could handle hardship.

"Qin Jiang, we've decided what to do with Huo Lie." Huo Qing'er appeared, getting straight to the point.

"Let's hear it."

She nodded. "Killing him outright feels too merciful. So I thought of someone—that special person you created at the Ye family."

Qin Jiang's face twitched. Special person? She meant Ye Xuan.

"I want to cripple Huo Lie's cultivation and send him to the Ye family," Huo Qing'er said, a glint of excitement dancing in her eyes.

Seeing that excitement, Qin Jiang instinctively recoiled. Hell hath no fury, indeed. Even he hadn't thought of something this cruel. Still...

"Will it work? What if Huo Lie ends up... getting into it?"

"Then we kill him afterward," Huo Qing'er said casually.

"Fair enough."

Qin Jiang nodded. Perhaps he could use this method in the future to torment other Children of Destiny. Chu Yuan, for instance.

"I'm sure the masterpiece you created will be absolutely devastating. Huo Lie won't know what hit him!" Huo Qing'er giggled.

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. He'd only meant to torment Ye Xuan a bit. Who could have guessed the man had such proclivities buried deep inside, ones that eventually consumed him entirely? The results, though, were undeniably effective. Ye Xuan's transformation was the reason Ye Qingtian now ruled as Ye family head. Ye Lingtian and his wife had fled to the Qin family for refuge.

On his last visit home, Qin Jiang had met with Ye Lingtian. The man had been seething with resentment toward Ye Qingtian's father and... daughter, his eyes haunted with a mix of fury and horror. According to him, the two brothers had still been contesting the family headship after Qin Jiang left. It had been roughly even—until Ye Qingtian deployed Ye Xuan. He'd sent Ye Xuan to visit Ye Lingtian every single day. Three days was all it took. Ye Lingtian packed up his wife and fled to the Qin family, cursing Ye Qingtian for fighting dirty.

Qin Jiang could feel Ye Lingtian's deep-seated anguish and barely suppressed nausea. The story had even reached the wider Qin family, and Ye Xuan's fearsome reputation had spread. Fourth Ancestor and the other elders had personally experienced Ye Xuan's "magical attacks." Nightmarish, all of them.

"I'll arrange to have Huo Lie sent to the Ye family," Qin Jiang said.

With everything settled, he closed his eyes and checked the system's rewards. They'd arrived the moment he'd taken Chu Hanyan—this particular plotline was significant. For Chu Yuan, Chu Hanyan was the most important person in the world, practically a mother figure.

The rewards were generous. First was another Time-Space Disc fragment, which Qin Jiang glanced at and tossed aside without much interest. But as he continued scrolling, his expression lit up with genuine delight.
