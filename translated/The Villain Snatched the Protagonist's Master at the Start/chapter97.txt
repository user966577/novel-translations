After the half-Emperor ancestor left, Ye Qingtian looked at the half-dead Huo Lie with some reluctance. He wasn't exactly eager to see Ye Xuan either—not given what his son had become. But in the end, he let out a soft sigh. Blood was blood.

He grabbed Huo Lie and headed for Ye Xuan's courtyard. It wasn't long before he reached the small compound and knocked on the gate with a moment's hesitation.

The gate opened to reveal Ye Xuan in full makeup.

"Father?" Ye Xuan looked surprised to see him.

Ye Qingtian nodded and peered past him into the courtyard. "No one else here?"

"No." Ye Xuan shook his head.

Lately, he'd been bringing men home on a regular basis. Ye Qingtian had walked in on it more than once.

"Did you need something, Father?"

Ye Qingtian dumped Huo Lie at his son's feet. "Qin Jiang sent this one over. Said he wants you to discipline him."

"Young Master Qin..." Ye Xuan's eyes lit up. Qin Jiang was his guiding light. Without Qin Jiang, he'd never have discovered his true calling. He was deeply grateful—he'd even offer himself if Qin Jiang were so inclined. Unfortunately, Qin Jiang wasn't interested in that particular path. But now he was sending someone over for "discipline"? Did that mean Young Master Qin was coming around?

"Ahem—this man offended Qin Jiang. You understand?" Ye Qingtian coughed, steering the conversation back on track.

Ye Xuan paused, then caught his father's meaning. A flicker of disappointment crossed his face. So it was just punishment, then.

"I understand, Father. Please tell Young Master Qin that I'll take excellent care of his guest."

Ye Qingtian regarded his transformed son with a complicated expression. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but ultimately just nodded. Changed as Ye Xuan might be, at least the boy seemed happy.

"I'll leave you to it, then." Ye Qingtian turned and left.

Back in the Fire Domain, inside the traveling palace, Qin Jiang retrieved the Fire Tribe's Legacy Flame and considered how to purify its energy.

While he pondered, Qin Lian'er emerged from her room and greeted him. "Brother, are you done with your business?"

He looked up, and she immediately zeroed in on the flame hovering before him.

"Is that the Fire Tribe's Legacy Flame?" she asked curiously.

Qin Jiang nodded. "The energy inside is immense, but it's too impure..."

"Let me take a look~" Qin Lian'er scooped up the Legacy Flame, carefully prodding it, then grinned. "Brother, I can purify the energy inside."

"You?"

"Yep~" She nodded proudly. The white flame at the center of her brow emerged, and under her control, it enveloped the Legacy Flame entirely.

The Immortal Fire. Qin Jiang's eyes widened. This flame had more uses than he'd thought—it could transmit techniques, locate treasures, and now purify energy. He suspected there were even more capabilities he hadn't discovered yet.

Wrapped in the Immortal Fire, the Legacy Flame trembled. Crackling sounds emanated from within as wisps of impure energy rose like steam. The siblings crouched down side by side, watching the process intently.

"The Immortal Fire doesn't drain your energy?" Qin Jiang asked.

Qin Lian'er shrugged. "Nope. I think it has its own deep reserves. If it drew on my power, I'd collapse in no time."

That made sense. The Immortal Fire was an artifact of the immortal path. Qin Lian'er's cultivation was far too low to sustain its consumption.

"Lian'er, do you think it has its own consciousness?" he asked.

Excitement sparkled on her face. She'd wondered the same thing. "Brother, let me tell you—the Immortal Fire has all sorts of techniques and skills stored inside it. Every time it transmits a technique to me, it's a really pretty female voice. Do you think maybe one day, it could turn into a beautiful woman?"

Her eyes were bright. Before Qin Jiang could respond, she plowed ahead: "I'm going to take good care of it. And if it really does become a beautiful woman someday, I'll let it be your wife!"

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. A flame for a wife? He shuddered. Wouldn't it burn him alive? Even with his cultivation protecting him, certain areas were... sensitive. And this was an Immortal Fire. Incinerating him would be child's play.

"Don't be ridiculous," he said with a cough.

Just then, the Immortal Fire floated back to Qin Lian'er on its own, trembling slightly before returning to the spot between her brows. A peculiar look crossed Qin Lian'er's face.

She turned to Qin Jiang. "Brother, the Immortal Fire just told me it can't control its temperature yet, so... it can't be your wife right now."
