"Big sister, they don't know any better. Please don't mind them," Hu Xian'er said.

Jian Yao's expression was odd. 'As if you know any better yourself.'

She shook her head and smiled. "Take me to see the immortal herb."

"Sure—wait, huh?" Hu Xian'er blurted out the agreement before her brain caught up. She blanched. "Immortal herb? What immortal herb? We don't have one!"

"Oh, drop the act."

Jian Yao looked at her with open amusement. "I came to the White Fox Tribe specifically for the immortal herb. You think I didn't do my homework? You have one."

"We don't!"

"You do."

"We don't!"

Hu Xian'er argued like a child, offering nothing beyond blanket denial. But under Jian Yao's unwavering gaze, her composure cracked. Her little lips pursed.

"Big sister... you really know we have the immortal herb?"

"I do now."

Hu Xian'er: "..."

She stared blankly, then the realization hit—she'd just confirmed it herself. Her face fell.

Her small fists clenched. She looked up at Jian Yao with defiance. "I won't give you the immortal herb!"

The herb was more than just a plant. It nurtured other spirit medicines, concentrated ambient energy, and its aura alone strengthened every White Fox Tribe member's physique. It was their greatest treasure.

"Won't give it? What if I take it by force?" Jian Yao studied her. "Could you stop me?"

She let a sliver of her aura leak out, and Hu Xian'er's face went white. She was a Great Emperor, but she hadn't even stepped into the Ancient Emperor tier. Against an Immortal, she felt as though Jian Yao could snuff her out with a single thought.

Hu Xian'er's expression crumpled. Her pretty eyes reddened, and tears began to fall, one by one.

Jian Yao: "..."

'I made her cry?'

She retracted her aura with some exasperation. "How has your tribe survived this long?"

The Demon Domain's laws of survival were even harsher than among humans. The White Fox Tribe's continued existence was genuinely miraculous.

Hu Xian'er blinked through her tears, and a spark of courage returned to her eyes. "Our White Fox Tribe is part of the Fox Race! The Fox Race is one of the three great powers in the Demon Domain! You can't rob us!"

Her confidence grew with each word, and a smug little smile crept onto her face. Their survival was indeed thanks to the Fox Race. As one of the Demon Domain's three great powers, nobody wanted to provoke them. And since the White Fox Tribe never caused trouble, they'd been left to live comfortably under the Fox Race's umbrella.

"The Demon Domain's three great powers?" Jian Yao had heard of them—besides the Fox Race, there were the Snake Race and the Wolf Race.

The Wolf Race was the strongest. Their ancient Wolf King was reportedly the Demon Domain's number one expert, a top-three figure in all of Azure Cloud Heaven.

The Fox Race's own ranking among the three powers, however, was...

"The Fox Race is the weakest of the three, isn't it? And are you sure they'd go up against an Immortal for your sake?"

Jian Yao fixed Hu Xian'er with a piercing stare. No killing intent leaked out, but the invisible pressure still made the fox girl squirm.

"Immortal? Big sister, you're an Immortal cultivator?"

Jian Yao gave a proud nod.

Fear flickered through Hu Xian'er's eyes. If she really was an Immortal, even the Fox Race wouldn't want to pick that fight.

"Well? Still not handing over the herb?"

"I..." Hu Xian'er wrung her small hands together, her face a portrait of aggrieved misery. She looked ready to burst into tears again.

Jian Yao watched her, thoroughly amused. She was toughening Hu Xian'er up, really. Otherwise, once Qin Jiang got hold of her, the poor thing would be crying every single day.

Not that Hu Xian'er appreciated the training.

She bit her lip, made some agonizing internal decision, and sniffled. "Fine! Take the herb—but never come to our White Fox Tribe again!"

She was kicking her out.

Jian Yao nearly laughed out loud. Seeing Hu Xian'er's pitiful expression, she relented. "Alright, I'll stop teasing you."

"Huh?"

"Keep your herb. But I suspect someone will come for it in a few days anyway."

Hu Xian'er stared in confusion, tilting her head. 'She doesn't want the herb?'

Jian Yao explained with a smile. "I heard someone is planning to steal your immortal herb, so I came here specifically to help you."

"Someone wants to steal it?"

Hu Xian'er's face went pale with alarm.

Jian Yao nodded. "A real piece of work, too. Your tribe helped him once, and he repaid you by scouting out your herb. He's already rallied allies and is on his way to take it."

"Someone we helped?" Hu Xian'er looked stunned, then puffed out her cheeks, indignant. "We helped him and he's still going to rob us?!"

"He's a villain. And I'm here to protect you."

Hu Xian'er's eyes sparkled. Her gloomy expression vanished in an instant, and she bounced over to grab Jian Yao's hand. "Big sister, thank you!"

An Immortal protector—with that kind of backing, the White Fox Tribe had nothing to fear.

"Just like that? You believe me?"

"Of course!"

'So gullible. Qin Jiang is going to love her.'

The Tang family.

The loss of five Great Emperors had cut their strength nearly in half, but dealing with the White Fox Tribe was still child's play—or so they thought.

Under Tang Yin's guidance, the Tang Patriarch set out with two Great Emperors for the Demon Domain.

"Do you know where the White Fox Tribe is, Yin'er?"

An Ancient Emperor and two Great Emperors—more than enough to crush the White Fox Tribe.

Tang Yin nodded. He'd spent considerable time in the Demon Domain. He'd once been wounded, and a group of little foxes from the White Fox Tribe had found him, brought him home, and patched him up. He'd left shortly after, but during his stay, he'd caught the scent of the immortal herb.

He was certain. Absolutely certain it was an immortal herb.

If not for the White Fox Tribe having a Great Emperor on hand, he would have stolen it right then and there.

Tang Yin led the three Emperor-level cultivators deep into the Demon Domain. With such powerful escorts, the journey was uneventful.

A few hours later, a familiar valley came into view. Tang Yin halted and smiled. "This is the White Fox Tribe."

He drew a deep breath. Even from this distance, he could catch the immortal herb's fragrance—a talent born of his gift for poisons and medicines.

The Tang Patriarch and his two companions surveyed the valley. "The White Fox Tribe only has a single Great Emperor, and the Fox Race backs them. We need to be fast and clean."
