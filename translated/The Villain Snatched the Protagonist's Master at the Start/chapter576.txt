The person inside the cavity was a Huaxia operative. He quietly stowed his recording crystal and studied the newcomer.

He'd placed an illusion formation around the cavity's entrance. Plenty of people had walked past without noticing a thing. Yet this Human Immortal had seen right through it. Interesting.

Every Huaxia operative knew that Qin Jiang's surveillance orders were ultimately about identifying unusual individuals. And this one definitely qualified.

The newcomer, meanwhile, recovered from his surprise and discreetly tucked the blood-red stone out of sight. Without a word, he turned to leave. He had no desire to interact with strangers—especially not while carrying an heirloom that might be the key to the realm's true legacy. Better to leave and come back after this person was gone.

But the Huaxia operative spoke up. "Fellow Daoist, found anything good?"

"No." Zhao Sheng—for that was his name, head of the Zhao family and bearer of his clan's hopes—shook his head curtly. He gave the briefest possible answer and turned away.

The operative followed, undeterred. "You seem capable. How about we team up?"

"I don't need a team."

"Come on, this realm's more dangerous than it looks. You're strong, sure, but there are plenty of people stronger. Teaming up gives us both better odds."

"I don't need a team."

Zhao Sheng picked up his pace, but the operative matched him effortlessly. A True Immortal tailing a Human Immortal—there was no escaping. Finally, Zhao Sheng stopped.

"Fellow Daoist, I prefer working alone. Perhaps you could find a different partner."

"But I like the look of you."

The operative grinned. If this person turned out to be who Qin Jiang was looking for, the reward would be enormous—possibly enough to help him break through to Immortal King. No way he was letting a prospect like this slip away.

His persistence left Zhao Sheng at a loss. Worse, he could sense the pressure the man exuded—this was a True Immortal. He couldn't win that fight.

While Zhao Sheng was trying to figure out how to lose his shadow, the operative shrugged and produced a message stone. "Tell you what—since you don't want to team up, take this. If you need anything, reach out."

Zhao Sheng blinked, then instinctively accepted the stone. Maybe the man was genuinely trying to help. The operative smiled. "If anything comes up, just contact me. In this realm, I can handle most problems. Anyway—I'll be going."

And just like that, he left.

Zhao Sheng watched him go, then looked down at the message stone. After a moment's hesitation, he pocketed it. Might come in handy. And having a True Immortal as a friendly contact couldn't hurt—as long as the man wasn't following him.

Zhao Sheng returned to the statue and waited. When night fell, he opened his eyes, scanned the area thoroughly, and confirmed he was alone. Only then did he fly up to the heart cavity and take out the blood-red stone. It glowed faintly, warm to the touch.

Uncertain how to use it, he hesitated, then carefully placed it into the cavity.

The stone erupted with light.

Crimson radiance flooded the cavity in an instant. Zhao Sheng flinched—then felt a surge of excitement. The legacy was truly about to manifest, and it would be his!

He hovered before the cavity, staring at the stone. Suddenly, a torrent of energy burst from it. The blood-red light shot skyward, illuminating the entire realm. The blast hurled Zhao Sheng backward.

His face twisted. Of all the things—it had to make that kind of spectacle? Now everyone in the realm would come running. This was practically a public event.

Had he known, he would have done this openly. He could've kept that True Immortal around instead of chasing him off—might've even earned some goodwill. Now all for nothing.

Every person in the realm saw the crimson light and surged toward its source. Near the statue, Zhao Sheng could feel the approaching auras. He gritted his teeth and flew back up to the heart cavity, hoping to reclaim the blood-red stone.

But it was gone. The cavity had sealed itself, filled in where the stone had been.

His expression darkened further. The heirloom was lost.

In frustration, he slammed his fist against the statue. At that instant, a streak of light shot from the heart position and pierced his forehead before he could react.

Startled, he closed his eyes and searched his consciousness for it—but found nothing. The approaching auras were closing in fast. He didn't dare linger. Opening his eyes, he clenched his jaw and retreated into hiding.

The realm was crawling with True Immortals. A lone Human Immortal had no business standing in the spotlight. More importantly, no one could know the anomaly was his doing.

He'd barely concealed himself when figures began appearing before the statue—predominantly True Immortals. Black Dragon and Little Xu arrived as well.

Surveying the glowing statue, Black Dragon raised an eyebrow and turned to Little Xu with a smirk. "I thought you cleaned the place out. This thing right here is probably the realm's biggest prize. If I had to guess—it's the Immortal Emperor's legacy."

Little Xu clenched his jaw, glaring at the statue. How was he supposed to know this unremarkable chunk of rock was hiding the most important treasure? It had been completely inert when he'd searched the place.

"How was I supposed to know there was a legacy inside a statue?"

"Regardless," Black Dragon shrugged, "you'd better explain this to the Young Master. You missed the biggest prize."

Little Xu had no retort. It wasn't his fault, technically—but it was his responsibility. Still, if he could seize the legacy now, it would balance the books.
