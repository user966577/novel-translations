After that, Qin Jiang behaved himself. He let Ye Ling'er rest in his arms while he recounted everything that had happened since he'd left.

He teased her occasionally, drawing flustered protests, but as his stories unfolded, a shadow crept into her eyes.

Qin Jiang was operating at the immortal-path level now. She was still a Supreme.

All that effort, and she still hadn't caught up.

She pressed her lips together, head resting on his shoulder, quietly listening to his voice.

'I wish time could stop right here.'

Her hand tightened around his.

Qin Jiang paused mid-sentence, looked down, and kissed her softly on the lips. "Ling'er, I brought you a gift."

"A gift?"

"Mm. A good one. It'll strengthen your water-attribute technique."

Ye Ling'er's face went scarlet. She glared at him, half-embarrassed, half-suspicious. "I really don't have any left!"

"I know. That's why we should upgrade, right? We've barely gotten started."

"..." She hugged herself, deeply wary. She was certain he hadn't had his fill. But she truly had nothing left!

Her defensive posture made Qin Jiang roll his eyes. 'I'm not that insatiable.'

He produced an immortal-path law from his palm — water-attribute, set aside for Ye Ling'er long ago.

"An immortal-path law. Water-attribute. Perfect for Ling'er. Once you refine it, your control over water techniques will improve dramatically. And your stamina will increase massively. Then..." He waggled his eyebrows. "I'll want to see Ling'er's new limit."

Her eyes lit up. She knew Chen Ningbing had received an immortal-path law — she'd been jealous, honestly. But she also knew Qin Jiang hadn't had a suitable one for her at the time, so she'd redoubled her training efforts, determined to close the gap on her own.

She hadn't managed it. But Qin Jiang hadn't forgotten her either.

Ye Ling'er threw her arms around him, eyes shining with emotion, and kissed him fiercely.

The kiss went on so long Qin Jiang nearly suffocated. When she finally pulled back, lips slightly swollen, she wore a triumphant expression. Even if she couldn't win the main event, at least she'd dominated the kissing.

"Ling'er. You nearly killed me."

She giggled and pecked his lips several more times by way of apology.

He handed her the law. "Keep it for now." A touch of his finger sent the water-attribute law flowing into her body. A torrent of energy surged through her. She gasped and immediately sat cross-legged, closing her eyes to manage the influx. A full half-hour passed before she had it under control.

She opened her eyes. Qin Jiang was still there. She breathed a sigh of relief.

"Got it stabilized?"

She nodded, then hesitated, looking sheepish. "Can I wait a few days before going into seclusion?"

"Sure. I'll stay with you until then."

Inside the Space-Time Temple, real-world time barely moved. He could spend days here and lose only hours outside.

Her face broke into a radiant smile. She grabbed his arm. "The law's energy restored me a bit..."

Her eyes were full of implication.

Qin Jiang's eyebrow rose. "Did it now?"

"Mm-hmm~"

"So... you want me to check how much?"

"Mm~"

Red-faced, she nodded. "But... leave me a little this time? Being completely drained is so tiring..."

"Heh. Of course."

The immortal-path law was potent indeed. Just sitting in her body, unrefined, it had restored her nearly to full capacity.

Qin Jiang almost drowned.

Three days later, Ye Ling'er was still going. She was reluctant to let him leave — he'd been generous with rest breaks, and she savored every moment.

She nestled against him, knowing she'd already monopolized far more of his time than was fair. But she wanted to be greedy, just a little longer.

"Qin Jiang... more~"

She lifted her head, saw his throat, and kissed it softly.

He tweaked her cheek. "Again?"

"Mm~"

Despite her shyness, she nodded. She simply wanted him to stay.

He ruffled her hair. "Alright, time to rest."

"Oh~"

Disappointment flickered across her face. He pulled her onto his lap, flicked the tip of her nose, and said, "I'll stay until you've recovered."

"Really?"

Full recovery would take at least three days. His nod sent joy flooding through her.

What followed was supposed to be light flirtation while she rested. But flirting had a way of escalating. Despite his best restraint, solitude plus attraction proved combustible. A handsome man and a beautiful woman — some things were inevitable.

Three days should have been enough to recover. Five days in, she was still running on empty.

Qin Jiang looked at her helplessly. She was definitely baiting him on purpose. But he couldn't help taking the bait — she was his wife, for heaven's sake.

"Qin Jiang, do I look good in this?"

She knelt before him in a maid outfit, twin tails, white stockings — batting her eyes with devastating effect.

He groaned. "Heaven help me."

He closed the distance and scooped her up. Some temptations simply couldn't be resisted.

"Last time, okay?"

She grinned, nodded, and melted against him. She was content.

It was time to enter seclusion. With the immortal-path law, her breakthrough wouldn't take long.

Then she'd finally be able to help him.
