Ye Xuan's talent was beyond question — her performance on the staircase was top-tier across the entire class. Li Yang, dead last, had long since lost sight of her. But he could still see Zhao Juncai, who hadn't been able to keep up either.

That offered a sliver of consolation.

The test dragged on for four full hours before the pressure abruptly vanished. A surge of force swept up every student and deposited them inside Huaxia Academy's grounds.

"Congratulations. From this moment forward, you are official students of Huaxia Academy."

Qin Jiang and An Xihe stood at the front, Qing Chan and Mo Mo half a step behind. The full teaching staff assembled at their backs.

The students snapped to attention, faces brightening with relief and pride.

Qin Jiang surveyed the crowd. "Your entrance performances will now determine your tier: elite, regular, or remedial. Each tier carries different privileges and resources. Huaxia Academy does not coddle the weak."

He paused. "However — this initial ranking is not permanent. Distinguished performance in the academy can earn promotions. Those who start at the bottom shouldn't despair. Opportunities exist."

He gestured, and a teacher stepped forward bearing a list.

"Go ahead."

The teacher nodded, faced the students, and unrolled the scroll.

"Remedial student roster — three hundred names. Li Yang, Ma Shun, Shen Qiu, Fan Yingying..."

Three hundred names rolled out. Li Yang's was first.

Every student called out looked stricken. They were supposed to be geniuses — being labeled "remedial" at Huaxia Academy was a slap in the face.

They seethed, but under the stern gazes of the teaching staff, no one dared object. They could only swallow it and swear silently to claw their way up.

"Regular student roster — eight hundred names. Lei Yutian, Yu Binbin, Shi Zihan..."

First batch of students: 1,130 total. Three hundred remedial. Eight hundred regular. That left just 30 elites.

Tension mounted as name after name was read. No one wanted to be on this list — elite was the only tier worth having.

Li Yang stood in the crowd, fists white-knuckled. Not just remedial — first on the list. The ordering went from worst to best, which meant he was dead last.

He wanted to protest, but the evidence was damning. The only student frozen solid on the ice. The only one hit by a fireball. The only one who nearly didn't escape the illusion. Last place on the stone staircase.

By every metric, he was the weakest.

He sighed and looked toward the front, where Ye Xuan stood among the top group. 'She'll be an elite for sure.'

Her name hadn't been called in either the remedial or regular lists, and her performance warranted nothing less. She'd led the way even while carrying him as dead weight, then dominated the staircase after leaving him behind.

The realization stung. Was he really worthy of a girl like that?

When the eight hundred regular names were finished, Ye Xuan's absence from the list confirmed it — she was elite.

But what twisted the knife further: Zhao Juncai's name hadn't been called, either. That arrogant bastard was also elite.

Zhao Juncai stood near the front, beaming. Better yet, Ye Xuan was in the same tier. As for that remedial deadweight? Not even worth mentioning. An elite and a remedial student — that had no future.

His advantage was enormous.

He glanced at Ye Xuan. A faint smile played on her lips. She seemed pleased. He didn't realize her smile wasn't about the ranking — it was about seeing Qin Jiang. She'd expected nothing less than elite. The ranking was the least interesting part of the day.

Her eyes were locked on Qin Jiang.

She wasn't the only one. Half the female students were sneaking glances at him — though none so bold as to stare openly. They peeked, blushed, and looked away.

Qin Jiang, of course, noticed. He met their gazes with an amiable smile and the occasional friendly nod, which only deepened their blushes.

An Xihe's hand crept to his waist.

He caught it smoothly, giving her fingers a gentle squeeze. She pouted and sent a private message: "With this many female students, you're not planning to poach from our own school, are you?"

"How could you think that? I'd never."

"Then stop flirting with them. You smile at them, they fall for you, and then what? They'll never be able to settle for a normal man."

"Come on — I founded this academy. Being nice to my students is just good leadership."

"Oh? Is that why you're only being 'nice' to the girls? Funny how none of that charm is aimed at the boys."

He had no good answer for that.

"Anyway," she continued, "Qing Chan mentioned the Azure Lotus Divine Palace situation. Their women refuse to marry now — they're all waiting for you. You need to deal with that."

"I know, I know. I'll fold them in like the foxes. Problem solved."

"Your call."

She scanned the student body, eyes calculating. Then: "There are some genuinely impressive prospects here. If the opportunity arises, a bit of poaching wouldn't hurt. They're all going to the Heavenly Domain — better to have them as family than as strangers."
