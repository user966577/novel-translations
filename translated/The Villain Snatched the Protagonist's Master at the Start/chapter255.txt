"I'm... alive?"

Chen Changsheng woke to agony. Every inch of his body screamed in pain, and cold sweat instantly drenched his face. His limbs trembled as he tried to rise, only to find that nearly every bone was fractured and his meridians were paper-thin. He couldn't move at all.

Gritting his teeth, he swallowed a mouthful of blood and forced one arm upward to reach for his storage ring. But it wasn't there.

"My storage ring?"

His expression twisted. The ring held most of his wealth. "That bastard! Qin Jiang definitely stole my ring and left me here to die. Hmph—did he really think I keep everything in one place?"

He snorted bitterly, pinning the blame squarely on Qin Jiang. In truth, Qin Jiang couldn't have cared less about his meager possessions. The only thing Chen Changsheng carried that was worth coveting was the Reincarnation Law.

Taking a steadying breath, Chen Changsheng closed his eyes. A moment later, a pill materialized before him. He swallowed it whole—an Emperor-grade healing pill. His injuries began mending, but even after two full hours, he could only manage to stand on shaky legs.

"Too severe," he muttered. An Emperor-grade medicine hadn't been enough for full recovery. But at least he could move again.

"I need to get out of here. Qin Jiang might come back to finish the job."

He staggered away from the gully, each step unsteady. The Human Dao Sect was no longer an option. What about the Limitless Holy Land? But two of the three great powers in the Central Regions were already in Qin Jiang's pocket. Would the Limitless Holy Land actually help him? These major factions were unreliable.

"I have to rely on myself. I'm too weak. If I were a True Immortal, a mere Qin Jiang would be dust beneath my palm."

His eyes hardened with renewed determination. He needed to grow stronger—Great Emperor at minimum. At Great Emperor, the fruits of his ten reincarnations would fully merge, completing the Reincarnation Law. His realm would skyrocket, and then he refused to believe he couldn't handle Qin Jiang. But for now, he needed to lay low.

"This isn't fear. It's a tactical retreat."

He consoled himself. Before, he'd insisted on confronting Qin Jiang head-on, desperate to prove himself. But after one crushing defeat after another, he'd finally accepted the truth: as things stood, he was simply no match. Still, the battle wasn't over. Only the one laughing at the end was the true victor.

With this self-encouragement, Chen Changsheng's wavering dao heart gradually steadied. "Once I break through to Great Emperor, we'll settle this!"

Meanwhile, Chen Qi'er had been searching for Chen Changsheng with no luck. The trail had led from the Azure Lotus Divine Palace all the way to the Human Dao Sect.

"The Human Dao Sect..."

His eyes flickered, and a faint smile crossed his face. He produced a token from his palm—a Human Dao Sect outer disciple's badge. Running his thumb across its surface, he felt a swell of gratitude.

Back then, he'd been nothing but a little beggar, living right here in the Human Dao Sect's territory. A beggar with a dream: to become a cultivator. To soar through the skies and ride the clouds.

The Human Dao Sect's rules had given him a path. For just one spirit stone, you could join the outer sect. One spirit stone would buy you a cultivation manual and a monthly stipend of one stone.

He begged tirelessly, hoping to scrape together that single stone. But for a beggar, even one spirit stone was an impossible sum. And he wasn't alone—there was a girl, younger than him, also a beggar. They'd found each other and become like siblings.

She knew his dream. Every day, she ate as little as possible, saving every scrap she could to help him gather that one spirit stone. Every night, they'd count the day's earnings together, and Chen Qi'er would describe his dream—how once he became a cultivator, he'd treat his little sister to a real feast.

But the dream remained impossibly far away.

Until one day, a middle-aged man appeared before them. He said the girl had exceptional talent and could enter the Human Dao Sect's inner sect directly. They were both overjoyed. She wanted to bring Chen Qi'er along, but the man said he had no talent. Even in the inner sect, he'd accomplish nothing and only be bullied. She pleaded, and the man relented—but Chen Qi'er had his pride. He refused the charity.

He persuaded his little sister to go with the man. Leaving was her chance at a real future. Though reluctant, she eventually agreed. But before she left, she insisted on leaving him one spirit stone. The man could have given more, but Chen Qi'er wouldn't accept it. One stone. One stone carrying all their hope.

He joined the outer sect. He received his cultivation manual and his monthly stipend. His talent was poor and his resources scarce, but he worked harder than anyone. Beyond begging hours, every waking moment was spent cultivating. Gradually, he shed the beggar's life and devoted even more time to training.

Day and night, never resting. He knew this was the only way to keep pace with his sister. He didn't want the day they reunited to be one where he could only look up at her.

Early on, she snuck back to visit a few times, showing off her progress. Her talent dwarfed his—he couldn't help but feel envious. Whenever she tried to help him, he refused. Every time.

Later, she said the competition within the inner sect was fierce. She needed to train harder. After that, their meetings grew rarer and rarer, until eventually he left the Human Dao Sect entirely.

Under her protection, his growth had been too slow. He needed real tempering—genuine, life-or-death crucibles. Otherwise, he'd never be more than someone who looked up at his sister.

He left quietly. Without her protection, he experienced the true cruelty of the cultivation world, especially at the bottom. Cultivators died by the thousands every day, and he struggled among them. Countless times, he'd danced on the edge of death. Each time he survived by the skin of his teeth, he grew stronger. Over the ages, he became powerful beyond measure.

And now, he'd returned to the Human Dao Sect—the place where the dream began.
