Inside the Heavenly Pill Palace.

Qin Jiang had been keeping tabs on Chen Changsheng. When the man was finally chased away by the Pill Emperor, the report reached Qin Jiang almost immediately, and he couldn't help but laugh.

It seemed the Pill Emperor truly despised Chen Changsheng to the bone. Given her temperament, she normally wouldn't be the type to throw someone out.

"Chen Changsheng... I'll let you go for now," Qin Jiang murmured.

That man was a big, juicy leek—thick at the stalk and ripe for harvesting. Ten lifetimes of reincarnation meant his connections extended far beyond just the Pill Emperor. He would inevitably seek out others, and there was a good chance a new fortune heroine would surface along the way.

When that happened...

Qin Jiang chuckled. All of it would end up lining his own pockets.

'Chen Changsheng, work hard for me. I'm rooting for you. Don't let me down.'

Half a month slipped by in the blink of an eye.

During that time, Qin Jiang lived a leisurely life—a few minutes of cultivation each day, then spending the rest of his time with the women. Pill City, meanwhile, had gradually quieted down after the Assembly's conclusion.

Inside the Heavenly Pill Palace, Qin Jiang lounged at ease with the Pill Emperor at his side.

"You're really leaving?" She peeled a grape and fed it to him, her voice tinged with reluctance.

Qin Jiang nodded. He'd stayed in Pill City for quite a while now, and Fourth Ancestor's group had sent word that they'd gotten into a scrap with someone. He needed to go check on things.

He caught the Pill Emperor's small hand and smiled. "I'm in the Western Regions—not far from Pill City. I'll come back whenever I have time. Or... you could come with me?"

"The Western Regions?" The Pill Emperor's eyes brightened. That wasn't far at all—with her cultivation, she could get there in half a day. But leaving with Qin Jiang wasn't realistic. The Heavenly Pill Palace was enormous, and it still needed her to lead it.

"I can't go with you," she said, "but I'll visit whenever I can."

Qin Jiang nodded. He didn't want her to abandon the Heavenly Pill Palace either. Alchemists were invaluable no matter the circumstances.

"When are you leaving?" she asked.

Qin Jiang hesitated. Seeing the reluctance in her eyes, he softened. "In a couple of days."

Qin Family City.

Situated at the far edge of the Western Regions, this was typically a place where no formidable powers took root. But Fourth Ancestor and his people had become the exception.

With Qin Jiang away for so long, the elders had grown restless in their remote corner and begun expanding outward. With their combined strength, they'd swept through everything within hundreds of thousands of miles without meeting a single worthy opponent. Qin Family City's territory had grown considerably.

But there was always a bigger fish. Just a few days ago, after Fourth Ancestor's forces had seized a city, someone had stepped forward to hurl insults at them. As a Qin, how could he tolerate that?

One slap. Dead on the spot.

However, the moment the man died, a spectral image erupted from his corpse. It was a protective measure—left behind for the man by someone powerful. Unfortunately, Fourth Ancestor had struck too fast for it to activate. The man was already dead before it could intervene.

The phantom, naturally, was furious.

So Fourth Ancestor destroyed that too.

Still, he realized the man he'd killed was no ordinary person. That phantom had carried the aura of a Great Emperor—a lifesaving trump card left to a descendant.

A single Great Emperor didn't worry Fourth Ancestor much. He issued some brief orders for everyone to stay vigilant, then put it out of his mind.

His intuition proved correct.
