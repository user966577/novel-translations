The alchemy discussion lasted a full day.

Several women drifted in during the session, but seeing the two deep in conversation, none of them interrupted. They simply waited nearby.

When they finished, Linglong was beaming with newfound understanding. She grabbed Qin Jiang's head and planted a kiss on it, then gathered the Immortal Pill Dao scroll. She was about to take things further when she noticed the crowd of women around them.

When had they arrived? Were they all waiting for Qin Jiang?

She blinked, then climbed off Qin Jiang's lap. She'd monopolized him for a whole day — it wouldn't be fair to make her sisters wait any longer. "I, uh... had some breakthroughs. Let me go consolidate them. You all go ahead."

She tried to take Dan Yu with her, but Dan Yu was reluctant. She'd barely risen when Qin Jiang pulled her back down. He grinned at Linglong. "Leave Dan Yu with me. I'll teach her the Immortal Pill Dao."

Linglong's eyes turned reproachful. At that moment, Qin Jiang stood and swept her into his arms as well. "You too. We barely scratched the surface today. If you leave now, there's no way you'll be able to focus."

Her cheeks reddened. She'd been exercising restraint for his disciple's sake, letting Qin Jiang direct most of his energy toward her. But the whole day had been nothing but appetizers, and he was right — leaving now would be torture. She glanced at the other women apologetically, but none of them showed any intention of leaving. The more the merrier — Qin Jiang's stamina was bottomless.

Five days vanished in a blink.

Qin Jiang was petting Hu Xian'er. The little fox had spent a recent period in seclusion, and he'd even accelerated time for her. She'd broken through to Ancient Emperor. The next step was the immortal path.

Qin Jiang had plenty of immortal-path laws. The little fox would get one when the time came. But he had no illusions about sending her into battle. She was too innocent for that — better to keep her safe at his side. The sole purpose of strengthening her was to extend her lifespan.

Combat could be left to others. The little fox's job was to nestle in his arms and act cute.

He held Hu Xian'er close and inhaled deeply. Her scent was clean and fresh. People always said foxes smelled bad — pure slander. She smelled wonderful.

The little fox sprawled entirely on top of him, nuzzling her head against his chest. His hands roamed gently over her body. When they found a ticklish spot, she dissolved into giggles, squirming and wriggling.

"Xian'er, let's visit the Fox Race soon?"

He held her waist as he spoke. The Demon Domain's power balance had shifted dramatically. One of the five True Immortals he'd killed was the Wolf Race's old Wolf King, along with several Wolf Race Human Immortals. With their top fighters gone, the Wolf Race was surrounded on all sides.

Not that the other Demon Domain factions would dare move without his say-so. But going forward, the Fox Race and Snake Race would be the dominant powers. He could also elevate the Celestial Rabbit Tribe to become one of the new big three.

The Snake Race was already his — his woman was the clan chief, and the previous chief was on his side too. As for the Fox Race, he'd met the chief, and the man's attitude had been... lukewarm. Still, he was technically Qin Jiang's father-in-law. Show the man some respect, bring a strong entourage to bolster his prestige, and surely he'd come around. At the very least, he'd bring the Fox Race into the fold.

And Hu Xian'er would definitely side with him.

While he was thinking, the little fox wriggled up until her lips could reach his face. She peppered him with kisses — tit for tat. He'd kissed her once, so she had to repay him tenfold. Only when Qin Jiang caught her lips did she finally stop, going completely boneless in his arms.

After a few breaths, she raised her head and pointed at her pouting lips with one finger. "More kisses~"

"Of course. Kisses~"

He obliged instantly, and the little fox lit up with joy.

"More."

"More~"

"Mm — not there. I want lip kisses, not — ah—"

Her body stiffened, and she let out a small, flustered sound.

Qin Jiang raised his head innocently. "I was kissing your lips."

"Not those ones! Bad~"

Despite her protests, her fingers were already guiding his head rather than pushing it away. Her chin tilted up, eyes half-lidded, teeth worrying her lower lip.

After a long while, she finally released him.

Qin Jiang lifted his head to find Hu Xian'er already dabbing at his face with a handkerchief, cheeks flushed. "I told you not to do that. Look at the mess."

She cleaned his face meticulously, making sure not to leave a trace. But Qin Jiang licked his lips.

He caught her hand and grinned. "You don't have to wipe it off. Think of it as a facial."

"A facial? That's so dirty!" Hu Xian'er's face turned scarlet.

To Qin Jiang's exaggerated disappointment, she cleaned him up anyway. Then she grabbed his head and smothered him with another round of kisses.

"That's a proper facial. But since I gave you one, you owe me one too~"

She held up a finger, perfectly serious.

Qin Jiang laughed. "Done. Right now."

The little fox was hardly innocent anymore — Qin Jiang had corrupted her thoroughly. "Facials," at least, were a regular occurrence. And every time, watching her wide, guileless eyes during the process, the sheer contrast drove Qin Jiang a little wild.

Which, naturally, meant the little fox paid for it. She'd often sulk for days afterward, refusing to speak to him. But one round of coaxing was all it took before she'd come bouncing back, demanding he help her with her skincare routine.

He adored her for it. And he wasn't alone — all the women doted on Hu Xian'er. She was the group's second-favorite pet, right behind Lian'er.
