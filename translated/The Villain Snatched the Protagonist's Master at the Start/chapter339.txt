Most factions chose the first option. Only a handful of blood enemies — the kind of grudge that couldn't be talked away — gritted their teeth and chose war. Qin Jiang approved every request without hesitation.

One month. One side had to be eliminated. If both still stood at the deadline, Huaxia Manor would step in and wipe them both out.

Internal strife had consequences.

His casual, matter-of-fact delivery made every leader's blood run cold. This wasn't just a kept man. This was a decisive, ruthless ruler.

He solved that problem with brute simplicity. Other problems followed in quick succession, though Liu Shuwan handled the bulk of them. The transition from a single faction into an empire required adjustments to the original blueprint.

"Should we appoint ministers?" Liu Shuwan asked.

Qin Jiang shook his head. If he appointed ministers, he'd become an emperor in practice, and ministers would start watching his every move. How was he supposed to slack off?

"No need. Rank and status within Huaxia Manor will be determined entirely by strength. Stronger means higher rank. Simple as that."

Liu Shuwan's face flickered with exasperation. Simple to say, complicated to implement. A pure meritocracy based on strength alone couldn't work — there had to be other factors, like contribution to the manor. If strength were the only measure, Huaxia Manor would breed a legion of selfish powerhouses who contributed nothing. Eventually, the whole thing would collapse.

She worked through his rough idea, filling in the gaps with practical details.

"Speaking of which," she said, "you must have quite a stockpile of treasures?"

Qin Jiang nodded. "Plenty. Need something, Wan'er?"

"What do you have?"

"Uh... whatever you need, I can probably provide."

Liu Shuwan blinked, studying him. That wealthy?

"So basically, if there's a need, you can produce anything?"

"More or less."

"Then we shouldn't delay setting up the Merit Hall. Huaxia Manor's disciples earn Merit Points for accomplishments, and those points can be exchanged for treasures. The point balance should also factor into rank and status. What do you think?"

Qin Jiang scratched his head. This sort of thing wasn't his forte. "Sounds great."

Liu Shuwan shot him a look, then continued: "The Merit Hall can also post missions — for instance, since you want to unify all realms, we can post expansion missions. Complete a mission, earn points. It incentivizes everyone. Members can also spend their own points to post tasks for each other — creating a trading platform within the manor. And there's also—"

She kept going. Qin Jiang just nodded along, dropping the occasional compliment to keep the emotional support flowing.

"Wan'er, you're amazing."

He grinned, gave her a thumbs up, leaned in, and planted a kiss on her cheek.

She shot him a look of fond annoyance, then settled into his arms. "Once the factions have adapted, we can establish a Huaxia Academy — select talented disciples from every member faction and train them together. It'll create bonds between the factions and build a sense of belonging over time. Especially the next generation — raised by the academy, their loyalty will run deep."

"Good." Qin Jiang nodded. "I was just racking my brain over how to make them feel like they belong, and you've already solved it."

"You need to use that brain of yours more." She tapped his forehead.

This man spent his days doing nothing, never thinking anything through, defaulting to violence for every problem. If Huaxia Manor were entirely in his hands, he'd probably slaughter his own people within the month.

Qin Jiang chuckled and held her tighter. "With you, Xihe, Qing Chan, and the rest — why would I need to think? I'm just the mascot."

"You can't only be the mascot." Liu Shuwan's tone turned thoughtful. "Your approach to the grudge problem was good — it made the leaders respect you. We can stage a few more demonstrations of authority later. But we can't overdo it. They need to fear you a little, be grateful to you for rewards, and admire you for your abilities... We'll need to workshop your public image."

"Just stage some crises and let me save the day," Qin Jiang said without missing a beat. "They'll admire me for sure."

"Too fake." Liu Shuwan shook her head. "With Xihe-jiejie around, what kind of crisis could possibly threaten Huaxia Manor?"

Good point. An Xihe was so powerful she eclipsed his spotlight entirely.

He'd briefly considered a grassroots approach, but this was a cultivation world. Grassroots meant ants — all effort, no payoff.

"There's no rush," Liu Shuwan said, lifting a hand to caress his cheek. "The Merit Hall's treasures will largely come from you. That alone will earn their gratitude. Beyond that, your talent means your power will grow fast. You don't need to do anything special — once your strength catches up, the respect will follow naturally. So... less slacking off from now on."

The conversation had somehow circled back to his laziness. Qin Jiang shrugged.

He gazed down at Liu Shuwan in his arms and licked his lips. "I can stop slacking. But I'm not sure you all can keep up."

"Hm?"

"Hehe. Wan'er, don't forget — I've comprehended the Yin-Yang Law now. The most efficient way to cultivate is together with all of you..."

Liu Shuwan's face flushed. She swatted his chest lightly. "Your Taotie Divine Body cultivates faster on its own, doesn't it?"

"Sure, but when we cultivate together, I can use the Taotie Divine Body too. After all, the water-attribute essence you produce is quite... energy-rich. I can absorb it."

"You— you're terrible!"

Her face went scarlet. This wolf said absolutely anything that came to mind. It was the truth, but still — mortifying.
