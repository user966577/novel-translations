The speed of that about-face was truly humbling.

Hu Yan practically sprinted to Qin Jiang's side, his face blooming into the warmest of smiles. "Son-in-law, it's settled then. The Fox Race joins your faction."

One "son-in-law" after another, dripping with warmth. Qin Jiang matched his energy with a grin.

He clapped Hu Yan on the shoulder. "Uncle, you really are... a fine clan chief."

"Ha, you flatter me, son-in-law. The Fox Race will be counting on your patronage from now on."

"Don't worry. The Wolf Race is gone — their legacy can be split among the Fox Race, Snake Race, and Celestial Rabbit Tribe."

A stick followed by a carrot. Hu Yan's eyes lit up. The Wolf Race's accumulated wealth, as the Demon Domain's premier power for generations, was staggering. Even a third of it would dramatically strengthen the Fox Race.

He'd have preferred more, of course. But the Snake Race had deep ties to Qin Jiang, and the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's Immortal-level elder was also Qin Jiang's woman. A third was the realistic ceiling.

"Thank you, son-in-law." He bowed.

Privately, he was already calculating how to squeeze out a slightly larger share.

Just then, he sensed multiple powerful auras converging on the courtyard. Fox Race leaders, arriving in force.

"Son-in-law, the Fox Race leadership is arriving. Shall I brief them?"

"Go ahead."

The gate opened. Fox Race elders poured in.

"Clan Chief! The Wolf Race has been destroyed!"

One of them burst out the news, voice trembling with excitement. Hu Yan smiled ruefully and glanced at An Xihe. None of these people knew the annihilator was standing right in front of them. All they'd seen was a sky-covering palm that had erased the Wolf Race from existence.

The elders clamored — grab the territory, seize the resources, move now before someone else did.

Hu Yan raised a hand for silence, then stood beside Qin Jiang. "Allow me to introduce my son-in-law, Qin Jiang."

Silence.

The two Human Immortal elders who'd met Qin Jiang before nodded politely. The rest had heard the name but had never seen their clan chief this deferential.

"One more announcement while you're all here." His expression turned grave. "My son-in-law is establishing a faction, and our Fox Race has been honored with an invitation to join. Effective immediately, the Fox Race is a member of his organization."

Dead silence.

Joining someone else's faction? And needing to be "honored with an invitation"? When had the Fox Race, overlords of the Demon Domain, become so humble?

Before anyone could protest, Hu Yan continued, "That's final. No debate. Now — your assignment: prepare to receive one-third of the Wolf Race's legacy."

He watched Qin Jiang from the corner of his eye. The young man's expression didn't change at "one-third" — tacit approval. Hu Yan exhaled.

The elders were stunned. One-third of the Wolf Race's wealth? Already claimed? The corpse was barely cold.

But the two Human Immortal elders, who'd connected the dots, spoke first. "Clan Chief, we'll handle the Wolf Race transfer. Consider it done."

They waved the others out. The bewildered elders followed, questions buzzing.

The third Human Immortal elder, though uncertain, trusted his old friends' judgment. Whatever was happening, the clan chief and the other two patriarchs wouldn't lead the Fox Race astray. He nodded politely at Qin Jiang and departed.

Hu Yan sagged with relief. Smart people, all of them. He'd been terrified someone might challenge Qin Jiang to his face — that would not have ended well.
