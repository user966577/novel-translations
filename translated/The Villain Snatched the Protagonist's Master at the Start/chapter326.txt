Chen Ningbing's bravado didn't last long.

The moment contact was made, her expression shifted. Qin Jiang was stronger than she'd anticipated. She bit down and doubled her efforts, pressing him down, trying to seize the initiative in one burst.

But no matter how hard she pushed, he remained immovable. To him, her assault was nothing more than gentle waves lapping at a cliff.

He lay there, utterly relaxed. Though beneath her, he radiated an air of absolute dominance. His eyes roamed appreciatively — she really had grown, compared to before.

Meanwhile, his hands had found their favorite perches and were relaying their enthusiasm with great vigor.

"Mm~" A pained gasp. She grabbed his hands and complained, "Lighter~"

"Ahem." He looked innocently at her. "I can't control them."

She rolled her eyes, gripping his hands firmly. "If you can't control them, I will."

"Works for me."

Under her guidance, the targeting became even more precise. Qin Jiang closed his eyes and savored the experience. Chen Ningbing, jaw set with determination, threw everything she had at him.

But as the saying went — the first charge carries spirit, the second wavers, the third collapses. Her stamina drained steadily. Meanwhile, Qin Jiang remained as leisurely as ever.

She deflated, flopping onto his chest and gazing up at him with wounded eyes. He opened his own eyes, took one look at her expression, and laughed.

He pinched her cheek. "Done already?"

Done? Chen Ningbing clenched her teeth and pushed herself up again, glaring daggers at him. "Hmph. Done? We're just getting started!"

"If you say so." He shrugged, repositioned his hands, and closed his eyes again. "Go ahead."

His dismissive posture — eyes shut, clearly unimpressed — made her cheeks puff up with indignation. She ground her teeth, wanting nothing more than to bite him.

Bite him? Her eyes lit up with cunning. Right. She wasn't limited to just one approach.

She shifted her position and launched a new offensive.

"Hss—" Qin Jiang sucked in a sharp breath and frowned slightly. He patted her head. "Ningbing, that's a little... sharp. Be careful — if you actually hurt something, you'll be the one crying."

She grumbled a muffled protest and rolled her eyes before doubling down. Sharp? Please. She was just out of practice.

Chen Ningbing gave it her all. She cycled through every technique she could think of, some more than once. The results weren't nothing, but the exchange rate was brutal — eight hundred damage dealt, ten thousand taken.

She was truly running out of ideas. How was he this strong?

"Little Ningbing, got any more tricks? Bring them on — I can take it!" His smirk made her pout. She'd exhausted her entire arsenal, and besides, every single technique just let him enjoy himself more at her expense.

She shook her head and collapsed against his chest. "Nothing. I've got nothing left."

"Nothing?" His eyebrow rose. "Well then — my turn."

Before she could react, the world spun and she found herself pinned beneath him. The tables had turned.

Memories of his prowess flooded back, and Chen Ningbing paled. It was over. Now she understood why Chu Hanyan and the others had fled. This was unsurvivable.

"Qin Jiang, I—" Panic flashed in her eyes as she searched for an excuse to escape. But she was alone. No reinforcements were coming. And he was already past the point of no return.

He silenced her with a kiss. What followed was the hunting hour.

Every technique she'd used on him, he returned — upgraded.

"Waaah, you jerk, I don't want anymore~" Red-eyed and trembling, she shoved at him weakly, voice thick with grievance.

The brute. She was already crying and he still wouldn't stop. Inhuman. An absolute beast.

She glared at him through tearful eyes, her earlier swagger a distant memory, replaced by pitiful pleas for mercy.

Finally, Qin Jiang showed mercy. He gathered her into his arms and soothed her gently. She kept her pout, eyes still red, wearing a look that said she was categorically impossible to console.

This stubborn pride only made her more endearing.

And of course, she wasn't actually inconsolable. A few kisses and she nipped his lip — her way of accepting the truce. After that, she clung to him like a koala, refusing to let go, insisting he stay and sleep with her.

He didn't object. Between his return and all the repayment sessions, he was genuinely tired. He held her close, savoring the softness, and drifted off.

Roughly half a day later, he woke to find her still curled against him, sound asleep. He kissed her gently. She smacked her lips and nuzzled deeper.

He chuckled — and immediately felt warmth on both sides of his face. Liu Shuwan, Qing Chan, and several others had slipped in while he slept.

Before he could speak, Liu Shuwan pressed a finger to her lips and pointed at Chen Ningbing. "Don't wake her."

They all knew what it meant to face Qin Jiang alone. She needed the rest.

He nodded and chatted quietly with them. About two months had passed inside the Space-Time Temple, but less than a day outside.

Eventually, Chen Ningbing stirred. She blinked sleepily at the gathering of women and blushed. At the same time, warmth touched her heart — they'd all held back just so she could sleep.

Good sisters indeed.
