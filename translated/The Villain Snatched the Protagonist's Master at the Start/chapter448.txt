It took a good while before Weiwei's master managed to extract her hand.

Her skin was impossibly smooth, and Qin Jiang's grip had simply... slipped. He was mildly disappointed but didn't push further.

The master, meanwhile, took two discreet steps back. Her so-called son-in-law was clearly not a good man. Her eyes swept over the women at his side, and alarm bells rang — aside from one at the Supreme Realm, the other four were all at her level or above.

True Immortals. Two of them. And they clearly deferred to this man.

Her mind raced. In all the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, only one person commanded that kind of loyalty. The lord of Huaxia — Qin Jiang.

It had to be him.

Her fists clenched subtly, wariness flickering in her gaze. Qin Jiang's most infamous reputation? Lech. Which meant his wandering hands earlier had been no illusion. He'd targeted her deliberately.

Just then, Weiwei took her arm. "Master, you called me back. Is something wrong?"

"Hm?" Mu Yunxiao — for that was her name — snapped back to the present.

But before she could speak, Qin Jiang cut in. "Something's wrong with Mother-in-law's body, isn't it? I can sense that the spiritual energy inside you is becoming unstable."

"What? Master, your body's acting up?" Weiwei grabbed her arm, eyes wide with worry.

Mu Yunxiao glanced at Qin Jiang, then down at her anxious disciple. She stroked Weiwei's hair and shook her head gently. "I'm fine. It's the same old problem."

Her body had been flawed since birth — dual ice-fire attributes that constantly clashed, with ice overwhelming fire. The resulting imbalance made her spiritual energy volatile, erupting periodically. And as she'd grown stronger over the years, the eruptions had worsened, sometimes leaving her severely injured.

It was one of the reasons she lived in seclusion. In the outside world, conflict was inevitable, and while casual fights were fine, any intense battle would trigger an eruption.

Weiwei relaxed a little. She knew about her master's condition — it had flared up countless times over the years. Nothing new.

"By the way, Weiwei — how many fire-attribute spirit medicines did you bring back?"

Weiwei froze. "Huh? I didn't bring any. Don't we have a stockpile?"

To compensate for the imbalance, Mu Yunxiao regularly used fire-attribute medicines to boost her weaker fire aspect. It was a stopgap — the medicines only provided temporary energy, unable to permanently repair her fire-attribute origin. Once the effect faded, ice reasserted dominance, and she'd need more medicine. For her, fire-attribute spirit medicines were an essential consumable.

But this time, a violent eruption during seclusion — the worst she'd ever experienced — had depleted her entire reserve. She'd barely managed to suppress it. Now the balance inside her was razor-thin, and she'd messaged Weiwei to bring more supplies.

"You didn't bring any?" Mu Yunxiao sighed.

"Your message didn't say to bring medicine!" Weiwei protested. "Didn't you send junior brother to tell me?"

Mu Yunxiao frowned. "He didn't come back?"

Weiwei shook her head. She'd been too preoccupied with Qin Jiang to pay any attention to Nangong Yun's whereabouts.

Qin Jiang stepped in. "He's probably still busy with Anti-Huaxia Alliance affairs. He'll come back when he's done." Then, casually: "Mother-in-law, you need fire-attribute spirit medicines? I happen to have some."

But Mu Yunxiao had stopped listening at the words "Anti-Huaxia Alliance."

"The Anti-Huaxia Alliance?" she repeated, dazed.

"Yep. Junior brother founded it. I joined too — I'm a card-carrying member."

"You?" Her eyes went wide. She might live as a hermit, but she'd heard of Huaxia's fearsome reputation. The Nangong family had been destroyed by Huaxia. She'd taken in Nangong Yun out of pity, figuring that hiding in the mountains would keep him safe. And now, after just one year of seclusion, he'd gone and founded an Anti-Huaxia Alliance? Was he trying to get himself killed?

As for this man joining the Alliance — that made no sense at all. Had she guessed wrong? Was he not Huaxia's lord?

She hesitated, then asked, "Your name is...?"

"Oh right, let me introduce myself." He tapped his forehead, then smiled broadly. "I'm Qin Jiang."

Three simple words sent her reeling. Just as she'd thought — it was him.

Looking at his smile, a chill ran down her spine. Weiwei noticed her swaying and caught her arm. "Master, are you alright?"
