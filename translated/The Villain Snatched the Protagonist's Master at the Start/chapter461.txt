They traded one final blow and separated. Nangong Yun's face was grim. "How is he this strong?"

He couldn't accept it. He was a genius — he should be unmatched at his level. And during the chase, this man had clearly been weaker. But now...

He clenched his fists but didn't charge again. More powerful auras were converging — Zhou family reinforcements. If they were all this strong, he'd have no choice but to run. Bitter as it was, he turned and fled.

The Zhou family Great Emperor gave a token chase, then stopped. Several more arrived. "Found Nangong Yun?"

"He came to me. And just as Lord Black Dragon predicted — he's broken through to Great Emperor."

"Already? In this short a time, while we had him surrounded?" The others were stunned.

The one who'd fought him added, "Not only that — his strength rivals mine." That drew even more surprise. They'd each been Great Emperors for centuries, far stronger than the day of their breakthrough. For a freshly minted Great Emperor to match them spoke to genuine talent.

They watched him vanish into the distance and didn't pursue, returning instead to the former Alliance base. The Zhou family operatives lounged around, bored. Toying with Nangong Yun was hardly stimulating, especially when they had to hold back.

The news reached Black Dragon quickly. "Greetings, Lord Black Dragon." The Zhou family members bowed.

Black Dragon waved them off and turned to the one who'd fought Nangong Yun. "He broke through?"

"Yes. Your foresight is remarkable, my lord."

"Credit belongs to the Manor Lord. I'm merely the messenger."

That opened the floodgates. The Zhou family members fell over themselves praising Qin Jiang until their mouths went dry. Black Dragon let them finish — he rather enjoyed hearing his master praised.

"Enough. Since Nangong Yun has reached Great Emperor, deploy Ancient Emperors for the pursuit. And send one Human Immortal — there's something on him that the Manor Lord needs. Strip him of everything. Don't miss so much as a pebble."

"Yes, sir."

Back in the mountains, Mu Yunxiao's courtyard had been expanded many times over. She watched in slack-jawed shock as hundreds of women flooded in, swarming Qin Jiang like they wanted to devour him alive. Every single one was his.

So many. No wonder he'd enlarged the courtyard — anything smaller couldn't fit them all.

Weiwei and Xue Yue were equally stunned. They'd known Qin Jiang had "quite a few" women, but the reality was staggering. And every one of them was devastatingly beautiful — graceful, cute, sultry, innocent, playful, gentle, every type imaginable. Together, they were breathtaking. Even other women couldn't help but stare.

Qin Jiang's eyes darted everywhere, unable to take it all in.

Under his direction, the crowd eventually squeezed into a purpose-built grand chamber. He introduced Mu Yunxiao, Weiwei, and Xue Yue. The rest could get acquainted on their own — there were simply too many for individual introductions.

Some women were still in secluded cultivation within the Space-Time Temple. Most had emerged, though. An Xihe, the strongest, had finally exited seclusion with dramatically improved cultivation. The treasures Qin Jiang provided were effective — and eye-wateringly expensive. At her level, a single resource cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of Villain Points. She was bleeding him dry.

Fortunately, he had a new Villain Point supplier, and the recent fleecing of his Children of Destiny had replenished his reserves. With time remaining before the Heavenly Domain opened, he could keep earning.

While Qin Jiang tallied his points, the women fixed him with glittering eyes. They'd been stuck on the airship, watching from afar, unable to touch him for far too long. Now that An Xihe was out and they didn't need to stand guard, they'd come running. They were starving. And this time, they intended to feast.

Under their collective gaze, Qin Jiang looked around and raised an eyebrow. They all looked hungry. Well, they'd been deprived for days — he owed them.

"Hungry?"

They nodded in unison, tongues darting across their lips.

He grinned. "Then I'll cook. I promise to fill every single one of you until you're stuffed."

"We want porridge!"

"Of course. Porridge is my specialty. I'll make it so good you won't be able to think straight."

"Yay! Cook for us!"

They crowded close. Cooking required their participation, naturally, and his food was best enjoyed hot — straight from the pot. Fresh porridge was the most fragrant. They drank it all every time, until their bellies were round and full. That feeling of satisfaction was what they loved most.

The process took a while, and he needed them to add water before the porridge could start. But his service was excellent — the moment a batch was ready, he'd personally spoon it into their mouths.

Delicious.
