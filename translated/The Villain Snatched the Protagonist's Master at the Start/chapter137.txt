The Seven Beauties Painting trembled.

A gentle force pushed Qin Jiang and Liu Shuwan back. In the next instant, space around the painting began to warp and shudder.

Qin Jiang's eyebrows rose. The Void Divine Temple's spatial fabric was far tougher than the outside world's—even Liu Shuwan going all out could barely tear it. Yet a single wisp of Jian Yao's unintentional energy had set it rippling.

"So this is the power of the immortal path," he murmured.

The Seven Beauties Painting snapped open, and Jian Yao's figure emerged, seated cross-legged in the void. Her eyes were closed. Wave after wave of power radiated outward, her aura vast and boundless, blanketing the entire Void Divine Temple.

Outside, the world erupted with celestial phenomena—brilliant light cascading across the sky, heaven and earth trembling as if celebrating the advent of an immortal.

Every powerful cultivator across the Divine Dragon Empire jerked their heads up. A pressure on the soul level made them shudder, and a crushing sense of insignificance settled over all of them.

In the imperial palace, the Dragon Emperor's face was grave. He strode out of his throne hall and looked skyward at the airship. The phenomena seemed to be emanating from it.

"What's happening..." he breathed.

He had his suspicions, but could scarcely bring himself to believe them.

The four Imperial Patrons appeared at his side, equally shaken, staring at the airship.

"The immortal path?"

"It must be someone mid-breakthrough. I never imagined I'd live to witness the birth of an immortal-path powerhouse."

"Qin Jiang had someone this powerful hidden away? Thank the heavens we've stayed on good terms with him."

"Indeed. He concealed it well."

They weren't the only ones stunned. Aboard the airship, Fourth Ancestor and the other Great Emperors gaped at the Void Divine Temple. They knew the temple housed Qin Jiang's women. What they hadn't known was that one of them was this terrifying.

"That aura... it's the legendary immortal path, isn't it?"

"When did Xiao Jiang find himself a wife this powerful?"

"Is it the Holy Sword Sect Saintess? No—she's around our level. She couldn't break through to the immortal path this quickly."

"Didn't he bring back an immortal-path being recently? Maybe he unsealed her?"

"Can't be. The aura's different."

"That boy's been hiding things even from us."

The ancestral elders muttered among themselves, exchanged glances, then flashed to positions around the airship. Their overwhelming auras erupted, warding off all comers.

At that moment, a painting shot toward them. Fourth Ancestor intercepted it—the Demon Hall Founder.

She stared at the Void Divine Temple, trembling with barely contained excitement. "The immortal path... it's actually the immortal path..."

If Qin Jiang now had an immortal-path ally, he no longer needed to worry about her being a threat. Surely he'd break her seal now?

Hope surged through her. She'd been prepared to wait five thousand years, yet here was fortune knocking early.

Fourth Ancestor watched her warily. This was a critical juncture—Jian Yao's breakthrough couldn't be disturbed, and the Demon Hall Founder was a wild card. But the Founder stopped at the airship's perimeter and came no closer.

The breakthrough took time.

The immense aura blanketed the Divine Dragon Empire for a full two weeks before gradually receding.

Inside the Void Divine Temple, Jian Yao opened her eyes. Razor-sharp sword intent exploded outward before she reined it in, her aura vanishing completely.

She looked up at Qin Jiang, and a smile blossomed across her face.

"Qin Jiang."

She threw herself into his arms, burying her face against him and breathing in his scent. After a long moment, she lifted her head and greeted Liu Shuwan and the other women.

"Sister Yao, how does it feel?" Liu Shuwan asked, curiosity written all over her face. The others crowded in too, fascinated. The immortal path was impossibly distant for them, but that didn't dampen their interest.

"Powerful." Jian Yao clenched her fist, expression earnest. "Before, I thought Ancient Emperor was the pinnacle. But now that I've stepped onto the immortal path, that level of cultivation isn't even worth mentioning."

Liu Shuwan: "..."

Ancient Emperor wasn't even worth mentioning? She herself was still a step below Ancient Emperor. As for the others, they weren't even Great Emperors yet.

A wave of collective dejection swept through the women.

Qin Jiang laughed. "You just broke through. Can you access your full immortal-path power?"

"Absolutely." Jian Yao nodded with confidence, then pumped her fists eagerly. "Who do you need me to fight? I'll do it!"

"An immortal-path being."

"Huh?"

Shortly after, Qin Jiang left briefly and returned with the Demon Hall Founder—painting and all—to the Void Divine Temple.

"You're really going to break my seal?" For once, the Founder's voice betrayed genuine excitement.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. Beside him, Jian Yao studied the painting curiously; she could sense the immortal-path aura within it.

He turned to Jian Yao. "Think you can handle it?"

Jian Yao considered for a moment, scrutinizing the Founder's painting. "No problem."

An immortal-path cultivator sealed for millions of years would be lucky to recover even a tenth of her strength right after being freed. Subduing her wouldn't be an issue.

The only wildcard was appearance—it was like opening a blind box. If an old crone popped out... Jian Yao shot Qin Jiang a strange look. She wondered whether he'd still go through with it.

"She's going to break my seal?" The Founder had overheard their exchange and was studying Jian Yao, wondering about their relationship. An immortal-path powerhouse, practically taking orders from this young man?

"No," Qin Jiang said. He pressed a finger to the painting and channeled the Immortal King Seal.

The painting convulsed. Simultaneously, he barked: "Hit it together—inside and out!"

"Done!"

The Founder could feel the seal weakening and needed no urging. She threw every scrap of remaining power against it, and the painting split apart. Demonic qi boiled outward as cracks raced across its surface.

"Break!"

With one final coordinated push, the painting tore to shreds.

A petite figure materialized before Qin Jiang.

"Hahahaha! Free at last!"

The Demon Hall Founder cackled wildly, demonic qi rampaging around her.

Qin Jiang's eyebrow arched.

She was tiny. A little girl, barely over five feet tall, with long purple hair, faintly crimson eyes, and delicate features touched with baby fat—like a porcelain doll. Bewitching and adorable in equal measure.

The great and terrible Demon Hall Founder—an immortal-path existence—was a loli.

And one who'd been alive for countless ages.

Definitely a legal loli.
