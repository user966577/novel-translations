Chen Changsheng shook off his pursuers and cleansed every tracking mark from his body. His expression was grim.

Hiding in a secluded corner, he suppressed his aura as much as possible. He could still faintly hear footsteps—his hunters hadn't given up—and the occasional figure streaked across the sky overhead, though none spotted him.

He exhaled quietly. Fortunately, the news hadn't spread far yet. His current pursuers didn't include anyone truly powerful. But if word got out, Great Emperors—even Ancient Emperors—might come after him.

He pulled out the Ancient Emperor Pill and gently shook the vial, sighing. The curse of possessing a treasure beyond one's ability to protect.

As he held it, a calculating look crossed his face. The Azure Lotus Divine Palace was a dead end now. They'd firmly aligned with Qin Jiang. Forget receiving help—he should count himself lucky they hadn't hunted him down personally.

"Qin Jiang's support keeps growing."

Jealousy flashed in his eyes. Why did all these women flock to Qin Jiang? What did that man have that he didn't? A bunch of shallow idiots, the lot of them!

He scoffed. Without the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, there was still the Limitless Holy Land and the Human Dao Sect. It would be harder, but he could still win one of them over.

First, though, he had to shake his pursuers completely. There were too many to fight—his only option was to hide. Once the heat died down, he'd head for one of the two remaining factions.

He sat cross-legged, intending to rest.

Then the jade vial trembled in his hand.

"Hm? What's happening?"

Odd. Pills at this level did develop a certain sentience, but he'd already neutralized this one—

He was reaching to open it when the vial shattered. A devastating explosion erupted from his palm. The hand holding the vial was blown clean off. The blast left him a bloody mess, his ears ringing, his mind blank.

He sat in stunned silence, unable to even feel the pain.

Then hurried footsteps—his pursuers, drawn by the explosion. They found him quickly. Frowning at the bloody, mangled figure, they couldn't identify him. The gore had rendered him unrecognizable, and with his aura suppressed, no one connected him to their target.

"Hey, buddy—you alright?"

One of them spoke, pity in their eyes. This poor bastard had clearly had a rough day.

The pain finally hit, jolting Chen Changsheng back to reality. Surrounded, he scrambled to his feet and glared warily.

"What happened here? How'd you end up like this?"

It took him a moment to process—they hadn't recognized him. He looked down. His entire body was flayed to the bone, one hand gone, the arm ruined. His face was probably just as mangled.

Ten lifetimes, and this was the worst he'd ever looked.

'An Explosive Pill.'

As an alchemist, he recognized it immediately. The vial hadn't contained his Ancient Emperor Pill—it was an Explosive Pill. The Azure Lotus Divine Palace had swapped it out.

Rage boiled inside him, twisting his already ravaged face into something nightmarish. The crowd flinched.

"Bloody hell, you scared me!"

"Answer the question—what happened? Talk, or I'll put you out of your misery."

Chen Changsheng fixed them with a cold stare. He needed to get rid of these people immediately.

He hesitated briefly, then rasped: "It was Chen Changsheng. I found him, but he threw an Explosive Pill at me. Blew me up like this. He ran that way."

"Chen Changsheng?" Their eyes lit up. "Which direction?"

He pointed at random. The pursuers ignored him and charged off.

Once they were gone, Chen Changsheng laughed bitterly. In his current state, no one could recognize him anyway.

Dragging his ruined body in the opposite direction, his voice echoed behind him, dripping with killing intent:

"Azure Lotus Divine Palace... Qin Jiang... Ning Xue'er..."

His hatred for Qin Jiang and the palace had reached its absolute peak.

Elsewhere, a blind beggar stopped at the edge of the Central Regions. Chen Qi'er. Though he'd sealed his own cultivation, his speed was still extraordinary—he'd arrived at roughly the same time as Qin Jiang.

Gazing at the Central Regions, he murmured: "My seal can be released now."

A hundred years of self-imposed exile. A hundred years of Red Dust Heart Tempering. It was complete.

He hurled his rusty sword skyward. A flash of sword light sliced down, severing the black cloth over his eyes. Beneath it—empty sockets, dark and hollow.

The rusty sword trembled, splitting into two streams of energy that plunged into his eye sockets, coalescing into a pair of eyes. First just whorls of energy, then gradually, they solidified into real, living eyes.

His aura skyrocketed. Immortal energy swept in all directions, scattering bystanders in terror.

He stood motionless for two hours as his aura stabilized. A smile spread across his face.

"Human Immortal Perfection. One more step, and I'll reach True Immortal."

A hundred years of bitter cultivation, advancing from early Human Immortal to Human Immortal Perfection. Who else could match such speed?

"I, Chen Qi'er, am the strongest prodigy of this era. My future lies at the supreme pinnacle."

He wasted no time, vanishing into the Central Regions. He hadn't forgotten—there was a man called Chen Changsheng who'd claimed his technique was complete and he had nothing to fear.

Chen Qi'er intended to see just where that confidence came from.

It didn't take long to pick up a trail.

"This Chen Changsheng has made quite a name for himself." He frowned. "But his cultivation is only at the Supreme Realm? Did he seal himself like I did? Possibly—anyone who can produce an Ancient Emperor Pill is no ordinary Supreme. But then his technique shouldn't be complete yet."

He smirked. "Your dear friend tried to bully me when my technique was still developing. Now that yours isn't complete either—I won't be holding back!"

And with that, he vanished, hunting for Chen Changsheng.
