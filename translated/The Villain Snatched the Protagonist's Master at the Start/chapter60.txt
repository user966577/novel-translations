"Haul him away!" Qin Jiang dusted off his hands and looked toward Bai Jingyun in the spectator area.

Bai Jingyun walked onto the arena and winced at the pitiful sight of Lin Chen. But he shelved his concern for the moment. Instead, he rubbed his hands together and turned to Qin Jiang.

"Ahem, my boy—is there any chance, hypothetically, that you might be a disciple of our Holy Sword Sect?"

Qin Jiang: "???"

What kind of nonsense was this?

"Think about it. Susu is my daughter, right? And you're Susu's husband. You and Susu are family, and Susu and I are family, so by extension, you and I are family too. And since I'm the Holy Sword Sect Master, doesn't that make you a Holy Sword Sect disciple?"

Through some creative arithmetic, Bai Jingyun had essentially naturalized Qin Jiang into his sect. Just then, Qin Hao appeared on the arena.

"Bai Jingyun, what are you blathering about? Take your disciple and go. My Qin family's young patriarch doesn't need your measly Holy Sword Sect." He looked at Bai Jingyun with unconcealed disdain.

Bai Jingyun bristled, but remembering that Qin Hao was Qin Jiang's father, his bravado deflated. "Can't you at least consider it? Our Holy Sword Sect isn't weak, you know. And given the relationship between Qin Jiang and Susu, couldn't he at least be an honorary member?"

"Honorary?" Qin Hao considered for a moment, then looked at his son. "Jiang'er, what do you think?"

"I'll pass," Qin Jiang said, shaking his head. "With my status, I hardly need another title."

"I can give you the position of Holy Son—equal standing with me!" Bai Jingyun pressed.

"Equal standing?" Qin Jiang gave him an odd look. "Correct me if I'm wrong, but according to the rules of sword cultivation, my Sword Heart realm makes me a Sword Emperor—able to command all sword cultivators under heaven."

Bai Jingyun: "..."

Truthfully, he wouldn't mind being outranked—Qin Jiang was a Sword Emperor, after all. But before he could formulate a response, Qin Jiang glanced down at the unconscious Lin Chen.

"Besides, the Holy Son title would put me on the same level as him. Do you honestly think he's worthy of sharing a rank with me?"

"Uh..." Bai Jingyun looked at Lin Chen. The young man was undeniably talented—possibly surpassing even the heirs of other ancient clans. But compared to Qin Jiang? The gap was simply too vast. He truly wasn't worthy of sharing the Holy Son title. Giving them equal standing would actually be dragging Qin Jiang down.

A thought struck him. What if he revoked Lin Chen's Holy Son status instead?

He stroked his chin. It was feasible. Though he'd have to discuss it with Lin Chen first—the boy was still his disciple. And there was always the possibility that Lin Chen could reach Sword Heart in the future.

Bai Jingyun sighed. "How about this: once Lin Chen wakes up, I'll talk to him about stepping down as Holy Son. Then you'd be our sect's sole Holy Son, with authority above my own."

"Revoke Lin Chen's Holy Son status?" Qin Jiang was genuinely surprised. He knew how much Bai Jingyun valued Lin Chen—the man had been willing to marry his beloved daughter to him. And now he wanted to strip Lin Chen of his title?

He hadn't seen that coming. His earlier refusal had been pure disinterest. But if Bai Jingyun was going to revoke Lin Chen's title over this? Well, suddenly he wasn't so disinterested anymore.

"If you revoke his Holy Son status, I'll consider taking the position." Qin Jiang nodded.

Bai Jingyun was overjoyed. "Rest assured—I'll make it happen."

Looking at this more clearly now, Qin Jiang understood. Bai Jingyun's devotion had never been to Lin Chen personally—it had been to the Sword Heart realm. Now that Qin Jiang had achieved it, Lin Chen's importance had plummeted. To Bai Jingyun, Qin Jiang was now the one who mattered most.

With the spar concluded, Bai Jingyun carried Lin Chen away. The Qin family elders, meanwhile, swarmed Qin Jiang.

"Jiang'er, show us your Sword Heart! Come on!"

"Heh heh, a Sword Heart master could massively boost our Qin family's strength. With one word from you, who knows how many powerful swordsmen would come knocking."

"Let's not recruit too many outsiders, though."

"Bah, that's a problem for later. Jiang'er, besides Sword Heart, what other trump cards have you got? Show us, show us!"

Surrounded by eager elders, Qin Jiang felt somewhat helpless. Every last one of them was ancient, yet their curiosity rivaled a child's. "I do have a few more tricks up my sleeve." He rubbed his chin. "Step back a bit and I'll show you."

They hastily backed away, watching with anticipation. In a flash, Qin Jiang appeared beside Bai Susu—who'd been waiting for him in the spectator area—swept her into his arms, and vanished from the training grounds in a blur.

His parting words hung in the air: "I've got more cards, but I'm not showing them to you lot!"

The Qin family elders: "..."

They stood there, stupefied, for several long seconds before the indignation hit.

"That little bastard dangled the bait and ran!"

"Damn it, I'm not going to sleep tonight!"

"Sigh, Jiang'er has already reached Sword Heart. His other trump cards can't be weak. I just wish I knew what they were..."

"Forget it. We'll find out eventually."

Meanwhile, Bai Jingyun brought Lin Chen back to the guest quarters and administered some quick treatment. Despite the bruises and swelling, Lin Chen's actual injuries weren't severe. However, having burned so much Primordial Spirit Power, he was genuinely weakened.

Lin Chen opened his eyes. "Chen'er, you're awake?" Bai Jingyun sat at his bedside, concern written on his face.

Lin Chen nodded. The hollow feeling of depletion made him frown—but at least he was alive.

"Ahem, Chen'er, there's something I'd like to discuss with you." Bai Jingyun coughed and got straight to the point.

"Please go ahead, Master." On the surface, Lin Chen maintained his respectful demeanor.

Bai Jingyun hesitated. He'd been the one who'd championed Lin Chen's appointment as Holy Son over all objections, and now he was the one proposing to take it away. The hypocrisy made him uncomfortable. But the thought of Sword Heart steeled his resolve. He took a deep breath.

"Chen'er, I feel your current strength isn't quite sufficient for the Holy Son position. How about... you step down?"

Lin Chen: "???"

His expression froze. He stared at Bai Jingyun in disbelief. 'That's not what you said when you gave me the title!' But the reason was immediately obvious. His face darkened.

"Is this because of Qin Jiang?"

"Yes." Bai Jingyun nodded. Now that he'd broached the subject, there was no point being coy. "Qin Jiang possesses Sword Heart. He's more suited to be Holy Son than you are."
