Qin Jiang swept his arm out, and Brother Jie—who'd been holding Nangong Yun—was sent flying. Nangong Yun blinked in confusion, then lifted his head.

The moment he saw Qin Jiang, his pupils contracted. Memories came rushing back. Him. The man who'd taken everything from him.

Hatred blazed in his eyes. His current wretched state was largely this man's doing.

"Heh, Nangong Yun. Remember me?" Qin Jiang said with a light laugh.

Nangong Yun trembled. He quickly masked his hatred, forcing a stiff smile. "Of course. We were friends, once."

"Friends?" Qin Jiang couldn't help but laugh. The pity in his eyes was unmistakable. This man probably still didn't know who he really was. In over twenty years, Nangong Yun hadn't accomplished a single useful thing—he'd either been hiding in mountain hollows or seducing men, occasionally getting chased by the Zhou family. His life was thoroughly pathetic.

Though, to be fair, Nangong Yun seemed to enjoy it. He'd even put on weight.

"Sure. We were both in the Anti-Huaxia Alliance. Doesn't that make us friends?" Nangong Yun said.

Qin Jiang smiled, eyes full of mockery. He spread his arms wide. "Then perhaps you should know—all of Huaxia is mine."

"???"

Nangong Yun's jaw dropped. All of Huaxia was his? What did that mean?

Reading Qin Jiang's expression, the truth crashed into him. He stared in disbelief, voice stumbling. "Y-you're... you're the Lord of Huaxia?"

"At least you have a brain."

The color drained from Nangong Yun's face, then flooded back crimson with fury. The Lord of Huaxia—the one who'd destroyed his family, who'd stolen his master, his senior sister. Even Xue Yue, who'd once had feelings for him, had been taken.

He had nothing left. All because of this man.

And during all of it, the Lord of Huaxia had been playing him like a fiddle—joining his pitiable anti-Huaxia alliance in person. In hindsight, he'd been nothing more than a clown.

Nangong Yun's face cycled through shades of green and white. He glared at Qin Jiang with clenched teeth. Finally, the hatred boiled over. With a roar, he launched himself skyward, attacking with everything he had.

His cultivation had reached Ancient Emperor—a respectable force in his fury. "Die!" he screamed.

Black Dragon didn't even let him get close. A single breath of dragon fire swatted Nangong Yun from the sky. An Ancient Emperor daring to attack his young master? Laughable.

Nangong Yun cratered into the ground, body broken, blood pouring from his mouth. The crowd watched in horror, too terrified to go near him. But then Brother Jie came staggering over, already injured from Qin Jiang's earlier blow, and gathered Nangong Yun into his arms.

"Yun'er, Yun'er, are you alright?"

"Jie..." Nangong Yun called out softly, tenderly. He swallowed blood and managed, "I'm fine."

With Brother Jie's help, Nangong Yun struggled to his feet and glared upward at Qin Jiang, hatred undimmed. Brother Jie held him, eyes full of heartbreak. He followed Nangong Yun's gaze upward, his own expression filled with anger—and deep self-loathing.

He was too weak. Before, he could only hide and run from the Zhou family's assassins. Now he couldn't protect Nangong Yun, couldn't avenge him. Looking at Qin Jiang, he was overwhelmed by helplessness. He slowly lowered his head and looked at Nangong Yun's profile.

His eyes filled with quiet anguish. There was no escape this time. But to die alongside Nangong Yun—that was enough.

His gaze softened. In these final moments, he just wanted to look at the man he loved.

Though Nangong Yun's attention was entirely on Qin Jiang, Brother Jie didn't mind. As long as Nangong Yun was in his eyes, that was all he needed.

Watching the two of them, Qin Jiang sighed. He hadn't expected Nangong Yun to find true love—and this kind of true love, no less. The other men had clearly only been after Nangong Yun's body. Now that danger loomed, every last one of them was trying to put as much distance between themselves and Nangong Yun as possible.

Qin Jiang snapped his fingers. Everyone except Nangong Yun and Brother Jie disintegrated instantly.

Nangong Yun shuddered. Fear crept in—was this really the end?

He swayed, but Brother Jie caught him, then gently kissed his cheek. "Yun'er, don't be afraid~"

"Jie..."

Brother Jie's eyes held no fear—only love, and a deep reluctance to let go. Nangong Yun's gaze wavered. So he wasn't entirely alone after all. At the very end, someone was still by his side.

He opened his arms and hugged Brother Jie back. "I'm sorry. I dragged you into this."

"Silly boy~ I don't mind being dragged. I love you—can't be helped."

They held each other, looking into each other's eyes. Love and sorrow mingled in both gazes. In the end, they couldn't resist, and their lips met.

Qin Jiang had been completely forgotten. The two of them stood at the pinnacle of love, while Qin Jiang, Black Dragon, and Little Xu collectively fought the urge to retch.

Taking a deep breath, Qin Jiang closed his eyes, raised one hand, and clenched his fist.

A crushing force seized both of them. They cried out in agony, still embracing as their bodies twisted and warped. Blood sprayed in every direction.

"Yun'er, my love, I love you so much..."

Brother Jie's voice was raw. He gazed at Nangong Yun—face contorted, but eyes still brimming with devotion. Nangong Yun looked back, eyes full of pain and regret. He regretted not having truly been with Brother Jie—if he could do it over, he'd just want to be with him, properly.

But it was too late.

Under the crushing force, Nangong Yun could no longer speak. He could only hold Brother Jie tighter, conveying everything through his embrace.

Until, with a wet crunch, the two of them were reduced to a single mass—inseparably merged.

Never to be parted again.
