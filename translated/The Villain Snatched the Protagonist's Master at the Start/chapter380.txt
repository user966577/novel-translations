Despite Li Qingqiu's failed gambit, it had awakened something in Qin Jiang: the urge to savor.

Normally he devoured in one bite. This time, he decided to take things slow — tease her bit by bit. This decision, unfortunately, put a heavier burden on An Xihe and the others. With the main course delayed, his considerable appetite fell on them instead. Li Qingqiu was kept close through all of it, naturally.

Several days passed. Aside from the final step, they'd done essentially everything. Li Qingqiu's personality had transformed in Qin Jiang's presence. Cold? Gone entirely.

One morning, Qin Jiang took her hand and they strolled through the Li compound. Whenever they passed a disciple, he'd flash a grin and introduce her.

"Hey there, buddy — meet my wife, Li Qingqiu."

The Li family men could only smile through gritted teeth. He'd stolen their goddess and was rubbing it in. Li Qingqiu kept a flat expression and let herself be dragged along. She'd made her peace with things. Everything that could be done — short of the last step — had been done. Everything that could be seen had been seen. She'd even acquired a certain amount of theoretical knowledge, and had secretly compared notes with An Xihe and the others. No significant differences in certain dimensions.

Her fear had faded. If they could handle it, so could she. She just didn't know what it would feel like. Judging by the other women — quite enjoyable.

Beyond all that, Qin Jiang was genuinely exceptional. Leagues above every man in the Li family. She might look down on the rest of the world, but she had no grounds to look down on him. If anything, the disparity ran the other way.

She tilted her head and watched him enthusiastically showing her off to yet another disciple. The smug pride on his face was almost punchable. But she found it... kind of amusing.

They'd wandered for most of the day when Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. Target acquired.

Li Yang. Child of Destiny. Unawakened, though — indistinguishable from trash.

Through the system's spoiler, Qin Jiang knew about Li Yang's feelings for Li Qingqiu. The kid's entire reason for living was to earn a single glance from her. Textbook simp — a dedicated one, driven by devotion to constantly push himself, but a simp nonetheless.

Too bad he'd crossed paths with Qin Jiang. No more chances.

Li Yang spotted Li Qingqiu from a distance, and the sight of her hand in another man's grip made his blood boil. Worse — the man was staggeringly more handsome than him. When that gaze swept over, Li Yang dropped his head on instinct. The inferiority hit like a physical blow.

Qin Jiang led Li Qingqiu straight to him. "Hey, trash."

Li Yang's head snapped up. The man and his goddess stood right in front of him. Trash? Was that aimed at him? Well... accurate. But this was the first time he'd been called it to his face with Li Qingqiu standing right there.

She looked mildly puzzled. He'd been polite to everyone else on their walk — "bro" here, "buddy" there. Why single this one out?

She glanced at Li Yang. Average looking. Cultivation... subpar. Over thirty and still at Golden Body. Trash indeed.

That single glance, and she lost interest. But for Li Yang, that glance detonated a firework in his chest. She'd looked at him! Actually *looked!*

"Oi, trash. Keep your eyeballs to yourself or I'll dig them out."

Qin Jiang's kick sent Li Yang sprawling. "This is my wife. Next time you see her, close your eyes. Or else—"

He flicked two threads of energy into Li Yang's eyes.

"AAHH!"

Li Yang crumpled, clutching his face, rolling on the ground in agony. Qin Jiang walked over, planted a foot on him, and gave two deliberate kicks to the Chaos Sword at his waist.

This sword was the so-called "Immortal King secret treasure."

A million years ago, the Sword Sect had obtained a block of Chaos Stone — said to have formed at the dawn of creation, infused with primordial Chaos Qi. Their elders attempted to forge it into an Immortal King-grade sword, but the stone's impurities were too severe. The result was a half-step Immortal King weapon — still extraordinary, and its forging had released an aura that shook all of Grey Cloud Heaven, birthing the "Immortal King treasure" rumor.

At the time, the Sword Sect was Grey Cloud Heaven's dominant power. Rather than suppress the rumor, they fed it, hoping to ride the prestige higher. But they'd underestimated greed. The other factions united — over ten True Immortals — and attacked. The Sword Sect had only three. Even wielding the half-step Immortal King sword, three couldn't withstand ten.

But the Sword Sect's elders had seen it coming. Before the siege, they'd publicly confirmed the treasure's existence and declared it could only be opened by a Sword Sect descendant — ensuring the sect's bloodline would survive.

Then, in the final battle, the three True Immortals performed a blood sacrifice. Eleven True Immortal lives fed the sword — three of their own and eight of the attackers'. The blood feast completed what the forging couldn't. The half-step weapon became a true Immortal King sword.

The three Sword Sect True Immortals survived within it as sword spirits, though grievously weakened. A full million years of dormancy had been needed to recover. They'd only recently reawakened — and been found, quite by accident, by Li Yang.

Somehow, the boy had bonded with the weapon on contact. The three ancient True Immortals were now his sword spirits. And privately, they were beginning to suspect they'd gotten the short end of the deal.
