The destruction of the Yan family sent shockwaves across Azure Cloud Heaven. They hadn't been a top-tier power, but they'd been formidable enough that their sudden annihilation drew attention from every corner of the continent.

The state of the compound was what truly alarmed people. Row upon row of desiccated corpses. One word surfaced in every mind: demonic cultivator. And not just any demonic cultivator—a grand demon.

To wipe out the Yan family so completely required at minimum an Ancient Emperor-level demon. Possibly even an immortal one.

That kind of being could bring catastrophe to any continent. The news spread like a hurricane, throwing all of Azure Cloud Heaven into a state of unease.

The perpetrators, of course, had long since returned to Qin Family City, laden with spoils. The outside world's panic couldn't touch them.

Half a month slipped by.

Qin Jiang continued dispatching people to hunt down the remaining Yan family stragglers—a surprisingly productive endeavor. Meanwhile, his group had firmly established themselves in Qin Family City, even beginning to expand into surrounding territories.

The demon scare gradually faded from public consciousness, supplanted by Azure Cloud Heaven's next major event: the Myriad Pill Assembly.

Organized by the Heavenly Pill Palace once every decade, the Myriad Pill Assembly was the continent's premier gathering for alchemists. Thousands of pill masters descended on the Palace to compete in alchemy duels, observe the Pill Emperor's techniques, and exchange knowledge with peers.

It wasn't just alchemists who attended. Major families and factions from across the continent sent representatives, all hoping to befriend—or better yet, recruit—talented pill masters. High-quality pills were scarce commodities, and Emperor-grade pills were essentially priceless. Most powerful clans kept several accomplished alchemists on retainer.

Qin Family City.

The news of the Myriad Pill Assembly reached Qin Jiang quickly. He muttered to himself, "The Myriad Pill Assembly—isn't that basically a stage for the Child of Destiny to show off?"

Events like this had a ninety percent chance of producing a Child of Destiny sighting. He chuckled. "Looks like I need to pay the Heavenly Pill Palace a visit."

Pill City, home of the Heavenly Pill Palace.

With the Assembly approaching, Pill City was bustling far beyond its usual capacity. Many visitors wore the distinctive garb of alchemists, and ordinary citizens regarded them with reverence and undisguised envy.

Amid the crowd, a young man in alchemist's robes entered the city. He gazed around, eyes filled with a wistfulness that belied his youthful face—his gaze carried the weight of ages.

"Pill City hasn't changed at all," he murmured.

He navigated the streets with practiced familiarity, occasionally pausing to sigh at some landmark or another. His peculiar behavior earned more than a few odd looks from passersby.

Eventually, he arrived at the city's heart—the Heavenly Pill Palace itself. He stopped and smiled. "Still looks exactly the same."

He stood outside for a while, staring, until a guard approached. "Master alchemist, would you like to enter the Heavenly Pill Palace?"

The Palace opened its outer grounds to the public, and alchemists in particular could move through most areas freely.

The young man came back to himself, shook his head with a smile, and declined. "After the Myriad Pill Assembly, I'll enter the Heavenly Pill Palace in a different way."

Ignoring the guard's bewildered expression, he turned and walked away. After a few steps, he paused and glanced back, murmuring, "Once I make my name at the Assembly, you'll recognize me."

Three days later, outside Pill City.

Qin Jiang arrived with an entourage of women. Jian Yao, Mo Mo, and Liu Shuwan formed the security detail. Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er had been brought along as well—both were skilled alchemists from the Fire Tribe, and Qin Jiang had been mentoring them personally. The Myriad Pill Assembly was a perfect opportunity to sharpen their skills.

Xia Qianling walked beside him, her small hand clasped in his. The shy girl rarely saw the world beyond their home, and Qin Jiang figured the exposure would do her good.

And of course, there was the human radar: Qin Lian'er, whose sole mission was to sniff out Children of Destiny.

The moment they entered Pill City, Lian'er's bright eyes began scanning in every direction like searchlights, fascinated by everything she saw. She bounced ahead of the group, practically vibrating with energy.

Watching her from behind, Qin Jiang smiled. 'Good—the more ground she covers, the higher the odds of encountering a Child of Destiny.'

The women trailed behind, window-shopping and buying trinkets. After a while, Lian'er darted back and sidled up to Qin Jiang, eyes sparkling mischievously.

"Big brother, I found something good~"

"What?"

He looked down. Cradled in Lian'er's arms was a scroll.

Jian Yao and the others leaned in curiously. Lian'er unrolled it with exaggerated care. It was a painted portrait—of a woman. The instant Qin Jiang saw the image, he understood exactly where this was going. The other women glanced at Lian'er knowingly. They all knew their little sister had a habit of scouting potential additions to Qin Jiang's harem.

"Isn't she pretty, big brother?"

"She is," Qin Jiang agreed. The woman in the portrait was undeniably beautiful.

"Where'd you get this?"

Lian'er pointed up the street. "They're selling portraits just up ahead! And—I asked around—this woman is the Heavenly Pill Palace's master. The Pill Emperor herself! She can refine Emperor-grade pills!"

Her eyes shone with anticipation. "Big brother, if you win her over, the whole Heavenly Pill Palace becomes ours! Then we could eat Emperor-grade pills like candy!"

Qin Jiang was momentarily speechless. Even the most prolific Pill Emperor couldn't mass-produce Emperor-grade pills. The energy required was enormous, and the ingredients astronomically expensive. Eating them like candy wasn't happening anytime soon.

But the Pill Emperor herself was an intriguing target. If Lian'er had taken notice, there was a strong chance the woman was a fortune heroine.

Under Lian'er's eager gaze, Qin Jiang pocketed the portrait. "Let's go. Time to see the Heavenly Pill Palace for ourselves."

Lian'er pumped her tiny fist in triumph. Jian Yao and the others rolled their eyes but showed no real irritation. They were used to it by now.
