When Liu Shuwan woke, Qin Jiang produced the three immortal-path laws. "Wan'er, which of the girls do you think these are best suited for?"

"Immortal-path laws?" Her eyes widened. "One fire, one water, and one strength."

"All for the girls?"

"Well... the Strength Law might not be appropriate."

Liu Shuwan nodded. "True. Other than Zi Fu, none of the girls would suit it. But Zi Fu already has the pure law you gave her."

"Zi Fu would suit it?"

"Of course." Liu Shuwan looked at him. "You didn't know? Zi Fu cultivates the path of raw physical power. It's why her body is so strong — she'd be a perfect fit for the Strength Law."

He hadn't known, actually. Zi Fu had never fought in front of him, so he'd never learned what path she followed. Her physical power was certainly formidable, though — he could personally attest to that. In their sparring sessions, she was even more... vigorous than Qing Chan. And during group encounters, she was consistently the main combatant. He'd assumed it was because she was a yao, but apparently it was her cultivation path that made her body so powerful.

That said, the pure law he'd already given Zi Fu was being refined as they spoke and couldn't be swapped out now. And none of his other women were suitable for the Strength Law.

While he pondered, Liu Shuwan studied the other two laws. "The Water Law could go to Ling'er. As for the fire..."

She hesitated. "Qing'er and Ying'er are both excellent fits. Linglong and Dan Yu would also work."

She looked at Qin Jiang. Several women were suitable for the Flame Law, but there was only one. That was a problem — giving it to one would leave the others feeling slighted. The Water Law, at least, aligned perfectly with his earlier thoughts. Ye Ling'er had been with him from the very beginning, but after they left the Qin Domain, her cultivation had fallen behind. She spent most of her time in the Void Divine Temple, and the last time he'd seen her, she'd broken through to Saint Realm. With the Space-Time Temple accelerating her training, she'd be at Supreme at least by now. This would be a good chance to test the little girl's progress.

"Ling'er is definitely the right choice for the Water Law," Qin Jiang agreed. That settled the Water Law.

For the Flame Law, he thought for a moment. "Linglong and Yu'er can be set aside — Linglong has something else coming, and Yu'er's cultivation isn't high enough yet. That leaves Qing'er and Ying'er. They're best friends. They wouldn't fight over an immortal-path law... would they?"

He looked at Liu Shuwan. She pursed her lips. "I wouldn't be so sure about that."

He winced. Depending on their mood, giving it to one could easily ruffle the other. If it were some random opportunity they'd found on their own, the two friends would probably defer to each other graciously. But coming from Qin Jiang — that changed the dynamic entirely. This was a gift, not a windfall. It carried emotional weight.

He scratched his head and stored all three laws. Still not enough.

But there was no need to stress. He still had Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng to deal with, and once the five True Immortals broke free, there would be plenty more immortal-path laws to collect. When the time came, he'd have enough for everyone.

"Made up your mind?" Liu Shuwan asked as he put them away. "Who gets what?"

"Everyone."

"Huh?"

"There aren't enough right now, but there will be soon."

Killing intent flickered in his eyes. For the harmony and stability of his household, those other immortal-path cultivators would simply have to apologize for existing.

Meanwhile, Dao Zhen was still guarding the courtyard. A full day had passed, and the commotion inside had gradually died down. He hadn't looked — he valued his eyesight too much — but from the aura signatures alone, he knew Chen Wuming was dead.

Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng, on the other hand, seemed largely unaffected physically. Their cultivation was strong enough to withstand it.

"AHHH!" A howl of anguished fury erupted from within the courtyard. A violent aura detonated, and in an instant, the entire structure was obliterated — reduced to dust. Only the formation held, protecting the surroundings.

With the walls gone, the scene was laid bare. One figure lay torn apart and lifeless — Chen Wuming. Another had been flung against the formation, face ashen — Chen Changsheng. His aura was weak, his eyes glassy and empty. He looked like his mind had simply... stopped.

And then there was Chen Qi'er. Roaring, raging, eyes blood-red, face twisted with grief and fury. He was limping. He thrashed and vented, unable to contain the volcanic eruption of emotion. He'd been... taken.

He'd had no awareness during the act, but once consciousness returned, the memories came flooding back in agonizing clarity. Every detail. Every moment. He nearly blacked out. His face cycled between white and green, and when he examined those memories more closely — if he was being honest — some small part of it had actually felt—

No!

He'd already lost his manhood, and now this. He could never go back.

A single tear traced down his cheek. In tens of thousands of years, he had never once wept. But this was simply more than he could bear.

Chen Changsheng slumped against the formation wall, and as the pain dragged him back to lucidity, the same memories invaded his mind. He couldn't help but look at Chen Qi'er. The images only grew sharper.

He retched violently. Ten lifetimes of reincarnation, and he'd never been with a woman — fine. But to have his first time be with a man? The humiliation was soul-crushing. Like Chen Qi'er, tears streamed unbidden.

His first time. Given to a man.

If he'd known it would come to this, he would have visited a brothel first. At least the people there were actually women.

As if connected by some terrible synchronicity, both men lifted their heads at the same moment. Their eyes met through a haze of tears. In that blurry, devastated gaze, they each felt something stir — something that almost resembled...

Was this... attraction?

No!

They wrenched their gazes apart. But the memories branded into their minds refused to fade.
