The back mountain.

All the ancestors had crawled out of their coffins and gathered around Qin Jiang, poking and prodding him here and there.

"It really is dual Divine Bodies."

"But that shouldn't be possible. We did a comprehensive examination of Jiang'er before, and there was only the Immaculate Divine Body. How did another one appear?"

"Hey, no matter how you look at it, this is a good thing."

"Dual Divine Bodies—a first since the dawn of time."

Their eyes sparkled.

Even Qin Jiang's scalp was tingling.

"Jiang'er, what does your newly awakened Divine Body do?"

Great-grandfather asked curiously.

The other ancestors also looked at Qin Jiang. Once they understood its effects and observed him for a while, they'd be able to determine which Divine Body it was and formulate the best training plan.

Qin Jiang smiled faintly.

"My newly awakened Divine Body is a perfect match for the Immaculate Divine Body!"

"Oh? You already know what kind of Divine Body it is?"

Everyone asked.

Qin Jiang nodded. He didn't hide anything and spoke directly.

"The Taotie Divine Body. Its primary attribute is devouring—it can devour heaven and earth!"

"The Taotie Divine Body..."

The ancestors murmured to themselves. The effects of the Taotie Divine Body appeared in their minds.

They exchanged glances, all seeing the wild joy in each other's eyes!

"Devouring paired with Immaculate—ha ha ha! It really is a perfect match!"

"To think it's the Taotie Divine Body."

"The Taotie Divine Body and Immaculate Divine Body complement each other. Combined, they cover each other's weaknesses."

"Ha ha ha! Our Jiang'er has the bearing of a Great Emperor!"

The ancestors were overjoyed.

But that last sentence made Qin Jiang break out in a cold sweat. Saying things like that was asking for trouble.

After their excitement, the ancestors' expressions turned solemn.

"Jiang'er, the fact that you've awakened the Taotie Divine Body must absolutely not be revealed!"

One ancestor spoke.

As he said this, his gaze fell on Qin Jiang's ring, his eyes turning cold.

Some ancient clans were already aware of Qin Jiang's Immaculate Divine Body. Besides, having a single Divine Body appear actually increased the Qin family's prestige, so they hadn't deliberately concealed it.

But if one person possessed two Divine Bodies—and two that perfectly complemented each other at that—the other ancient clans would probably be unable to sit still.

For Qin Jiang's safety, the Taotie Divine Body absolutely could not be exposed.

As his words fell, that ancestor flicked his finger. The ring on Qin Jiang's hand shattered instantly, and the Fire Tribe woman tumbled out.

Seeing the woman, the ancestors showed no surprise. Their gazes were extremely cold.

Clearly, they'd detected her presence long ago.

The Fire Tribe woman's expression was ugly. She'd thought the Divine Body Qin Jiang had just awakened was the one he'd mentioned to her in the secret chamber. She hadn't expected him to have yet another Divine Body.

Dual Divine Bodies!

This secret was terrifying.

If word got out, the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent would be shaken.

She looked around. Her expression grew bitter. Facing these ancestors, forget her soul state—even at her peak, she'd have no choice but to accept death.

"A member of the Fire Tribe?"

Seeing the woman, the ancestors narrowed their eyes.

They looked at Qin Jiang, asking about the woman's origins.

Qin Jiang shrugged.

"I snatched her.

"Before going into seclusion, I went out and snatched two people. One is her, the other is the Ye family's princess."

The ancestors: "..."

"You already knew she was there?"

An ancestor asked.

They'd assumed Qin Jiang didn't know someone was hiding in the ring.

Hearing the ancestor's question, Qin Jiang nodded.

"Knew all along.

"I was even planning to have her bear my children. Help our Qin family carry on the bloodline, hehe..."

At his words, the ancestors' mouths twitched. Bear children? Carry on the bloodline?

For a moment, they weren't sure whether they should make a move or not.

Their original intention was to eliminate all unstable factors.

But if she could help continue the family line...

That wasn't entirely out of the question.

Qin Jiang's dual Divine Body bloodline naturally shouldn't go to waste. Best to have lots of children.

Even if they couldn't inherit the Divine Bodies, their talent wouldn't be too poor.

"Jiang'er, are you up to it?"

Just then, Great-grandfather spoke up.

Qin Jiang: "???"

He stared wide-eyed at Great-grandfather. Wait, what was that supposed to mean, old man?

"Ahem. What Great-grandfather means is, this woman's strength is considerable. Once she restores her physical body, she should be at the Saint realm. Can you handle her?"

Great-grandfather coughed awkwardly, realizing the ambiguity in his words.

Hearing this, Qin Jiang curled his lip. He looked at the Fire Tribe woman and nodded.

"Judging by her exterior, I should be able to handle her. As for the rest, I'll need to get to know her more... deeply."

Great-grandfather: "???"

Why did those words sound a bit off?

The ancestors thought for a moment, then spoke.

"Fine. She's just a Saint. She won't cause any real trouble."

With that, one of the ancestors produced a piece of white jade. Power surged in his palm, and before long, the stone transformed into a ring.

He tossed the ring to Qin Jiang, then looked at the woman.

"This is Soul-Nurturing Stone. You can stay inside it from now on. It's better than that ring of yours."

The woman hesitated briefly, then nodded.

"Thank you."

With that, she slipped into the ring.

The minor episode resolved, the ancestors' attention returned to Qin Jiang.

"The guards around Jiang'er should be replaced."

"Whether the guards are replaced doesn't matter. One of us should go protect Jiang'er personally."

The one who spoke was the most senior ancestor in the Qin family—the First Ancestor.

Currently, only three others from his generation remained in the Qin family.

Even Qin Jiang hadn't expected that this time, they would actually emerge.

"Big Brother, I'll go."

Beside him was a withered, thin old man—the Qin family's Second Ancestor.

The First Ancestor glanced at him and shook his head.

"Too risky. Fourth Brother, you go."

Second Ancestor: "..."

Qin Jiang looked at the Fourth Ancestor. Compared to the other three, the Fourth Ancestor appeared only middle-aged. He held a folding fan in his hand and wore a gentle smile.

He looked like an ordinary scholar.

Hearing the First Ancestor's words, the Fourth Ancestor nodded with a smile.

"Alright. I quite like this little fellow's temperament."

Qin Jiang blinked. He didn't really care either way—it wasn't like he had a choice.

Besides, the strength of all four ancestors was at the absolute pinnacle. In the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent, there weren't many who qualified to be their opponents.

"Come along, little one. Follow this ancestor."

The Fourth Ancestor beckoned, leading Qin Jiang away from the back mountain.

As for the other ancestors, they remained on the back mountain, continuing their discussions. Beyond ensuring Qin Jiang's safety, they also needed to deliberate on how to cultivate him.

In their hearts, the current Qin Jiang absolutely had the potential to reach the Great Emperor realm.

And right now, there were no Great Emperor-level experts on the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent. If Qin Jiang could succeed, the Qin family would become the undisputed number one ancient clan!

Excitement gleamed in every ancestor's eyes.

In this moment, Qin Jiang had become the most important existence in the entire Qin family!
