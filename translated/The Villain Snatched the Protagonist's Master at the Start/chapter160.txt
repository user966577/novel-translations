Soon enough, the day of the Myriad Pill Assembly arrived.

All of Pill City was draped in celebration. Countless alchemists donned their ceremonial robes and gathered outside the Heavenly Pill Palace gates, their faces alight with excitement. This was their stage—the event they'd been waiting for.

The Palace's enforcers maintained order throughout. High above, the Enforcement Grand Commander sat cross-legged in the sky, his Emperor's might blanketing the area like a silent warning.

Then, finally—

A bell tolled, its resonance carrying across the entire city. And in the wake of that sound, the crowd saw it.

A cascade of seven-colored radiance surged from the Palace's depths. Within the shimmering light, a figure could be seen, ascending gracefully into the sky.

"The Pill Emperor! That's the Pill Emperor!"

"Our Azure Cloud Heaven's Goddess of Alchemy!"

"The greatest alchemist alive. She's been in seclusion deep within the Palace for years—her last public appearance was at the previous Assembly, a full century ago."

Alchemists by the thousands gazed up at the Pill Emperor's silhouette, their eyes burning with fanatical devotion.

Amid the seething crowd, one young man also lifted his head to watch. But unlike everyone else, his expression held no fervor—only a calm, even gaze, tinged with the faintest hint of nostalgia.

The Pill Emperor rode the seven-colored light and surveyed the assembled alchemists. Bathed in the radiance, no one could see how pale her face actually was.

She took a deep, steadying breath. The furrow in her brow smoothed slightly as she silently cursed Qin Jiang. He knew perfectly well she needed to make a public appearance today for the Assembly, and he still hadn't given her a moment's rest.

She scanned the crowd. Tens of thousands of faces, packed shoulder to shoulder—she had neither the energy nor the inclination to look closely. According to Qin Jiang, her real master was somewhere among them.

A cursory glance was all she spared. She didn't bother searching in earnest. With her master's alchemy skills, he'd distinguish himself soon enough.

No need to go hunting.

Withdrawing her gaze, the Pill Emperor parted her lips. Her voice, magnified to fill the city, rang out:

"The Myriad Pill Assembly officially begins!"

She'd prepared a speech, but her throat was too sore and her legs were still a bit unsteady, so she opted for brevity.

Make an appearance, declare the Assembly open, and be done with it.

As her words faded and the seven-colored light dispersed, the Pill Emperor's figure vanished.

The assembled alchemists blinked in confusion.

'That's it?'

Even the Palace's own people were caught off guard. In previous Assemblies, the Pill Emperor always delivered an address—promoting the Heavenly Pill Palace, inspiring the alchemists. Today's appearance had been... perfunctory.

Something was clearly off.

But no one questioned it.

After the Pill Emperor's departure, the elder in charge of the Assembly stepped forward and began the proceedings.

Hundreds of thousands of alchemists couldn't all compete directly—elimination rounds were necessary. Only the final hundred would participate in the main event, and those hundred, barring any surprises, would become the most sought-after recruits for every major faction in attendance.

Back in the Palace.

Seeing the Pill Emperor return so quickly, Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "That was fast?"

She shot him a withering look. 'And whose fault is that?'

Qin Jiang chuckled, sidled up to her, took her hand, and gave it a gentle squeeze. "Your skin's gotten even smoother."

"Hmph. My skin was always smooth," she huffed, pulling her hand back.

She looked at him. Part of her genuinely wondered if she'd lost her mind. The things she'd done over the past two days, looking back...

Qin Jiang just smiled.

He'd had enough time by now to figure out the Pill Emperor's temperament. She'd protest and refuse, but when the moment came, she'd go along with it all the same.

All in all, the Pill Emperor was surprisingly cooperative.

"Aren't you going to watch the elimination rounds?" Qin Jiang changed the subject.

The Pill Emperor shook her head. Fatigue was plain in her features. She looked up at him, her lips forming a slight pout. "I want to rest."

"Rest?" Qin Jiang blinked, then nodded. "Sure. I'll keep you company."

"No~"

The Pill Emperor pushed him away gently, her eyes narrowing. 'You, keep me company? Then there'll be no resting at all.'

She shook her head. "Go spend time with the others. I need..." She paused, a faint blush creeping across her cheeks. "You've been here with me for two days straight. The other girls are going to get jealous."

Qin Jiang glanced toward the row of tightly shut bedroom doors... then looked back at the Pill Emperor.

The implication was unmistakable.

The Pill Emperor: "..."

She stared at the closed doors and felt a twinge of exasperation. Apparently, jealousy wasn't something that existed in Qin Jiang's world.

He could satisfy every single one of them.

None of them had time to be jealous.

With a silent sigh, the Pill Emperor relented. "Fine. But you're not allowed to touch me while I rest."

"Uh..."

Qin Jiang licked his lips and said with a strange look: "If I remember correctly, these past two days, you were the one who always started—"

"Don't say it!"

Qin Jiang tilted his head, grinning wide. "As long as you can resist, I naturally won't lay a finger on you."

"Hmph!"

The Pill Emperor huffed, and though her confidence wavered for a moment, she squared her shoulders stubbornly. "I can absolutely resist!"

"If you say so."
