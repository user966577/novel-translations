In a grand hall deep within the Snake Race's territory, five figures sat around a circular table. One of them was the Black Serpent Ancestor.

Each held a stack of intelligence reports on Qin Jiang. The Black Serpent Ancestor's expression was grim. He was silently cursing his useless descendants—days of investigation, and this was the best they could manage?

"Four Immortals," one of the others spoke up, fixing the Black Serpent Ancestor with a level stare. "One on the righteous path, one demonic cultivator, one who appeared for the first time recently, and the last is the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's ancestor. But more importantly..." He tossed his report onto the table and tapped it with a firm finger, his voice cold: "He's killed an Immortal before."

The Black Serpent Ancestor's face twitched. An Immortal—someone at their own level—and this human youth had slain one.

"Black Serpent, he has four Immortals and the means to kill Immortals. You want to antagonize him? Are you trying to drag the entire Snake Race into the abyss?"

These five were the Snake Race's Immortal Ancestors. After the Black Serpent Ancestor emerged from seclusion, he'd awakened all of them, intending to unite against Qin Jiang. Their combined intelligence-gathering abilities were formidable, and in short order, they'd pieced together a fairly complete picture of Qin Jiang's exploits across Azure Cloud Heaven.

The fact that he'd slain an Immortal was enough to make every one of them wary.

"The Immortal he killed—based on the intelligence, he likely used a single-use artifact. Once expended, it's gone. That's one factor we can dismiss," the Black Serpent Ancestor said, his eyes shifting. Learning about the Immortal-slaying only deepened his anxiety. After all, the bloodline poison that had nearly destroyed Yu Lan came from him. If Qin Jiang's people sought revenge...

"Even so, there's no reason for us to make an enemy of him," the others said flatly, clearly unwilling to back the Black Serpent.

The strength at Qin Jiang's command was one thing, but his ability to slay Immortals spoke to a status of extraordinary significance. They'd have to be out of their minds to cross someone like that—especially when one of their own factions was already allied with him.

"Since the Purple-Scale Serpent has his backing, let the chieftainship go to them."

The four Immortals reached their consensus in a matter of sentences, then turned collectively toward the Black Serpent Ancestor.

"Black Serpent, if you insist on making a move, we won't lift a finger to help—even if it costs you your life."

"Hmph!" The Black Serpent Ancestor snorted and swept out of the hall.

Back at the Black Water Serpent clan, Mo Ling rushed to greet him. He was about to ask how negotiations had gone when the Ancestor's palm cracked across his face.

Mo Ling spun in place several times, his entire head buzzing. It took him a long moment to steady himself, his expression pitiful. "Ancestor, why did you hit me?"

"I should have killed you!" the old man snarled.

Mo Ling flinched. He was only an Ancient Emperor—to the Ancestor, he was nothing. Killing him would be no different from swatting a fly.

The Black Serpent Ancestor took a deep breath and hissed: "Did you know that human boy has killed an Immortal before?"

"What?" Mo Ling's eyes bulged. "Killed an Immortal? How? He's just a Supreme! Ancestor, you must have it wrong."

"Useless! Is your intelligence network staffed by dung-eaters?"

The Ancestor laid into Mo Ling with fists and feet, venting his frustration in the most direct way possible. When the worst of his anger had passed, he exhaled a turbid breath and glowered at Mo Ling, finding the sight of him more grating by the second.

If this worthless descendant hadn't come begging for poison in the first place, none of this would have happened.

"The other Snake Race Immortals won't help. I'll need to look for leverage elsewhere," the Ancestor muttered.

With one final glare at Mo Ling, he vanished.

Nursing fresh bruises, Mo Ling went straight to find Chen Changsheng.

"Chieftain Mo Ling, what happened to—"

Before Chen Changsheng could finish the sentence, Mo Ling's fist connected with his face.

'I can't beat the Ancestor, but I can damn well beat a Supreme! This is all your fault—your garbage intelligence got me thrashed, and you're going to pay it back!'

Without a word of explanation, Mo Ling unleashed a flurry of punches and kicks, beating Chen Changsheng senseless. When the man finally gathered his wits, fury blazed in his eyes.

This reincarnation—why was he getting beaten up everywhere he went? At the Heavenly Pill Palace. At the Purple-Scale Serpent clan. And now at the Black Water Serpent clan, of all places!

A kick sent him flying. Chen Changsheng spat blood and glared at Mo Ling. "What's the meaning of this?"

"Meaning?" Mo Ling snorted. "Qin Jiang has killed an Immortal before. You didn't know?"

Chen Changsheng went still.

Of course he knew. He'd been there when it happened. He'd even tried to help that Immortal.

"You set me up! You have a grudge against him, so you manipulated me into confronting him—into getting myself killed!" Mo Ling was still fuming, and the pain from his own beating only stoked the fire.

He grabbed Chen Changsheng and pummeled him again.

'I have a grudge against him?' Chen Changsheng thought bitterly. 'Don't you have one too? How is this all my fault?'

Mo Ling's blows were savage, but he recognized that Chen Changsheng still had potential value, so he stopped short of lethal damage. Once he'd beaten the fury out of his system, he finally relented.

At the Purple-Scale Serpent territory, Qin Jiang was reunited with Jian Yao and Liu Shuwan. They'd even brought Xiao Jiu along. Hu Xian'er had finally consented to walk on her own two feet—but only if Qin Jiang held her hand.

"Wan'er—you've reached Ancient Emperor?" Qin Jiang asked, sensing the marked increase in Liu Shuwan's aura.

She nodded, glancing briefly at Hu Xian'er—she'd grown fond of the ditzy little fox. Walking to Qin Jiang's side, she said: "After fusing the Sword Dao Law, the breakthrough came naturally. But fully refining it will take more time."

"No rush," Qin Jiang said with a smile.

The Time-Space Disc was with him, but with the Black Water Serpent situation still unresolved, secluded cultivation seemed risky right now.

"With all of you here, won't the Celestial Rabbit Tribe be unprotected?" he asked Jian Yao.

"Don't worry about that," Jian Yao said with a smile, nodding toward Hu Xian'er. "Her father is the Fox Race chieftain. Before we left, he stationed his people at the tribe. With the Fox Race watching over them, nobody's going to bother the Celestial Rabbit Tribe."

"Good." Qin Jiang nodded. "Make sure Xue Mei knows, so she doesn't worry."

"Already done." Jian Yao's beautiful eyes twinkled. "I heard from our little shorty that you're picking a fight with the Snake Race. We made it just in time, didn't we?"

"Just the Black Water Serpent," Qin Jiang clarified.
