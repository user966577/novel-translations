Back at the residence, Liu Shuwan and the other two women were chatting about something, their melodic laughter drifting through the air. The moment Qin Jiang returned, all three looked over. Liu Shuwan and Bai Susu both flushed slightly, while Qin Lian'er flashed him a toothy grin.

"What's so funny?" Qin Jiang strolled over with a smile.

Liu Shuwan stood and shooed him away. "Shoo—girl talk. You're not invited."

Qin Jiang was helpless. They were this close, and he still couldn't join in? Fortunately, his little sister took pity on him. Qin Lian'er trotted over to keep him company.

"Brother, do you especially like Wan'er?" she asked curiously.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "What makes you say that?"

Especially? He didn't think so. He liked every one of his women.

"You were in Sword Valley for a full month. Aside from the two days in the depths, you spent the entire time with Wan'er. That's the first time you've ever stayed with one woman for so long." She paused, then added, "Plus, you're way more lenient with her."

As Qin Jiang's most beloved sister, Qin Lian'er got along well with every one of his women and knew the details of each relationship. In her assessment, Qin Jiang treated Liu Shuwan differently. He hadn't even resorted to forceful tactics—he'd genuinely courted her for an entire month. And had Liu Shuwan not eventually taken a small initiative herself, he still might not have won her over. Even after that, he'd actually been considerate of her feelings, staying to keep her company.

Hearing this, Qin Jiang couldn't help glancing toward Liu Shuwan. She happened to look his way at the same moment, and her slightly bashful expression made his heart stir. When she shyly averted her gaze, he turned back and rubbed his chin.

"I guess I have been a bit biased."

"A bit? You've been totally biased," Qin Lian'er said, rolling her eyes.

Qin Jiang smiled wryly. This kind of favoritism wasn't something he could control—it was instinct. Still, if Ye Ling'er and the others noticed, they'd probably feel hurt.

With a small sigh, he rubbed his forehead. Having too many women wasn't necessarily a good thing, and he wasn't the type of cold-blooded villain who could be emotionally detached. He had feelings. He genuinely liked every one of them, but the degree of affection did vary. Qin Lian'er could sense it, and the others likely could too—they just wouldn't bring it up or put him in a difficult position. But it had to sting.

"Should I try to adjust?" he asked.

Qin Lian'er shook her head. "No. You're a little biased, but at least you've never deceived them. The depth of your feelings may differ, but you do care about all of them. If you tried to force balance, it would just come off as fake. That said, you should be more mindful sometimes. I'm sure you can handle it."

Qin Jiang nodded in agreement. Best to follow his heart.

Then he eyed her. "Since when did you start dispensing such mature wisdom?"

Qin Lian'er glared at him, her small face indignant. "You're looking down on me!"

Qin Jiang stood, ruffled her hair, and grinned. "All right, time for you to go. I need to spend some quality time with your sisters-in-law." He headed toward Liu Shuwan and Bai Susu. "Hey, ladies, mind if I join the conversation?"

The next day.

Bai Susu was still sleeping. Qin Jiang and Liu Shuwan, however, had been up for a while—she was a half-Emperor, after all, with extraordinary constitution and recovery. The two sat by the courtyard pond, hand in hand, leisurely feeding the fish as the early sun painted them in golden light. They looked every inch the immortal couple.

Too bad Qin Jiang was greedy.

Tossing a bit of fish food into the water, he turned to Liu Shuwan. "Wan'er, Little Lian'er told me yesterday that I'm too biased toward you."

"Hm?" Liu Shuwan blinked, puzzled.

Qin Jiang smiled and pulled her into his arms. "I didn't even realize until she pointed it out. My heart leans toward you more than anyone."

"Really?" Her eyes brightened.

He gave a rueful sigh. "Honestly, I've been wanting to balance things out. I'm afraid of hurting any of you—Susu, and Ling'er, Bing'er, Qing'er, Yun'er, Shiya... every one of them is a wonderful woman, and I care about each of them. I thought my feelings were equal across the board. But when Lian'er made me actually look at my own heart, I realized the truth—my feelings for each of you are different. She told me not to adjust, to just follow my heart. But for all of you, it's not fair. Or rather, the unfairness started the moment I decided to have all of you. Maybe I can fool you, but I can't fool myself."

He kept talking, and for the first time since arriving in this world, he felt genuinely troubled. Perhaps, he mused, he wasn't cut out to be a proper villain. He needed to be colder.

Liu Shuwan watched him, quietly tightening her grip on his hand without a word.

Qin Jiang gazed at the rising sun—not too bright to look at. "Wan'er... what should I do?"

She blinked. "You said you're especially biased toward me?"

He nodded.

"Then I have no complaints."

Qin Jiang stared at her.

Before he could respond, she nestled into his arms and spoke softly. "Women are selfish. I can't have you all to myself, but I want you to love me more. That's my perspective. The other sisters probably feel the same way, so jealousy is inevitable when you're with all of us. But as long as we can feel that you truly love us—even if the degrees are different—it'll only be jealousy, nothing worse."

A playful smile crossed her face. "Who knows? Maybe the competition will add a little spice for you."

"So you're saying I should just follow my heart?"

"Obviously. You love me most, so of course I'd want you to follow your heart." She looked at him. "But the other sisters might not agree—and you could say that right now, I'm being jealous too. I want to be the one you love the most!"

Qin Jiang understood. No matter what, this was a problem that could never truly be solved. From the moment he'd decided to save every fortune heroine, the ending was already set.
