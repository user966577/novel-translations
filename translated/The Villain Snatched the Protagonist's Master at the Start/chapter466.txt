Cheeks flushed, Chen Ningshuang walked over and was immediately pulled into his arms. She hugged him back, small hands gentle around his waist.

"Here?"

"Where does Shuang'er want?"

"My room?" She looked up shyly. "We could be more thorough in there."

Qin Jiang glanced at the foxes. They were already reverting to their original forms, waving tiny paws. "We're going to play! Make sure you give Xiao Shuang a proper checkup!" They bounded away, leaving the two alone.

"Still want your room?"

She looked around — no one in sight. Her arms circled his neck. "Never mind." She smiled.

He began the examination. She'd grown significantly since last time — the exercises he'd taught her were clearly working. In some regards, she'd already surpassed her older sister, and still had growth ahead.

"Nice development. The techniques I showed you are clearly effective. Keep at it — don't skip days."

She pouted. "You promised to do it for me personally, but I've been doing it all by myself."

"I haven't had time. But look — the moment I'm free, I came straight here." He reached out and began the massage himself.

Her pout melted the instant his hands made contact. She nestled against him, eyes half-closed, savoring it. Her small fingers traced along his hands, as if memorizing the technique.

When he stopped, she opened her eyes. "Done already?"

He tapped her nose. "Can't go too long in one session. It could be counterproductive."

"Okay." Reluctant, but she didn't want to risk stunting her growth.

Then her eyes fixed on him with a different kind of anticipation. "Big brother, when will you give me a proper spot-check?"

Qin Jiang nearly choked. He studied her — she was serious. And she really wasn't small anymore.

Should he...?

"Shuang'er, are you sure you're ready?"

She nodded without hesitation, excitement breaking through. "Ready!"

He wavered. 'Being a beast is still better than being worse than a beast.'

He drew her into his arms. "Remember what I said? You don't have to prepare anything. I'll take care of it all. Let me get you ready first, okay?"

"Okay!" She was nervous, too — she'd been craving this for so long. Was she finally going to get a taste? She left the preparation entirely to him.

In truth, the checkup had already done most of the groundwork. Conditions were favorable. But this was her first time. He'd be thorough with the preparation — wouldn't want to hurt her.

After a long, careful while, he judged her ready. He lifted her gently, kissed her, and murmured, "I'm going to start."

"Mm." A soft sound, barely audible.

She closed her eyes, a delicate flush spreading across her neck, chin tilted up. Waiting.

He smiled. What a good girl. He'd be gentle. Hurting her would truly break his heart.
