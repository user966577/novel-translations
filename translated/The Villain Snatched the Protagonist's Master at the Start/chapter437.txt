"Am I making things up?" Qin Jiang nuzzled against Weiwei's cheek, resting his chin on her shoulder. "When our dear junior brother showed up, I offered to go see what he wanted. But you wouldn't let me stop."

"You—!" Weiwei clapped a hand over his mouth, face scarlet. "Say that kind of thing at home! There's company!"

She dragged him back through the gate without sparing Nangong Yun another glance.

Outside, Nangong Yun stood rigid. Those few words from Weiwei stung more than he'd expected. He took a steadying breath. "She's pretending," he whispered. "It's all for me. She can't blow her cover. She's pretending..."

He repeated it until he believed it, then thought again of the exhaustion on her face. She was suffering so much for him, and he was powerless. 'Your worthless brother is useless, Senior Sister!'

He lingered outside a while longer, then turned to leave — glancing back every few steps, as if hoping to see through the wall.

Inside, Qin Jiang was indeed bullying Weiwei — bullying her right to "tears." "Tears" that kept flowing no matter what.

Of course, he was nothing if not considerate. Whatever mess he made, he cleaned up himself. Step one: dry her tears. Only instead of using his hands, he lowered his head and kissed them away. But the more he "comforted" her, the harder she "cried."

She pushed at him feebly between sobs. "Weiwei, hold still — let me wipe those tears."

She bit her lip, gripping his head with both hands, voice trembling. "No — I don't want you to! I'll do it myself!"

"Be good. Almost done."

"No..."

She couldn't win. The "tears" simply wouldn't stop as long as he was the one "wiping." Still, she let him continue — she loved the feeling of him tending to her, even if he was making everything worse.

Much later, he lifted his head and sighed with genuine exasperation. "I really can't get you dry."

"Hmph!" She pushed him away, face flushed. "Turn around."

"Can't I watch?"

"No!" She stood and physically turned him the other way, pouting. "Whenever you're looking at me, I just want to cry. I'll never dry off."

"Looking at me makes you cry?"

"Mm." She nodded, embarrassed.

With his back turned, she quickly tidied herself up. "Done."

"All dry?"

"Mm."

She walked over and collapsed against his chest. She felt like crying again — though she was too wrung out just then. He held her waist, kissed her forehead, and mused, "They say women are made of water. Seems it's true."

"That's your fault!" She buried her face in his chest. 'If not for this jerk, I wouldn't cry at all.'

Her bashful expression stirred him — and she noticed. Looking up in alarm: 'Not again?'

"Qin Jiang," she blurted, scrambling for a topic change, "how are you going to investigate the killer for Nangong Yun?"

"That's not important." His gaze remained fixed on her, burning hotter by the second.

"It is important! Wasn't it your people who did it? Are you going to tell him the truth?"

"My people? No, no, no — the killer is definitely my enemy."

"..."

"I'll have someone look into it thoroughly. I guarantee: the killer is my enemy." He said it without a flicker of irony. Weiwei stared. 'The shamelessness it takes to run Huaxia.'

"But that's not what matters right now." He grinned, tipping her chin up, expression shifting to mock gravity. "What matters is an investigation I need to conduct on you. Yue Weiwei — I'll give you one chance. Confess: are you or are you not made of water? Refuse to cooperate, and I'll have to... investigate personally."

"..."

She pouted, tipped her head back, and bit down on the teasing finger under her chin.

He didn't pull away. "Assaulting the investigator? That's a punishable offense."

"No—"

"Resisting adds to the charges!"

"You're terrible—"

"Insulting an investigator! Additional charge!"

"You—"

"Your defiant little expression — this investigator likes it very much. Please maintain it."

"Pervert!"
