"Heh, another law in the bag."

Qin Jiang pocketed the Myriad Dao Stone. The Eagle Immortal's corpse had likewise crumbled into stone fragments.

With An Xihe's backing, slaying the Eagle Immortal had been trivial.

Two Human Immortals killed in three days. Xue Mei's name swept through the Demon Domain like a storm, and whispers of "strongest below True Immortal" began circulating. Meanwhile, the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's bid for one of the three overlord seats was on everyone's lips.

Qin Jiang and Xue Mei walked side by side, hand in hand, making sure every spectator got a good look. He even nodded politely at the distant observers — ensuring they'd remember his face. In a few days, he'd appear again to destroy the Wolf Race, and the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's ascension would be cemented for good.

On the way back, Xue Mei scratched his palm and winked. Battle's over. Time for the real business?

He licked his lips. "Let's head back."

There was still time before the Wolf Race operation — Xue Mei's reputation needed a few more days to permeate the entire domain.

What followed was best described as a crusade.

An Xihe served as commander-in-chief, Xue Mei as vice-commander, with Yu Lan, Yu Ru, Hu Xian'er, and Xiao Jiu in support. Together, they formed an alliance to bring down the Great Demon King Qin Jiang.

Five days of fierce combat ensued.

The alliance suffered crushing defeats at every turn. Midway through, Vice-Commander Xue Mei defected, colluding with the enemy. The combined assault nearly broke An Xihe outright. The four supports fell one by one, each withdrawing from the alliance in succession.

In the end, An Xihe stood alone. She held on valiantly, but a lone pillar couldn't prop up a crumbling sky.

"I... I'm done~"

With a final, defeated sigh, she surrendered.

The Great Demon King was magnanimous. He accepted her capitulation.

Her first act as a convert was to deliver the traitor Xue Mei to Qin Jiang's feet, demanding punishment for her betrayal. Cornered by An Xihe's insistence — and she was, after all, his darling — Qin Jiang had no choice but to comply.

And so Xue Mei, abandoned by her allies, received a thorough disciplining. Mercifully, the Great Demon King was benevolent. This was merely a token punishment to appease An Xihe — nothing close to full power.

Alliance defeated. Disbanded.

Qin Jiang basked in victory, his supremacy once again unchallenged.

In his arms, Xue Mei shot him a resentful look. Whose idea had it been for her to "betray" the alliance? And now she was the one being "punished"? Hmph. Never again.

An Xihe, of course, hadn't actually been angry. It was all in good fun. She looked at Xue Mei with concern. "Are you okay?"

"Jiejie..." Xue Mei said plaintively. "You really let him punish me?"

"Didn't you enjoy it?"

"I... I did not..."

"No?" An Xihe smirked. "Then why were you so cooperative? And why were you yelling 'faster'—"

"Stop!" Xue Mei leaped up, crimson-faced, and clapped both hands over An Xihe's mouth.

The other women watched from the sidelines, giggling behind their hands. Qin Jiang enjoyed the show as well. Beautiful women bickering was always easy on the eyes.

As the two wrestled playfully, Yu Lan sidled up to him. "Qin Jiang, is it just me, or did my cultivation actually improve?"

She was genuinely puzzled. She'd spent the past five days with him without cultivating once, yet her progress exceeded a normal training session.

"He's comprehended the Yin-Yang Law," An Xihe explained. "Being intimate with him accelerates your cultivation."

"Yin-Yang Law?"

"Basically... dual cultivation," Qin Jiang confirmed.

Of course, the Yin-Yang Law's applications extended far beyond that. Dual cultivation was merely a minor facet. The Yin-Yang Dao was a supreme path on par with Reincarnation and Space-Time.

Yu Lan's cheeks reddened. She clung to his arm. "So from now on, we can just..."

"Heh. As long as you can keep up."

Hu Xian'er launched herself at him immediately. "I can keep up!"

He gave her a flat look and pulled her close, landing a light smack on her backside. "You? You were the first one eliminated."

The little fox was Ancient Emperor level — second only to An Xihe and Xue Mei — yet she'd been the first to fall in the alliance battle.

She huffed. "I think you were targeting me on purpose! Otherwise I'd have lasted until the very end!"

"Oh really?" He pulled her tight, leaned in, and kissed her cheek. "How about a solo round? See how long you actually last."

"Solo..." She faltered, but stubbornness won out. "Bring it!"

"Bold."

Yu Lan quietly released his arm and retreated, casting a sympathetic glance at Hu Xian'er. The others filed out as well, pausing at the door.

"Qin Jiang, don't overdo it. If she cries, you're the one consoling her."

About two hours later, they heard the little fox sobbing. Between wails, she was apologizing, begging for mercy, and calling for rescue.

The women shook their heads. Swagger had consequences.

They didn't intervene — that would only get them dragged in too. Besides, Qin Jiang knew her limits. He adored Hu Xian'er and wouldn't truly push too far.

Sure enough, the crying stopped before long, replaced by sniffles, then quiet grumbling, and finally — Hu Xian'er's bright laughter.

She'd been consoled.
