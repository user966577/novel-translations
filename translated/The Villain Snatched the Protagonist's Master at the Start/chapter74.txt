The next day, Qin Jiang sent Yan Shiya back into the Seven Beauties Painting. As he did, the system chimed.

【Ding! Host has altered a major plotline.

Rewards: One Immortal Marrow (immortal-grade spirit marrow — produces Immortal Qi, the foundation for advancing to the immortal path); Way of the Sword Emperor (the true path of the Sword Emperor — one sword drawn, ten thousand kneel); Emperor-Grade Alchemy (due to Host's low cultivation, probability of refining Emperor-grade pills is minimal); Myriad Dao Stone (forcibly absorbs a Great Emperor's law power and purifies it); Villain Points.】

As expected, the Sword Heart had been destined for Lin Chen. By snatching it first, Qin Jiang had triggered the system's rewards—and what rewards they were.

An Immortal Marrow that could generate Immortal Qi? A Myriad Dao Stone that could steal a Great Emperor's fundamental law power? These two items immediately caught his attention.

'So advancing to the immortal path requires Immortal Qi,' he mused. 'But there's probably almost none on the Heavenly Mystery Continent—maybe none at all. Otherwise, with so many Great Emperors tens of thousands of years ago, at least one would have ascended to immortality.'

The continent's lack of Immortal Qi explained the absence of immortal-level cultivators. That was his theory, at least. Regardless, he now had access to Immortal Qi—not that it was useful yet. The Qin family's four ancestors had only just broken through to Great Emperor. Immortality was a distant goal, and they wouldn't know what to do with Immortal Qi at this stage.

As for the Myriad Dao Stone—forcibly stripping a Great Emperor's law power? That was the foundation of a Great Emperor's entire existence. Lose your laws, and you were effectively crippled. The stone could steal an enemy Emperor's laws and convert them for your own people's use.

But there was a problem: apart from the Qin family's four ancestors, there didn't seem to be any other Great Emperors on the Heavenly Mystery Continent. He could hardly use it on his own people.

"The Myriad Dao Stone is useless too..." He sighed. Great items, terrible timing.

He glanced at the other rewards—the Sword Emperor path and the alchemy upgrade were both personal power boosts. Useful, but the gains were marginal, and Qin Jiang was too lazy to do things himself most of the time. He preferred being a powerful heir who let others do the heavy lifting. Of course, he couldn't neglect his own strength entirely. After all, you had to have the goods to back up the talk.

'Might as well level up before heading back.'

His aura began climbing. With his dual Divine Bodies, breaking through was simply a matter of choosing when. Minutes later, he reached Divine Ability Realm Perfection. He held for a moment, then pushed further. Within an hour, he'd broken through to the Yin-Yang Realm.

"That should do it." He nodded, satisfied. A productive trip all around.

At the 27,000-foot depth, Liu Shuwan stood outside her stone dwelling, gazing anxiously into the valley's lower reaches.

"It's been two days... why hasn't he come back?"

She was on the verge of going in after him. Given his sword comprehension, reaching 30,000 feet should have been trivial—it shouldn't have taken this long. But beyond the sword pressure, who knew what other dangers lurked at those depths?

Just as she was about to descend, a familiar figure finally appeared. Her eyes lit up and she moved instinctively, nearly throwing herself into his arms before shyness checked her momentum. But her delight was impossible to hide.

Qin Jiang, however, had no such reservations. He spread his arms wide and pulled her into a tight embrace.

Liu Shuwan's cheeks colored, but she didn't resist. Two days apart, and she'd discovered just how much she'd come to depend on this little rogue.

"Did my little Wan'er miss me?" He kissed her forehead lightly.

The pet name made her pout. "Don't make up nicknames—I'm way older than you. If we're talking seniority..."

"If we're talking seniority, should I call you... little ancestral wifey?"

Liu Shuwan rolled her eyes. "Absolutely not."

"Then what should I call you?"

She furrowed her brows, considering. Every option seemed wrong. Their relationship was different from everyone else's—she couldn't let him use the same forms of address.

"How about..." Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. "I'll call you 'wifey'?"

"Hmph!" The word made her blush fiercely. She swatted his chest. "Stop taking liberties!"

"It's settled, then." Qin Jiang was entirely unbothered. He grabbed her hand. "From now on—wifey."

"No! I don't agree!"

"It's my mouth. What are you going to do—seal it shut?" He grinned. "Wifey~"

"Ahh, Qin Jiang, stop calling me that!"

Liu Shuwan squirmed in protest, trying to cover his mouth, but he just kept going. "Wifey, wifey, wifey~ Hehe, can't stop me~"

She glared at him, but the more she heard it, the less terrible it sounded.

"You know," he said, eyeing her lips, "there is one way to shut me up. Depends on what you use..."

"Hmph." She tossed her head. Of course she understood what he was getting at. "Call me whatever you want—I don't care anymore."

She surrendered. Qin Jiang was a shameless force of nature, and Liu Shuwan had no countermeasures.

"Well then—wifey, let's go home!"

He scooped her up and carried her toward the stone dwelling. Liu Shuwan yelped and clung to his neck, nestling against him. For the first time, she felt truly safe.

Back inside, Qin Jiang sat on the stone stool with Liu Shuwan on his lap.

"Put me down," she protested with a pout, though she made no effort to move. If anything, she snuggled closer, arms draped around his neck.

"Hold still." Qin Jiang sent a thread of energy into her body. "Let me check on your injuries."

"Oh~" Liu Shuwan nodded and let him work without resistance. In this state, a single thought from him could shatter her meridians—but she trusted him completely.
