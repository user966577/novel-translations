Despite Qin Jiang's spirited resistance, the women had their meal. Several days' worth, in fact.

They didn't manage to exhaust him. Instead, they stuffed themselves.

As chef, Qin Jiang was obliged to take responsibility. He surveyed the women lying in a row, groaning softly, and went down the line — massaging, kneading, easing the distension until each belly returned to its original flatness.

"All that talk about dining and dashing, and you ate yourselves into a food coma."

The women pouted at his smug face, itching to sink their teeth into him. They settled for a collective glare, then sat up slowly, hands pressed to aching lower backs. Truly exhausted.

But the meal had been spectacular. Worth every bit of soreness. Could've eaten more, honestly.

Qin Jiang sidled over and patted their backsides.

"Hey! What are you doing~"

An Xihe pushed him away, cheeks pink. Qing Chan and the others watched him warily. They knew that signal — muscle memory nearly had them flipping over before their brains caught up. Too tired. They froze just in time.

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. "Relax. I'm offering massages. Just your backs."

"Just backs?"

"Promise."

They hesitated, exchanged looks, and cautiously turned over. "Only backs~"

"Yes~"

He went to work — varying pressure, practiced hands, the fatigue melting away. They closed their eyes and enjoyed it.

While massaging, he spoke. "Qingqiu, before we leave — do you want to say goodbye to anyone?"

"No need," she said, shaking her head. "We can tell the ancestor on the way out."

She was the Li family's heir, but she had no blood relatives left. Her parents had died on a clan mission shortly after her birth. She'd been raised in the Li family's orphanage until her talent emerged, winning the attention of the elders and, eventually, the ancestor himself.

She hadn't wasted the opportunity. Through sheer effort, her gifts had shone brilliantly enough to earn her the position of heir.

"Alright." Qin Jiang's hands never stopped. "Once everyone's recovered, we'll head home."

"Okay~"

Under his ministrations, the aches quickly faded. Qin Jiang accompanied Li Qingqiu to bid farewell to the Li Family Ancestor — a brief, unsentimentally affair.

The send-off, on the other hand, was enormous. Nearly every faction leader in Grey Cloud Heaven turned out.

In a quiet corner, Li Yang hid behind a wall, peering through a gap at the departing procession. Specifically, at Li Qingqiu.

His eyes burned with devotion, unblinking. "Cousin Qingqiu looks even more beautiful..."

Beside him, three spectral figures looked at him with pity. She certainly did look more radiant. Because she was being well-nourished, you fool. This oblivious boy didn't understand a thing.

They shook their heads and kept their mouths shut. No point shattering his illusions. The kid still believed Li Qingqiu was chaste. Even knowing she'd bathed and shared a bed with Qin Jiang, he'd convinced himself they'd merely bathed and merely slept. He refused to accept that his untouchable goddess would give herself to any man so easily.

"He's finally leaving," one of the sword spirits murmured.

The other two relaxed slightly, nodding. They'd felt Qin Jiang's awareness hovering near them — a vague but persistent threat that had frayed their nerves. Now that he was going, and he hadn't come for Li Yang again in all this time, it likely meant he hadn't detected them after all. No one, they reasoned, would ignore an Immortal King weapon.

"Cousin Qingqiu is leaving..." Li Yang's face crumpled with longing. "After this, who knows when I'll see her again."

The three spirits were speechless. That tone — as if they were close. She didn't even know he existed! And the next time he saw her, she'd probably be carrying a baby in her arms.

They had nothing to say to this lovesick fool. No argument could overcome a simp's ability to rationalize.

"Masters," Li Yang said suddenly, "do you think I could get into Huaxia Academy?"

Three pairs of ancient eyes turned to him. Was the boy finally showing ambition?

They'd heard about Huaxia Academy — purpose-built to prepare elites for the Heavenly Domain, backed by Huaxia's limitless resources and incredible teaching staff. Spots were fiercely contested. Only the most exceptional talents stood a chance.

As for Li Yang... the three sword spirits firmly believed he had extraordinary potential. Under their guidance, he just hadn't shown it yet. That made them slightly uneasy.

"You really want in?"

Li Yang nodded firmly. "If I get into Huaxia Academy, I'll have more chances to see Cousin Qingqiu."

The spirits' faces twitched.

But he wasn't wrong. That young man was Huaxia's leader. He'd certainly visit the academy, and Li Qingqiu would likely be at his side. For Li Yang, this was genuinely the best path to seeing her again.

The spirits had reservations, though. That young man made them uneasy — a low-grade but persistent sense of danger that seemed to emanate from the Lord of Huaxia himself.

Still, if Li Yang did get in, the resources alone would be transformative. No shortage of cultivation materials, at the very least.
