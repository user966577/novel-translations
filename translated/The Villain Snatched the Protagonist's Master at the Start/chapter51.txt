Qin Jiang didn't hesitate. He bought the Fortune-Sealing Stele on the spot.

A tiny stele appeared in his palm. Qin Jiang's eyes bulged.

"System, did you cut corners on this?"

The thing was smaller than his hand. Could it really protect the Qin family's fortune?

Before the system could respond, information about the Fortune-Sealing Stele flooded into his mind:

Fortune-Sealing Stele: can grow or shrink at will, can change weight at will. Seals the fortune of all under heaven, protects ten thousand generations from ruin!

The brief description put a grin on Qin Jiang's face. This stele was the real deal.

Villain Points well spent.

"Nothing beats the system for value."

The system: "..."

She didn't believe a single word of his. He'd literally just accused her of cutting corners. Now that he knew what it did, suddenly she was offering great value?

The nerve. She spat internally.

Before long, Qin Jiang had figured out how the Fortune-Sealing Stele worked. He just needed to place it within the Qin family's territory for it to take effect. As for where to put it...

Obviously, his own courtyard was the safest spot.

Qin Jiang went to the courtyard, enlarged the stele a bit, found a suitable location, and slammed it into the ground. Looking at it, though...

It kind of looked like he'd put up a tombstone in his yard.

A bit of an eyesore, but function over form.

Finally, he maxed out the stele's weight so that even a Supreme Realm expert would struggle to lift it. No point risking someone making off with it while he was away.

Satisfied, Qin Jiang nodded.

"System, the Qin family's fortune won't drain anymore, right?"

【The Fortune-Sealing Stele can seal the fortune of all under heaven. A single Qin family is easily handled.】

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched at the response.

A "single" Qin family...

Fair enough. In the grand scheme, the Qin family really wasn't that big.

"Time to transfer Xiao Fan's fortune, then."

Qin Jiang spoke up.

All this effort was for the sake of receiving Xiao Fan's fortune. He hadn't forgotten.

【Fine.】

The system agreed, then fell silent. Qin Jiang waited. Nothing happened.

"System?"

【Transfer complete.】

Qin Jiang: "???"

That was it? He didn't feel anything.

But just then—

The ground shook violently as a wave of energy nearly knocked him off his feet. It lasted only an instant before dissipating completely.

As if it had never happened.

But Qin Jiang's gaze had snapped toward the rear mountain, a flash of excitement in his eyes. He knew that several of the family's ancestral elders had been in seclusion, attempting to use the Great Emperor blood essence to break through to the Great Emperor realm.

In that brief moment, he'd sensed a pressure identical to the Fourth Ancestor's.

Great Emperor!

He was about to head for the rear mountain when the ground heaved again, staggering him.

"Another one?"

Qin Jiang was elated.

This time, he didn't rush off immediately. Instead, he waited, hoping for one more.

Three ancestral elders had been in seclusion.

Two had already broken through. Surely the third wouldn't fail?

Sure enough, he wasn't disappointed.

A third energy wave surged outward. The successive tremors left the Qin family members bewildered, though certain high-ranking members had sensed something and wore expressions of barely contained excitement.

Qin Jiang made his way toward the rear mountain, muttering to himself:

"This has to be the fortune at work."

Xiao Fan's fortune had barely been transferred to the family before three ancestral elders broke through to Great Emperor in rapid succession. If that wasn't fortune's influence, Qin Jiang would eat his shoe.

The rear mountain was the Qin family's restricted zone. Besides the ancestral elders, no one else was allowed to enter freely—not even the family head. Qin Jiang, however, was an exception.

His status now exceeded even that of most ancestral elders.

The moment he entered the rear mountain, he saw a group of elders straining to maintain a barrier, preventing the breakthrough energy from leaking out.

The Fourth Ancestor was among them, wiping sweat from his brow and grumbling:

"Did they have to all break through at once? Does this old emperor not have enough pressure already?"

Three Great Emperors breaking through simultaneously—the released energy had most of the ancestral elders white-faced. Without the Fourth Ancestor anchoring the front, there was no way they could have contained it.

From outside the barrier, Qin Jiang could see churning phenomena within, accompanied by terrifying waves of power that had annihilated everything inside.

He winced.

If this energy had been released in full, the ancestral breakthroughs would be one thing, but the Qin family estate would be half-destroyed.

No wonder most powerful cultivators went to remote mountains for their breakthroughs. Fear of being ambushed was only part of it—they also didn't want to level their own homes.

Breaking through to Great Emperor took time.

According to the Fourth Ancestor, his own breakthrough had taken half a day just to stabilize, followed by several more days to fully master Great Emperor power.

Qin Jiang stayed put.

He sat cross-legged outside the barrier, waiting patiently.

Several hours later, the energy within finally subsided.

The assembled elders breathed a collective sigh of relief.

Then, with a thunderous crack, the First Ancestor appeared before them.

"So this is what it's like to be a Great Emperor?"

He hovered in midair, his aura not yet fully reined in, looking every bit the sovereign.

Right behind him, the Second and Third Ancestors emerged as well.

Great Emperor pressure set the void trembling. The other elders gazed upon them with reverence and envy.

"Ha! Who would've thought—the four of us actually all made it to Great Emperor!"

The Fourth Ancestor roared with laughter, flashing to the First Ancestor's side.

The other three smiled as well, then turned their gazes collectively toward Qin Jiang.

"It's all thanks to this kid."

The First Ancestor spoke.

The four of them appeared before Qin Jiang, emotions stirring within them.

They'd originally pinned their hopes on Qin Jiang as the family's path to the Great Emperor realm. Yet before Qin Jiang himself had broken through, he'd already helped all four of them achieve it.

That was something none of them had foreseen.

"Congratulations to the four ancestors on your breakthrough!"

Qin Jiang grinned.

The Fourth Ancestor waved dismissively.

"We only made it because of you, kid."

The other three nodded. They were curious about how Qin Jiang had procured Great Emperor laws and blood essence, but since he wasn't volunteering the information, they didn't pry.

Then the First Ancestor flipped his palm.

"There are still four drops of Great Emperor blood essence left. What do you think we should do with them?"

"That many left over?"

The Fourth Ancestor was mildly surprised.

He'd expected ten drops of blood essence to barely push the three of them through, if they were lucky. He hadn't anticipated having nearly half remaining.

The First Ancestor smiled faintly.

"I'd expected to need all of them too. But today, everything just fell into place—no obstacles whatsoever. The breakthrough happened almost effortlessly."
