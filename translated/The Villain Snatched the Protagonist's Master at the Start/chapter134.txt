The frontier.

This was Long Yu's third day at the border. Every garrison commander understood that despite the official line about tempering through experience, Long Yu had been shunted aside—exiled in all but name.

So the commanders treated him with polite indifference at best.

Accustomed to being the center of attention, Long Yu found their attitude intolerable. By the second day, he'd already reached out to his Demon Hall contacts in secret.

On this particular day, Long Yu sat in a cramped tent, face dark as a storm cloud, clad in standard-issue armor. His rank was a mere general—nothing impressive without the princely title propping it up. And the frontier marshal had actually made him do a general's grunt work: patrols, drills, every dirty, exhausting task on the roster.

Then space split open inside his tent, and a sinister laugh echoed forth.

"Heh heh heh. Ninth Prince, we meet again."

Long Yu looked up. A familiar figure materialized before him. His expression stayed cold. "Demon Lord. You're late."

"Heh, the Demon Hall has its affairs. I'm not an idle prince with time to spare."

The Demon Lord's words carried a subtle barb. Long Yu snorted but held his temper. He took a deep breath.

"If I join the Demon Hall, how much support can you provide?"

"That depends on what the Ninth Prince intends to do." The Demon Lord's voice turned silky. "Should you join, you'd hold the rank of Holy Son. Even someone of my standing would take orders from you. Beyond that, you'd have authority to command three of the Demon Hall's Elders. And if your goals happen to align against the Divine Dragon Empire... heh, our resources won't disappoint."

He studied Long Yu. "So, what is the Ninth Prince's decision?"

Long Yu's eyes flickered. A trace of inner conflict lingered—joining the Demon Hall meant crossing a line he could never uncross.

But when he considered his circumstances, his resolve crystallized. A vicious expression twisted his features, madness glinting in his eyes.

"I need military achievements! Can the Demon Hall arrange that?"

"Military achievements?" The Demon Lord smiled coldly and nodded. "Naturally. Stirring up trouble is child's play for us. With advance intelligence, you'd rack up merit effortlessly. The only question is—how much merit does the Ninth Prince desire?"

"The more the better, obviously!"

"That will come at a price."

"What price?"

"First, joining the Demon Hall requires more than lip service." The Demon Lord swept his arm, and a wisp of pure demonic qi materialized before Long Yu. "This is demonic qi—from our Founder herself. Refine it, and your power will gradually convert to demonic energy. Your strength will surge."

Long Yu's expression shifted. He wanted the Demon Hall's resources, but he didn't want to become a genuine demonic cultivator.

Seeing his hesitation, the Demon Lord's tone turned frosty. "What's the matter? No sincerity?"

"I'm a prince. If I become a demonic cultivator, it'll be detected instantly."

The Demon Lord shook his head with a smile. "The Ninth Prince needn't worry. The Founder's demonic qi can perfectly mask your aura. Even in combat, no one will notice."

As he spoke, his gaze lingered on the demonic qi with naked covetousness. This was the treasure every Demon Hall cultivator dreamed of. A pity it wasn't meant for him.

"Refine it quickly, Ninth Prince."

Tearing his eyes away, he urged Long Yu on. Such a priceless gift, and the boy was actually hesitating. Unbelievable.

Long Yu frowned, drew the demonic qi into his palm, and was still deliberating when it suddenly pulsed and burrowed into his body of its own accord.

His face changed.

Sinking his awareness inward, he watched the demonic qi rampage through his meridians, tainting everything it touched. His spiritual energy was converting whether he wanted it to or not. He couldn't stop it.

Then a hazy golden radiance blossomed from within, and the corrupted meridians began to recover.

'My bloodline!' Long Yu's heart leapt.

His ancestors' progenitor had been a divine dragon. Though the bloodline had thinned over the ages, reversions occurred, and Long Yu's dragon blood was exceptionally dense—richer even than the Dragon Emperor's.

Now, sensing a threat, his bloodline activated on its own.

But this demonic qi originated from an immortal-path powerhouse. Long Yu's bloodline, while also of immortal origin, came from a dragon long dead. Its residual power was a shadow of what it had once been.

Threatened, the demonic qi erupted with terrifying force.

Long Yu's body became the battlefield. The two energies warred savagely. He grunted, his face whitening, blood seeping from the corner of his mouth. His aura lurched wildly—golden light flashing one moment, demonic qi billowing the next.

The Demon Lord waved his hand, sealing the tent to prevent unwanted attention.

Long Yu's body convulsed, eyes clenched shut. The conflict between demonic qi and bloodline raged for two full hours before he snapped his eyes open.

His irises, once cleanly black and white, had turned jet-black through and through, with a single thread of gold flickering in their depths—an unsettling blend of the profane and the sacred.

He inhaled deeply, closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, they'd returned to normal.

He regarded the Demon Lord with an icy expression. A faint pressure radiated from him. The Demon Lord swallowed and bowed slightly.

"Your subordinate greets the Holy Son."

By refining the Founder's demonic qi, Long Yu had formally joined the Demon Hall. That qi carried a trace of the Founder's aura, granting a natural authority over all demonic cultivators.

Long Yu's eyes glinted. Refining the demonic qi hadn't been all bad, actually. His bloodline had fused with it, and the combined power was far greater than either alone. Compared to before, he felt he could take on three of his old selves.

He clenched his fist and fixed the Demon Lord with a stare. "Can I now command Demon Hall members?"

"Naturally." The Demon Lord nodded. "Below the Elders, you have free rein. Three Elders can be mobilized as well."

"Good. Mobilize everyone I can command. I want the frontier thrown into chaos—the more disorder, the better."

Only in chaos could he seize military glory. And since he'd orchestrated the chaos himself, quelling it would be trivial.

Opportunity—easy, obvious, his for the taking!

A spark of excitement kindled in his chest. He murmured to himself: "You exiled me to the frontier? Then I'll make this frontier mine."
