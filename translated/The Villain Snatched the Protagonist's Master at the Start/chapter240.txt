"So you two have history," Qin Jiang mused, rubbing his chin.

Qing Chan nodded. She personally didn't think the grudge was that serious—but the other party might feel differently.

She looked at Qin Jiang and blinked. "How about... you take her out for me? One less threat. And the Chaos District is actually the best location in the Central Regions—we could seize it for ourselves."

"???"

Qin Jiang scoffed. "Please. She's a True Immortal. I don't have that kind of firepower."

"Don't play coy." Qing Chan rolled her eyes. "When I grabbed you, I sensed a threat coming from you. If I'd meant you harm, you would've struck, right?"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. When Qing Chan had kidnapped him, the Immortal King Seal had been primed and ready. If she'd shown any hostility, he'd have used it without hesitation. He just hadn't expected her to sense it without him even making a move.

A True Immortal's perception was impressively sharp.

"That's the same weapon you used to kill the Ghost Immortal, isn't it?" Qing Chan pressed.

He smiled and nodded but offered no specifics. It was effective against True Immortals—that much was certain.

Qing Chan pouted. He was still keeping his guard up.

"Fine." She waved dismissively, her mood souring. "I bet the moment you see her, you won't want to use it anyway."

"Hm?"

"She's as beautiful as I am. Could you really bring yourself to attack a beauty?"

"She's a woman?"

Qin Jiang's interest piqued.

Qing Chan rolled her eyes. Predictable—the man had a blatant soft spot for beautiful women and zero compunction about ruthlessness toward men. A total double standard.

"Yes, she's a woman. But put that out of your mind for now. You haven't even won over Ning Xue'er and the others yet."

Qin Jiang grinned at her. "If you'd just tie them all to the bed for me, it'd be done already."

"Dream on." Qing Chan huffed, then added: "But I did promise you compensation. Pick one of them—I'll tie her up for you."

"Really?" Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. He rubbed his hands together. "Then tie up Ning Xue'er. She's been very disrespectful—I need to teach her a lesson."

The Chaos District situation wasn't going anywhere fast with a True Immortal calling the shots. Qin Jiang told Black Dragon to lie low and attempt peaceful contact with the Chaos Sect instead.

As for Black Dragon's vendetta, Qin Jiang promised to handle it personally—by going straight to the source. That True Immortal. For Black Dragon's sake, he would thoroughly... educate her.

Touched to the point of tears, Black Dragon vowed to work harder at making nice with the Chaos Sect, paving the way for his Young Lord to win over yet another beauty.

The bond between master and servant—truly moving.

Qing Chan rolled her eyes. These two were shameless—one shamelessly scheming, the other shamelessly flattering. A perfect pair.

After rallying Black Dragon, Qin Jiang returned to the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. Qing Chan summoned Ning Xue'er.

"Qing Chan called for me?" Ning Xue'er arrived at the cottage, glanced at Qin Jiang, and turned to Qing Chan.

Qing Chan looked at Qin Jiang. He flashed Ning Xue'er a wide grin.

"Little Xue'er~ I told you I'd tattle."

"..."

He'd actually done it?

She looked pleadingly at Qing Chan. Surely her big sister wouldn't side with a man over her own...

"Qing Chan—tie her up."

Qin Jiang pointed at Ning Xue'er.

She glared at him, then turned her wounded eyes to Qing Chan. "Qing Chan..."

"Little Xue'er~"

Qing Chan smiled gently and glided over. One hand on Ning Xue'er's shoulder, a flash of light—and Ning Xue'er's cultivation was sealed.

"You—! You actually sealed me for a man?!" Ning Xue'er gasped.

She tried to bolt, but against Qing Chan, escape was hopeless—especially now. Qing Chan gripped her shoulder and sighed. "I'm sorry, Xue'er."

Then she tossed the girl to Qin Jiang.

He caught her easily. Ning Xue'er clung to his shirt in a panic, eyes darting everywhere. She distinctly remembered his threat to spank her. Her face reddened. The Palace Master of the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, spanked by a man—unthinkable.

She looked at Qin Jiang and forced a sweet smile, her voice going soft and coy. "Big brother Jiang~ won't you let me go~?"

One hand clasped the other, full-on puppy-dog mode.

Qin Jiang matched her saccharine tone perfectly. "Nope~"

"..."

Ning Xue'er's face fell. Was he mocking her?

Before she could protest, she yelped—without her cultivation, her physical strength was no match for his. He flipped her over his knee and, without a shred of hesitation, brought his palm down.

"Ah~"

Ning Xue'er's face burned crimson. She twisted to stare at him in disbelief. He'd actually... like disciplining a child.

Seeing him raise his hand again, she thrashed desperately. "Let me go!"

"Oh? Fighting back?"

"You bastard!"

"Calling me names?"

"Qing Chan, save me!"

"Crying for help?"

"You..."

"Me what?"

Ning Xue'er went silent. Qin Jiang held his hand up, waiting. When she said nothing, he brought it down anyway.

"What was that for?! I didn't fight back, didn't swear, didn't call for help..."

"Arguing?"

"..."

When you wanted to hit someone, you could always find a reason.

Qin Jiang grinned at her flushed face and secretly rubbed his palm. Nice. Very nice texture.

He should do a more thorough assessment.

Ning Xue'er gave up and lay still. Fine—let him. It didn't really hurt. And no one else was watching. Just Qing Chan. She could live with that.

But as the spanking continued, his hand grew lighter and lighter until it wasn't slapping anymore—it was stroking.

Ning Xue'er felt a tickle, squirming involuntarily. Her face was on fire.
