Outside the Yang family gates, Zhao Sheng and Liu Xing were predictably stopped by guards.

Zhao Sheng didn't dare force his way in. In his mind, this was his future father-in-law's home, so he kept things polite. "Could you please inform Patriarch Yang that Zhao Sheng is here?"

"Zhao Sheng? You're Zhao Sheng?" The guard's eyes narrowed. The Zhao patriarch was the most hated name in the Yang family. He studied Zhao Sheng and recognized the resemblance to the portrait he'd seen.

The guard snorted. "Wait here."

Knowing Zhao Sheng's strength, the guard wasn't foolish enough to provoke him. He hurried inside to report. Before long, Yang Hong appeared. Seeing Zhao Sheng, he allowed himself a cold smirk. The Yang family had nothing to fear from the Zhao family anymore—they had a real backer now.

"Well, well. What brings the Zhao patriarch to our humble little family?" His voice dripped with condescension.

Zhao Sheng smiled wryly. He knew the Yang family didn't welcome him, but what could he do? He was the one pining after their daughter. Though confident he could defeat Yang Hong in a fight, he kept his posture deferential.

"Patriarch Yang flatters himself. The Yang family has always been the power in these parts."

Yang Hong scoffed. Before today, he would have read that as mockery. But now, he fully intended to reclaim that top position.

"Enough pleasantries. Say your piece—I haven't got all night."

Zhao Sheng paused, then asked carefully, "Patriarch Yang... how is Miss Manman?"

Yang Manman—Yang Hong's daughter. Zhao Sheng's beloved. Right now, she was locked in a passionate kiss with Qin Jiang.

Yang Hong's eyes narrowed. He knew his daughter had feelings for this boy, and apparently the sentiment was mutual. Before today, he might not have approved but wouldn't have been entirely opposed. Now, however, Zhao Sheng represented a threat to his daughter's future—and the Yang family's.

His expression turned glacial. "My daughter's affairs are none of your concern. You're not welcome here. Leave."

"Patriarch Yang, I—"

"I said leave!"

Yang Hong was losing patience. He was terrified Qin Jiang would find out about his daughter's history with Zhao Sheng and discard her. He wanted Zhao Sheng gone, quickly and quietly, before anything could go wrong.

But Zhao Sheng hadn't rushed over in the middle of the night just to be turned away. He took a steadying breath and spoke with conviction. "Patriarch Yang, I must see Miss Manman today."

"Hmph. You and what army?"

Yang Hong's confidence ran deep. He had three True Immortals behind him now. If things escalated, they'd intervene—couldn't have the commotion disturbing the man inside. His only worry was whether Qin Jiang would abandon his daughter once he learned about Zhao Sheng. But the risk was unavoidable now. Zhao Sheng clearly wasn't leaving without a fight. Yang Hong could only pray that Qin Jiang cared enough about his daughter to overlook this.

His aura flared. Just then, Liu Xing stepped forward with an easy smile, placed a hand on Yang Hong's shoulder, and crushed his rising energy with casual force.

Yang Hong's eyes went wide. A True Immortal. How did Zhao Sheng have a True Immortal at his side?

"Let's go inside, shall we?" Liu Xing said pleasantly.

Yang Hong bristled—one True Immortal didn't scare him. He had three! But before he could refuse, Liu Xing's voice reached him via private transmission: "The Manor Lord wishes it."

Manor Lord? Yang Hong's mind raced. He looked at Liu Xing, who glanced meaningfully toward the estate's interior with a knowing smile.

'Manor Lord'—was that the man inside? This True Immortal was his subordinate too? Planted beside Zhao Sheng?

Then he'd known everything all along.

Relief washed over Yang Hong. If the man already knew about Zhao Sheng and his daughter's connection and had still claimed her, then he clearly didn't mind. Letting them in should be safe enough—and it might well be a direct order.
