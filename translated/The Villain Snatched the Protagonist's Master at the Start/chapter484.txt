Qin Jiang lingered in her arms for most of the day, the two of them chatting idly. The moment Murong Qing heard sounds from Xue Yue's room, she shoved him away in a panic, face flushed.

"I'm going back to my room. Don't tell Yueyue."

She hurried off like a thief fleeing the scene. Qin Jiang shook his head, settled casually into his seat, and waited.

Soon, Xue Yue drifted out, still languid. Her face brightened when she saw him. She trotted over and plopped herself in his lap, arms looping around his neck. She tilted her chin up, lips pursed. "Qin Jiang, kiss me~"

He obliged, wrapping an arm around her waist and pressing his lips to hers. They stayed like that for a while, then lingered together, exchanging small affections.

From inside her room, Murong Qing watched through a crack in the door. Envy stirred in her chest. She'd never known that kind of intimacy. It looked so happy. The strange warmth she'd felt with Qin Jiang cradled in her arms earlier—she couldn't put it into words, but it had been wonderful.

If only she weren't Xue Yue's mother. But what they'd done wasn't too far out of bounds, was it? She'd simply been providing motherly affection. A mother-in-law looking after her son-in-law. Perfectly natural. And if it happened again—well, he was the one who kept claiming to be deprived of maternal love. But next time, hugging would be the absolute limit.

Outside, Xue Yue glanced toward Murong Qing's room. "Is Mother still in there?"

Qin Jiang could sense Murong Qing watching. He smiled slightly and looked away. "Probably still cultivating."

"Oh." Xue Yue nodded. "Mother really is dedicated. She always told me that only the strong control their own destiny."

"Can't argue with that."

Xue Yue laughed, arms tightening around his neck. "Then again, finding a powerful husband works just as well."

"That's no excuse to slack off." He pinched her cheek and tapped her nose. "At minimum, you need to reach Human Immortal."

"I know." She pouted. Only at the Human Immortal level could she stay with Qin Jiang long-term. She was only at Supreme Realm, but with his resources and her talent, reaching Human Immortal was inevitable.

Murong Qing's door opened. She stepped out, perfectly composed, looking like she'd just finished cultivating. She glanced at the darkening sky with well-rehearsed surprise.

"Oh my, it's gotten so late! Sorry, I was deep in cultivation and lost track of time. When are we leaving?"

Qin Jiang couldn't help but smile at the performance.

Xue Yue bounced over, linking arms with her. "No rush! Do you want to rest first?"

"No need." Murong Qing shook her head. She shot Qin Jiang a glare when Xue Yue wasn't looking. This was his fault. If he hadn't been so shameless, she wouldn't have needed to lie. And he had the nerve to smirk!

The glare, though, carried more flirtatious heat than menace. It only made his smile widen.

He stepped forward. "Then let's head out. Moth-- I mean, Mother-in-law, do you need to pack anything?"

"Let me get my things." She glared at him again. What had he almost called her?

"Let me help!" Xue Yue started to follow, but Qin Jiang caught her arm.

"I'll help your mother. You rest—last night was tiring."

Xue Yue blushed but nodded, staying in the courtyard. As she watched Qin Jiang disappear into Murong Qing's room, she blinked thoughtfully. So the rascal really was interested in her mother. The question was when he'd make his move. At least with Qin Jiang, her mother would be very happy.

Inside the room, Murong Qing was packing when Qin Jiang walked up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist, chin resting on her shoulder. She flinched, turning to look at him, eyes wide with alarm.

"What are you doing?" She kept her voice low, terrified of Xue Yue hearing.

He smiled, tilted his head, and let his lips brush her cheek. She turned scarlet.

"You—don't. Let go. Yueyue's right outside."

Her voice trembled. Her hands grasped at his, trying to pry them loose, but she was no match for his strength—and she couldn't struggle too loudly. He could tell what she was thinking, which only emboldened him.

"Auntie Qing'er, you smell so nice."

His head nuzzled against her face, and then he kissed her full on the lips.

"Mm!" Her eyes flew wide, but her body went limp. She gripped his clothes, one anxious eye on the open doorway. From where they stood, Xue Yue couldn't see them—but any movement could change that.

When he finally released her, she was breathing hard, face flushed, caught between relief and indignation.

"You bastard—I'm Yueyue's mother! How dare you--"

Before she could finish, he kissed her again. Brief, but enough to silence her.

"You--"

"Relax, Auntie Qing'er. Yueyue won't find out."

She glanced through the doorway, then whispered, "That doesn't make it right!"

"No?"

"No!"

He fixed her with an intense stare that made her shrink back slightly. "You—what are you going to do? Yueyue's right outside. Don't you dare--"
