Long Yu surged forward, shoving aside the soldiers trying to shield him and charging straight at the Saint.

"Ninth Prince!"

Voices cried out in alarm. Every soldier was cursing internally—was this prince an idiot? A Yin-Yang Realm cultivator picking a fight with a Saint? That was suicide.

Still, prince was prince. Disgraced or not, his rank outstripped theirs. If he died, their families would pay the price.

Gritting their teeth, the soldiers charged after him. Even if it cost their lives, Long Yu had to survive.

In a flash, Long Yu closed the distance and attacked the Demon Hall Saint, giving the man a subtle wink before unleashing a devastating strike.

The Saint sneered, swatting the attack aside with a casual flick. Before Long Yu could react, an eruption of Emperor-level pressure and surging demonic qi hammered down on him.

Long Yu's expression contorted. The demonic qi inside him stirred instinctively, but he clamped down on it immediately—he couldn't expose himself as a demonic cultivator. Not in front of all these witnesses.

He clenched his jaw and took the hit head-on.

Blood sprayed from his mouth as his body rocketed backward, eyes locked on the Demon Hall Saint, burning with rage.

'That bastard! I'm the Demon Hall Holy Son—my authority is second only to the Founder's! I can command Supreme Realm powerhouses! And this lowly Saint dares hurt me?'

His expression twisted into something savage.

Then the Demon Hall Saint looked down at him with amusement and swept his arm forward. "Kill them all!"

Shadowy figures erupted from the forest, demonic qi running wild. Combined with the Saint's power, it was a massacre.

"Ninth Prince, we can't hold!"

Long Yu clutched his chest, coughing violently, blood streaming from his lips. He memorized that Saint's face. Then, through gritted teeth: "Retreat!"

The soldiers closed ranks around him and fell back. Of the thousand who'd charged in, fewer than fifty made it out. They didn't dare stop, rushing Long Yu back to the main encampment.

His injuries weren't critical. After treatment, he'd mostly recovered within a day. Several commanders visited—out of obligation, not concern. Their eyes held only cold indifference. A few even looked disdainful.

They'd already heard the account from surviving soldiers. A reckless assault, panicked leadership, botched commands—nearly a thousand soldiers dead. The blame fell squarely on Long Yu.

The next day, alone in his tent, a figure materialized silently.

"Holy Son."

The Demon Lord, bowing.

The moment Long Yu saw him, his pale face twisted with fury. "Demon Lord! Explain yourself!"

Wisps of demonic qi leaked from Long Yu's body, pressing down on his visitor.

The Demon Lord ducked his head. "Please calm yourself, Holy Son. The cultivator we deployed was originally Unity Realm, but after massacring that city, he absorbed the blood essence and broke through to Saint. It went to his head."

"Oh? Went to his head? Decided he didn't feel like dying?" Long Yu's voice dripped with venom.

"Demonic cultivators are inherently difficult to control," the Demon Lord said carefully. "A sudden breakthrough and the power rush that comes with it—a little defiance is understandable. However, he injured the Holy Son, and the Demon Hall has already issued a kill order. He will answer for his crime."

Long Yu snorted, took a deep breath, and forced himself to calm down. "I don't want to hear excuses. Next time, there'd better not be any surprises."

"You have my word, Holy Son."

"Go. Prepare the next operation. And if there's another incident like this, I'll use you as the military achievement."

"Bahahaha! You should've seen his face—kid was completely blindsided! He actually thought I'd just stand there and let him kill me. Charged right at me, the absolute idiot—one slap and he went flying! A Yin-Yang Realm brat trying to fight a Saint!"

In a hidden valley not far from the frontier, a crowd of Demon Hall cultivators had gathered. The one boasting was the very Saint who'd injured Long Yu.

The others laughed along. Then someone raised a question.

"This Ninth Prince—wasn't he supposed to be a priority recruit? Why are we messing with him now?"

"Right, he's technically our Holy Son."

"Who cares? Orders from above. We follow them."

"Honestly, I wouldn't mind just killing him."

The debate was still going when a breeze stirred the valley and the Demon Lord appeared. Everyone straightened and bowed—in the Demon Hall hierarchy, the Demon Lord held considerable status.

He waved them off and turned to the Saint with an approving nod. "Well done."

The Saint grinned. He'd been playing his role to perfection—just restraining himself enough to let Long Yu escape alive.

"What's our next move, Demon Lord?"

The Demon Lord surveyed the group. "Same plan. Do whatever you want—level up, grab some loot. In the end, it all gets pinned on Long Yu."

"Heh heh, finally. I was sick of sneaking around. Time to cut loose."

"About time we got to go wild."

"Who's up for some dual cultivation with unwilling participants?"

"I prefer blood."

"Ha—count me in. Let's go together."

The demonic cultivators laughed with sinister glee, their voices sending chills through the air. Soon they dispersed in groups, melting into the wilderness.

In the Imperial City, Qin Jiang was enjoying a scenic outing with his women when his expression suddenly shifted. Excitement replaced idle contentment.

He flipped his palm. The Seven Beauties Painting appeared, ringed by the Time-Space Disc, which still radiated its hazy temporal power.

"Is it time?" he murmured.

The painting trembled gently in his hand. Only Jian Yao remained inside—he'd already released Yan Shiya, not wanting to risk complications.

Beside him, Liu Shuwan leaned in to look, her eyes brightening. "Is Sister Yao about to break through?"

"Possibly." Qin Jiang nodded.

He slipped an arm around Liu Shuwan's waist, and in a flash they vanished from the room, reappearing in an open expanse within the Void Divine Temple.

An immortal-path breakthrough wasn't going to be quiet.
