Several days later.

In the ruined temple, Chen Wuming was cultivating the method Chen Qi'er had left behind. His talent was impressive—in just a few days, he'd managed to draw a wisp of spiritual energy into his body. It was faint, but it meant he'd officially set foot in the world of cultivation. He was confident he could reach the entry level within three months.

He finished a cultivation session and opened his eyes, only to sense a shadow looming over him. His heart seized. He snatched the dagger from inside his robe and thrust it forward with everything he had.

The blade struck something immovable—like stabbing a boulder. The impact numbed his entire hand. He looked up. Before him stood a hulking man whose bare palm had caught the dagger without so much as circulating spiritual energy. Physical toughness alone had rendered the attack meaningless.

"Impressive!" Chen Wuming's heart hammered. Chen Qi'er's aura had made him feel like an ant; now, facing this stranger, the same overwhelming helplessness returned.

"Not bad reflexes, kid." Black Dragon flashed a toothy grin.

He'd received Qin Jiang's orders a few days ago. With nothing better to do, he'd come immediately. He sized up Chen Wuming—nothing special that he could see—but the young lord's commands were the young lord's commands, and this assignment was actually rather entertaining.

"Who are you?" Chen Wuming gripped the dagger tightly, on guard.

Black Dragon didn't answer. He circled the boy, clicking his tongue and shaking his head. "Poor kid. You've been played, and you don't even know it."

"???"

Chen Wuming frowned. Black Dragon kept shaking his head as he walked away. "Shame. Good raw material, wasted. That guy's not someone you mess with. Forget it—not worth sticking my neck out for a kid."

Chen Wuming watched him leave in silence, exhaling only after the man vanished. But his brow stayed furrowed as he turned the stranger's words over in his mind.

"Played?" he murmured. He was a beggar—who would bother scheming against him? What was there to gain? And lately, with the resources Chen Qi'er had left, he hadn't even needed to go out begging...

"Brother Chen..."

The thought made his expression freeze. Could the stranger have been talking about Chen Qi'er?

"No... impossible!"

He shook his head. Brother Chen had been so kind to him—given him a cultivation method, supplies, everything. Why would he be plotting against him?

He stared in the direction Black Dragon had gone, unable to smooth the crease in his brow. He was a complete novice, too green to sort truth from deception. All he could do was follow his instincts.

And his instincts told him something felt wrong.

At the Human Dao Sect, Dao Zhen had returned from his latest swindling expedition in high spirits—until he saw the situation.

His expression was glacial as he rounded on Dao Kun. "What happened with Baizhe?"

His voice could have frozen steel. He'd poured his heart into keeping the Human Dao Sect running through years of cons and grifts, only to come home and find the house had been robbed. Baizhe wasn't his direct disciple, but her talent was the sect's finest. Breaking through to True Immortal was a genuine possibility, and he'd long considered her the heir apparent. Through his Fortune-Reading Art, he could see her fortune blazing bright—rivaling even Chen Changsheng's. In his eyes, she was more important than Dao Kun.

But now...

His face twitched. Before confronting Dao Kun, he'd bumped into Qin Jiang and Baizhe. Seeing them arm in arm, all lovey-dovey, he'd nearly choked on his own breath. The sect's most pristine cabbage, dug up by an outsider. And this outsider was precisely the man he'd warned Dao Kun—repeatedly—to stay away from.

When Qin Jiang had cheerfully called him "Brother Dao Zhen," he'd nearly slapped the kid into oblivion.

Sensing his ancestor's fury, Dao Kun hunched his shoulders, feeling rather aggrieved himself. Baizhe was his own disciple—he hadn't expected this either. One momentary lapse and Qin Jiang had poached her. It defied all reason. His disciple had always been cold to every man who approached her, so he'd never thought to guard against it. By the time he noticed, it was too late—she'd become utterly devoted to Qin Jiang. He was certain that if he tried to intervene now, she'd elope without a second thought. And even if she didn't, Qin Jiang's forces were no weaker than the Human Dao Sect's own.

"I'm asking you a question. Answer me!"

Dao Kun opened his mouth, managing a bitter smile. "Ancestor, I never expected... Qin Jiang captured Baizhe's heart in just a few days. She even fell out with her own brother over him."

"Her brother? I thought he died long ago."

"So did I. But he showed up a few days ago, and his cultivation... it's nearly as strong as mine."

Dao Zhen's brow creased. He knew of Chen Qi'er—but only through Dao Kun's assessments: talentless, destined for mediocrity. Clearly, Dao Kun had gotten it wrong.

For someone with no talent to reach Dao Kun's level...

"He must be a man of great fortune as well," Dao Zhen mused.

Chen Changsheng was one such person, and now Chen Qi'er was another—both of them antagonized by Qin Jiang. No wonder the man was shrouded in calamity. Opposing two people blessed by heaven's fortune would never end well. And now the Human Dao Sect was entangled in the mess. One misstep and the sect could be destroyed.

Dao Zhen's headache intensified. He looked at the oblivious Dao Kun and felt his blood pressure spike. This was all his fault! Misjudged talent, couldn't even keep watch over his own disciple, and let her get stolen right under his nose!

His expression turned frigid. He beckoned to Dao Kun, who hurried over. "What can I do for you, Ancestor?"

"Do for me?" Dao Zhen's palm cracked across the back of Dao Kun's skull, making his head ring like a bell.
