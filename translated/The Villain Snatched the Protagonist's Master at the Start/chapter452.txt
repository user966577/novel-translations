"Mm, don't—" Mu Yunxiao flinched and raised her hand between them like a shield. "You can't... I'm Weiwei's master..."

"Which makes it even better, doesn't it?" He leaned in with a wicked grin and whispered in her ear, "Master?"

"You..." Her face burned — half from shame, half from something she didn't want to examine too closely.

"Or how about... Mother-in-law?"

She shivered and turned her head away, unable to look at him. In the next instant, his arm flexed and she was on his lap.

"Ah!" She scrambled to stand, but the position gave her no leverage.

"Don't move." His voice dropped low.

Mu Yunxiao trembled and went still, sitting meekly in his arms. Her eyes glistened, a picture of wounded innocence. The sight only sharpened Qin Jiang's appetite. He wanted nothing more than to bully her thoroughly.

He tilted her chin up, making her look at him. "You know who I am."

"Mm~" She nodded timidly.

"Then you understand that Nangong Yun's Anti-Huaxia Alliance is nothing short of treason. And both you and Weiwei are implicated."

"But Weiwei is your woman!" she protested, eyes wide.

He scoffed. "So? One woman — you think I care?"

Her face drained of color. 'This is the lord of Huaxia — heartless and bloodthirsty.'

"However..." His expression softened into a smile. "If the two of you can make me happy, I might consider letting you off."

"What do you want?"

"What do you think?"

He grabbed the front of her dress and tore it away in one clean motion.

She cried out and clutched herself, trembling. She bit her lip, and the tears that had been threatening finally spilled down her cheeks — the very picture of a beauty wronged.

He lowered his head and kissed her tears away, smoothing her hair. "Don't cry. Crying ruins the pretty face, and if the face isn't pretty, I won't like it. And if I don't like it..."

She sniffled, hastily wiped her eyes, and stared up at him — terrified, red-eyed, but silent.

And the more pitiful she looked, the more he wanted to push. That expression — wanting to cry but not daring to, wounded and helpless — was irresistible.

"What... what do you want from me?" she managed in a small voice.

He sighed theatrically and released her. She didn't dare move, sitting obediently on his lap.

He leaned back and smiled. "I like women who take initiative."

Initiative? He wanted her to make the first move?

But... she didn't know how. And he was Weiwei's man. Though from the sound of it, he didn't much care about Weiwei. Probably wouldn't care about her either.

The thought brought a sting of melancholy — for both herself and her disciple.

But if she couldn't satisfy him, they'd both pay the price.

'For Weiwei's sake, I have to.'

Resolve hardened in her eyes. She looked at him, raised both hands to cup his face, and kissed him.

It was clumsy, artless — but undeniably willing.

She remembered: he liked proactive women.

After a long moment, they separated. She was breathing hard — she'd nearly forgotten to breathe. Her tongue darted across her lips. "Was that... acceptable?"

"That's it?"

Her brow creased. She'd given him her first kiss! She kissed him again.

"Now?"

"No."

Again.

"Now?"

"No."

Again!

She seemed to know only one move: when in doubt, kiss harder. Each time he shook his head, she pressed her lips to his once more.

Eventually, Qin Jiang decided he'd had enough kisses and said, with a hint of impatience, "Is kissing all you know?"

"Then... what else should I do?"

He considered, letting his gaze travel over her. Then his eyes landed on the bed, and his lips curled. "Before I came in — what were you doing?"

"N-Nothing."

"Really nothing?"

"Nothing."

"Really?"

His stare bored into her, and she couldn't hold his gaze.

"What I hate most," he said coolly, "is being lied to."

She flinched. Her head dipped, and she whispered, "I was just... doing that... by myself."

"Doing what exactly?"

"That thing..."

She could barely get the words out. She felt the dampness intensify.

He pulled her close. "Sounds like someone was lonely. But tell me — who were you thinking about?"

"Can I... not say?"

"No."

Her hands knotted together, her eyes on his. He drew her closer, so close that their bodies were flush, and kissed her softly. "Was it me?"

"Mm~"

She nodded.

Of every man she'd encountered, Qin Jiang was the most striking. And his brazen touches that afternoon had planted an image she couldn't shake. So when night fell and she was alone, her thoughts had drifted to him, and her body had followed.

She hadn't expected him to actually show up. The moment she'd heard his voice, all composure fled, and the evidence had been left behind — evidence he'd promptly discovered.
