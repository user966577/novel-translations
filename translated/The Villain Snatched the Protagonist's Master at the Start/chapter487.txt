Xue Yue bounded off, and only then did Murong Qing dare look out the window. What she saw made her jaw drop. This was absolutely scandalous.

Then she spotted Xue Yue diving in with obvious enthusiasm. Clearly not her first time.

'Yueyue, too?'

Murong Qing's heart hammered. She swallowed. With that many people, if she joined, nobody would even notice, right?

She slapped her own cheeks. No. She couldn't think like that.

But her gaze refused to leave the window, and before she knew it, her hand had drifted downward. Her mind replayed what had happened in the room at the Blood Tribe compound -- Qin Jiang's hands, his lips. If she hadn't resisted so hard, would he have gone all the way? If only Xue Yue hadn't been outside.

She'd promised him "later." She just didn't know when that would be. That was up to Qin Jiang. Whenever Xue Yue wasn't around, she'd keep her word.

Days passed. Murong Qing didn't leave her room. She watched from the window, growing more restless by the hour. Part of her wanted to charge out there and throw herself at Qin Jiang the way Xue Yue did. But her position wouldn't allow it.

And so she relied on herself. But self-reliance was like drinking seawater to quench a thirst -- each attempt left her more desperate than before. The fire Qin Jiang had kindled refused to die. It only grew.

She felt herself losing her mind. She'd managed alone for years. Why was this different?

Because he'd awakened something she'd kept buried, and now it wouldn't go back to sleep.

She stared at the window a while longer, frustration mounting, then huffed and yanked the curtains shut. She retreated to bed, closed her eyes, and let her hand drift back down.

She didn't know how much time passed before she felt a weight settle onto the bed.

Her eyes flew open. Qin Jiang was hovering over her, grinning. He reached out and tapped her lips. "Washing your hands, Auntie Qing'er?"

She went scarlet, jerking her hand away and hiding it under the covers. "What are you doing here?"

"I heard someone calling my name. Followed the sound, and here I am." He brushed his lips against her cheek. "Was there something Auntie Qing'er needed?"

"I wasn't -- I didn't--"

He silenced her with a kiss. She didn't resist. She kissed him back.

When he tried to go further, she snapped to attention. She checked the door -- closed. The curtains -- drawn. They were alone.

She relaxed. She didn't stop him. She only whispered, "Where's Yueyue?"

"Resting. She won't come looking. We won't be caught."

"Mm."

Her teeth sank into her lower lip, brow creasing, a flicker of pain crossing her face. It had been so long. And Qin Jiang was substantial. Overwhelming, almost.

He brushed the hair from her face, kissed her forehead, and gave her time to adjust. She pulled him down and pressed her lips to his -- the kiss seemed to ease the discomfort.

When they separated, he searched her face. "Still hurting?"

"It's alright." She shook her head.

Her arms wrapped around his back, eyes filled with unmistakable longing. She'd spent days thinking about nothing but him. Now he was finally here.

"Start," she urged. "Please."

"That eager?"

"Yes. I've been going crazy wanting you. Please, don't tease me..."

"How crazy?"

"So crazy I thought I'd lose my mind. Please--"

"Call me something nice."

"Anything you want. Just please--"

He lowered his lips to hers and obliged.

Two hours later, Murong Qing ran out of stamina and collapsed onto him. He held her, amused.

"More?"

"Mm." She nodded, cheek pressed to his chest. "You lead."

"Gladly."

He didn't start immediately. First, he wove a layer of space-time power around the room.

This was going to take a while.
