Qin Jiang blinked.

'This direct?'

He considered for a moment, studying Chen Ningbing's exquisite face, and chuckled.

"Is there a difference?"

A subtle shift passed through Chen Ningbing's gaze.

She fell silent, as though making a decision, then looked at him.

"In that case, follow me inside."

Qin Jiang: "???"

"Inside?"

"You want to bed me, don't you?"

'Good lord.'

Looking at Chen Ningbing, Qin Jiang was genuinely thrown off.

This wasn't how the script was supposed to go. He'd torn down her stage, ruined her act of defiance—shouldn't she resent him?

Despite his confusion, he followed Chen Ningbing into her bedchamber.

A girl's room, all pinks and pastels. Even someone as outwardly icy as Chen Ningbing was still a girl at heart, and her room was decorated with warm, delicate touches.

"Would you like to bathe first, or shall we just begin?"

Chen Ningbing asked.

Before Qin Jiang could answer, she continued:

"Let's bathe first. You smell like another woman."

Qin Jiang: "..."

And so, under Chen Ningbing's arrangements, the two of them found themselves sharing a wooden tub.

A couple's bath?

Qin Jiang stared at her. He truly couldn't figure it out. She was a female lead blessed by fate—why was she being so forward?

From the plotline he'd seen, she hadn't been this accommodating even with Xiao Fan. In the beginning, she'd treated Xiao Fan like a puppy trailing at her heels.

"Like what you see?"

Chen Ningbing noticed his gaze.

She deliberately let her skin show beneath the water's surface, and her toes traced teasing patterns against him.

Since she was being this direct, Qin Jiang wasn't about to hold back. His arm encircled her waist, pulling her close. He tilted her chin upward.

"Tell me. What's your real purpose?"

Qin Jiang wasn't in the mood for guessing games. Straight to the point.

Chen Ningbing shifted against him, finding a more comfortable position. She nestled into his arms of her own accord, looking up at him with an expression that was cool yet somehow coquettish.

"My purpose... is you."

Qin Jiang's brow furrowed. Chen Ningbing read his doubt and bit her lip before speaking.

"Ever since I was old enough to understand, my father taught me one thing: in this world, strength is everything. If you want something, you must have the power to take it.

"And power comes in many forms—personal strength, family strength, and the strength of one's connections. Any force you can leverage counts as your own.

"Among these, personal strength matters most. But it's also the hardest to build—at least in the short term.

"That's why the power you can borrow from others also matters a great deal.

"Today, I held this tournament to borrow power—to defy my father.

"As it turns out, the results were quite satisfactory."

Qin Jiang's brow creased.

"You want to use my power to defy your father?"

"No."

Chen Ningbing shook her head, her eyes bright.

"I simply want to obtain what I desire."

"And what do you desire?"

Chen Ningbing tilted her head, then shook it.

"I don't know."

Qin Jiang: "???"

Seeing his stupefied expression, Chen Ningbing laughed.

"Right now—you're what I want."

"You don't even know who I am."

"Oh right, who are you?"

Chen Ningbing asked.

Qin Jiang felt slightly exasperated. This woman was a bit unhinged.

"You don't know me, and you're sure you won't regret this?"

"Mm~

"As long as you're strong enough, I'll never regret it."

Chen Ningbing suddenly straightened, meeting his eyes.

"I'm a woman who's drawn to strength. I admire the strong—I desire them. Your background, your talent, your power... they're all overwhelming. So right now, I want you.

"I know you might think I'm too easy. But as long as you can dominate me, I will never betray you.

"I'd even give up everything for you.

"As long as you're strong enough."

Qin Jiang studied her. Beneath her beauty, there was something feverish, almost manic.

She leaned closer.

A long while later, Chen Ningbing exhaled softly and looked at Qin Jiang.

"Now, will you tell me who you are?"

"Qin Jiang. Ring any bells?"

Her pretty face froze.

"Qin Jiang. The Qin family's Young Patriarch?"

"You've heard of me?"

Qin Jiang was mildly surprised that someone in this backwater town knew his name.

That feverish look in Chen Ningbing's eyes intensified. She ran her tongue across her lower lip.

"Every man of consequence across the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent—I've looked into them all. Unfortunately, my reach is limited. For top-tier figures like you, all I had was a name.

"I never imagined I'd actually meet one in person."

Qin Jiang's expression turned odd.

This woman's ambitions ran deep.

As if reading his thoughts, Chen Ningbing giggled.

"Don't worry, I'm not ambitious. I just want to control my own life—and obtain everything I desire."

"Ambition grows with power."

Qin Jiang said meaningfully.

Chen Ningbing pondered this, then nodded seriously.

"Would you give me enough power?"

"That depends on your performance."

Chen Ningbing draped herself against him, her voice turning honeyed.

"Master~

"Hasn't my performance been satisfactory?"

Qin Jiang suppressed a shiver. Looking into Chen Ningbing's bright, alluring eyes, he was momentarily captivated.

"Femme fatale."

Qin Jiang sighed.

Chen Ningbing huffed, playfully swatting his chest.

"You should know by now—I won't betray you."

"Only because I'm stronger."

"Don't you have faith in yourself?"

"Heh. It's you I don't have faith in."

"You—!"

Chen Ningbing's lips pursed. Then she deflated somewhat.

"Should I not have been so forward?"

Seeing her genuine disappointment, Qin Jiang chuckled softly and gathered her into his arms.

"You could never betray me."

Qin Jiang had absolute confidence. Dual Divine Bodies plus a cheat system—in this lifetime, he was destined for the absolute pinnacle.

With Chen Ningbing's personality, as long as he remained the strongest, she would do anything for him. Just as now—having witnessed his power, his talent, his background...

She'd given herself to him willingly.

Drawn to strength. Reassuring in one sense, unsettling in another.

But for Qin Jiang, it meant nothing but security. That was his confidence.

Looking at his self-assured face, Chen Ningbing's eyes went soft and dreamy. This kind of confident dominance was intoxicating—addictive beyond measure.
