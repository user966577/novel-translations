"I..." Qin Jiang held her gaze. "I want you to be my woman!"

The curiosity on Liu Shuwan's face froze. She hadn't expected that answer. She straightened up, and all the warmth in her expression vanished—replaced by the icy demeanor Wang Chao had warned about.

Her voice turned cold. "I didn't hear that clearly. Would you mind repeating it?"

"I..." Qin Jiang opened his mouth, trying to put on a shy, innocent expression—but after cycling through several attempts, none of them looked right.

Liu Shuwan frowned. Was this kid having some kind of episode?

Suddenly, Qin Jiang slapped the stone table, making her jump. "Forget it—I'm done pretending." He took a deep breath and reverted to his natural self, rolling his shoulders with visible relief. Then he looked at Liu Shuwan again, his gaze turning playful.

Liu Shuwan blinked in momentary confusion. The shift in Qin Jiang's demeanor was like watching someone swap bodies.

"Ahem. Miss Liu, allow me to introduce myself properly. I am Qin Jiang, young patriarch of the Qin family. In the Qin family, everyone from our 10,000-year-old ancestor down to three-year-old children follows my commands. You could say I'm the true master of the Qin family. Some time ago, I happened upon a portrait so breathtaking it haunted me. Later, I learned the woman in the painting was none other than Miss Liu—the Saintess of the Holy Sword Sect, six thousand years ago. And so, I traveled day and night to the Holy Sword Sect for one purpose alone... to see you."

He started with an air of arrogance, but as he spoke about Liu Shuwan, his tone gradually shifted to one of deep sincerity. The transition was so smooth that Qin Jiang wanted to give himself an award.

Liu Shuwan, however, remained stone-faced despite her internal amusement. She hadn't expected that a portrait of her from thousands of years ago could still attract a young man's attention. The thought actually pleased her—no woman ever minded being told she was desirable, regardless of age.

Her expression softened slightly. She felt a flicker of delight at her enduring appeal, but she was thousands of years old. Dating a child? Ridiculous. She had to turn him down—gently, though. She didn't want to hurt him.

"You—"

"Just call me by my name." Qin Jiang grinned.

Liu Shuwan nodded. "Qin Jiang, I'm over six thousand years old, and you..."

"I'm eighteen!"

"Eighteen..." Liu Shuwan smiled ruefully. The gap was insurmountable, and besides, her world had only ever contained the sword. Love had never been part of it. What she'd forgotten, however, was that for Qin Jiang to reach this depth, his sword comprehension had to be extraordinary.

"Qin Jiang, the age gap between us is too large," she said softly.

Her usual coldness had thawed somewhat from the long isolation. After all, humans were social creatures—spend long enough alone, and the first person who shows up feels like a friend.

"Is age really a problem?" Qin Jiang blinked. "As cultivators, our lifespans are vast. Age is just a number. And in the future, we'll surely live as long as the heavens themselves—perhaps even beyond the reach of heaven and earth. At that level, age means even less. Six thousand years? A snap of the fingers."

Liu Shuwan stared. What audacity! Living as long as the heavens was already blasphemous. And beyond the reach of heaven and earth? That was outright defiance of the Heavenly Dao. Did this boy truly have such ambition? But even a Great Emperor couldn't match the heavens in longevity. She was merely a half-Emperor, and Qin Jiang was just a Divine Ability Realm cultivator.

She shook her head. "Qin Jiang, you're still young..."

"Young?" His eyebrow arched. "Young or not—you won't know until you try."

"What?"

His innuendo sailed right over her head. Qin Jiang blinked in surprise—at her age, she'd never heard that kind of joke? Never even seen it in passing? But her bewildered expression told him her confusion was genuine. Six thousand years of complete romantic ignorance.

'A blank canvas,' Qin Jiang mused. 'Once I get my hands on it, I can paint whatever I want.'

He shook his head. "I understand, Miss Liu. You don't want to be with me."

The bluntness made Liu Shuwan slightly uncomfortable, but she nodded.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Honestly, I didn't expect you to say yes."

"Hm?"

"Everyone who knows me knows I love forcefully picking melons—the harder they are to twist, the more I enjoy it."

Liu Shuwan: "..."

Watching Qin Jiang's excited expression, she got the distinct feeling this person had something seriously wrong with him. And he was a little... perverted.

Still, she wasn't worried. After all, Qin Jiang was just a mere Divine Ability cultivator—

Wait.

Liu Shuwan's gaze snapped to Qin Jiang. Divine Ability Realm? Sure, no issue there. But this was Sword Valley—the 27,000-foot depth! He'd walked here without any apparent effort.

"What's wrong?" Qin Jiang asked, noticing her alarm.

"You..." She paused, then couldn't help asking, "What level is your sword comprehension?"

"Oh right, you don't know yet." Qin Jiang smiled, straightened his back slightly, and kept his tone as casual as possible. "I, at eighteen years old, have achieved Sword Heart. I am a Sword Emperor! Every sword cultivator under heaven should obey my commands! And you—are no exception!"

'Wait—I'm a Sword Emperor! Almost forgot!'

His scheming eyes locked onto Liu Shuwan as he wondered: if he ordered her, as the Sword Emperor, to become his woman... would she agree?

"Sword Heart..." Liu Shuwan stared in shock. Sword Heart—her lifelong dream. She'd spent thousands of years in solitary cultivation at this depth, enduring loneliness only she understood, all for that goal. Yet the threshold remained invisible. In her desperation, she'd tried forcing her way to the valley's 30,000-foot bottom to claim whatever treasure lay there. Every attempt had ended in failure and injury. Even now, her body still bore wounds from those reckless attempts.

She looked at Qin Jiang, her expression complex. "You... really have Sword Heart?"
