By now, Chen Qi'er understood. He'd been played. Chen Changsheng wasn't Qin Jiang's best friend at all — he was Qin Jiang's enemy. Why else would Qin Jiang have subjected his own friend to something like this? Unless Chen Changsheng was a deviant. But watching the man dry-heave with revulsion, that clearly wasn't the case.

Regardless — this man had taken his purity.

Chen Qi'er drew a deep breath and limped toward Chen Changsheng, who immediately went on alert. He rose to his feet, eyes locked on Chen Qi'er — his first... man. His stomach lurched again, but he forced it down.

"What do you want?" he asked warily.

If Chen Qi'er wanted revenge, Chen Changsheng couldn't stop him. The power gap was too wide.

Chen Qi'er stopped about three feet away. A complicated emotion stirred inside him as he looked at the man who'd ruined his virtue. "You're not really Qin Jiang's friend, are you?"

Chen Changsheng's mouth twitched. 'You're only figuring that out now?' He looked at Chen Qi'er the way one looks at a fool. Every instinct screamed to curse the man out, but self-preservation won.

"I have a grudge against him," he said, swallowing his pride. "What happened between us — that was all Qin Jiang's doing. You and I have no quarrel. He's our common enemy."

He was keenly aware that they weren't safe yet. They were still in Qin Jiang's territory. Chen Qi'er's strength was considerable — an alliance improved their survival odds. So despite the nausea, he made his case.

Chen Qi'er nodded but said nothing. Chen Changsheng waited, then prodded: "We're not exactly out of danger here."

"You think he'll attack again?" Chen Qi'er frowned. In all their encounters, Qin Jiang had humiliated him but never killed him. He didn't believe he was in mortal danger — and besides, Chen Baizhe would intervene if it came to that. She was his sister. She wouldn't let him die.

Chen Changsheng tried not to roll his eyes. His own experience told a different story. "Qin Jiang and I have clashed many times. Before, he always let me escape — I don't know why. But this time, his tactics have escalated dramatically. I think he might be going for the kill."

Chen Qi'er paused. The pattern was familiar — beaten, humiliated, released. He'd always attributed his survival to Chen Baizhe interceding on his behalf. Learning that someone else had experienced the same cycle gave him pause.

But he still believed. "He won't kill me. My sister is at his side — if he tried, she'd never forgive him."

Chen Changsheng stared. The confidence was almost admirable. For a moment, he nearly believed it. But based on his own history with Qin Jiang, the man's sudden escalation pointed to something else entirely. Qin Jiang treated them like toys — and when you tired of a toy, you threw it away. But first, you broke it.

Just then, the formation around them trembled violently and vanished.

Both men tensed, turning toward the source. Qin Jiang was approaching with two women — Liu Shuwan and Chen Baizhe. Liu Shuwan, fresh from her time with Qin Jiang, hadn't felt like diving straight into cultivation and had tagged along. As for Chen Baizhe — Qin Jiang hadn't planned to bring her. But since he was about to kill her brother, he'd gone to tell her. She'd said she wanted to see Chen Qi'er off, one last time.

He hadn't refused. They'd once been siblings. A farewell was only right.

Seeing Qin Jiang, both men went rigid, hatred burning in their eyes. But neither dared speak. An Ancient Emperor and a Human Immortal — yet in this Nine Tribulations Supreme's presence, they felt crushing pressure.

Chen Qi'er, however, relaxed slightly at the sight of Chen Baizhe. If she was here, Qin Jiang wouldn't kill him. He started mentally drafting his plan: leave, go into seclusion, and not emerge until he'd reached True Immortal. Then he'd come back for revenge.

Qin Jiang stopped about forty feet away and studied the two of them. A broad smile spread across his face. "From the looks of it, you both really enjoyed my gift."
