In the Space-Time Temple, Qin Jiang had exerted every ounce of energy helping the women relax, and was now lying in Lian'er's lap, resting.

That was when the system's voice suddenly rang through his mind, and his expression brightened at once.

【Detected: A Child of Destiny has established a connection with the Host. One spoiler is now available. The Host may view the Child of Destiny's trajectory for the next hundred years. Altering the plotline may yield Villain Points or rewards.】

Another Child of Destiny?

It had to be one of the operatives Huaxia deployed — someone had made contact with a Child of Destiny out in the field. Finally. After all these years, he'd found a new Villain Point supplier.

He nuzzled deeper into Lian'er's lap, found a comfortable position, wrapped his arms around her waist, and buried his face against her. Eyes closed. Time to review the plotline.

A full century of narrative was a lot to take in, but he only needed to skim the first few years before opening his eyes again. Once he intervened, the original plot would be irrelevant anyway. The later sections might serve as light reading when he had time — and likely contained some resource caches worth noting.

He looked up from Lian'er's lap at her delicate face, sat up, pulled her into his arms, and kissed her.

"Heh, my Lian'er's so pretty."

He grinned. Finding a new Villain Point supplier had put him in an excellent mood — and a certain kind of mood at that.

Lian'er's cheeks flushed. She leaned into him, her voice a playful whine. "Hey — didn't you say you wanted to rest?"

"I'm rested."

He lowered his head, one hand cradling the back of her neck, their faces almost touching. Nose to nose, he pursed his lips and pressed a light peck to her mouth.

"Lian'er, let me give you some private tutoring."

"Mm..." She pouted, kissed him back, then whispered, "I'm a little tired..."

"That's fine. We'll take it slow — just think of it as unwinding. Sound good?"

"Mm... okay."

She nodded, and Qin Jiang smiled, pulling her a fraction closer. Face to face, nearly pressed together, Lian'er's lips parted slightly. One arm hooked around his neck while her other hand covered her mouth, her eyes growing hazy.

Before long, she exhaled a soft breath, let her hand fall from her lips to his shoulder, and her body relaxed. She bit her lower lip, gazing at him with eyes full of liquid warmth.

He leaned in, kissed her cheek, and glanced down. With the practiced ease of long-standing chemistry, they came together effortlessly.

He pinched her cheek and smiled. "Lian'er's getting more and more skilled."

"Hmph. After this many times, obviously." She gave a little huff, then nestled against his shoulder. "Just... do your thing."

A contented expression settled over her features.

He chuckled softly and patted her back — as if lulling her to sleep.

After several days in the Space-Time Temple, Qin Jiang decided it was time to personally visit the new Child of Destiny.

Mystic Cloud Heaven.

That was where Black Dragon and the Void Beast were stationed, and where they'd stumbled upon this Child of Destiny. A mere Great Emperor had clashed with the two of them — and escaped with his life. Classic Child of Destiny shenanigans. Even facing opponents an entire major realm above, the advantage was somehow still theirs. Pure nonsense.

"You're going to Mystic Cloud Heaven?" Liu Shuwan asked, surprised.

He nodded. "Black Dragon and Little Xu ran into some trouble there. They're my boys — when my boys have problems, their boss has to step up."

She gave him a flat look. "I heard from Black Dragon's end. He said he snatched a woman for you. It's been, what, a few days? You can't wait?"

"Ahem." He straightened up, all business. "Let me be clear — I'm going to Mystic Cloud Heaven purely to back up Black Dragon and Little Xu. As for this so-called woman... we'll see."

Black Dragon had indeed captured a woman — specifically, from the Child of Destiny's orbit. That was what sparked the conflict. The Child of Destiny had escaped, but the woman was secured. And Black Dragon had wasted no time claiming credit.

No need to ask — she was clearly stunning. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been so eager to report it. They knew the caliber of women at Qin Jiang's side. An ordinary beauty wouldn't have been worth mentioning.

Then again, the women around Children of Destiny were never ordinary. Qin Jiang had seen her in the plotline. A genuine knockout.

"'We'll see'?" Liu Shuwan looped her arm through his, a teasing smile on her lips. "Weren't you the one who always says 'never let a good girl slip away, never let a bad girl go free'?"

That was indeed Qin Jiang's motto — for beautiful women, at least.

Before he could respond, she continued. "We're all coming along."

"Of course." He smiled and nodded. Many of the women were in secluded cultivation, but he could simply bring the Space-Time Temple with him. Everyone would travel together to Mystic Cloud Heaven. Besides, he only felt at ease with his women nearby. As a kept man who lived off their support, he needed their protection to feel safe.

"When do we leave?"

"Right now."

Without delay, Qin Jiang piloted the immortal ship and departed with everyone aboard. At the ship's speed, they reached Mystic Cloud Heaven in just three days.

The massive vessel didn't enter Mystic Cloud Heaven directly, instead hovering in the Chaos. Qin Jiang disembarked with Liu Shuwan, Lian'er, Jian Yao, and Mo Mo at his side. The other women remained on the ship — some were still in seclusion and needed guarding. Plus, his Immortal King Killing Formation was deployed on the ship. At the first sign of danger, he could detect it instantly and activate the formation remotely.

The five of them slipped from the Chaos directly into Mystic Cloud Heaven.

The moment they crossed the boundary, Mo Mo's eyes lit up. "The killing aura here is incredibly dense. Mystic Cloud Heaven really is a mess."
