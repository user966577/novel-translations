Qin Jiang didn't take Yu Ru's jab to heart. His arms felt a bit empty, though, so he scooted over and pulled her back into his embrace.

Yu Ru squirmed but seemed resigned to it by now. She let him hold her without further protest.

After a stretch of silence, she spoke again. "You want to win my sister's heart?"

"Her heart?" Qin Jiang rubbed his chin. "That's secondary, I suppose. At the very least, though, I'd like her to not despise me too much—like you."

"Not despise you?" Yu Ru's small fists clenched. She glared at him through gritted teeth. "What makes you think I don't?"

He'd taken her innocence, and he had the gall to assume she didn't hate him?

"Do you?"

Qin Jiang tightened his arms around her, lowering his head to rest against her shoulder. He tilted his face and pressed gentle kisses along her cheek.

Yu Ru stiffened. In that moment, his tenderness made her feel as if they were actually in love. She bit her lip, silently cursing herself for being so weak. She truly didn't harbor much hatred toward him.

Toward Mo Mo, that wretched little loli—now that was a different story entirely.

Perhaps it was precisely because of Mo Mo that her resentment toward Qin Jiang had faded. His gentleness, by contrast, even stirred something in her chest.

She struggled with herself for a moment, then deflected. "My sister's personality is nothing like mine. I'm soft, but she's cold. I was sheltered by her all my life, while she's been fighting wolves and tigers at every turn. If you try the same approach on her, she absolutely will hate you."

"So you're admitting you don't hate me?"

Qin Jiang's lips curved.

Yu Ru's cheeks reddened. She shot him a glare. "We're talking about my sister."

Qin Jiang nodded with a laugh. "You know her best. How should I win her over?"

"Be good to her." Yu Ru's small face turned earnest. "My sister's never been intimate with a man. She's completely naive about romance. If you treat her well and I help you along, there's a very good chance you'll capture her heart."

"That would take too long."

"You're that impatient?"

Qin Jiang shook his head. "It's not that I'm impatient—it's that you're the ones running out of time. If I can't be certain your sister will be mine, I won't help you."

"So it's entirely about self-interest?"

Yu Ru pressed her lips together, a flicker of disappointment crossing her face.

Qin Jiang's mouth quirked upward. "No. It's entirely because I'm lustful. And right now happens to be the perfect opportunity to strike while the iron's hot and claim you both."

Yu Ru: "..."

She stared at him strangely. He didn't even have the decency to scheme behind their backs.

Yet somehow, her mood inexplicably improved. At least he wasn't acting out of cold calculation—he genuinely wanted her. For her beauty, sure, but it was still for her.

"Think of a faster method," Qin Jiang said.

Yu Ru pondered for a while before suggesting hesitantly, "What if we... deceived my sister a little?"

"How?"

Qin Jiang eyed her. This younger sister was something else—already plotting against her own sibling.

Yu Ru thought it over. "Right now, you and my sister are strangers. Not even acquaintances. To close that gap quickly, you'll need a little... creative storytelling. When she arrives, we spin a tale—say Snake Race fighters found us, and you saved everyone. She'll be grateful, and just like that, you've built rapport. Then, since she's injured, you offer to help treat her. Get a little... close during the process. You know what I mean, right? She's vulnerable right now—she's still a woman, after all—and your timing could let you slip past her defenses and into her heart. And if all else fails, we could always use... well, I've heard there are certain substances that make people..."

As Yu Ru laid out her suggestions, Qin Jiang's expression grew increasingly peculiar. She looked so soft and innocent, but when it came to selling out her sister, she held nothing back.

Noticing his odd look, she tilted her head. "What?"

"Nothing." He shook his head with a smile. "Your suggestions are excellent."

"Of course they are! Nobody knows my sister better than me."

Yu Ru puffed up with pride—then abruptly realized she'd been scheming against her own sister. The pride deflated. She looked at Qin Jiang earnestly.

"After you win her over, you have to treat her well."

If Qin Jiang mistreated Yu Lan after all this, she'd never forgive herself.

"Don't worry." Qin Jiang nodded. "I never mistreat beautiful women. Your suggestions were wonderful, so... here's a little reward."

"What reward?"

Yu Ru was curious, but the next moment...

---

The following day.

Outside the formation, a tall, slender figure emerged cautiously. She surveyed her surroundings with wary eyes, and only after confirming no one was nearby did she release a breath.

'I hope Ru'er and the others are all right.'

This was Yu Lan—the Snake Race Empress, Yu Ru's elder sister.

Her face was ghostly pale, her aura feeble. Her brows were drawn tight, and pain flickered through her beautiful eyes. She flipped her palm, producing a small token. A thread of light shot from it into the ground, and a portal materialized at her feet.

Without hesitation, Yu Lan stumbled through.

At the same moment, Mo Mo and Xue Mei opened their eyes. They looked toward Qin Jiang. "She's here."

Before the words fully landed, Qin Jiang shot upward. Moments later, he spotted a figure plummeting from the formation's inner boundary.

He flashed forward and caught her.

Once inside the formation, Yu Lan's mental guard had dropped. The injuries she'd been forcibly suppressing erupted all at once, robbing her of balance. She was falling—until a pair of arms caught her. She forced her eyes open.

A handsome but unfamiliar face.

Alarm surged through her. She shook her head, bit down hard on the tip of her tongue to force clarity, and wrenched herself free. Staggering several times before steadying herself midair, she fixed Qin Jiang with an icy stare.

"Who are you?"
