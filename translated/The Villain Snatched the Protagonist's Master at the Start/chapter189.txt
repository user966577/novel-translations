The formation was no trivial thing—Emperor-grade, designed primarily for concealment. Layer upon layer, each interlocking seamlessly with the next.

Qin Jiang led Mo Mo and Xue Mei through them one by one, dismantling each with startling speed. The two women watched in slack-jawed amazement. These arrays made their heads spin just looking at them—clearly high-level work—yet in Qin Jiang's hands, they unraveled like child's play.

"Qin Jiang, you..."

Mo Mo had been at his side for a long time now, yet this was the first time she'd seen him demonstrate formation mastery.

Qin Jiang flashed a modest smile. "Told you—I know just a teensy bit."

As he spoke, he flicked his wrist and a passage materialized before them.

"There we go. Let's see what's inside."

He took both women by the hand and stepped through. The moment they entered, the passage sealed behind them. They walked only a few paces before the space opened up dramatically.

Before they could react, a lithe figure came darting toward them, voice bright with excitement. "Sister, you're finally—"

The words died mid-sentence. The figure froze, staring at the three strangers, and her expression snapped to wariness in an instant.

"Who are you people?"

Yu Ru's face hardened, tension coiling beneath the surface. She was Yu Lan's younger sister—though her bloodline wasn't as potent. The moment Yu Lan had been attacked, Yu Ru's first instinct was to gather their faction's people and retreat into this formation, preventing the enemy from using them as hostages.

The formation was Yu Lan's secret project. Only the two sisters knew of its existence. For days, they'd been hiding here, waiting. They believed that as a royal bloodline holder, Yu Lan would escape—and once she'd recovered, she'd reclaim everything that had been taken from them.

Yu Ru had been waiting. When she sensed the formation ripple, she'd assumed it was her sister returning. She hadn't expected three strangers.

They'd detected the formation and gotten inside. Yu Ru's heart sank. These people were a liability—they must not be captured, or Yu Lan's position would become even more precarious.

And there was one possibility Yu Ru didn't dare contemplate: that Yu Lan was already gone, and these people had found the formation because of it...

If that were true, their entire faction was finished.

Before Qin Jiang could speak, more figures appeared around them, their expressions murderous. They glared at the three intruders with undisguised hostility.

Qin Jiang smiled placidly. "Mo Mo. Mei Mei."

A quiet call, and both women stepped forward. Immortal-path aura erupted simultaneously.

Yu Ru and her people went white.

"Immortals!"

Gasps of horror. Two Immortals. The strongest person on their side was Yu Ru—a single Great Emperor. They had absolutely no means of resistance.

Yu Ru's pretty face drained of color. She bit down hard on her lip and watched Qin Jiang approach step by step. When he stopped beside her, he smiled.

"You're Yu Lan's sister?"

"Hmph."

Yu Ru gave a cold snort. "I won't let you use me to threaten my sister!"

Her internal energy surged violently—her eyes burning with resolve. She was going to self-destruct.

But before an Immortal, a Great Emperor didn't even have the luxury of choosing death.

Mo Mo was at Qin Jiang's side in an instant. A single fingertip pressed against Yu Ru, and the raging energy was crushed into silence. Yu Ru's face twisted. Her power had been sealed completely. Against an Immortal, she couldn't even self-destruct.

Mo Mo grabbed Yu Ru by the scruff and tossed her into Qin Jiang's arms. "Sealed. She's all yours."

She shot Qin Jiang a meaningful wink. Back then, she'd been in the same position—sealed by that crazy woman Jian Yao, then "conquered" by this big bad wolf. Well, more like brute-forced into submission.

Held in a man's arms, Yu Ru's cheeks blazed crimson, but with her power sealed, she was no stronger than a slightly sturdier mortal. She couldn't break free of Qin Jiang's embrace no matter how she struggled.

"Let go of me! Even if you capture me, my sister will never bend to your threats!"

She still believed they'd been sent by the Snake Race.

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. "Who said anything about threatening your sister?"

"Huh?"

Yu Ru stopped struggling, confusion replacing fury.

"You don't seriously think we're from the Snake Race, do you?" Qin Jiang said, holding her steady.

"You're... not?"

"Sweetheart, use your brain. I've got two Immortals escorting me. The Snake Race doesn't have the clout to boss me around."

Yu Ru's face went blank. He had a point. With two Immortal-path powerhouses at his side, the forces behind him had to be extraordinary. The Snake Race probably didn't rank high enough.

"Then who are you...?"

She looked up at him—and realized that to keep her balance, she'd unconsciously wrapped her arms around his neck.

"Heard the Snake Race had some excitement going on. Thought we'd come have a look. And while we were at it..." A sly grin tugged at Qin Jiang's lips. "...see if you sisters are really as beautiful as the rumors say. Now that I've met the younger one, the rumors don't do you justice."

"Ah!"

Yu Ru yelped, suddenly aware of their position, and released his neck. She lost her balance and tipped sideways. Qin Jiang's hand shot out and caught her—but his grip landed somewhere decidedly inappropriate.

"Ahh!!!"

Yu Ru shrieked. "Let go, you pervert!"

Qin Jiang wasn't about to listen. He gave an appraising squeeze—gently, of course; wouldn't want to cause any damage. Then he hoisted her back up by her collar and deposited her in his arms again. She instinctively grabbed his neck once more, face burning, and hissed through clenched teeth, "Can you let go now?"

"Not bad. Gotta be at least a C."

Qin Jiang released his hand with a grin.

Yu Ru's expression was stormy, but the flush spreading across her cheeks betrayed her. The clan members watching their princess get openly teased didn't dare utter a word. Two Immortals were watching. Besides, the situation might actually... work in their favor. If this man was willing to help, they had a real chance of turning things around. Yu Ru would just have to make a small sacrifice.

The clan members exchanged wide-eyed glances, a spark of hope kindling in each of them.

Mo Mo watched the flirtation from the sidelines, frowning with displeasure. "Hey, Qin Jiang! That's not how you treated me! I got sealed for you too—at least do it properly, the way you did with me!"

Qin Jiang: "???"

He turned to her. "That was a completely different situation! You were all 'I'll kill you, I'll kill you'—what else was I supposed to do? Look at her—she's gentle..."

"I don't care! I sealed her for you, so you have to treat her the same way you treated me!"

"That's a bit..."

"Hurry up! I'm supervising!"

"I..."

Qin Jiang glanced at Yu Ru with a look of helpless apology. Yu Ru's sense of unease intensified.

"What are you... what are you going to do?"

"Sorry about this. Mo Mo's spoken. You'll have to bear with me."
