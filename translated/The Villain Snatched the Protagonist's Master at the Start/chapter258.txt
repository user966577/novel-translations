"You?"

Chen Baizhe shook her head. Qin Jiang glanced at her hand resting on the guqin. His own hand drifted toward it—but before he made contact, she pulled hers away.

He blinked, withdrawing with a hint of regret, and met her eyes. "I've done my research on you. For years, people have courted you, and you've turned them all down. Because there's already someone in your heart. A little beggar—or I should say, an old beggar by now. Actually, with this many years gone by, the odds of him still being alive are... slim."

Chen Baizhe's aura rippled. The look she gave him turned several degrees colder.

"Perhaps you don't want to admit it, but deep down, you know—"

"Silence!" She glared at him, each word measured. "He is alive."

"Don't lie to yourself."

Without flinching, Qin Jiang rose, circled around the guqin, and stood behind her. He placed his hands on her shoulders. She bristled, ready to strike, but he spoke calmly. "Unless you want the Human Dao Sect to suffer, I'd suggest you control your temper."

"You think you can threaten me?"

Her energy pulsed, but only enough to shake his hands off—barely. Qin Jiang smiled. So she was wary. Otherwise, that pushback would have been far stronger.

"You know who I am. Maybe the Azure Lotus Divine Palace and the Human Dao Sect are roughly equal in power, but do you know why Qing Chan willingly became my woman?"

He placed his hands on her shoulders again. Chen Baizhe frowned. A True Immortal submitting to a Supreme—it defied comprehension.

She took a steadying breath. "I don't care who you are. Qing Chan may submit to you, but I never will. Never."

"I told you—I understand you," Qin Jiang said with a chuckle. "Better than that little beggar ever could."

He leaned in, his chin nearly resting on her shoulder. His breath stirred the hair at her neck, making her skin tingle. His threat was effective—though she resisted inwardly, she held herself in check, tilting her head slightly to the side without a word.

His hand began to slide from her neck downward.

"Don't push your luck!"

Qin Jiang stopped. "Tell me—if your brother saw me treating you like this, would he still protect you?"

"Yes!" Not a moment's hesitation.

"And given his talent back then, even if he'd survived to this day, what's the highest realm he could have reached? Could he actually protect you?"

After tens of thousands of years, he'd be at least a Great Emperor—if he were still alive. But Chen Baizhe's eyes wavered. Given her brother's talent... could he really have reached Great Emperor? She'd never wanted to dwell on that question. She knew his talent. The probability was vanishingly small. And even at Great Emperor, he'd be powerless against Qin Jiang.

"One more question. If he is alive, and in all these years he's never once come back to see you—how important do you think you really are to him?"

His words slithered like a demon's whisper. Chen Baizhe went rigid. It was true. If he'd survived, he'd be at least a Great Emperor by now. Returning would be trivial. But he hadn't come back. Was he dead? That was the most likely explanation—one she'd privately accepted long ago but never dared acknowledge.

Today, Qin Jiang had ripped the wound open.

Her expression twisted with conflict. She wanted desperately for her brother to be alive, yet if he was, his decades of absence meant... what? That she didn't matter?

She shook her head. He wasn't dead. He couldn't be.

But if he wasn't dead, why hadn't he come back?

Her gaze grew distant, unfocused. One question from Qin Jiang, and she couldn't tell whether she wanted her brother dead or alive.

"Honestly, dead or alive, the two of you were never going to happen," Qin Jiang continued.

Chen Baizhe snapped back to herself. "If he's alive, I'll be with him."

"He doesn't even care about you, and you still want to be with him?"

Silence.

Her fists tightened. She glared at Qin Jiang, furious. Everything he said was infuriating—and irrefutable.

He leaned close to her ear and whispered, "If he's alive, do you think I have the power to kill him?"

Her face drained of color.

Qin Jiang straightened, patted her shoulder, and spoke flatly. "I'm an extreme person. What I can't have, no one else gets. If you're smart, you'll forget about him entirely—even if he is alive. You can't protect him, and he certainly can't protect you."

He paused. "You'd better hope he's already dead. Because if he is, then maybe he really did care about you. But if he's alive... odds are, you don't mean much to him at all. And I'll kill him."

With that, he turned and walked away.

Chen Baizhe watched his retreating figure in a daze. She'd had countless suitors, but never one like this. Was this even courtship? This was naked intimidation.

And worse—his words had fractured everything she'd believed. She wanted her brother alive and she wanted him to care. But those two desires seemed mutually exclusive. Alive yet absent for tens of thousands of years—what kind of business kept a Great Emperor away that long?

Her eyes grew hollow with confusion.

Outside the courtyard, Qing Chan fell into step beside him. He wasn't foolish enough to provoke a Human Immortal without backup. Qing Chan was his trump card—always close at hand.

She glanced back at the courtyard, amused. "A few sentences, and you shattered her entire belief system."

"Just helping her see clearly."

"Oh? So her brother really is alive?"

Qin Jiang nodded. "Alive and well. A Human Immortal, actually."

Qing Chan blinked. "How do you know?"

"Heh—I've met him. Even gave him a beating." He looked back toward the courtyard. "And if I'm not mistaken, he'll be showing up soon."
