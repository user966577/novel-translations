Back in Bai Susu's courtyard, Qin Jiang could feel the change in the way she looked at him. The entire walk back, she'd spent most of the time staring at his face.

Qin Jiang smiled. "What, already conquered?"

Bai Susu's cheeks flushed and she averted her gaze, murmuring, "You really were impressive today."

Before, at the Holy Sword Sect, every fight she'd watched had been Lin Chen crushing his opponents—thrilling, dominant, unmatched. Today, Lin Chen had been on the other end. She had to admit her world had been too small. She'd mistaken Lin Chen for the brightest star in the sky, but as it turned out, the night sky held many stars. The brightest light had always been the moon. Qin Jiang was that moon—and everything else was merely decoration around him.

"When am I not impressive?" Qin Jiang arched an eyebrow. This was the first time Bai Susu had softened toward him. Such progress deserved a reward.

Only, before the reward could commence, a knock came at the courtyard gate. Qin Jiang frowned. Bai Susu's eyes flashed with irritation too.

They opened the gate to find Bai Jingyun barging in. "Heh heh, I knew you'd be here, my boy."

His voice was dripping with warmth—but he failed to notice the displeasure on both Qin Jiang's and Bai Susu's faces.

"Uncle Bai, is something the matter?" Qin Jiang asked with a furrowed brow.

"I've already stripped Lin Chen of his Holy Son title. So, about you taking the position...?"

Qin Jiang blinked. That was fast. Bai Jingyun was clearly desperate to have him as Holy Son. "Fine," he said with a nod. It was just an honorary title—basically funneling sword cultivators to the Holy Sword Sect. The Qin family didn't need that many swordsmen anyway.

Bai Jingyun beamed. "Haha! Rest assured, our sect won't let you down."

Qin Jiang waved it off. "Uncle Bai, is there anything else?"

Bai Jingyun had been about to heap on more flattery, but Qin Jiang's tone carried a distinct "please leave" undercurrent. He paused. "Uh... no, nothing else."

"Susu and I have some things to attend to, so if you don't mind..."

The hint landed. Bai Jingyun glanced at his daughter—who appeared to be silently urging him toward the exit—and understood immediately. His timing was terrible.

Even his own daughter was signaling him to scram.

A mix of dejection and worry crossed his face. 'Does that animal never give Susu a single day off?'

"Ah, young people... you really should practice some moderation," he sighed, then finally departed.

With the interruption gone, Qin Jiang and Bai Susu locked eyes. Sparks practically arced between them.

"Let's go... to my room," Bai Susu whispered.

Qin Jiang shook his head. "No. Right here."

The next day, Qin Jiang brought Bai Susu to his main residence. "You'll live here from now on," he said with a grin.

Ye Ling'er and the others came out to greet them. They'd heard about Bai Susu but were meeting her for the first time. And thanks to Qin Jiang being—well, himself—his stamina was borderline inhuman, and he was constantly taking enhancement pills besides. The other women didn't feel threatened by Bai Susu's arrival. Quite the opposite—they found her presence comforting. She was a sister who could share the burden.

After brief introductions, the women quickly warmed to each other. Qin Jiang nodded in satisfaction. This harmonious arrangement was entirely his doing.

After some chatting and laughter, he led everyone into the Void Divine Temple, where they normally resided. The spiritual energy concentration inside was far beyond the outside world, making it an ideal cultivation environment. Bai Susu entered for the first time and gaped at the seemingly endless rows of houses, plus the enormous structure at the center.

"Pick any room you like, Susu." Qin Jiang waved his arm—inside the temple, he was the absolute master. Rooms of every style flickered into view. "If nothing catches your eye, just tell me and I'll build you a custom one."

Bai Susu's head spun at the choices. Eventually, with input from Ye Ling'er and the others, she chose a room adjacent to theirs for easy visiting.

But then she eyed Qin Jiang strangely. Were all these rooms prepared for his women? Could any man actually handle that many? Granted, Qin Jiang had the constitution of a beast, but the sheer number of rooms was absurd. And judging by the caliber of the other women here, he'd need to recruit every exceptional beauty on the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent to fill them all.

That suspicion was put to rest the very next morning. She stepped out of her room to a chorus of melodious laughter. Following the sound, she found hundreds of gorgeous women—slim and curvy, elegant and voluptuous—following Qin Jiang around as they chose their rooms.

The sight nearly broke her.

Ye Ling'er and the others joined Bai Susu, surveying the flock of beauties with pursed lips. "This is a special unit under Qin Jiang's command," Ye Ling'er explained. "But knowing him, bringing them here means he's not planning to keep things professional."

"With his personality, having this many beauties around and not touching them? That would be the strange part," Yan Yun added with a pout.

Huo Qing'er and Chen Ningbing nodded in agreement. They all had a thoroughly developed understanding of Qin Jiang's character.

"But... this is so many," Bai Susu said, mouth agape.

"You'll get used to it," Huo Qing'er said with a resigned sigh. "In the future, there'll probably be even more." She looked at the endless rooms in the Void Divine Temple. Qin Jiang's ambition was to fill every last one.

She'd come to terms with it. Looking back, she and Ye Ling'er had appeared in Qin Jiang's life at the same time. But she'd hesitated too long, letting Chen Ningbing, Yan Yun, and even Yan Shiya get ahead of her. Now she felt a twinge of regret. What had she been holding out for? The outcome had been set in stone from the start. All that needless resistance had only wasted time.

After a busy stretch, the 360 Songstresses were settled. Qin Jiang surveyed the three hundred occupied rooms with a satisfied nod—though they represented only a small fraction of the Void Divine Temple's capacity. He still had a long way to go.

Over the following days, Qin Jiang indulged himself freely within the temple. Until Qin Lian'er sent him a message:

"Brother! The Phoenix Egg is hatching!"
