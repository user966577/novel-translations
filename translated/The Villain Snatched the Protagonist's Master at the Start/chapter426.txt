While Yue Weiwei was busy saving people, Nangong Yun was busy planning to save her.

The anti-Huaxia alliance had only two Great Emperors left besides Yue Weiwei, and her captors included an Ancient Emperor. His master was a Human Immortal, but she was in seclusion — by the time she emerged, his senior sister would have long since been claimed. He had to do this himself.

After days of scouting, he'd located where Yue Weiwei was being held. He and the alliance's two remaining Great Emperors staked out the area for several more days, observing carefully, before reconvening.

"These past few days, only one Great Emperor has been going in and out of the courtyard," Nangong Yun said. "If I'm not mistaken, the Ancient Emperor must have business elsewhere. This is our window. One Great Emperor can't stop us."

"Agreed. I probed the courtyard," one of the Great Emperors added. "Most of the time, the only presence I can detect is Miss Yue's. Her aura seems... weakened. She's likely being suppressed."

The other Great Emperor nodded. "Then we move tonight?"

"Tonight." Nangong Yun's expression was grave. "I'll infiltrate first. Once I've located Senior Sister, I'll bring her out immediately. You two handle the extraction."

"Understood."

They couldn't detect Qin Jiang's group, of course — everyone there was at least Human Immortal. A pair of Great Emperors had no chance of sensing them.

Inside the courtyard, Yue Weiwei was chatting with Liu Shuwan and the others. Over the past few days, she'd gradually integrated into their circle and learned far more about Qin Jiang through their stories. She'd also realized that even without the "saving people" pretense, he would never have let her leave. The man was possessive to the bone — once he'd tasted something, he didn't give it back.

That knowledge actually relieved her. She'd been worried he might discard her once the saving was done. As it turned out, he'd never intended to let her go. The whole rescue game had been nothing more than a bit of bedroom roleplay. He even knew her list was fabricated — he'd investigated every member of the anti-Huaxia alliance down to their ninth-generation relatives. No wonder he'd looked at her strangely when she presented it. He was probably laughing at her behind that smile.

The thought made her flush. Her little schemes had been transparent to him the entire time, and he'd played along with exaggerated cooperation. How mortifying.

Just then, Qin Jiang strolled over, swept her into his arms, and asked with a grin: "Weiwei, shall we save some more people today?"

She gave him a flat look, cheeks pink. Still keeping up the act, this one.

Liu Shuwan rolled her eyes too. Before they'd come to Mystic Cloud Heaven, he'd insisted he was here to back up Black Dragon. Now he'd forgotten Black Dragon entirely, lost in the pleasures of a new companion.

Yue Weiwei glanced at the others, then nodded. "Mm."

Qin Jiang looked at Liu Shuwan, Lian'er, Jian Yao, and Mo Mo with hopeful eyes. "Together?"

"You and Weiwei go play. We're resting." They all shook their heads. With only this small group present, even a few days had left them feeling drained. Weiwei still had the novelty factor on her side, and her "saving" sessions were limited — she got off far easier than they did.

That would change soon enough, now that Weiwei knew the rescue game was meaningless. Less roleplay, fewer excuses for moderation.

Qin Jiang and Yue Weiwei retreated to their room. The others returned to theirs, each throwing herself into cultivation. They all felt the urgency — the Heavenly Domain awaited, and no one knew what dangers lurked there. They needed to be as strong as possible to protect Qin Jiang. With his reckless personality, he'd be killed in the Heavenly Domain within a week without them.

Night fell.

A shadow slipped over the courtyard wall. Liu Shuwan and the others detected the intrusion instantly, their eyes snapping open, cold light flickering across their features. But they held back — Qin Jiang had warned them that someone might try to sneak in. Over the past few days, they'd even sensed probing attempts. The intruders had failed to detect any of them, but the women had pinpointed the scouts' locations immediately.

The anti-Huaxia alliance, no doubt, coming for Yue Weiwei. But the Weiwei of today had already been shaped into Qin Jiang's mold. She'd long since left the alliance behind.

And with Qin Jiang right beside her, whoever had snuck in was walking straight into the lion's jaws.

Nangong Yun, clad in dark clothing and suppressing his aura, crouched in the shadows of the courtyard. After a tense pause without being discovered, he exhaled slowly and crept out of his hiding spot, preparing to search for Yue Weiwei.

Then a shriek pierced the quiet night.

He froze. His head swiveled toward one of the rooms. That voice — it sounded like Senior Sister.

Only...

A terrible suspicion bloomed in his mind. He crept to the door and pressed his ear against it.

"Husband, I want more..."

Yue Weiwei's voice. Soft and cloying and devastatingly seductive. Her voice already had an innately sensual quality, and now, drenched in longing, it was almost unbearably alluring.

Then Qin Jiang's voice followed: "Little glutton. Still not full?"

"Mm... Husband, give it to me..."

Qin Jiang chuckled, leaned down to kiss her, then glanced toward the door.

"Of course I'll make sure my Weiwei is satisfied. But first... there's a rat to deal with."

"Huh? What rat?"

He dressed her quickly, pulled her into his arms, and struck the door with his palm.

The door exploded outward. A figure was hurled into the courtyard, slamming into the ground hard enough to spit blood.
