To properly express his gratitude, Qin Jiang pulled out all the stops. It took several days before An Xihe was finally satisfied.

An Immortal King's constitution was no joke. Anyone else would have given out long ago.

He held her, still raring to go.

"Enough. I'm done," she murmured weakly.

"Done?"

"Mm."

But he only licked his lips and pulled her closer. "Now it's your turn to call me 'big brother.'"

"You--" She puffed her cheeks. "No!"

"You sure?"

"Hmph. Absolutely not!"

"Well then, don't blame me."

In an instant, he flipped her over, pinning her beneath him. "Say it."

"No!" Defiance blazed in her eyes.

He escalated. Within half an hour, she broke.

"Big brother..." she breathed.

"Say it again."

"Big brother..."

He grinned triumphantly and kissed her. "Good girl."

"Hmph." She turned her face away, refusing the kiss. Still defiant.

But Qin Jiang still had fuel in the tank.

She froze, realizing her mistake. She'd turned too quickly -- and he wasn't finished yet.

She looped her arms around his neck, bit her lip, and put on her most pitiable expression. "Big brother... I was wrong, okay? Forgive me this once?"

"No!"

"Big brother..." She pouted, shaking his arm. She leaned in and kissed him. "Please? Just this once?"

"One more kiss."

"Mwah." She peppered his lips with quick pecks until he was satisfied.

He pinched her cheek. "Fine. You're forgiven."

"Big brother is the best." Another kiss.

Predictably, that led to another round. When it was over, they lay together in silence.

An Xihe recovered enough to realize she probably had the strength to throw him across the room. She smiled sweetly. "Big brother?"

"Ahem. You can stop now."

But she stroked his face, her smile deepening. "Doesn't big brother like it?"

"I do, actually."

She kissed his cheek. "Then I'll keep calling you that from now on. Deal?"

"Really?"

"Big brother..."

"Heh. Deal--"

A tremendous force launched him out of the room.

Fortunately, An Xihe had enough control to cushion his landing. He ended up sitting on the floor, dazed.

He looked at the door. She'd seen through him? That was fast.

He dusted himself off and walked back in. She was already dressed, sitting primly on the edge of the bed.

He sidled up to her. "Xihe..."

"Hmph." She swatted his wandering hand. This scoundrel was supposed to be thanking her, and somehow she'd ended up as the reward. She refused to acknowledge him.

But Qin Jiang was nothing if not persistent, reaching for her again and again. Eventually, she relented -- letting his arm settle around her waist, though she sat ramrod-straight, not leaning into him.

He pressed his face against her ear and whispered, "Big sister..."

"Mm..." A blush crept across her face, and she softened slightly toward him.

He grinned. "Big sister, don't be mad anymore. Come give me a kiss."

Men liked when women acted cute. Women liked it right back -- provided they were actually fond of you. Otherwise, male cuteness was just cringe.

He kissed her cheek, then buried his face in her chest. She sighed, unable to maintain her irritation, and held him. Qin Jiang acting adorable was rare, and combined with that handsome face, the puppy-dog look was irresistible.

She kissed the top of his head. "You like when I call you 'big brother'?"

"Mm-hmm."

She leaned close to his ear. "Big brother..."

He swallowed. "I like the other names too."

"Other names?" She blinked. "Hubby?"

"Mm-hmm."

"Darling..."

"Heh."

"My lord..."

She cycled through every pet name imaginable, each one breathier than the last, until his blood was practically boiling. Finally, she flicked his forehead. "Happy now?"

"Very." He snuggled back into her arms. "Xihe, call me those things more often?"

"Hmph. Depends on my mood."

He looked up and kissed her. "With me around, your mood should always be good."

"It's not! You're always bullying me."

"Don't you like being bullied?"

She blushed. "When you go easy on me, I like it. When you go too hard, I don't."

"You don't like it hard?"

"Mm... once in a while is okay."
