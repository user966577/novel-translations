While Wu Tian was still unconscious, Qin Jiang departed with Yun Bao. Before long, they were back aboard the airship.

The group training session had taken its toll—the ship lacked its usual bustle. Most of the women were still resting. A few with stronger constitutions had already recovered and were leisurely sipping tea and discussing cultivation. Meanwhile, the little foxes who hadn't participated in the training session were romping about.

When Qin Jiang returned, all eyes turned his way. Spotting Yun Bao beside him, eyebrows rose around the room. Another new sister. They wondered about her strength—the last addition, Wu Yingtao, had stunned everyone by becoming one of the primary attackers.

A narrow loss to Qin Jiang, but a loss that had given them a glimpse of victory.

So when they saw Yun Bao, the women swarmed her with enthusiasm.

Qin Jiang smiled and made the introduction. "This is Yun Bao. She's a Pixiu and absolutely loves treasures. Feel free to give her some welcome gifts."

"A Pixiu?"

The women were pleasantly surprised. One by one, they produced treasures and piled them around Yun Bao. Following Qin Jiang, none of them wanted for anything—and most of them were independently wealthy to begin with. Within moments, Yun Bao was practically buried under a mountain of gleaming artifacts.

The warmth was almost overwhelming. Beyond that, being surrounded by treasures on all sides made Yun Bao's mouth water. She wanted to eat so badly. But this was their first meeting—she needed to show some restraint, not make a bad impression.

"What's wrong? Don't you like them?" the women asked, noticing her odd expression.

"No! I love them."

Yun Bao waved her hands emphatically.

Qin Jiang, of course, knew exactly what was going on. He scooped up a treasure and popped it straight into Yun Bao's mouth. She'd been mid-sentence, and the words got stuffed right back in.

"Mmph~ Munch munch~"

Two bites and the treasure vanished down her throat.

The women watched in fascination. Under their collective gaze, Yun Bao's cheeks flushed.

"Tasty?"

"She just ate a treasure. Does that actually taste good?"

Yun Bao nodded shyly. "Yummy~"

"Here, have another." Qin Jiang produced a second treasure and fed it to her directly. Munch munch—down it went.

Seeing this, the women's competitive spirits flared. They grabbed treasures of their own and crowded around.

"Here, Yun Bao, have one more."

"Try mine."

"Can you eat demonic artifacts?"

"How about this spirit sword? It's definitely delicious."

"I have Immortal Marrow—that's the good stuff. Want some?"

They swarmed Yun Bao like a crowd feeding a small animal, shoving one treasure after another into her mouth without giving her a chance to speak. Before long, Yun Bao was frantically waving them off.

"Hic~"

She let out a little hiccup, cheeks pink, and held up her small hands. "I can't eat any more."

She'd consumed far too much, and many of these treasures were top-tier—things she'd never tasted before. Having so many all at once was genuinely too much for her system. She rubbed her tummy, feeling uncomfortably full. It would take a long time to digest everything.

"That's all you can eat?"

The women looked disappointed. They shook their heads and pushed the remaining treasures toward her. "Take the rest, then. Save them for a midnight snack."

"..."

Looking at the enormous pile, Yun Bao—for the first time in her life—wasn't feeling greedy. She thought back to her former existence: those lean, hungry days.

"Not enough? There's more where that came from!"

Mistaking her silence for desire, the women swept their hands grandly, producing yet another avalanche of treasures. "Most of the sisters are still resting. Once they're up, they'll have welcome gifts for you too."

"Oh, no, this is more than enough."

Yun Bao shook her head quickly, gesturing at the mountain around her. "This will last me ages."

"It can't last that long. This isn't even that much. Ten in the morning, fifteen at lunch, ten more for dinner, five for a late-night snack, plus ten throughout the day for nibbling—that's only enough for about ten days."

"???"

Yun Bao stared, then shook her head vigorously. "I can't eat that much! And Pixiu don't eat three meals a day."

"Oh? How often do you eat, then?"

"It's not about how often—it's that we only eat more once we've fully digested the previous batch."

She explained, "What I just ate will take me about six months to digest."

Even that estimate assumed maximum digestion speed. In the past, she'd always eaten slowly and sparingly, stretching things out to avoid running out.

But now... she surveyed the treasure hoard, enough to literally bury her. She'd never go hungry again.

"Six months? That long?"

"Mm. My cultivation is still low, so I don't need much. Once I'm stronger, I'll need a lot more."

Her voice dropped. If her cultivation rose, would he think she ate too much?

The thought made her glance at Qin Jiang.

Catching her look, Qin Jiang grinned. "Don't worry. No matter how much you eat, I can afford it."

"I don't only eat treasures. And past a certain cultivation level, I don't even need to eat at all."

Yun Bao added. Treasures were like staple food for Pixiu—they could eat regular things too. And once a Pixiu reached the immortal path, not eating wouldn't kill them. They'd simply stop advancing.

"Relax. You're with me now. I'll never let you go hungry."

Qin Jiang reached out and ruffled her hair. Then he gathered the entire treasure pile into a storage ring and slipped it onto Yun Bao's finger. "Start with these. When you run out, come find me."

"Oh~"

Yun Bao's cheeks pinked as she nodded.

Qin Jiang glanced down at her belly. Despite everything she'd consumed, it looked exactly the same. Pixiu must have some kind of internal storage space.

Curiosity got the better of him. "Yun Bao, would more exercise help you digest faster?"

"Exercise?"

"Right."

Qin Jiang's eyes danced with mischief. "Theoretically, it should work. Want to try?"
