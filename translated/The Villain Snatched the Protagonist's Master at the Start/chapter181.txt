Xue Mei's heart skipped a beat. Qin Jiang's scorching breath, his shameless gaze, his utterly undisguised desire—it all set her nerves alight.

She still resisted him, instinctively. But his domineering tone had slipped past her defenses and lodged itself somewhere deep.

This was the first time anyone had claimed her with such raw possessiveness. And despite herself... it cracked something open in her heart.

On the surface, she glared at him. Inside, the anger had already faded. He was rough with her, yes—but in a strange way, it felt like recognition. He wouldn't force other women, yet he was determined to have her? Didn't that mean she was better than all the rest?

For a fleeting moment, she felt a secret spark of pride.

Meanwhile, Mo Mo couldn't help but scoff. 'Doesn't force women? Please.'

She remembered perfectly well how Qin Jiang had treated her. And she knew for a fact that several of his other women had been... well, "persuaded" in much the same fashion.

Not that any of them were complaining now.

"Let go of me," Xue Mei murmured, her head lowered.

Qin Jiang chuckled and released his embrace but kept hold of her hand. "You have a little rabbit with a bloodline reversion in your tribe, don't you?"

His real objective had always been the bloodline-reverted rabbit. Finding Xue Mei was an unexpected bonus. The system's plot data had mentioned the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's Immortal ancestor, but she'd never appeared—he hadn't expected her to be such a stunning beauty.

Absolutely worth the trip.

Xue Mei's brow creased. She pushed down the strange flutter in her chest and replied coolly, "I don't know what you're talking about."

This man was clearly no saint, and the bloodline-reverted rabbit was the tribe's most precious treasure. She couldn't let him get his hands on the girl.

Qin Jiang arched a brow. "You're not being honest."

"Hmph."

When he'd first mentioned a proposal, she'd assumed he wanted the little rabbit. If so, an alliance marriage would have been perfectly fine. But now, he'd already claimed her instead—and she was willing to sacrifice herself to protect her tribe.

That little rabbit was their future hope.

Resolve hardened her features. 'For the Celestial Rabbit Tribe!'

She looked Qin Jiang in the eye. "I accept your proposal. But you must leave the rest of the Celestial Rabbit Tribe alone."

The determination on her face—as though she were marching to her execution—made Qin Jiang roll his eyes. 'Is it really that bad?'

He shook his head. "The Celestial Rabbit Tribe isn't in a position to negotiate with me. You—I want. The little rabbit—I also want."

When the other side was weaker, why negotiate? Defy him and he'd wipe the tribe out. Qin Jiang wasn't in the habit of indulging anyone.

Xue Mei's teeth clenched. This man was insatiable.

But she glanced back at her tribe, and the fury rising in her chest deflated. Weakness meant no bargaining power. They could only be at his mercy.

"Take me to the little rabbit," Qin Jiang said with a smile.

Xue Mei drew a deep breath, bit her lip, and relented. "Follow me."

She'd given up resisting. After all, she bore the weight of an entire race on her shoulders. Even an Immortal could be shackled by that burden. Her tribe was her weakness—one she couldn't abandon.

She led Qin Jiang's group into the Celestial Rabbit Tribe.

Their territory was considerably larger than the White Fox Tribe's, with little rabbits hopping about everywhere, occasionally shifting into human form. They watched Qin Jiang's party with wide, fearful eyes and scampered away.

At the tribe's center lay a beautiful lake—Xue Mei's usual place of seclusion.

She brought them to the lakeside and waited.

Before long, a Great Emperor arrived with a young girl in tow.

The girl looked frail—pale complexion, slender frame—but her bright, darting eyes betrayed a restless spirit. The Great Emperor whispered a few instructions before departing.

The girl approached on her own and gave Xue Mei a small bow. "Ancestor."

Xue Mei nodded, then looked at Qin Jiang. "This is the one you're looking for. Bloodline reversion. But her body is congenitally weak—she can't withstand the power of her own bloodline."

She sighed inwardly. Under normal circumstances, this girl would inevitably reach the Immortal path simply by growing up. But with a body this fragile, the pressure would only mount as her strength increased.

The tribe had tried everything over the years. Nothing worked. Even Xue Mei herself was powerless to help.

Still, a bloodline reversion was too precious to give up on.

The girl studied Qin Jiang with curious eyes. She'd seen the standoff in the sky earlier but didn't understand why she'd been summoned.

"Xiao Jiu greets the young master," she said with a polite curtsy.

"Xiao Jiu?" Qin Jiang already knew her name. He smiled. "Do you know someone called Tang Yin?"

"Tang Yin?" Xiao Jiu's eyes lit up. "I do! He saved me once. Do you know him too, young master?"

"I do."

Qin Jiang's smile widened. "I didn't like him much, so I wiped out his family."

Xiao Jiu: "..."

Her face went rigid, paling several shades. Beside her, Xue Mei's brow twitched. One more data point on Qin Jiang's personality—he'd destroyed an entire clan simply because he found someone disagreeable.

"Don't worry, Tang Yin's still alive. I figure he'll come running to the Celestial Rabbit Tribe."

Xue Mei's pulse quickened. So Qin Jiang's visit was connected to Tang Yin?

"Xiao Jiu," she said sternly, "what exactly is your relationship with this Tang Yin?"

Xiao Jiu snapped out of her daze. The sparkle in her eyes dimmed, replaced by a flicker of fear. She shot a nervous glance at Qin Jiang.

"It's just... a while back, an elder took me out, and my bloodline suddenly went berserk. Tang Yin happened to be there. He's very knowledgeable about herbs—not an alchemist, exactly, but the medicine he made did suppress the episode. That's all."

"That's all?"

"Well... we traveled together for a few days afterward. He's talented, and the elder thought highly of him. Because he saved me, the elder promised that if he ever needed help, he could... come to the Celestial Rabbit Tribe."
