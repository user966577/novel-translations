One day, Ning Xue'er was nestled in Qin Jiang's arms, toying with a piece of paper. She tossed it aside with a dismissive pout. "The Human Dao Sect is so cheap. Their annual invitations are just scraps of paper—you could forge one in five minutes."

"Is that for their inner sect selection?" Qin Jiang asked, catching a few words.

Ning Xue'er nodded. "Every year around this time, they hold a selection for inner sect disciples and send invitations to all the major powers—mostly to collect gift tribute. Our Azure Lotus Divine Palace has never attended." She placed a hand on his chest. "Want to go? I can come with you."

"The Human Dao Sect..." Qin Jiang murmured. "Did Chen Changsheng head there a few days ago?"

"He did. After he left the palace, I had people tailing him. He arrived at the Human Dao Sect a few days ago and registered as an outer disciple. I imagine he'll enter the selection." She looked up, puzzled. "That Chen Changsheng is just a Supreme. Why do you pay him so much attention?"

"Heh. He's not as simple as he looks. For all you know, he's already scheming against the Azure Lotus Divine Palace."

Ning Xue'er scoffed. "A mere Supreme thinks he can scheme against the Azure Lotus Divine Palace? I could crush him with one hand!"

"Heh heh—I keep forgetting, you're my esteemed Palace Master." He grinned at her self-important tone.

She shot him a look. "I haven't pulled rank on you. Why the sarcasm?"

"No sarcasm intended." He pulled her close, burying his face against her neck, breathing her in. "I was just thinking—for someone of your distinguished station, your humble servant had better provide exemplary service."

"Hey—! Pervert!"

Her cheeks flushed.

Hours later, Ning Xue'er's "distinguished station" had driven Qin Jiang to pull out every stop. She lay in a blissful daze, eyes swimming—more radiant than usual, flushed and luminous.

"Did your humble servant perform to my lady's satisfaction?" he murmured, holding her close.

She stirred, nuzzling against his chest, and mumbled: "Mm... I want more..."

"More?"

"Mm~"

"As you command."

More hours passed. Ning Xue'er smacked her lips contentedly, savoring the afterglow. Qin Jiang's full service was comprehensive indeed—including, when she got hungry, a genuinely delicious meal. He was a top-tier chef on top of everything else.

He smiled, wiped the perspiration from her brow, and asked softly: "Xue'er, do you like my cooking?"

"Mm~ Love it~" She nodded, still pink-cheeked.

"Then whenever you're hungry, I'll cook for you. Deal?"

"Deal~" She paused. "But why'd you stop calling me Palace Master?"

"Time to break character." He pinched her cheek.

She pouted. She'd actually been enjoying that.

Several days later.

Qing Chan looked at Qin Jiang, surprised. "You want to go to the Human Dao Sect?"

"Their inner sect selection is coming up. Thought I'd go have a look." He smiled. He'd learned enough about the sect by now—poor and chaotic, but powerful. Chen Changsheng might actually stir up something there. Qin Jiang intended to drop in and turn up the difficulty.

"Alright. I'll come with you." Since their heart-to-heart, Qing Chan had been eager to accommodate his every request.

He pulled her into his arms and kissed her. "With you there, I can relax."

"Hee hee, I'll keep you safe." She grinned, then glanced pointedly at Ning Xue'er, who was also present. The two had been competing so fiercely for Qin Jiang that they'd nearly fallen out.

Ning Xue'er huffed. 'So what if you're stronger? Can you compete with my moves? Have you ever tasted his cooking?'

She glided over. "The inner sect selection starts in a few days. Shall we leave now?"

"No rush. We'll time it to arrive right when it starts."

"Okay~ I have a traveling palace I've barely used—perfect for this trip. Plenty of rooms." She threw Qin Jiang a suggestive look. She knew he'd bring the others—Jian Yao, Mo Mo, and the rest. Her palace was spacious enough for everyone.

"A traveling palace will be a bit slow," Qing Chan said. "If we leave now, we should arrive just in time."

"Then let's go," Qin Jiang agreed.

At the Human Dao Sect, the selection was imminent and the atmosphere had grown lively. Outer disciples brimmed with confidence, determined to pass and join the inner sect. Chen Changsheng was among them. The exam would be easy for someone of his caliber, but he wanted the challenge—no shortcuts, just merit.

"Old man, how many days until the selection?" The old man he'd hired was still shadowing him—ten thousand spirit stones' worth of bodyguard.

The old man counted on his fingers. "Three more days. But are you really going to do it the hard way?"

"Yes. I hear the exam is supposed to be difficult. I want to see just how difficult."

"Tch." The old man shook his head. "You've got the money. Just pay the million and skip the whole thing. What if you fail? You'll have to wait another year."

"Ha—it's just an exam. I'm confident."

The old man muttered something and went back to his chicken.

Chen Changsheng smiled faintly. In his mind, Qin Jiang's image surfaced. 'This time, can you still interfere? All you have is a pretty face to attract women. And the Human Dao Sect doesn't have many women.'

He headed back to his quarters. Three days. Time to prepare and leave nothing to chance.

Time flowed onward. Three days passed in a blink, and the day of the Human Dao Sect's inner sect selection arrived. Every power in the Central Regions had received invitations. Apart from the Limitless Holy Land and the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, none dared refuse. They came bearing gifts.
