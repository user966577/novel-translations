The Void Beast was fast.

In just three days, the outline of the Ye Domain came into view.

And at that very moment—

[A new Child of Destiny has formed a connection with the Host. One spoiler is available. The Host may view the Child of Destiny's trajectory for the coming year and alter the storyline. View?]

Qin Jiang blinked.

A new Child of Destiny? Here in the Ye Domain?

"View!"

He chose immediately.

A cascade of scenes flooded his mind. At the center of them all was a young man—the new Child of Destiny.

"The Ye family... Ye Xuan?

"The Ye family produced a Child of Destiny?"

His eyes snapped open, brows furrowing, though they quickly relaxed again.

"Come to think of it, with a surname like Ye, it'd be stranger if a Child of Destiny didn't pop up."

He glanced at Ye Ling'er, then returned to studying the plotline. As he delved deeper, his expression grew increasingly peculiar.

After a long moment, he rubbed his forehead.

"So this Ye Xuan is Ye Qingtian's son.

"Tch—it's the classic 'avenge my father and reclaim what's rightfully mine' storyline, isn't it?

"But without me in the picture, wouldn't Xiao Fan have run into Ye Xuan eventually? Two Children of Destiny going head to head?"

[Because of the Host's interference in suppressing Xiao Fan, Ye Xuan has become the new Child of Destiny. Without the Host, Ye Xuan would never have received this designation.]

The system answered his question.

"So there's only one Child of Destiny at a time?"

[For now, yes.]

Qin Jiang muttered to himself.

"Children of Destiny, born in response to crisis... According to novel conventions, they exist because the Heavenly Dao creates them to avert catastrophe. If a Child of Destiny gets suppressed, the Heavenly Dao will simply create more...

"Am I right, Sys?"

[Correct, Host. Very perceptive!]

"So does that mean the Heavenly Mystery Continent faces some kind of calamity? Am I in danger?"

[Has the Host considered the possibility that he is the calamity?]

Qin Jiang: "..."

"What kind of joke is that? I'm refined, elegant, dashing as a jade tree in the wind. I've been pure-hearted and kindhearted since childhood—the kind of man who sweeps gently to spare the ants and covers the lamp to protect the moths. How could I possibly be a calamity?"

He was rather indignant at the suggestion.

The system offered no further comment.

Qin Jiang moved on, studying Ye Xuan's trajectory before thinking of his old friend Xiao Fan.

"So what about Xiao Fan now? Is he still a Child of Destiny?"

If a new one had appeared, did that mean the Heavenly Dao had abandoned Xiao Fan?

[The Host may send someone to check on Xiao Fan's condition. You'll understand then.]

Now Qin Jiang was really curious.

The spirit medicines he'd left behind had all been laced with cold poison. For an ordinary person, it would have been lethal. Against Xiao Fan's Fire Divine Body, the clash of ice and flame would be especially devastating.

But he hadn't known exactly what would happen when Xiao Fan refined those medicines.

"System, just tell me."

The system paused, then projected an image into his mind—Xiao Fan refining the spirit medicines.

Qin Jiang watched with interest.

At first, nothing unusual. But at the end, Xiao Fan's entire body was engulfed in flames, his agonized screams making even Qin Jiang flinch.

"Holy—he didn't burn to death, did he?"

Qin Jiang was stunned.

As the image continued, the flames finally subsided—but Xiao Fan was no longer recognizable as a human being. Every inch of skin had been incinerated. The heat had been so intense there wasn't even any blood.

Qin Jiang grimaced.

"That's... brutal. I really didn't mean for it to go that far."

He shook his head.

He hadn't even gotten his fill of tormenting the protagonist yet. He'd only left a casual trap, and it had completely destroyed Xiao Fan.

"System, he's still alive, right?"

[Alive, but he will never recover. What you saw is his permanent state.]

Qin Jiang: "..."

Alive—but looking like that, he might have been better off dead.

"What have I done..."

Qin Jiang sighed, briefly considering whether to send someone to put Xiao Fan out of his misery.

"Forget it. I'll take Ling'er to see him sometime."

He murmured to himself.

Half a day later in the Ye Domain, they finally reached Ye City.

"Young Lord, we've arrived at Ye City."

Black Dragon called from outside the palace.

Qin Jiang opened his eyes and rose from Ye Ling'er's lap. He took her hand—he could feel her trembling slightly.

"Don't be nervous. I'm right here."

Ye Ling'er nodded.

As they stepped out of the Void Palace, a welcoming party had already assembled before the Void Beast. Beyond Black Dragon, quite a number of figures stood waiting.

Among them was a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Ye Ling'er—about seventy percent alike—with barely contained emotion on her face. This had to be Ye Ling'er's mother.

Beside the woman stood a middle-aged man with an imposing bearing, his eyes betraying the same poorly hidden excitement. This was Ye Lingtian, head of the Ye family and Ye Ling'er's father.

Their gazes swept briefly over Qin Jiang before locking onto the girl at his side, unable to look away.

One glance was all they needed. They knew, without a doubt—this was their daughter.

Decades of searching. They'd seen portraits, of course, but this was the first time they'd laid eyes on her in the flesh. For a moment, neither knew what to do.

Ye Ling'er kept her head down, but her eyes darted between them. Her small hand tightened around Qin Jiang's, nervous.

Ye Kuan noticed the tension and sidled up to Qin Jiang, whispering:

"Young Lord, would you... bring the Young Miss over to meet the Family Head and his wife?"

Qin Jiang looked at Ye Ling'er, nodded, and gave her hand a gentle squeeze.

"Ling'er, let me walk you over."

"Mm."

She agreed softly.

Qin Jiang smiled and led her forward. In a few steps, they stood before the couple.

"Uncle, Auntie—I hope we didn't keep you waiting too long."

Ye Lingtian and his wife snapped out of their daze, shaking their heads hurriedly.

"Not at all, not at all."

The words came out, but their eyes never left Ye Ling'er. Qin Jiang might as well have been invisible.

He shrugged it off.

Ye Ling'er's mother opened her mouth, but nerves stole whatever she'd meant to say. Ye Lingtian was no better—a battle-hardened man who'd never been any good at emotional moments.

Ye Ling'er mustered her courage and looked up at them, which only made them more flustered.

So close, yet frozen in awkward silence.

Qin Jiang looked back and forth between them. 'First time seeing something like this. Might as well enjoy the show.'

After a while, Ye Ling'er's mother realized there was only one person who could break the ice—Qin Jiang.

She turned to him.

"Um..."

"Just call me Xiao Jiang, Auntie. After all, given my relationship with Ling'er..." He let the implication hang.

Ye Ling'er's mother: "..."

Ye Lingtian's eyes narrowed. If not for Qin Jiang's status, he'd have put the boy in his place right then and there. But as things stood, they needed Qin Jiang's help.

Thoroughly aggrieved.
