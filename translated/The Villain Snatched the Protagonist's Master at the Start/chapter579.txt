After their exchange, both were in good spirits. They decided to stick together and compete for the Immortal Emperor's legacy as a team.

Between them, Liu Xing's trio were all True Immortals—a strong lineup. Not dominant enough to crush all opposition in a realm full of True Immortals, but enough to deter casual trouble.

As more people gathered, the statue's radiance gradually faded, its pressure diminishing along with it. From nightfall to dawn, the statue's glow extinguished completely. No one made any rash moves—opportunity often came hand in hand with danger, and no one wanted to be the first to test it.

About fifteen minutes later, still nothing happened. Impatience was setting in when Zhao Sheng murmured to Liu Xing.

"I think the waves themselves are the trial."

"What makes you say that?"

"Try flying higher. There's a pressure ceiling—and have you noticed the waves getting stronger since we arrived? Remember, this Immortal Emperor called himself the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor. He created the Heavenly Waters Thirty-Six Strikes—a technique centered on water. The trial probably involves them."

Liu Xing tested it and found Zhao Sheng was right—he couldn't fly beyond a certain height. And the waves were indeed building, slamming against them with increasing force.

"If the trials are based on the Thirty-Six Strikes, how are we supposed to survive?"

"Don't worry," Zhao Sheng replied with a smile. "If this is a trial, it won't be the full technique—just a fraction of its power. Weakened versions."

As they spoke, more people caught on. The waves hit hard enough to cause actual pain, and those who tried to dodge upward found themselves trapped below the pressure ceiling. The trial had begun.

Towering waves crashed down upon the crowd with devastating force. Many coughed blood, and even True Immortals reeled from the impacts. Everyone endured. After two hours, the first wave of casualties lost consciousness and were teleported out—eliminated but alive.

The waves subsided briefly. Then the sea erupted again—droplets of water shot skyward and reformed into blades that rained down like a storm of knives. Anyone pierced by a blade vanished, teleported away. Another two hours, and this phase ended as well. The remaining cultivators were now fewer than one in ten.

A third trial followed: the sea churned and coalesced into water giants that charged the survivors. Each giant matched a Human Immortal in strength—and worse, they reformed after being shattered, making them effectively unkillable. Two more hours of that, and the survivor count dropped again.

"Thirty-Six Strikes... please don't tell me there are thirty-six rounds of this," Liu Xing muttered.

Beside him, Zhao Sheng gasped for breath. At his level, the intensity was brutal. Thirty-six rounds would finish him for certain.

The sea went eerily calm. Then it churned again, and a massive figure materialized—the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor, same as before. This version seemed to possess actual awareness. He surveyed the remaining few hundred—mostly True Immortals, with a handful of Human Immortals who'd somehow endured. His gaze lingered on Zhao Sheng for an extra moment.

"After all these years," he said, his voice tinged with emotion, "my heir has finally arrived."

He swept his arm, and a pool of blood appeared upon the water's surface—his own heart's blood. All eyes fixed upon it.

The Heavenly Waters Great Emperor smiled. "This pool contains my heart's blood—and within it, my legacy. One final trial. Those who pass shall inherit everything."
