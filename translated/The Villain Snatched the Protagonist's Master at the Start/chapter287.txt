How was their relationship?

Not great!

Dao Zhen grumbled internally but didn't dare say it aloud. Still, he'd already guessed what Qin Jiang was getting at—the boy wanted to recruit him. Could the Celestial Formation Fairy be attempting to break through to Immortal King again? He glanced at An Xihe and decided the likelihood was very high.

"Brother Qin, our relationship goes without saying! You're Baizhe's husband, and Baizhe is the heir to our Human Dao Sect. We're all family!" Dao Zhen beamed. Then, as if suddenly remembering something, he slapped his forehead. "Oh, right—I've recently had a breakthrough insight and was just about to enter seclusion. Brother Qin, given how close we are, would you mind keeping an eye on the Human Dao Sect for me?"

Qin Jiang: "..."

This old fox was truly cunning. He'd come here planning to recruit the man, and somehow the geezer had turned the tables and assigned him chores instead. And on top of that, the bastard was planning to hide away.

Neutral? Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed. He couldn't afford any uncertainties during An Xihe's breakthrough. Neutrality was not an option. Besides, staying neutral required the strength to flip the table at will. With Dao Zhen's power level, if he truly tried to sit this out, Qin Jiang would eliminate him preemptively. Better to remove any potential variables.

Under Qin Jiang's piercing gaze, Dao Zhen's smile gradually faded.

Qin Jiang sighed. "Brother Dao Zhen, you're basically Baizhe's grandmaster. I really don't want to make Baizhe sad."

Dao Zhen: "..."

He swallowed hard. The power emanating from Qin Jiang's palm was growing more intense by the second, as if it was about to erupt at any moment.

Dao Zhen let out a bitter laugh and shook his head. "Brother Qin, just tell me what you want."

"Alright, I'll be direct." Qin Jiang smiled. "I need you to help deal with the other True Immortals."

"Just me alone?"

"Of course not. Qing Chan and I will be there too."

"..."

Dao Zhen glanced at the Immortal King Seal in Qin Jiang's hand. If that thing went off at full power, it could probably slay a True Immortal—but Qin Jiang's personal cultivation was far too weak. Without Qing Chan and An Xihe backing him, even with the seal, Dao Zhen wouldn't have feared him. The gap in strength meant he could shut Qin Jiang down before the boy ever deployed his trump card.

And besides... "How many times can you use that thing?" Dao Zhen couldn't help but ask. A treasure like that was typically single-use, and a one-time burst, while useful, had limited strategic value. After all, aside from the three present, Azure Cloud Heaven still had five other True Immortals. Moreover, An Xihe would be attempting her breakthrough—she couldn't participate in any fighting, nor could she be disturbed. The defending side always had the harder job.

Hearing his question, Qin Jiang waved the seal and grinned. "After slaying the other True Immortals, there should still be enough juice left for you."

"..."

Dao Zhen's cheek twitched. Still keeping his guard up, even now. But he was also genuinely astonished—this treasure wasn't single-use?

He studied Qin Jiang carefully. According to the Human Dao Sect's intelligence, this young man wasn't native to Azure Cloud Heaven. His true identity had never been uncovered. But one thing was certain: his origins were extraordinary. Dao Zhen even suspected he came from somewhere above the Nine Heavens.

Shaking his head, he decided not to dwell on it. "Fine. I'll help you."

Qin Family City.

Inside the Void Divine Temple, a beam of sword light pierced the sky as a graceful figure swept out from within. It was Liu Shuwan.

She'd been cultivating in the Space-Time Temple all this time and had finally refined her law power, successfully breaking through to Human Immortal. The women who remained at Qin Family City watched with envy. At this point, only reaching the immortal path would grant them enough time to stay at Qin Jiang's side—and for most of them, that breakthrough was still a long way off.

They rushed over to congratulate her. Upon learning that Qin Jiang had gone to the Central Regions, Liu Shuwan urged everyone to keep cultivating diligently, then set off herself—bringing the Void Beast along for the ride. Little Xu had broken through to Great Emperor and now had the qualifications to serve as Qin Jiang's mount once again.

Demon Domain.

Xue Mei, Yu Lan, and Yu Ru gathered together. They'd all received Qin Jiang's message: Azure Cloud Heaven might descend into chaos, so stay safe. The specifics were unclear, but it likely related to the preparations he'd asked them to help with recently.

"That man—never tells us what he's actually doing." Xue Mei furrowed her brow, worry flickering in her eyes. If all of Azure Cloud Heaven was about to be thrown into upheaval, he was playing with fire. There was no telling if it would be dangerous.

Yu Ru fidgeted beside them. "Maybe... we should go find him?"

"No." Yu Lan shook her head. "Whatever Qin Jiang is planning, with our level of strength, we'd only be a burden at his side. Better to stay here and protect ourselves. Though, Xue Mei—your cultivation might actually be of help to him." She had a point. An immortal-path cultivator wouldn't be dragging anyone down.

Xue Mei considered this. "I'll go to the Central Regions to find him. Would you mind looking after the Celestial Rabbit Tribe while I'm away?"

"Of course." As the Snake Race chieftain, Yu Lan could easily shelter a small tribe like the Celestial Rabbits. And thanks to Qin Jiang's connections, the Snake Race and Fox Race had been getting along well, with both extending their protection over the Celestial Rabbits. Few races dared provoke them these days.

"Then I'll head out now. Anything you want me to pass along?"

Yu Lan and Yu Ru exchanged a glance, both turning slightly pink. They missed him but were too shy to say it.

Seeing their expressions, Xue Mei teased them with a smile. "Alright, you don't need to say it. I already know. I'll make sure he gets the message."

Before either could respond, Xue Mei rose and departed for the Central Regions.

Qin Jiang's group left the Human Dao Sect and returned briefly to the Azure Lotus Divine Palace before traveling to the Chaos District with An Xihe.

Aside from Qin Jiang himself, everyone in the party was at least a Human Immortal: five from the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, five of An Xihe's subordinates, plus Jian Yao, Mo Mo, Yan Shiya, and Chen Baizhe—fourteen Human Immortals total. And backing them were two True Immortals: Qing Chan and Dao Zhen.

This was without question the most formidable force ever assembled in Azure Cloud Heaven. The only catch was that this time, they might have to stand against every other faction combined. Quite a few of them were nervous. If things went wrong, the consequences would be devastating.

The only one who wasn't nervous was Qin Jiang. Beyond the Immortal King Seal, he'd already quietly deployed the Immortal King Killing Formation throughout the Chaos District. An Immortal King-level killing formation against a few True Immortals? Child's play. As long as the battle stayed within range and the formation's power held, he could control everything.
