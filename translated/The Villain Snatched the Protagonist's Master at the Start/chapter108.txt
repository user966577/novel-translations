The Qin family's might had shaken the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent. Over a dozen Great Emperors—the sheer number was terrifying. The ancient clans were already preparing congratulatory gifts, eager to pay their respects.

It was around this time that Qin Jiang received a piece of news.

Chu Yuan had made it to the Qin Domain.

"A boy who really can't stay away from his sister," Qin Jiang murmured to himself.

He'd known for a while that Chu Yuan was heading toward the Qin Domain. The purpose was obvious—he wanted to see Chu Hanyan. Qin Jiang hadn't planned to deal with Chu Yuan this early, but since the kid had come knocking, why not have some fun?

Once Chu Yuan was handled, the affairs on the Qin family's end would be more or less settled. After that, it would be time to look outward.

Qin Jiang went to find Chu Hanyan. If he was going to see Chu Yuan, he might as well bring the person Chu Yuan was dying to see.

"Where are we going?" Chu Hanyan asked curiously as they walked through the streets. This was her first time alone with Qin Jiang, and she had to admit, it felt rather nice.

He smiled. "I've got a little surprise for you."

He took her hand and strolled leisurely through the streets, occasionally stopping to buy her small gifts. After about an hour of wandering, he paused. Not far ahead sat a modest street stall—a few tables set out in the open, nearly all of them occupied.

At a corner table sat a young man in coarse hemp clothing. His expression was wooden, his features young yet somehow weathered. It was a strangely contradictory sight.

This was Chu Yuan, who had finally arrived at the Qin Domain.

Thanks to the people Qin Jiang had stationed along his route, Chu Yuan's journey had been nothing short of miserable. He'd slept outdoors nearly every night and gone hungry more often than not. Being able to sit and eat a proper meal like this felt like a luxury.

Still, relying on his experience from his previous life, his cultivation had advanced rapidly even without any lucky encounters.

Chu Hanyan followed Qin Jiang's gaze to the stall, and her eyes widened. "Yuan'er?"

Time had blurred the once-familiar face, but the moment she saw him, recognition was instant. The weariness etched into his features made her heart ache. Her little brother had traveled all the way to the Qin Domain—at his cultivation level, such a distance should have been nearly impossible. He must have suffered terribly.

She wanted to go to him, but the thought of Qin Jiang at her side gave her pause. She knew Qin Jiang had never been fond of Chu Yuan, and she was afraid her actions might provoke him into targeting her brother again—unaware that Qin Jiang's targeting had never actually stopped.

"Qin Jiang, may I go over?" she asked tentatively.

"Check his cultivation first," Qin Jiang said with a smile.

Chu Hanyan blinked, then looked at Chu Yuan more carefully. Her eyes went wide. "Golden Body Realm?"

When she'd left, Chu Yuan had been a mere Qi-Blood Realm cultivator. How long had it been? And he was already at Golden Body? His aura was thick and stable too—this wasn't the result of forcing breakthroughs for speed.

Qin Jiang's smile widened. "Remember what I told you? Chu Yuan has a special talent. The more adversity he faces, the faster his cultivation grows."

Chu Hanyan's brow furrowed. "Someone's been oppressing him?"

"That would be me."

She fell silent. No wonder Chu Yuan looked so haggard—he'd clearly been through a lot.

"I had people following him for two reasons," Qin Jiang continued. "First, to push his cultivation—and you can see how well that worked. Second, to protect him. Without my people watching over him, do you really think he could've made it to the Qin Domain at his level?"

Qin Jiang claimed credit without so much as a blush, spinning every one of his schemes as selfless benevolence.

Chu Hanyan paused, considering. What he said was actually true. The journey was impossibly long and dangerous for someone of Chu Yuan's cultivation. Without protection, he'd have died a dozen times over.

A pang of guilt flickered through her. She'd been blaming Qin Jiang all this time, but she'd misjudged him. She hadn't understood the depth of his good intentions.

"I'm sorry. I misjudged you," she said softly, pressing against his arm. "I thought you were targeting Yuan'er on purpose."

"I am targeting him on purpose."

"Huh?"

"His feelings for you are twisted. That's why I've been hard on him. But since he's your brother, killing him outright seemed wrong."

Chu Hanyan's face went blank. "Qin Jiang, you were thinking about killing Yuan'er?"

A tremor of panic. "You must be mistaken—Yuan'er only has normal sibling affection for me. He couldn't possibly have... those kinds of feelings..."

Even as she defended him, Qin Jiang's certainty planted a seed of doubt. Could Yuan'er really...?

If it were true, it would be absolutely unforgivable.

"Hide somewhere. I'll let you hear his real feelings for yourself," Qin Jiang said lightly.

Chu Hanyan hesitated, then nodded. She remembered the wager they'd made—if Chu Yuan's feelings were innocent, Qin Jiang would stop targeting him.

Once she was concealed, Qin Jiang walked toward the stall. Simultaneously, figures darted out from every direction, clearing out every patron and even the owner, leaving Chu Yuan alone at his table.

This sort of thing had happened to Chu Yuan so many times that he barely reacted. He just looked up—and when he saw who it was, his expression turned to ice.

"Qin Jiang. It's you."

His teeth ground together. The entire journey had felt like the world was conspiring against him, and he'd long suspected a hidden hand. Now, seeing Qin Jiang, suspicion became certainty.

Qin Jiang nodded pleasantly. "That's right. Every miserable thing that happened to you on the road? All arranged by me."

Chu Yuan's aura surged, shattering the table. He shot to his feet, fists clenched, and roared: "Why? Why are you targeting me?"

"You don't know?"

Confusion crossed Chu Yuan's face. Qin Jiang sneered.

"What? You need me to spell out what you feel for Yan'er?"

"You—!"

Chu Yuan's eyes bulged. His face went crimson in an instant, and panic flared in his chest.

"What are you talking about?"

"Hah. Can't even admit your own feelings. And yet you dare harbor those filthy thoughts!" Qin Jiang's voice dripped with contempt.

Chu Yuan's face burned, but he had no retort. Qin Jiang had struck his most vulnerable nerve. Toward Chu Hanyan, he had indeed developed feelings he shouldn't have.

"Coward! You can't even own up to it, and you came all the way to the Qin Domain for what? To ruin your sister's happiness?"

Qin Jiang's provocations rained down relentlessly.

Chu Yuan's fists clenched until his knuckles went white. Finally, unable to contain it any longer, he erupted:

"I like my sister—so what?"
