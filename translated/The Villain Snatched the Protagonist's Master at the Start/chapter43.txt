Listening to Qin Jiang's impassioned speech, Qin Hao's face went blank with confusion. Even Li Xueyi's eyes widened—she was discovering, for the first time, that her eldest son was...

Utterly shameless!

The student had surpassed the master.

As for Qin Lian'er, she gazed at her brother in open adoration. His ability to twist black into white was truly unmatched.

"Dad, I demand an apology!"

Qin Jiang's voice rang with righteous indignation.

By now, he'd convinced even himself. Emotions surged through him.

He was so filial, yet his father scolded him.

An apology was mandatory!

"Cough cough cough..."

Qin Hao snapped back to reality, choking on his own saliva. He stared at Qin Jiang in utter disbelief.

He pointed at his son for a long moment, unable to form a single word.

Seeing his state, Li Xueyi felt a twinge of sympathy—Qin Hao was genuinely furious—and cleared her throat:

"Jiang'er, you've made your point. Don't go believing your own stories."

Qin Jiang: "..."

Coming back to himself, he gave a sheepish laugh and scratched his head.

Li Xueyi took Qin Hao's hand:

"There now, don't be angry. Jiang'er and Lian'er take after me—a bit wild, but they know where the line is."

Her voice seemed to hold a kind of magic.

Qin Hao's temper cooled quickly. He smiled wryly:

"I know.

But I worry about Jiang'er. His talent is extraordinary, yet if he keeps fooling around, won't he waste it all?"

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes:

"Dad, you just said my talent is extraordinary. What's there to worry about?

If I wanted to, I could surpass you in a heartbeat!

Watch—I'll break through right now."

His aura surged. In a matter of breaths, he broke through a minor realm, reaching the peak of the Divine Ability Realm.

"Enough, or should I go again?"

For Qin Jiang, breaking through was the simplest thing in the world.

Qin Hao: "..."

He knew Qin Jiang had awakened a second divine body—the Taotie Divine Body, a perfect complement to the Immaculate Divine Body. But witnessing the combined effect of both was a first.

Li Xueyi's face likewise showed a flash of surprise.

"Wow, big brother, you're amazing!"

Qin Lian'er squealed, eyes sparkling.

Qin Jiang smiled and tousled her hair:

"Want to get stronger, Lian'er?"

"Yes!"

She nodded vigorously.

Her talent was actually quite good—comparable to Qin Hao's, at least. But next to Qin Jiang, it paled.

Qin Jiang flipped his palm. A flash of purple light appeared, and without hesitation, he pressed it into Qin Lian'er's body.

Innate Primordial Purple Qi!

It could improve one's physique and even had a chance of awakening a Divine Body.

Purple radiance enveloped Qin Lian'er instantly, and a gentle energy began reshaping her constitution:

"Mmm~

It feels amazing~"

She closed her eyes, a look of bliss on her face.

Li Xueyi started, staring at the purple aura, and gasped:

"Innate Primordial Purple Qi!"

"Oh?"

Qin Jiang looked at his mother in surprise:

"Mom, you recognize this?"

She pulled her gaze away, expression complicated, and nodded:

"Back when I created my cultivation method, the Heavenly Dao blessed me with a strand of Primordial Purple Qi. It improved my physique tremendously and smoothed my path ever since."

A blessing from the Heavenly Dao!

So his mother's method was truly extraordinary.

To have drawn the Heavenly Dao's very own blessing.

And the blessing had been Innate Primordial Purple Qi, no less—a supreme treasure.

"Since the dawn of creation, Innate Primordial Purple Qi has appeared only a handful of times. Jiang'er, where did you get it?"

Li Xueyi asked.

Qin Jiang blinked innocently:

"I dreamed about Primordial Purple Qi, and when I woke up, it was real."

Li Xueyi: "???"

"Boy, you can't even lie properly!"

Qin Hao couldn't resist.

Still, neither pressed the issue. If Qin Jiang didn't want to explain, he had his reasons—and whatever those reasons were, they clearly weren't harmful.

"If you'd used it on yourself, it might have pushed your talent even further."

Qin Hao said with a sigh.

Qin Jiang shook his head:

"No point.

My physique is already at its limit. Too much of a good thing turns bad.

And with my two divine bodies complementing each other, awakening a third might actually disrupt the balance. More harm than good."

He'd already thought this through.

Having dual divine bodies plus the system—there was no need to keep stacking talent.

Besides, even the best talent was useless if you never bothered to cultivate.

Qin Hao conceded the point with a nod.

All three turned their attention to Qin Lian'er, watching with anticipation. Innate Primordial Purple Qi had a chance of awakening a Divine Body.

The qi continued to reshape her constitution. The purple glow grew thinner as she absorbed more and more of it. As the last wisp flowed in—

Suddenly—

A burst of white radiance erupted from her body.

The surrounding spiritual energy trembled. All three faces lit up with joy.

"She actually awakened a Divine Body?"

Li Xueyi waved her arm, sealing off the courtyard—she had no intention of letting this news leak.

About fifteen minutes later, Qin Lian'er opened her eyes and stretched. In that short time, she'd grown a bit taller, and her cultivation had advanced as well.

"Wow, big brother, I'm at the Golden Body Realm!"

She exclaimed.

The cultivation boost wasn't what interested the others. Qin Jiang asked:

"Lian'er, besides your cultivation, do you feel anything else different?"

"Hmm~"

She scrunched up her face, closed her eyes, and focused inward. After a moment—

WHOOSH!!!

Fierce flames erupted across her body. Even Qin Jiang felt the searing heat from beside her.

She opened her eyes, marveling at the fire dancing around her. With a small gesture—

"There are these flames inside me now, and I can control them."

Fire? A Fire Divine Body?

Qin Jiang frowned. He'd just killed Xiao Fan—had the Fire Divine Body somehow transferred to Lian'er?

No, wait.

This fire was different from Xiao Fan's.

The flames in Lian'er's palm flickered and coalesced into a shape—something like...

A phoenix?

Faintly, a clear, ringing cry sounded. A phoenix's call?

"Nirvana Fire? A Nirvana Divine Body?"

Li Xueyi breathed.

Qin Jiang blinked:

"A Nirvana Divine Body?"

"Almost certainly!"

He stroked his chin. Phoenix... Nirvana...

Among the rewards he'd received alongside the Innate Primordial Purple Qi, there had been an Emperor weapon—the Phoenix Sword!

He held out his palm, and the Phoenix Sword appeared.

Before he could say a word, the sword began trembling, broke free from his grip, and flew to Qin Lian'er's side, practically nuzzling up to her.
