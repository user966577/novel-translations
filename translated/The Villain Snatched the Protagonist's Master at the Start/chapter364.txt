After Bai Jingyun departed, Qin Jiang and Bai Susu wandered the sect hand in hand. Before long, they both sensed energy flaring from a familiar direction.

"That's Wan'er and Yao Yao's power," Qin Jiang said.

They flashed over to find Liu Shuwan and Jian Yao at the entrance to Sword Valley, dao law energy pouring from their bodies and embedding itself into the earth.

"Didn't you destroy the old Sword Valley?" Liu Shuwan said, glancing at Qin Jiang. "Yao Yao and I decided to build a new one."

She wasn't wrong. The original Sword Valley had drawn its power from the Sword Heart that Jian Yao had left behind — the same one Qin Jiang had given to Liu Shuwan, collapsing the valley in the process. Bai Jingyun still considered him a walking disaster for it.

With their combined strength, the two women finished quickly. The new Sword Valley was vastly superior, and they'd seeded it with cultivation opportunities for future disciples. Qin Jiang produced two pills to help them recover, then examined their work.

"Nicely done. At least the opportunities here are actually obtainable by normal people."

Jian Yao's eyes narrowed. "My old Sword Valley was perfectly fine."

"Ahem. Each had its merits. This version excels at cultivating disciples. Yours excelled at... preservation."

Jian Yao shot him a withering look. He just loved taking jabs at her. Liu Shuwan and Bai Susu stifled their laughter. They'd both suffered in the old Sword Valley — Liu Shuwan especially. She'd known for years that a Sword Heart breakthrough awaited in its depths, but couldn't reach it. Then Qin Jiang strolled in and they'd discovered the catch: you needed Sword Heart mastery to claim the reward — which was the Sword Heart itself. Brilliantly circular.

"You two are laughing at me too!" Jian Yao pounced on them playfully.

Qin Jiang watched the three beauties tussle with an appreciative grin — until they unanimously redirected the blame onto him. Dragged into the fray, he dove in like a tiger among sheep, silenced Jian Yao with a kiss, and delivered a swift smack to each of the co-conspirators' backsides.

The mock battle wound down, and all four descended into the rebuilt valley, arriving at a small wooden cabin deep within — Liu Shuwan's old dwelling. It was here that Qin Jiang had shamelessly worn down her defenses over the course of a month.

Before leaving the sect years ago, Liu Shuwan had placed a protective barrier around it. The cabin still stood, pristine and undisturbed. She lifted the barrier with barely contained excitement — she'd missed this place dearly. That one month with Qin Jiang, when a certain shameless rogue had wormed his way into her heart... she'd never forget it.

The door opened to an immaculate interior — the barrier had kept even dust at bay.

"This is where you spent your seclusion, Sister Wan?" Bai Susu stepped inside, curious.

All four of them in the tiny space made it cramped.

"I was in seclusion here for thousands of years," Liu Shuwan said, smiling.

She'd been pursuing the Sword Heart that Jian Yao had left in the valley's depths. In the end, Qin Jiang was the one who'd retrieved it for her.

"Tch, this place is tiny," Jian Yao marveled. "You two lived here for a whole month? It must have been cozy." A pang of envy crossed her face. Their time together must have been impossibly sweet.

"He was injured at the time," Liu Shuwan murmured, cheeks pinking. She'd always known he could have healed himself easily. But he'd dragged it out, and she'd never called him on it. They'd grown closer day by day — from holding hands to stolen kisses — until she'd made one small fuss and he'd pounced.

Jian Yao latched onto Qin Jiang. "Not fair! You owe me a whole month alone too!"

"Me too~" Bai Susu raised her hand.

Two women flanked him, each hugging an arm with wounded expressions. Qin Jiang surrendered. "Time's precious right now. How about the Space-Time Temple? I'll give you each a full year in there."

"...Deal."

Liu Shuwan watched his predicament with an amused smile and a wink.

The cabin held nothing else to see. Qin Jiang restrained himself — he knew the place was precious to Liu Shuwan, a vessel for their shared memories. Better not to let others' presence intrude on that.

As they left, Liu Shuwan resealed the barrier with care. They descended deeper, to the very bottom of Sword Valley — a vast, open space. This was where Jian Yao had been reborn. She planted her hands on her hips triumphantly. Her territory! Far better than that tiny cabin!

She looked at Qin Jiang, then turned to Liu Shuwan and Bai Susu with a proud grin. "This is where I came back to life!"
