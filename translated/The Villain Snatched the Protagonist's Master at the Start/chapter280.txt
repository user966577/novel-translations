Qin Jiang rented a boat for himself. Ostensibly, he was alone, but Qing Chan and the others were shadowing him from the dark. They weren't about to let him wander off unsupervised. What if someone snatched him? Qing Chan, having done exactly that herself, was especially vigilant.

Qin Jiang crouched at the bow, trailing his hand through the water. The Human Dao River was no ordinary river—cultivators who fell in could struggle to climb back out if they were too weak. Some might even be dissolved into pure energy.

On a nearby boat, the woman in white watched him, her eyes gleaming. She'd spotted him.

"My lady, when the time comes, pretend to fall in," a subordinate whispered from behind. "Qin Jiang will surely come to your rescue."

Her cheeks colored faintly. She stole another look at Qin Jiang and nodded. According to the plan: fall in, get wet, then shelter in Qin Jiang's arms. Her fists clenched. She was uncharacteristically nervous, her face flushed pink.

The two boats drifted closer.

"My lady, it's time," her subordinate murmured.

She nodded, bit her lip, and squeezed her eyes shut.

Splash!

She toppled into the water. Nearby cultivators yelped in surprise, but most on the river were low-ranked—none dared enter the water to help. And even if someone had, her people would have intercepted them immediately. No one but the target was allowed near their mistress.

She thrashed lightly in the water, though to anyone watching, the acting was painfully obvious. Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. Dreadful performance. But he had a part to play. The lady was shy, after all—and more importantly, she was stronger than him. Force wasn't an option.

He dove in. Within seconds, he was at her side. Her eyes lit up the moment she sensed him in the water. Seeing him approach, she hastily put on a panicked expression and threw her arms around him like an octopus.

'So this is what a man feels like,' she thought. His warm body pressed against hers, and heat crept across her cheeks. His strength was nothing compared to hers, yet somehow, leaning against that solid chest, she felt an unfamiliar sense of safety.

Then his arm tightened around her waist. She stiffened for an instant before he lifted her, and they burst from the water to gasps from the onlookers.

Landing on his boat, Qin Jiang's arm stayed around her, and she clung to him just as tightly. After a moment, he spoke first. "Are you alright?"

His breath was warm against her ear. She came back to herself, her body softening, though her hands still clutched his clothes. She trembled, playing up the shock.

Qin Jiang's lips curved. He patted her back gently. Her clothes were soaked through. The white fabric had turned almost transparent. Under his quiet reassurance, she gradually "recovered," lifting her flushed face from his chest.

"It's you," she said, as though surprised. "You saved me again."

Qin Jiang smiled. "Seems like we're fated."

"Mm!" She nodded, a spark of delight in her eyes. "That's twice now. How should I repay you?"

"Well... how would you like to repay me?" he teased.

With anyone else of her power level, Qin Jiang wouldn't have dared be this forward. But this woman clearly had designs on him. Why not enjoy the game?

"I..." Her blush deepened. Was this the part where she was supposed to offer herself? But wasn't it too soon?

"Heh, I'm joking. Don't overthink it." He gave her a warm smile.

She blinked, then felt a pang of disappointment. He didn't want her to offer herself. Did he not find her attractive? Was this younger look too girlish? Did men not like that?

Her mind raced.

"Ah, by the way," Qin Jiang said, "you might want to change clothes."

She looked down and let out a small gasp, her face turning scarlet. The loose dress, now thoroughly soaked, clung to her like a second skin. Practically transparent. Qin Jiang had been getting an eyeful this entire time.

"Change... but I don't have anything else."

In her flustered state, she'd completely forgotten she could simply evaporate the water with her spiritual energy. Her whole body felt like it was on fire, her skin taking on a rosy glow. Qin Jiang watched from beside her, making no effort whatsoever to look away. If anything, he studied her more closely, which only deepened her embarrassment.

After letting his gaze linger until she was practically trembling, he finally spoke. "Here. You can wear mine."

He produced a set of clothes and handed them over. She hesitated briefly, then accepted.

They were in the boat's cabin now. She looked at him, cheeks still flaming. "Could you... step outside?"

"Sure."

He cast one last lingering look before leaving. Once his footsteps faded, she crouched down and buried her face in her hands. "That was so embarrassing!"

In truth, she'd remembered she could dry herself almost immediately. But under his gaze, she hadn't. Instead, she'd found herself subtly showing off, letting him look. Embarrassing, yes—but also a strange little thrill. She'd never felt anything like it before. And she liked it.

Taking a steadying breath, she peeked outside, then slipped out of her dress and into his clothes. But after pulling on the top, she looked down and paused. The shirt alone fell past her thighs.

She bit her lip, eyes glittering with mischief. What if she just... wore this? Skipped the rest?

Nothing underneath. It felt daring.

"This'll do!" she decided.

The whole point was seduction, wasn't it? This outfit was plenty seductive. She tucked away the remaining clothes and called toward the door, her voice soft: "You can come in now."

Qin Jiang walked in and stopped short. She was wearing only his shirt—just the top—her pale legs bare below the hem.

Had he only given her the shirt? No, he was sure he'd included pants too. Had he forgotten?

He scratched his head, eyes fixed on the sight before him. This was... admittedly quite something. The kind of view that was hard to look away from.
