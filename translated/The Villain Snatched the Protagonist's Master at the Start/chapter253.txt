The examination continued, but after what they'd just witnessed, the outer disciples called out by name were trembling. Every single one forfeited on the spot. They were afraid of being beaten to death.

And so the Human Dao Sect's inner sect selection began hastily and ended hastily. Qin Jiang's name would become something untouchable across the entire Central Regions.

The remaining administrative work didn't require him, but he stuck close to Dao Kun's side regardless. The Human Dao Tea hadn't been handed over yet—couldn't let him slip away.

Eventually, Dao Kun resigned himself to the inevitable and brought Qin Jiang back to his private quarters. With visible heartache, he produced a small box. Inside, neatly arranged, were dried tea leaves—the genuine Human Dao Tea.

Qin Jiang's eyes gleamed, and he reached for it, but Dao Kun yanked the box away. "Ahem, Young Master Qin, this is my entire collection. At most... at most, I can give you a small portion."

"A small portion?" Qin Jiang blinked at the box. There wasn't much to begin with. A small portion would be almost nothing.

"Sect Master Dao Kun, our Azure Lotus Divine Palace traveled millions of miles to lend your sect prestige, and we even pulled out a mole for you. A small portion... tsk, that really makes your entire Human Dao Sect look rather small-minded."

Dao Kun's cheek spasmed. Other factions came bearing gifts. The Azure Lotus Divine Palace not only brought nothing but wanted to take gifts home? Though the whole "lending prestige" angle was annoyingly valid.

"Half. Half at most!" Dao Kun said through gritted teeth.

Qin Jiang shook his head. "See, there you go being small-minded again. Your sect isn't short on tea. And haven't you wondered why we came to the Human Dao Sect at all?"

"Why?" Dao Kun blinked.

Good question. The Azure Lotus Divine Palace had never attended before. This time, they'd come out of nowhere—and Qing Chan herself had made an appearance.

"Don't forget," Qin Jiang said, patting his shoulder with a meaningful look, "we came with your Old Brother Dao Zhen."

Dao Kun's expression shifted. The ancestor had indeed been aboard the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's traveling palace. Had the ancestor personally invited them? If so, there had to be a grand plan at play.

"Sect Master Dao Kun, letting a few tea leaves ruin the Human Dao Sect's statesmanship... our Azure Lotus Divine Palace might start to view things a little differently."

Dao Kun's eyes flickered. If a handful of tea leaves derailed the ancestor's plan, the loss would far outweigh the gain. He clenched his jaw and thrust the entire box into Qin Jiang's hands. "Young Master Qin—take all of it!"

"See? This is the kind of vision worthy of the Human Dao Sect. Excellent, excellent."

Qin Jiang's smile was radiant. He snatched the tea and immediately stashed it in his storage artifact, then gave a satisfied nod. "The Sect Master must be busy. I won't impose any further. Until next time."

Before Dao Kun could react, Qin Jiang launched himself into the sky and was back at the traveling palace in moments.

Outside the palace, Qing Chan and Ning Xue'er were sipping tea and discussing the dao. Dao Zhen was nowhere to be seen—he must have already left.

"Had your fun?" Qing Chan smiled at his return.

Qin Jiang nodded, glanced around, and asked, "Dao Zhen left?"

"He left."

"Heh, good."

He produced the Human Dao Tea from his storage artifact with a grin. "Xue'er, switch to a different tea."

Ning Xue'er accepted the box curiously. She opened it, and her eyes widened. "Is this Human Dao Tea?"

"That's right. A gift from Sect Master Dao Kun."

"This tea is the Human Dao Sect's treasure. They barely drink it themselves. I once tried to buy some—spent a fortune and got less than a tenth of this amount. How strange that they'd give you so much."

"Sect Master Dao Kun is simply generous," Qin Jiang said, sitting down. "Xue'er, brew a cup first. Let's see what this Human Dao Tea can do."

Ning Xue'er nodded and switched to a fresh tea set, carefully measuring out a small amount of leaves. As she prepared the tea, she explained: "Human Dao Tea is refined using a special process unique to their sect. It's more precious than most spirit pills. A single cup grants ten years of cultivation progress, and if you're lucky, it can even trigger a state of epiphany—tremendously beneficial for cultivation."

The women listened with interest. Soon the tea was ready, and Ning Xue'er poured a cup for everyone, Qin Jiang included.

"Qin Jiang, let me feed it to you." She leaned against him with a playful smile, lifting the cup to his lips.

On his other side, Qing Chan raised her own cup. "Qin Jiang, I'll feed you too."

For them, ten years of cultivation was negligible. They weren't attached to a single cup. They'd rather monopolize Qin Jiang's attention for a while. Jian Yao and the others exchanged glances, then turned toward Qin Jiang with their own cups held up. "Qin Jiang..."

He looked left, then right. Every pair of eyes staring at him expectantly. Ning Xue'er's cup was practically at his lips, but if he drank it, he'd need to spend trillions of effort smoothing things over with the rest.

"Ahem, you all drink yours. I'll pass." He pushed the cup away. Ten years of cultivation was nothing to him. He could gain that much by casually devouring something.

The women didn't protest. Aside from Dan Yu, they were all at least Great Emperors. Ten years of cultivation was meaningless at their level, and epiphany was even less likely.

Only Dan Yu showed a reaction. After drinking her cup, a rosy flush spread across her cheeks, and her aura fluctuated before settling at a higher level. She'd broken through—Second Tribulation Supreme.

Ning Xue'er poured the final cup and held it out to Qin Jiang. "You're the only one who hasn't had any."

He accepted it with a smile, sensing the energy within. "Such a small cup, yet it holds such immense energy. This Human Dao Tea really is something special."

He drained it in one go. His cultivation ticked up slightly, but didn't reach a breakthrough.

Ning Xue'er took back the empty cup, set it on the table, and continued brewing. "The first steep is the only one with medicinal properties, but the flavor is exquisite even on subsequent steeps. We can enjoy several more rounds."
