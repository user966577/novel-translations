Under Qin Jiang's urging, the women threw themselves into cultivation with renewed vigor. Not that their training was unpleasant — most of it involved "mutual assistance" with Qin Jiang, and the results were undeniable. Everyone's cultivation efficiency skyrocketed, and their strength grew rapidly.

Before long, Lian'er emerged from seclusion, having broken through to Human Immortal. Qin Jiang was overjoyed. The moment he saw her, he swept her into his arms and kissed her deeply, drinking her in like a man dying of thirst. Lian'er clung to his neck and returned every bit of that heat — and didn't stop until they'd disappeared into the Space-Time Temple.

The other women left them undisturbed. Several days later, the two finally emerged, and Lian'er's cultivation had been thoroughly stabilized. Proof of just how much "effort" Qin Jiang had invested.

Dan Yu and Xiao Jiu broke through to Human Immortal shortly after. Qin Jiang didn't play favorites — he devoted equal effort to stabilizing both their realms, and warned them not to slack off. They needed to reach True Immortal before the Heavenly Domain opened. With Qin Jiang by their side, both women nodded with absolute confidence.

Qin Jiang found their determination gratifying. None of his effort had gone to waste.

Time flowed on amid the fiery cultivation sessions. Five months slipped by in a blink, and word arrived that Huaxia Academy's construction was complete.

Concurrently, both Azure Cloud Heaven and Grey Cloud Heaven had begun selecting prodigies — 1,000 slots total, 500 per Heaven, to be filled within one month. Five hundred spots across an entire Heaven was laughably few, and competition was fierce.

Qin Jiang paid it no mind. He only cared about the result. One month from now, he wanted to see the academy's doors open.

Just before the opening, Xue Mei, Ning Xue'er, and Chen Baizhe — who'd been in seclusion all this time — emerged one after another, each having broken through to True Immortal. A massive leap in strength. Qin Jiang devoted his usual effort to stabilizing their realms as well.

"Huaxia Academy is opening. You should attend, shouldn't you?" Liu Shuwan nestled against his chest. "And Xihe is the dean — she needs to make an appearance. Qing Chan and Mo Mo are vice deans too. They can't skip opening day."

"Mm, I should go take a look." He nodded, stroking her hair and pressing a kiss to her forehead. "Want to come along, Wan'er?"

"Sure! Let's all go — all of us sisters."

"Works for me."

There wasn't much else to do. Huaxia's day-to-day operations had been delegated to various subordinates, and the women had nothing filling their time besides cultivation. A group outing sounded perfect.

He floated the idea to the others. No objections. Qin Jiang produced an immortal ship and set out with the entire entourage.

The ship matched a Human Immortal in speed and was staggeringly vast — nearly half the size of Qin Domain. If they ever waged war across the heavens, this vessel would be a weapon in its own right.

Within days, they reached the academy. The teaching staff had received advance notice and was already waiting outside. Their jaws dropped at the sight of the ship — the thing was bigger than the entire campus. Several teachers were already scheming about converting it into the academy itself.

"So this is Huaxia Academy?" From the deck, the women surveyed the scene below: a sprawling landmass floating in the vast Chaos, studded with buildings of every shape and description, stretching as far as the eye could see. A soft luminous barrier enveloped the territory, making it look like a miniature immortal realm. Directly ahead stood a towering stone monument, its face blank — clearly waiting for an inscription.

"Not bad." Qin Jiang nodded approvingly. Viewed from above, the academy was impressively well-built. It looked like a proper institution.

He disembarked first. Liu Shuwan and the others followed close behind.

"Greetings, Manor Lord! Greetings, my ladies!" The assembled teachers bowed in unison.

Qin Jiang waved them off with a grin. "You've done well."

"This is simply our duty, Manor Lord." They smiled and deflected, none daring to claim credit. They'd all heard about the bloodbath in Grey Cloud Heaven. This Manor Lord was a walking calamity.

"Merit is merit," Qin Jiang said. "Five months to build this academy — each of you will receive Merit Points. On top of that, you'll each be allowed one above-rank redemption at the Merit Hall."

The teachers lit up. Above-rank redemptions were rare opportunities. In the Merit Hall, certain treasures were locked behind rank thresholds — no amount of points could buy them below a certain level. A single above-rank redemption was worth more than the points themselves.

"Thank you, Manor Lord!" They bowed deeply.

He waved them along. "Give me the tour."

"Of course — but Manor Lord, before we enter, would you do us the honor of inscribing the academy's name?" A teacher gestured toward the blank monument. They'd left it bare specifically for this moment.

Qin Jiang glanced over and smiled. "Sure." These people really knew how to play the game.

He walked to the monument, gauged the proportions, and soared upward. His expression sharpened. Using his finger as a brush, he carved into the stone — each stroke deep, each line deliberate.

HUAXIA ACADEMY

The moment the final stroke landed, golden light blazed from the characters. The teachers shielded their eyes against the stinging radiance.

"What ferocious willpower!"

"Is that the Manor Lord's intent? So sharp — so unyielding — like it would flatten everything in its path."

"The Manor Lord truly harbors grand ambitions."

The teachers traded quiet exclamations. The writing revealed the man — through those four characters, they could feel Qin Jiang's determination to sweep aside all obstacles.

He landed and surveyed his handiwork with a satisfied nod, then turned to the crowd with a grin. "Not bad, right?"

"Manor Lord, your calligraphy flows like dragons and serpents! Utterly transcendent!"

"Indeed! As powerful as a startled dragon — we're in awe!"

"Each character is a jewel! This inscription is the academy's greatest treasure!"

The flattery was shameless and relentless. Qin Jiang accepted every word with a smile, then grew serious.

"Guard this monument well. If anyone damages it..."
