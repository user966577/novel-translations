The five geniuses' suggestion was, in the end, adopted by An Xihe. But she was wrestling with a different question: should she reveal her true appearance?

If they went to a restaurant, there was a good chance the veil between them would drop entirely. And while her current look was her younger self—not exactly a disguise—there were still differences. When that moment came, she wanted to be honest.

But what if Qin Jiang didn't like it?

Every meeting so far had been in this younger guise. She was fairly certain he liked this version of her. Any change, even a slight one, introduced uncertainty.

After a long deliberation, she clenched her fist. "I'll go as my real self!"

If the worst happened—if he didn't like it—she'd simply take him by force. At her level, not even Qing Chan could stop her.

Her subordinates exchanged looks. They weren't surprised. They knew Qin Jiang was already aware of their mistress's true identity—the whole charade had been him humoring her. When she dropped the act, he'd simply stop pretending too. No real difference. As for her worry about being less attractive? Quite the opposite. Her true form was far more alluring than this younger version.

The next day, Qin Jiang received word that An Xihe wanted to meet at a restaurant. She was going all in, then. The thought brought a grin to his face.

Beside him, Qing Chan had seen the message too. She nestled against his chest, brow furrowed. She wasn't thrilled about him meeting with An Xihe—the woman was genuinely dangerous. Multiple True Immortals had sealed her, yet she slipped in and out freely. If she decided to hurt Qin Jiang, the consequences could be dire.

But she also knew Qin Jiang. A beauty this stunning? No way he'd pass.

"Qin Jiang, this woman is stronger than me. Can you really handle her?"

He held her close and kissed her cheek. "Relax. You've experienced my abilities firsthand, haven't you?"

She blushed. She had indeed. A True Immortal's constitution, and she still couldn't keep up.

"But you need the chance to use them," she pointed out. The Celestial Formation Fairy might not cooperate the way she had.

"Maybe... you should drug her?" Qing Chan suggested.

Whether the woman was willing or not, get the substance into her, and once Qin Jiang's particular talents came into play, Qing Chan was reasonably confident he could subdue her. After all, the Second General was undefeated.

"Drug her?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "I am a gentleman of the highest order. I would never stoop to such underhanded methods."

"..."

"Though—is there actually a drug that works on True Immortals?"

Qing Chan blinked. She'd assumed Qin Jiang would be an expert in this area. "You don't know?"

Her expression made Qin Jiang feel vaguely insulted. What exactly did these women think of him?

He shook his head. "Never used that kind of trick."

His methods had always been straightforward. With his abilities, he could simply win them over directly. Why bother with drugs? The closest he'd come was getting Baizhe drunk—but alcohol barely counted.

Lian'er had once tried to drug him, but that hadn't worked at all. Against a True Immortal, her concoction would be useless.

Qing Chan's eyes widened in genuine surprise. This shameless rogue had never actually drugged anyone? How novel.

Her astonishment made his eye twitch. He flipped her onto her back beneath him. "It seems my dear Chan'er has some deep misunderstandings about me. Allow me to correct them—thoroughly."

"Mm—" Her lashes fluttered. She'd only just recovered from the last round. Her small hands pressed against his chest as she whispered, "Wait... you should save your energy. That woman's still waiting for you..."

"Hehe, not to worry." He caught her wrists with a grin. "You know my stamina. A few more opponents wouldn't even slow me down."

"Then... be gentle..."

Time blurred. Night fell. Qin Jiang descended from the traveling palace with the bearing of a general marching to conquest. And in a sense, he was—about to conquer Azure Cloud Heaven's strongest powerhouse. No small feat.

Qing Chan and the others stayed behind. After the "thorough correction," Qing Chan was fast asleep, and the rest couldn't do much to help anyway. Besides, Qin Jiang had his own means of self-defense. The Immortal King Seal and the Immortal King Killing Formation Plate were more than enough to keep him safe.

Along the road, a figure appeared before him—one of An Xihe's people. "Young Master Qin, our mistress is waiting at the restaurant."

Qin Jiang nodded. "Lead the way."

The finest restaurant in the Human Dao Sect had been rented out entirely. Red silk ribbons festooned the interior, fluttering in the breeze—positively festive.

"Is this a wedding?" Qin Jiang murmured. The ceremonial touch was rather charming.

"Young Master Qin, the mistress is on the second floor. Please head up."

He climbed the stairs, noting the red silk along the walls. Every girl dreamed of being a bride, it seemed. He made a mental note: one day, he would hold a grand wedding—one that would make the myriad realms envious. His women deserved nothing less.

On the second floor, he followed the ribbons to a lamp-lit room. The door was unlocked. He pushed it open.

Inside, the room was decorated like a bridal chamber. He'd been through this once before—when he'd crashed the Fire Tribe chief's wedding and claimed the bridal suite.

His gaze traveled to the bed, where gossamer curtains revealed the silhouette of a figure within. He smiled, shut the door, and approached.

Just as he reached for the curtain, An Xihe's voice stopped him: "Wait."
