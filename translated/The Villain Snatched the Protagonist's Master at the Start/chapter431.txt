"I've received word that Huaxia has deployed True Immortal-level powerhouses to Mystic Cloud Heaven. When the time comes, every force that has opposed Huaxia will be swept away. The Anti-Huaxia Alliance will be no exception."

Qin Jiang fixed Xue Yue with a casual smile. "So when I say Nangong Yun doesn't have much time left — do you have a problem with that?"

Xue Yue's face went pale. True Immortals. Huaxia had actually sent True Immortals? The Anti-Huaxia Alliance couldn't withstand a Human Immortal, let alone a True Immortal. Against someone of that caliber, they would have no power to resist whatsoever.

"You — how would you know anything about Huaxia's movements?" she demanded.

Before Qin Jiang could answer, Yue Weiwei spoke up. "My husband's family has... certain connections."

Xue Yue trusted Weiwei, but she still regarded Qin Jiang with suspicion. "If you know what Huaxia is planning, why come to our Anti-Huaxia Alliance?"

"Like Weiwei said — my family has connections. Huaxia will give them some face." He smiled faintly and wrapped an arm around Weiwei's waist. "Besides, I need to keep Weiwei safe. By now, Huaxia probably has a full roster of everyone in the Anti-Huaxia Alliance, and Weiwei's name is certainly on it. Rather than wait for Huaxia to come hunting, better to stay put. When the time comes, I'll have the Huaxia True Immortal show my family a little courtesy — enough to spare Weiwei."

"You can protect Weiwei?" Xue Yue's eyes brightened.

"My family can manage that much." He nodded.

Xue Yue's mind raced. If his family could make Huaxia show face, they had to have at least a True Immortal behind them — and probably some relationship with Huaxia. This man's background was anything but simple. And if he could protect Weiwei, surely he could protect others.

"Nangong Yun is Weiwei's junior brother. If there's real danger, you wouldn't just abandon him, would you?"

Qin Jiang's brow creased, and a conflicted expression crossed his face. He shook his head. "You know how domineering Huaxia is. Protecting Weiwei alone will already cost my family dearly. Adding another person? They'd never agree. And Nangong Yun is the alliance's leader — protecting him would be nearly impossible."

Xue Yue's delicate brows knitted. Everything he said made sense. Huaxia's ruthlessness was well-known. Even with connections, saving one person demanded a steep price. And as the alliance leader, Nangong Yun would be at the very top of Huaxia's target list.

But he'd said "nearly impossible" — not "completely impossible." That meant if he truly wanted to, there was still a chance. The question was getting his family to agree, and for a major power, nothing moved without incentive. Weiwei could be saved because she was his woman — worth the cost. What could Nangong Yun possibly offer?

Xue Yue's gaze drifted to Nangong Yun, still digging graves in the distance, and worry clouded her face. She clenched her fists, drew a deep breath, and looked back at Qin Jiang. She made a silent decision: she would save Nangong Yun no matter what. And Qin Jiang was her only chance.

Nangong Yun finished the burial rites at a painfully slow pace — digging, laying the bodies to rest, paying his respects. One by one, the onlookers drifted away. Qin Jiang's group followed Yue Weiwei back to her quarters, and Xue Yue trailed along. Only Nangong Yun remained, standing silently before the two fresh graves, drowning in self-pity.

Weiwei's quarters were spacious — plenty of room for everyone. After settling them in, she turned to Xue Yue with a slight hesitation. "Xue Yue, my husband and the others need to rest, so..."

'Rest?' Xue Yue scoffed inwardly. On the way here, she'd heard Qin Jiang say he was going to take on all five at once. Obviously, this "rest" was anything but. Her cheeks colored slightly. She really shouldn't intrude. But for Nangong Yun's sake, she spoke up.

"Weiwei, I'd like to speak with him."

"Hm?"

"Don't misunderstand — I just want to discuss a partnership. For Nangong Yun's sake."

Just then, Qin Jiang walked over and looked at Xue Yue with surprise. "You want to discuss a partnership with me?"

"That's right."

"You're a Supreme. What could you possibly bring to the table? You can't save Nangong Yun." He shook his head.

Xue Yue's eyes narrowed. She lifted her chin proudly. "I'm from the Blood Tribe."

"The Blood Tribe?"

"With your family's standing, you can't be unfamiliar with them."

"I know of them." Surprise crept across his face as he looked her up and down. "What's someone from the Blood Tribe doing here?"

"That's none of your concern." She waved a hand. "So — can we cooperate now?"

"No."

She glared at him, frustration boiling over. "I'm Blood Tribe royalty! Even if your family has True Immortals, an alliance with us would benefit them!"

"The Blood Tribe is nearly finished. What's there to ally with?" He shook his head, regarding her with something almost like pity — a look that made her deeply uncomfortable.

'The Blood Tribe, nearly finished?' "What nonsense! The Blood Tribe has True Immortals too — we're no weaker than your family!"

He curled his lip dismissively. "True Immortals? So what? Huaxia has killed so many True Immortals you can't count them on one hand. Can the Blood Tribe stand against Huaxia?"

Her brows furrowed. "The Blood Tribe can't match Huaxia, true. But we've never provoked them. Huaxia is domineering, but they wouldn't slaughter us without reason, would they?"

"Who says you haven't provoked them?" He let out a cold laugh. "Don't you know that Huaxia's code includes a guilt-by-association rule? You joined the Anti-Huaxia Alliance — the entire Blood Tribe won't escape punishment."

"What?" The color drained from her face. She searched his expression for any sign of deception, but Qin Jiang's acting had long since reached its zenith. Besides, everything he'd said was technically true.

Feeling the weight of his sincerity, her legs nearly gave way. If her actions led to the Blood Tribe's annihilation... she couldn't bear to imagine it.
