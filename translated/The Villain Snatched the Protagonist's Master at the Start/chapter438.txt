Qin Jiang's investigation of Yue Weiwei was thoroughly conclusive: women were, in fact, made of water. At least Weiwei was. A broader study would require expanding the sample size — Liu Shuwan, Lian'er, Jian Yao, Mo Mo... and, of course, Xue Yue.

The very next day, Xue Yue arrived for the advanced kissing lesson, and that session proved the hypothesis once more.

Over the following days, her technique improved markedly. She was a diligent student — rain or shine, she showed up on time every single day, and often requested overtime. After finishing a session, she'd ask for more. Truly model dedication.

One day, after a particularly intense round, she lay limp in Qin Jiang's arms, eyes slightly glazed. She'd been so close for so long, always stopping just short of the final step. She couldn't take it anymore.

Summoning her courage, she wrapped her arms around his neck, leaned in, and kissed him. When their lips parted, she whispered, face crimson: "I want to be your woman. For real."

She gazed at him, eyes full of invitation. Her body melted against his — boneless, her cheek resting on his shoulder, her lips grazing his jaw.

"Aren't you already my woman?"

"I mean your real woman. Not pretend." A flicker of vulnerability crossed her eyes. All these days, she'd played along with everything, but he'd always stopped just short of truly claiming her.

"No regrets?"

"None."

"What about your dear Nangong Yun?"

She stiffened briefly. Did she still have room in her heart for Nangong Yun? These past weeks, only Qin Jiang had occupied her thoughts. Any stray recollection of Nangong Yun was immediately crowded out.

"Nangong Yun? What about him?" She kissed Qin Jiang again, clinging tight. "Make me yours. Please."

He'd always intended to take her — there was no reason to hold back any longer. He pulled her close, inhaled deeply against her neck, and murmured, "Yueyue, you smell wonderful."

"Do... do you like it?"

He chuckled, lowered his head, and kissed her collarbone. "Want to find out how much?"

"Yes."

He didn't disappoint. But his affection ran a little too intensely for her first time. After about two hours, he mercifully eased up — no need to overdo it on the maiden voyage.

She lay in his arms afterward, hair slightly tousled. He smoothed it for her, kissed her forehead, and asked, "Did you feel it?"

"Mm." Her voice was faint. His passion had been overwhelming — but she liked it. No wonder Weiwei had fallen so fast. Any woman would be helpless against that.

After resting a while, she looked up. "I'm really your woman now?"

"Of course."

"Not pretend?"

"It was never pretend. We've been real from the very start." He smirked.

She pouted. "Jerk."

"Your charm is irresistible. I was smitten."

She blushed, then asked softly, "So you do like me?"

"I like you." He ruffled her hair. "Which means you'd better start preparing."

"Preparing for what?"

"To stay by my side, like Weiwei and the others. Every single day we can..."

"Mm — how should I prepare?"

"Simple. Just have plenty of tea ready for me."

She flushed to her roots. After a hesitation: "Can you help me? I don't like doing it by myself..."
