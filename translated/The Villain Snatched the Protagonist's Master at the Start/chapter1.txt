"Pfft!"

Qin Jiang spat out a mouthful of tea, staring at his younger sister in disbelief.

"You want to break off the engagement?"

"Come on, Brother, just come with me! That trash isn't worthy of me at all. Do you really want your adorable little sister marrying some good-for-nothing?"

Qin Lian'er pouted, shaking Qin Jiang's arm back and forth. The grievance and anticipation in her beautiful eyes were absolutely devastating.

Qin Jiang rubbed his forehead, his expression pained.

So his Qin family really was a villain family after all!

Qin Jiang's soul came from a place called Blue Star. After studying hard for over a decade, he'd finally made it into university, only to die from a sudden heart attack while gaming late at night before he could enjoy any of it.

Then he transmigrated.

He arrived in the Heavenly Mystery Continent, a xuanhuan world where flying through the sky, moving mountains, and overturning seas were just basic abilities.

And Qin Jiang was lucky—he transmigrated into a great clan, and as the young patriarch no less. From the moment he was born, he'd enjoyed the finest luxuries.

Now, a full nineteen years had passed, and he was eighteen years old.

Noble status, top-tier talent. He'd thought he was this world's protagonist.

But now...

Looking at his little sister, Qin Jiang's expression grew conflicted. With his eighteen years of experience reading web novels, there was no doubt the Qin family was a villain clan.

And the target of his sister's broken engagement was probably the real protagonist.

"Brother~"

Qin Lian'er's sweet, honeyed voice snapped him back to attention.

Qin Jiang sighed. "Your fiancé—his name is Xiao Fan, right?"

He hadn't paid much attention to the name before, but now, combined with his sister's desire to break off the engagement, wasn't this the most protagonist-like name ever?

Qin Lian'er's face twisted with disgust.

"What fiancé? It's all Grandfather's fault! He said the Xiao family once saved his life, and that Xiao Fan was some kind of genius, so he insisted on arranging this engagement.

"But in reality, that Xiao Fan is complete trash. He's already fifteen and still only at the Qi-Blood Realm. I'm two years younger than him and already at Meridian Condensation.

"I refuse to marry some worthless nobody!

"Besides, what even is the Xiao family?

"If that old man wants someone to marry him so badly, he can do it himself!"

Qin Lian'er's voice dripped with resentment.

Qin Jiang: "..."

This Xiao Fan was definitely the protagonist.

And he and his sister were just cannon-fodder villains. Even if they didn't go break off the engagement, they'd probably end up opposing him for one reason or another.

The thought made Qin Jiang frown.

But when he looked at his expectant little sister, his worries eased somewhat. He smiled, shaking his head, and ruffled Qin Lian'er's hair affectionately.

"Fine. If Lian'er doesn't like him, then naturally this engagement doesn't count."

She was his own little sister. Of course he'd spoil her.

Besides, he really didn't want to marry her off. It felt like he'd raised this cabbage himself, and he wasn't about to let some random pig come along and take it.

"Hehe, Brother's the best!"

Qin Lian'er giggled, her face lighting up with joy.

Qin Jiang smiled indulgently, but his heart grew heavy. Once they broke off this engagement, there would be no turning back.

"The protagonist... the Child of Destiny, huh?"

He murmured to himself.

A fighting spirit rose within him. This so-called destiny—Qin Jiang wanted to see if he could defy it!

*[Ding. Detected will to defy destiny. Villain Spoiler System binding in progress...*

*Binding successful.]*

Just then, a long-awaited voice echoed in Qin Jiang's mind.

"A system!"

Qin Jiang's expression turned excited. A system had finally arrived! After nineteen years!

Do you have any idea what I've been through?

Every single day, dressed in the finest clothes, eating the finest food, living in the lap of luxury, indulging in pleasur—

Ahem. Not that last one.

Anyway, life had been quite enjoyable.

Wait, wasn't he supposed to be complaining about hardship?

Whatever. He really hadn't experienced any suffering. But getting a system now was like receiving coal in a snowstorm—exactly what he needed.

"Hey, System, what can you do?"

Qin Jiang asked in his mind.

*[This system is the Villain Spoiler System. It can reveal the future trajectory of the Child of Destiny. When Host alters the plot, Host will receive Villain Points or rewards.]*

"Spoilers?"

Wasn't that basically predicting the future?

System, you're amazing!

*[Detected that the current Child of Destiny has a connection with Host. One spoiler is available. Host may view the Child of Destiny's trajectory for the next year. Altering the plot will grant Villain Points or rewards.]*

Hearing this, Qin Jiang grew curious.

He immediately activated the spoiler function. Images flooded his mind, accompanied by text explanations.

How thoughtful.

"Xiao Fan—it really is him!"

Seeing the Child of Destiny in the spoiler content, Qin Jiang muttered to himself.

And the opening scene was him and his sister going to break off the engagement.

Then Xiao Fan would shout: "The river flows east for thirty years, then west for thirty years—never look down on a poor young man!"

A classic line.

Qin Jiang sighed with emotion and continued reviewing the future plot. Just then—

"Brother, what are you spacing out for?"

Qin Lian'er shook Qin Jiang's arm, her pretty face full of confusion.

Why did her brother look so dazed?

Snapping back to reality, Qin Jiang looked at Qin Lian'er and smiled.

"Get ready. Your brother's taking you to break off that engagement."

---

The next day.

A massive beast rose into the air from the Qin estate, pulling an ornate palace-carriage behind it.

Inside the carriage were Qin Jiang and Qin Lian'er.

Along with a contingent of guards.

Qin Jiang reclined on a soft couch, eyes half-closed. He'd already reviewed Xiao Fan's entire trajectory for the coming year, and he had to admit—the Child of Destiny was impressive.

After getting his engagement broken off, he'd soar to greatness, his cultivation progressing at an astonishing pace.

But what Qin Jiang couldn't understand was this: Xiao Fan's face was utterly ordinary, so why did all those talented beauties fall for him? This world's sense of aesthetics was severely skewed!

"Sigh. This world needs me to save it."

Qin Jiang said to himself.

He would definitely correct this world's beauty standards. And those talented beauties—how could he just stand by and watch them fall into the tiger's den?

Qin Jiang's heart was simply too soft.

He couldn't bear it.

"Young Master, Young Miss—we've arrived at the Xiao residence."

A respectful voice came from outside the hall.

Qin Jiang opened his eyes and looked at the excited Qin Lian'er beside him.

"Lian'er, let's go."

"Okay!"

Qin Lian'er hugged Qin Jiang's arm and followed him out of the hall, practically skipping.

The palace-carriage still hovered in mid-air.

Below them lay a small city. This was still part of the Qin family's territory, and the Xiao family was merely one weak clan among many within the Qin family's vast domain.

"The old man really has gone senile."

Qin Jiang shook his head.

"Exactly!"

Qin Lian'er nodded emphatically. This backwater place—Grandfather actually wanted to marry her off here?

She was the Qin family's little princess!

How could she possibly endure such hardship?

Break off the engagement. She absolutely had to break it off!

Looking at the indignant Qin Lian'er, Qin Jiang smiled slightly and ruffled her hair to comfort her. Then he turned to a burly man following behind them.

"Black Dragon, call out the Xiao family.

"No need to be polite about it."

"Yes, sir."

Black Dragon acknowledged the order. Standing at the edge of the palace-carriage, he split his mouth into a wide grin.

"All you Xiao family brats, get your asses out here! Your ancestors have arrived!"
