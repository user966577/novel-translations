Watching the scene unfold, Qin Jiang felt somewhat exasperated. Did fortune heroines all share the same defective survival instinct?

Well, no—Liu Shuwan hadn't been this foolish.

A defenseless girl parking herself outside the door of her father's killers to "demand justice"? In a world where strength was law, that was practically volunteering to be a victim. And what good was "justice" anyway? It wouldn't bring her father back.

The smart play was to lie low, grow stronger, and come back to settle the score properly. Even without talent, an ambush on the elderly or infirm would work—kill one and you've broken even, kill two and you're ahead.

But fortune heroines operated on a logic that defied comprehension.

"Did you hear me? Get lost! Or we'll make you!"

The two brutes loomed over her.

The girl shook her head, her voice small but firm through her tears. "I want justice for my father."

"Justice? Your old man nearly knocked over the madam—he's lucky we only killed him! Do you know who the madam is? The Ninth Prince's grandmother! The most favored prince in the empire—future crown prince, future emperor! And you, a nobody, want justice?"

The men sneered, their contempt barely contained.

The girl bit her lip, despair washing over her. She hadn't known the estate belonged to someone so powerful. She and her father were just ordinary people—refugees who'd fled their village after a bandit attack. Her father had taken a job at this very estate to put food on the table.

The pay was good. But now his body had been thrown out, battered beyond recognition.

It had felt like the end of the world.

Refusing to accept it, she'd dragged his corpse to the estate's entrance, hoping someone in authority would acknowledge what had been done. But she'd been immediately chased away and had retreated to this corner instead, clinging to the hope that the people inside would at least give her an explanation.

Now, hearing who owned the estate, that hope evaporated.

Why would someone that powerful care about her?

She slumped to the ground, tears falling like rain.

The two men's patience snapped. They were reaching for her when a voice cut through the air.

"Stop."

A young man in silk brocade strode over, his brow furrowed. He glanced at the girl, and a flicker of interest crossed his eyes. Then he turned to the brutes.

"What's going on?"

"Ninth Prince!"

The men dropped to their knees.

This youth was the Ninth Prince himself.

The girl's eyes widened. The Ninth Prince—the madam's grandson, the Dragon Emperor's most beloved son.

The men started to explain, but Qin Jiang, who'd been watching from nearby, stepped forward.

"Let me."

He walked to the girl's side and helped her to her feet. Fragile and delicate, she was the kind of person who inspired protective instincts. Among all his women, he didn't have one quite like this—genuinely soft and vulnerable. He had one who played at being demure, but this girl was the real thing. A pure, naive innocent. Without someone like Qin Jiang intervening, she'd probably end up falling for the very person who'd caused her suffering.

"Who do you think—"

"Shut up."

One of the brutes started to bark, and the Ninth Prince cut him off instantly. He turned to Qin Jiang with a broad smile.

"Third Brother-in-law! What a pleasant surprise."

"You know me?"

"Father had your portrait distributed to every prince and senior official. He said meeting you is the same as meeting him in person."

The Ninth Prince's posture was properly deferential.

Qin Jiang studied him. "By that logic, shouldn't you be kneeling?"

"Ah..." The prince's smile froze, then recovered. "Brother-in-law jokes."

Qin Jiang clicked his tongue. This Child of Destiny lacked flexibility—couldn't even bring himself to kneel when it mattered.

He looked down. The girl was pressing close to him, trembling slightly, clearly intimidated by the Ninth Prince's identity. Qin Jiang steadied her with one hand, gently patting her back.

"Don't be afraid."

"Thank you." She came to her senses, cheeks reddening as she registered the warmth radiating from the man beside her. She stepped back slightly and bowed.

The Ninth Prince watched this exchange, and something dark flickered behind his eyes. He was a genius-type Child of Destiny—the center of attention since birth. Everything he'd ever wanted had fallen into his lap.

Until now.

"Why don't you tell him what happened," Qin Jiang said to the girl.

She nodded. With Qin Jiang beside her, she found a sliver of courage. Looking up at the Ninth Prince, she recounted everything—her father's death, the circumstances, all of it.

The Ninth Prince's expression grew grave as he listened. The case involved his grandmother. Under normal circumstances, the girl's complaint would be worthless. But with Qin Jiang standing right there...

"What do you want?" he asked.

The girl glanced at Qin Jiang, then steeled herself. "I want justice."

"Justice?"

The prince blinked. What good was justice? You couldn't eat it.

Still, relief crossed his face. "I'll have my grandmother apologize to you and your father."

"Hah."

Qin Jiang's derisive laugh wiped the relief away. The Ninth Prince's jaw tightened. He drew a deep breath.

"Does Brother-in-law have other suggestions?"

Qin Jiang shook his head. He turned to the girl. "Let's lay your father to rest first."

Perhaps because Qin Jiang had given her support, or perhaps because she simply needed someone to follow, the girl hesitated only briefly before nodding.

Qin Jiang signaled, and a guard appeared to carry the body away.

He smiled at the Ninth Prince. "Have your grandmother ready. And those two"—he indicated the brutes—"deal with them. Thoroughly. I don't like leaving loose ends."

With that, he led the girl away.

The Ninth Prince's expression went fully dark. The two brutes had already dropped to their knees, shaking.

"Ninth Prince—mercy, please!"

Already irritated, the sight of these two only soured the prince's mood further.

"Someone dispose of them. Cleanly. Root and branch."

Elsewhere, Qin Jiang helped the girl bury her father. She knelt before the grave and kowtowed three times, her eyes crimson, tears painting delicate trails down her cheeks—a portrait of fragile beauty.

After a long moment, she rose and approached Qin Jiang with a deep bow.

"Thank you."

Qin Jiang's gaze dipped involuntarily—from his angle, the bow offered a rather generous view. He helped her straighten up.

"You only wanted justice? Haven't you thought about revenge?"
