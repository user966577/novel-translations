Qin Jiang's expression was calm. Facing a True Immortal's attack, he hadn't retreated a single step.

He glanced at the five True Immortals and lightly brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve.

His nature had always been cautious and careful. Naturally, he'd anticipated that the five True Immortals would try to cut off the head of the snake. So the lion's share of the Immortal King Killing Formation's power had been wrapped around himself as a shield.

And now, at the critical moment, that shield had erupted — crippling a True Immortal in one blow.

The wounded True Immortal crawled out of his crater, trembling, blood seeping endlessly from his body. Spiritual energy coursed through him, but it couldn't close the wounds. His face was ashen. Injuries like these could take tens of thousands of years to heal. And given the current situation, his wounds weren't even the most pressing concern.

He looked up at Qin Jiang and swallowed a mouthful of blood. Fear glinted in his eyes. Since breaking through to True Immortal, this was the first time he'd felt his life genuinely threatened.

"How are you? Are you alright?" The other four True Immortals grimaced at the sight of him.

He stared back at them. Alright? Could they not see the state he was in?

He drew a deep breath, eyes flickering, and broke into a violent coughing fit. Blood seeped continuously from the corner of his mouth. He wiped it away and said weakly, "My injuries are too severe. I'm afraid I can't hold on much longer. I probably won't be of much help going forward."

He didn't want to fight anymore. This was the perfect excuse — he'd quietly slip away while the others took the heat.

The four True Immortals frowned. Losing one fighter this early wasn't a good sign. Worse, they still had no idea what this killing formation's upper limit was. But that last strike made one thing clear: the power they'd faced before was nowhere near its peak. One blow had crippled a True Immortal. That kind of force was approaching Immortal King level. Against that, even all five of them together might not hold.

They exchanged glances, momentarily at a loss for words.

Qin Jiang, of course, wasn't idle. He continued channeling the formation's power, hammering the five True Immortals with devastating strikes. The wounded one immediately ducked behind the other four. Comrades-in-arms, after all — the four shielded him from the barrage, though the force drove them all backward.

This attack was visibly stronger than before. Through the wounded True Immortal, Qin Jiang had gotten a good read on their limits. His strikes grew sharper and more precise. As long as he didn't exceed the force of that earlier blow, their bodies should remain intact.

'And here I thought True Immortals were supposed to be strong,' Qin Jiang mused.

When that True Immortal had charged him, he'd only meant to knock the man back. But erring on the side of caution, he'd used a touch more power than necessary — and nearly obliterated him outright.

Pathetic.

After thoroughly pummeling all five True Immortals with the formation, he grew bored of playing with them. He calibrated the force to exactly the level that had crippled the first one and delivered a full serving to each of the remaining four.

The eruption of power shook the entire Chaos District.

On the women's battlefield, combat froze for an instant as all eyes were drawn toward the explosion. The five True Immortals' subordinates felt their hearts sink. Their leaders weren't dead... were they?

Qing Chan and the others glanced over, then refocused on their own fight. Yan Shiya seized another opening and cut down a second Human Immortal.

The enemy's morale collapsed. Every one of these cultivators had clawed their way to the immortal path through countless tribulations. Now that they could finally enjoy life, none of them wanted to die. Many were already thinking of retreat. But with Qing Chan and Dao Zhen — two True Immortals — watching like hawks, escape was impossible.

When the dust settled on the other side, all five True Immortals were on their knees, bodies swaying, auras guttering.

They were devastated.

"How can he be this strong..." they murmured, staring up at Qin Jiang in disbelief. They couldn't withstand even a single blow. Worse, they could feel it — this wasn't even his limit. Could the formation truly reach Immortal King-level power?

Qin Jiang didn't stop. He needed them dead before he'd feel secure. Who knew what trump cards a True Immortal might be hiding? He swept his arm. Nearly all of the formation's remaining power converged, a preemptive wall against any death throes.

The five True Immortals felt the crushing pressure descend. They staggered to their feet, forcibly circulating their spiritual energy. They couldn't heal, but they could suppress their injuries long enough for one final burst.

"We miscalculated," one of them said. One wrong step, and they'd truly die here. With only Qing Chan and Dao Zhen opposing them, their five-man alliance should have been overwhelming. But nobody had expected an unremarkable Great Emperor to control a formation like this. Was this An Xihe's trump card? They scowled. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the Celestial Formation Fairy's name had resounded throughout Azure Cloud Heaven. She'd held off all of Azure Cloud Heaven single-handedly. And now she'd constructed a killing formation of this magnitude. Truly worthy of her title.

The five True Immortals mistakenly attributed the formation to An Xihe.

"No matter how strong she is, she wasn't an Immortal King when she laid this formation. As long as it isn't Immortal King-grade, the five of us together should be able to break through."

"Break through? And then what about the Celestial Formation Fairy? She's on the verge of actually reaching Immortal King. Once she does, we'll be annihilated."

"We can't worry about that now! If we don't break out, we die here. Besides, Qing Chan and Dao Zhen managed to reconcile with her — maybe we can too."

"If we reconcile, our status will plummet. We'd be taking orders from her."

"Staying alive comes first!"

The longer one lived, the more one feared death — especially at their level. They had everything: power, authority, comfort. None of them wanted to lose it.

They suppressed their injuries. For a brief window, they could still fight at full strength. This time, it was to escape.

What they didn't know was that the formation was genuine Immortal King-grade.

Escape? Qin Jiang had other ideas.

"Trying to run?"

He read their intent and smiled. A desperate counterattack might actually be threatening, but fleeing? They'd lost any chance of that.

The Immortal King Killing Formation gathered its full power. Simultaneously, the five True Immortals erupted with everything they had. United, they threw their combined might against the formation's barrier.

It was annihilated. Their attack didn't even raise a ripple.

Five faces went blank. A wave of obliterating power rushed toward them.

It was already point-blank.
