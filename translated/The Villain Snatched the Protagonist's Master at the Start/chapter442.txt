It took Xue Yue a while to process. When she did, she remembered — this man had been the one threatening her with Huaxia's might all along. All those terrifying stories about Huaxia's brutality and ruthlessness had come straight from the person who made the rules.

She pouted at him. "So everything you told me — that was just to scare me?"

"Not exactly." He shook his head. "Everything I said was true. Under Huaxia's rules, you'd be dead as a core member of the Anti-Huaxia Alliance, and the Blood Tribe would be implicated. The reality might even be bloodier than what I described." He smiled. "But I'm the one who made those rules. So I'm the only one who can break them. And from the moment I laid eyes on you, I decided I'd break them for you."

She heard almost none of it. Only the last part registered — he'd decided to break his own rules for her from the very first moment.

Her cheeks warmed. "So it was love at first sight?"

"No."

"Huh?"

He lifted her chin and gazed into her eyes. "I'd already claimed you as mine before I ever saw you. Why do you think I came to this backwater? I came for you. So it wasn't love at first sight — it was love before first sight, and desire the moment I saw you."

"What do you mean, 'desire'?"

He raised an eyebrow and pulled her closer, letting her feel exactly what he meant.

She let out a soft sound, hands braced against his chest. "Stop..."

He chuckled. "Now you know."

She nodded breathlessly. "I get it. But you were so mean at first — scaring me like that."

"If I hadn't been tough, would you have listened? Back then, every other word out of your mouth was 'Nangong Yun.' You think I didn't have reason to be stern?"

She lowered her gaze. He was right — she'd been completely fixated on Nangong Yun. Looking back, it felt like she'd been under some kind of spell.

She wrapped her arms around him, swaying gently. "I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me back then. It was like I was being controlled. But now — you're the only one I love." She kissed him and whispered, "Husband, let Yueyue make it up to you."

"Make it up how?"

He regarded the blushing beauty in his arms and licked his lips.

As for her mention of feeling "controlled" — that was the protagonist's halo at work. Near Qin Jiang, the halo lost its effect and her mind cleared. Though "cleared" was relative — around him, her intelligence dipped a bit lower thanks to the villain's aura. Made her look adorably foolish. Made him want to bully her.

"How will you compensate me?" he teased. "You did hurt my feelings."

"I'm sorry," she said again, gazing up at him with glistening eyes. "I'll only love you from now on. Okay?"

She peppered his face with kisses, then affectionately stroked his hair. "There, there. Don't be sad anymore."

"Where's my compensation?"

She stood, face burning. A soft pop made her blush deepen. She knelt before him and whispered, "Husband, Yueyue is hungry."

He chuckled, ruffled her hair, and indulged her. "Little glutton. You say you're compensating me, but really you just want me to cook for you."

"Doesn't husband want to feed Yueyue?"

"Hmph — I want to eat! I want husband's home cooking!"

"Fine, fine. I'll cook for you. Fill you right up."

The fire had been lit for a while, the ingredients ready — it just needed a bit more preparation. Xue Yue threw herself into helping, hands working eagerly, though inexperience made her clumsy.

He guided her patiently, and she caught on fast. "Like this?"

"Perfect. Keep going."

After what felt like ages, she wiped the sweat from her brow. "Is it done yet?"

"Hungry?"

"Mm."

"Almost. But it's best served hot — be ready."

"I'm ready!"
