"Huh? What's going on with that Chen Changsheng?"

"He's the first one to mess up. I thought he was supposed to be a dark horse—looks like we overestimated him."

"I said it before. At his age, producing Saint-grade pills is already his ceiling. Making the top hundred was just a fluke—he's nothing but a seat-warmer."

"His mental state is off."

The elders offered their critiques.

The Pill Emperor overheard and glanced down, then shook her head. That level of alchemy confirmed it beyond any doubt—he wasn't her master.

Just then, warmth brushed her cheek. She turned instinctively toward Qin Jiang—

And their lips met.

The spectator stands erupted.

"Holy—did I just see what I think I saw?! That young man and the Pill Emperor just kissed!"

"K-kissed?!"

"I saw it too! Clear as day!"

"My goddess has fallen into another man's arms! Why couldn't it be me?!"

"My pure, untouchable divine maiden... defiled... I can't..."

"Forget the Pill Emperor—doesn't anyone else think that young man is ridiculously handsome?"

"Ew..."

"Ahem, just to clarify—I don't swing that way!"

The Pill Emperor heard every word. She jerked back, face burning crimson. "Qin Jiang, show some restraint!"

All these people watching—how mortifying.

The elders coughed diplomatically and fixed their gazes elsewhere.

Qin Jiang grinned, shoulders lifting. "I didn't expect you to turn your head. I was just going for your cheek..."

The Pill Emperor glared daggers at him. 'Blaming me for your move? Unbelievable.'

She huffed and tried to put some distance between them, but one hand remained firmly captured in his grip. Her hand was soft and delicate—warm, smooth, and impossible to let go of.

A heavy thud echoed from the plaza below, drawing all eyes.

"Him again?" The Pill Emperor frowned.

First a failed batch, and now a full-blown furnace explosion?

This was the Grand Refinement. How had he even made the final hundred?

Chen Changsheng's face was pitch black—literally, coated in soot from the detonation.

He stood before the ruins of his furnace, breathing deeply: 'Calm down. You have to stay calm.'

The crowd's outburst had shattered his concentration. He'd looked up, seen Qin Jiang and the Pill Emperor flirting, and completely lost control. The furnace had blown.

A chorus of boos rained down from the stands. Fortunately, ten lifetimes of willpower let him regain his composure quickly.

He looked up at the platform. Qin Jiang and the Pill Emperor were still at it. He exhaled a long, turbid breath, forcibly extinguishing every emotion. His expression went cold and flat.

The Grand Refinement didn't penalize failures—only imposed a time limit. Three days. Each competitor had to produce a completed pill within three days. The final rankings would be determined by grade, quality, and potency.

But someone who'd failed twice before the first day was over had essentially kissed any shot at the Pill King title goodbye.

The elders shook their heads.

"An exploded furnace during the Grand Refinement. That's a first."

Every competitor here was a master—Saint-grade at minimum. For an alchemist of that caliber, blowing up a furnace was nothing short of humiliating.

The Pill Emperor turned to the elders, her expression icy. "How did someone like this make the final hundred?"

She'd been... preoccupied these past few days and hadn't paid attention to the Assembly. Based on what she was seeing now, she suspected someone had helped Chen Changsheng cheat his way in.

The elders squirmed. Chen Changsheng's performance had been abysmal. The crowd was already questioning his placement—which reflected poorly on the Palace itself.

"Enough." Qin Jiang waved it off. "Don't blame them. I've been monitoring the Assembly. These elders haven't shown favoritism to anyone. Chen Changsheng does have some genuine skill—he's just having an off day."

The elders shot him grateful looks.

The Pill Emperor's frosty expression thawed in his presence—she could never stay angry around him.

Still, she added coldly: "After this is over, investigate Chen Changsheng. Find out how someone with this level of alchemy infiltrated the top hundred. This is an embarrassment to our Heavenly Pill Palace."

"Yes, Palace Master," the elders answered in unison.

And in the very next moment—the atmosphere shifted.

A monstrous aura crashed down from the heavens, smothering everything in its path.
