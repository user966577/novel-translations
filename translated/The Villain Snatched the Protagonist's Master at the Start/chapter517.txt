For days on end, Nangong Yun waited with desperate hope. Whenever he had a free moment, he'd sit by the window, watching for that tall, imposing figure.

Finally, the day came.

Under the cover of night, Nangong Yun stood at the window with someone behind him. He clenched his teeth and endured silently. Then his eyes lit up—in the darkness, he spotted a familiar silhouette.

"Brother Jie..." he murmured.

The man behind him raised his hand and brought it down with a slap. "Brother Jie? Call me Brother Gun!"

"Ah!" Nangong Yun cried out in pain, his eyes instantly misting over. Not from the sting, but because Brother Jie had come for him. He finally had a chance to escape this hell.

But the man behind him hadn't heard the name Nangong Yun had whispered and was displeased. He raised his hand again and struck hard. "I said call me Brother Gun! You hear me?"

Nangong Yun's body trembled. He glanced back, murder flickering in his eyes. But he couldn't blow his cover now. If he did, not only would he fail to escape, he might drag Brother Jie down with him. Clenching his fists, he forced out a soft, "Brother Gun~"

"That's more like it." Brother Gun laughed and then, as was his habit, raised his hand and gave Nangong Yun several more slaps, leaving a pained grimace on his face.

Nangong Yun turned away, gritting his teeth, silently enduring it while waiting for Brother Jie. His submissive posture only excited Brother Gun further, who kept swinging his hand and striking Nangong Yun, venting the darkness in his twisted heart.

But in the middle of this brutal display, a shadow appeared silently behind Brother Gun. A blade pierced through the back of his skull. In that instant, even his Primordial Spirit was shattered.

Brother Gun's eyes bulged. He tried to turn and look, but it was too late. Under the newcomer's control, he collapsed gently to the floor without making a sound.

It was Brother Jie. He'd slipped into the room and spotted Brother Gun abusing Nangong Yun the moment he entered. Enraged, he'd killed the man on the spot.

In the darkness, he took in the handprints covering Nangong Yun's body, his eyes full of heartache. "Little Yun, I'm here."

"Brother Jie~" Tears streamed down Nangong Yun's face as his legs gave way beneath him. These past days had utterly drained him.

Brother Jie rushed to catch him, gently wiping away his tears. "Little Yun, I'm taking you away."

"Mm~" Nangong Yun nodded, a smile finally breaking through. He was free at last. If this had gone on much longer, he truly couldn't have held out.

"Brother Jie, how do we get out?" Nangong Yun asked.

"Don't worry about that," Brother Jie said with a confident smile. "The Zhou family guards watching you have already been lured away. We can just walk right out."

"We should still be careful," Nangong Yun warned.

Brother Jie nodded. "I know."

With that, he scooped Nangong Yun into his arms and leaped from the window, vanishing into the night.

Meanwhile, in the room they'd just left, several figures appeared. They were the Zhou family's powerhouses. Watching the two flee into the darkness, they made no move to pursue. Instead, they breathed a collective sigh of relief.

"Finally got rid of him."

"I still don't understand what the Manor Lord was thinking. Going to all this trouble over a single Nangong Yun. Why not just kill him?"

"Enough. The Manor Lord's orders are ours to follow."

"I just think it's pointless."

"Hmph. You think you're smarter than the Manor Lord? He has his reasons. If you can't figure them out, just shut up and follow orders. Keep running your mouth and one day it'll get you killed."

They muttered among themselves for a moment before disappearing as well.

On the other side of the city, Brother Jie and Nangong Yun zigzagged through alleys and side streets, doubling back again and again. Finally, they arrived at a secluded little courtyard.

Once inside, Brother Jie set Nangong Yun down and exhaled with relief. "No one followed us. I think we're safe."

"Brother Jie, thank you." Nangong Yun could barely contain his emotions. He'd finally, truly escaped that hell.

Brother Jie waved it off, gazing at Nangong Yun with deep tenderness. "No need to be so polite with me. Meeting you is my good fortune. From now on, the two of us can truly be together."

"Brother Jie, I..." Nangong Yun's heart clenched. He'd only intended to use Brother Jie to escape the Zhou family's clutches. But now, looking into Brother Jie's eyes—so full of genuine affection—a pang of guilt shot through him. He felt as though he'd tainted the man's sincerity.

After everything he'd been through, after being transformed into a woman and enduring all of this, Nangong Yun had begun to change. He'd become somewhat feminized despite himself.

Under Brother Jie's steady gaze, Nangong Yun lowered his head, torn between conflicting emotions.

Brother Jie reached out and ruffled his hair, smiling warmly. "Little Yun, I know what happened to you—that you were forced into this. I know you don't actually like me. But I'm still willing to give everything for you."

His voice was unbearably gentle. Nangong Yun looked up, a flicker of genuine emotion in his eyes. He opened his mouth to explain, but in the end said nothing, managing only a bitter smile.

Brother Jie wasn't upset. His hand slid from Nangong Yun's head to his cheek, giving it a light pinch. "The Zhou family will come looking for you. For now, stay here. I'll go scout things out, and when the time is right, I'll smuggle you out of the city. From there, you can go wherever you want. As long as you're careful, the Zhou family will have a hard time finding you."

He turned to leave, but Nangong Yun instinctively reached out and grabbed his arm. Alone, he felt profoundly unsafe.

He looked at Brother Jie, face flushing, and whispered, "Brother Jie, stay with me for a while."

"Little Yun, you..." Brother Jie turned back, surprise and delight blooming across his face. "What did you say?"

"Stay with me tonight," Nangong Yun said again, his cheeks burning crimson.

Brother Jie couldn't help but swallow. In his eyes, Nangong Yun was the most beautiful person he'd ever seen.

The flush on those cheeks in the moonlight, that soft, vulnerable plea—Brother Jie didn't stand a chance. He took Nangong Yun's hand, pulled him close, swept him up into his arms, and carried him toward the bedroom.

Nangong Yun kept his head down, offering no resistance. Partly because he truly felt unsafe alone, and partly... well, it was the least he could do to thank Brother Jie. It wasn't as if it were the first time. And Brother Jie's gentleness—he had to admit, it was something he'd grown slightly fond of.
