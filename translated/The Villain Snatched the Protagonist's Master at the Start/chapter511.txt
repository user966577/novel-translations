Looking at the mischievous grin on Qin Jiang's face, Yun Bao had a pretty good idea what kind of "exercise" he meant.

Her cheeks flushed, her heart hammering. She'd mentally prepared herself before coming, but she hadn't expected Qin Jiang to move this fast. They'd barely arrived and already...

Then again, sooner or later made no difference. He'd fed her all those treasures—she really should reciprocate.

Yun Bao bit her lower lip softly and gave a shy nod. "We can try."

"Hehe, let's give it a shot then."

Qin Jiang caught her small hand and pulled her into his arms.

Yun Bao stiffened. "Can we not do this here?" she whispered.

All the sisters who'd just been feeding her treasures were still watching. Surely they wouldn't be watching for the exercise part too.

Understanding her first-time bashfulness, the women exchanged knowing smiles, called out a quick farewell, and took their leave. Soon only Qin Jiang and Yun Bao remained.

"Better?"

Qin Jiang grinned.

Yun Bao glanced around. Nobody in sight, but the wide-open space made her feel oddly exposed. Still, the sisters had all left on her account. She couldn't keep being difficult.

Shyly, she nodded, her slender form nestling against him. "Okay~"

"Don't be nervous. It's just an experiment—seeing whether exercise speeds up your digestion."

Qin Jiang smiled, gently patting her back until the tension in her body melted away.

"Plus, the exercise itself produces treasures."

"Treasures?"

Yun Bao's curiosity piqued. "What kind of treasures?"

"Hehe, you'll find out. I hope you'll like them."

"If they're treasures, I like them all."

"Then you'll definitely like these."

He wasn't lying. What came of their "exercises" genuinely aided the women's cultivation. And since Yun Bao loved treasures, she'd love this one too. Probably.

"So—does Yun Bao know how this exercise works?"

Nobody had ever taught her. She'd once glimpsed a few illustrated booklets, but her father had confiscated them before she could study the details.

"Then I'll teach you."

Qin Jiang was in his element. Teaching was his specialty—he'd lost count of how many students he'd guided. Every single one had turned out exceptional, personally verified by himself. By now, he was a seasoned veteran instructor.

"First, this exercise is meant to bring us joy. You'll understand that once we begin—I won't belabor the theory. Just remember a few key points."

"Mm~"

Yun Bao listened intently.

Qin Jiang adopted a professorial expression. "During the exercise, there are many different forms and positions. You can use whichever feels most natural, or adapt based on the situation. Of course, your repertoire and ability to improvise come with experience. Don't worry—I'll make sure we practice plenty."

"Mm~"

"Good. Enough theory. Time for the practical portion."

The stern-teacher facade cracked into a smile. Yun Bao's heart skipped, and she nodded bashfully.

Drawing her close, Qin Jiang chuckled. "Since this is your first time, we'll start with the basics, okay?"

"Okay~"

A small vibration, a cool breeze, and Yun Bao let out a startled gasp, burying her face in his chest.

"Necessary step," Qin Jiang murmured, kissing her forehead. "Unless you wear something special."

"What kind of special?"

"Want to try it?"

Judging from his grin, Yun Bao decided the "something special" was definitely improper. She shook her head.

"Your loss. But we'll revisit that later."

"Mm~"

She pressed against him, her voice small. "Can we start?"

"Eager, are we?"

It wasn't eagerness—standing there without a stitch on, she just felt terribly vulnerable.

"All right, no more teasing." Qin Jiang smiled. "But first, a proper warm-up. Jumping in cold risks injury. Let me check..."

A quick assessment, and he nodded. "Not bad. Warm enough for a first-timer, but we could do better."

"How?"

"Hehe, leave that to me."

A pause, a glance, a lick of his lips.

Hands gave way to mouth.

Before long, Qin Jiang swallowed and nodded to himself. Sufficiently warmed up. He kissed Yun Bao once more, then murmured, "Ready."

"Mm~"

Her eyes were already hazy, her answer barely conscious as she melted against him.

Scooping her up, Qin Jiang grinned. "Pay attention, Yun Bao. Class is in session."

"Mm—"

She started to respond but stiffened, her brows furrowing, eyes going wide. Her entire body went taut.

Qin Jiang held her tight, stroking her back soothingly. After a long moment, she began to relax.

He nuzzled her cheek, trailing kisses to her earlobe. "Relax, Yun Bao. Too much tension and you'll get hurt."

"Okay~"

She bit her lip, still trembling slightly. Qin Jiang kissed her deeply, and only when he felt the last of the resistance leave her body did he break away. Yun Bao lay dazed in his arms.

He let her collect herself before continuing.

A good teacher never let students learn in a fog.

"Yun Bao, ready for the next lesson?"

"Yes~"

"Good girl. This is still the most basic form, but even the basics bring plenty of joy. Enjoy the experience."
