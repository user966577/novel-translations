Bai Jingyun was torn.

But before he could decide, Qin Jiang spoke:

"Uncle Bai, let's say tomorrow. I'll arrange a sparring match. Pass the word to Lin Chen—I'll bring Susu along to watch."

With that, Qin Jiang turned and headed back toward Bai Susu's courtyard, leaving Bai Jingyun behind.

Watching his retreating figure, Bai Jingyun stood there in a daze.

"Did that brat just... order me around?"

He was the Holy Sword Sect Master! And Qin Jiang had the audacity to give him instructions?

The indignation flared, but then he remembered where he was. On someone else's turf, it was wise to keep a low profile. Besides, this brat was technically his son-in-law.

Best to be magnanimous.

Shaking his head, Bai Jingyun departed.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang returned to Bai Susu's courtyard. Seeing him, Bai Susu immediately demanded:

"What did you say to my father?"

She'd figured it out—her father's uncharacteristic behavior had to be the result of something Qin Jiang had told him. That was the only explanation for his decision to essentially hand her over.

Qin Jiang smiled faintly.

"That's not important. What's important is—your father doesn't want you anymore."

"You—"

Bai Susu's jaw dropped. This man truly had no shame!

Qin Jiang settled beside Bai Susu, capturing her hand in one smooth motion. She shook it twice, but when she couldn't break free, she gave up resisting.

Then Qin Jiang said quietly:

"Lin Chen is here too."

The words made Bai Susu stiffen. She instinctively searched Qin Jiang's expression. Seeing nothing out of the ordinary, she let out a small, internal sigh of relief.

She turned her face slightly away.

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Heh, no particular reason. I'm going to take you to see him tomorrow. You might even get to see his true face—just like the portrait I gave you."

At the mention of the portrait, Bai Susu's brows creased, a flash of distaste crossing her eyes. She snorted coldly.

"You're trying to disgust me. I don't believe a word of it! Even if Lin Chen was possessed by a Great Emperor's remnant soul, someone who reached the Great Emperor realm couldn't possibly be that ugly."

The disdain in her voice was palpable. Qin Jiang's smile turned wry. He hadn't deliberately chosen an ugly image—the Great Emperor who'd possessed Lin Chen genuinely looked like that.

Still, it seemed Bai Susu placed quite a bit of importance on appearances.

Qin Jiang touched his own face. No wonder she'd been half-hearted in her resistance earlier—his looks must have played no small part.

He sighed.

"A powerful cultivator isn't necessarily handsome. Someone like me—that's rare."

"Narcissist."

Bai Susu muttered under her breath, though she couldn't help sneaking another glance at Qin Jiang.

He really was handsome.

Forget the portrait—even Lin Chen in his current body couldn't hold a candle to Qin Jiang.

When Qin Lian'er had first brought her here, the girl had spent the entire time going on about how good-looking her brother was. As it turned out, she hadn't been exaggerating.

Qin Jiang ignored the jab.

"Tomorrow, when Lin Chen and I are standing side by side, you'll see the difference for yourself."

"You're really going to bring me to see Lin Chen?"

Bai Susu frowned.

A part of her resisted the idea. She was afraid the portrait might actually match Lin Chen's true appearance.

"Naturally."

Qin Jiang nodded.

"I've arranged a sparring match with him for tomorrow."

"A sparring match?"

Bai Susu's eyes widened.

She didn't know much about Qin Jiang's strength. She'd never once seen him display his power, and she couldn't read his cultivation—his realm was above hers.

Lin Chen, on the other hand, she knew very well. Since his meteoric rise three years ago, no one in the Holy Sword Sect's younger generation could match him.

Those who could even survive a single exchange with his sword could be counted on one hand.

"Hmph. If you spar with Lin Chen, you won't win."

Bai Susu sniffed.

"Three years ago, the very first time Lin Chen drew his sword, he'd already comprehended Sword Intent. With an Innate Sword Body, his attacks are devastatingly sharp—pure killing power. In three years under the sect's full support, he's become the undisputed number one among the younger generation. Within the sect, those who can take even one of his strikes can be counted on your fingers. Most people suspect his sword comprehension has already reached the level of Sword Force. Heh—do you really think you can beat that?"

Listening to Bai Susu rattle off Lin Chen's credentials, Qin Jiang regarded her with amusement.

"Are you... revealing Lin Chen's hand? Giving me a chance to prepare? What's the matter—worried I might lose?"

"As if!"

Bai Susu's face flushed.

"Who's worried about you? I'm just telling you—you can't beat Lin Chen!"

She hadn't even noticed that she'd gone from calling him "senior brother" to using his name directly.

Seeing her stubborn refusal to admit it, Qin Jiang swept her into his arms. Amid her startled yelp, he leaned close to her ear and spoke seriously:

"Remember this. I am your husband. You should always believe in your husband."

Held tightly against him, his warm breath tickling her ear, Bai Susu's face turned the color of a sunset. Her body went rigid, not daring to move.

After a long moment, she whispered:

"You're holding me too tight... I can't breathe..."

Qin Jiang loosened his grip slightly, then looked down at her soft, rosy lips. Unable to resist, he kissed her.

A good while later, he finally pulled back, grinning.

"Now that's what 'can't breathe' means."

Bai Susu went weak in the knees, her strength momentarily deserting her. Hearing his teasing, she shot him an exasperated look and rested her head against his chest.

After catching her breath, she looked up.

"You're really going to fight Lin Chen?"

"I already issued the challenge. As the Qin family's young patriarch, I can hardly back down. Besides, I'm the one who arranged it."

Qin Jiang shrugged, not a trace of concern on his face. A mere Lin Chen? Easy pickings.

Bai Susu fell quiet. After a pause, she mustered some strength and pushed Qin Jiang away.

"Is it because of me that you challenged Lin Chen?"

Qin Jiang gave her a surprised look. Women and their overactive imaginations.

He waved dismissively.

"You're overthinking it. I just want to test his abilities and knock him down a peg."

And maybe collect some system rewards while he was at it.

Though for something this minor, the rewards probably wouldn't be huge. Small skirmishes usually only earned Villain Points—barely worth checking.

Still, Lin Chen was a higher-ranked Child of Destiny. The haul might be decent.

Hearing his answer, Bai Susu pursed her lips. This man was just like her—stubborn and unwilling to admit anything.

Wait, why was she comparing herself to—

Bai Susu's cheeks reddened. She was annoyed with herself. She kept reminding herself that Qin Jiang was a liar, that he'd never truly care for her, and that she absolutely must not fall for him...

But by now, she had to admit it. She was already beginning to feel something.

In every conceivable way, Qin Jiang was at least Lin Chen's equal—and in most ways, he was better.
