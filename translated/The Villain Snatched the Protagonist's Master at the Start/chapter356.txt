After the battle, the women were thoroughly routed. The experience drove home a clear lesson: at their current level, they genuinely couldn't defeat Qin Jiang.

They needed to grow stronger.

Xue Mei, Ning Xue'er, and Chen Baizhe were all on the cusp of True Immortal — the recent chaos of events had delayed their breakthroughs, but now that things had settled, they were ready for seclusion. Xiao Jiu and Dan Yu, similarly, prepared to push for Human Immortal.

Lian'er was still in her clingy phase and had no plans to seclude herself. But there was no urgency — with the Space-Time Temple, time was plentiful.

The rest of the women weren't likely to see major breakthroughs in the near term, and without Huaxia Manor to manage, they were enjoying a rare stretch of leisure.

Qin Jiang, however, was busy.

Between attending to the women, he had to cultivate a new crop of powerhouses within the Qin family — enough to at least qualify for the Heavenly Domain. Thirty years wasn't long by cultivation standards. He'd need to cherry-pick the most talented and focus resources on them.

"Qin Jiang — what if we used this as the opportunity to establish Huaxia Academy?" Liu Shuwan suggested.

The Academy had been planned since Huaxia Manor's founding, but the timing had never been right. The manor was too new, and the subordinate factions' loyalty was too thin. Even if the Academy existed, they wouldn't willingly send their best talent. Forcing the issue would breed resentment — the exact opposite of what they wanted.

But now, with the Heavenly Domain's emergence and the Grand Sovereign's personal decree mentioning Qin Jiang by name, the manor's prestige had skyrocketed. If they framed the Academy as a training ground for Heavenly Domain qualification, every faction would be eager to participate.

The Qin family could also send a selection of their own talent. Competition would drive growth.

Liu Shuwan laid out her full vision. Qin Jiang nodded approvingly. "The timing is perfect."

"Then it's decided?"

"You have full authority, Wan'er. Though an academy needs a dean, and teachers..."

He stroked his chin and looked at her. "Want to be dean?"

"I think Xihe would be better. An Immortal King as dean lends the Academy real weight. And I'd like Qing Chan and Mo Mo as vice deans. As for teachers..."

"Teachers are easy. We've got plenty." Qin Jiang ticked them off on his fingers. "The Human Dao Sect, the Heavenly Pill Palace, the Fox Race, the Snake Race, plus every faction under Huaxia Manor's banner. Have each send a few powerhouses, and there's your faculty."

"That works. Having representatives from each faction teach at the Academy strengthens unity across the manor."

They ironed out the remaining details, and Liu Shuwan dispatched the announcement. Within the hour, word had spread to every corner of Huaxia Manor.

"Huaxia Academy? Selecting talented youths for Heavenly Domain training?"

"Immortal King dean, True Immortal vice deans — that's serious prestige."

"All training resources are covered by Huaxia Manor? We'd be insane not to take this deal."

"Tch, they only accept true geniuses. Wonder if my son qualifies."

"Every faction needs to send powerhouses as teachers? And there's a salary? Can I apply?"

"The requirements for teachers are steep — Ancient Emperor minimum."

Factions scrambled to respond, selecting both teacher candidates and their most promising disciples.

Then Qin Jiang realized a small problem: the Academy hadn't actually been built yet. He hadn't even picked a site.

Factions were already asking for the address so their people could report for duty.

Awkward.

"It can't be in Azure Cloud Heaven. The Academy will eventually serve all of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands," he mused.

Studying the geography, he settled on an ambitious location: the center of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands — in the Chaos itself. They'd build the Academy from nothing, in the void between worlds.

Difficult? Certainly. Troublesome? Absolutely. But Qin Jiang wasn't one to handle difficulties personally. He was the Lord of Huaxia. He gave the order; someone else could figure out the logistics.

So he dispatched the teacher contingent — over a hundred powerhouses, all Ancient Emperor or above — to the coordinates.

When they saw the location, the teachers-to-be were stunned. Building a school from scratch, in the Chaos?

Bold move.

They were headed off enthusiastically to their new posts when a follow-up message arrived: the site was selected, but the Academy itself still needed to be built. By them.

Every single powerhouse went slack-jawed.

The school wasn't even constructed yet? They'd signed up to teach, not moonlight as bricklayers!

And building in the Chaos was genuinely difficult!

Some politely pushed back. Qin Jiang ignored them.

He set a deadline: six months. Build it.

If it was "very difficult," that just meant it was hard — not impossible. Six months, or face punishment.

The powerhouses were aggrieved but didn't dare protest further. Forget the Manor Lord's identity — his wives alone could wipe the floor with all of them.

And so, the newly minted faculty rushed off to their construction site. Six months wasn't much time, and the work would be brutal, but as the Manor Lord had noted, with enough effort it was doable.

The teachers' compliance pleased Qin Jiang immensely. Now that was proper workforce attitude. Self-motivating, self-soothing, and self-directed. The perfect employee.

He sent along an encouraging message and promised generous compensation upon completion.

A grand promise to keep them going. The powerhouses felt a fresh surge of motivation as they arrived at the coordinates and began the backbreaking work of constructing Huaxia Academy from the void.
