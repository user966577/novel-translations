Qin Jiang carried Li Qingqiu straight back to the guest courtyard. Along the way, Li family disciples stared in shock. Their untouchable ice goddess — in some stranger's arms?

Under their heartbroken gazes, Qin Jiang walked with smug satisfaction. Li Qingqiu buried her face in his chest, ignoring the world — a skill she'd long mastered.

Word spread through the Li family like wildfire.

In a remote courtyard, Li Yang had just finished training. Li Qingqiu usually tested her combat power at the training grounds after a breakthrough, so he'd wandered over on the off chance of a glimpse.

Instead, he walked into a chorus of mourning.

"My goddess! How could she end up with a man?"

"I always thought our ice queen wasn't interested in men. Turns out..."

"If I'd known, I'd have gone after her myself!"

"You? Take a look in the mirror."

Li Yang's face stiffened. The Li family only had one universally acknowledged ice goddess. Taken by a man? Impossible! Besides the ancestor and a few elders, not a single male in the clan had ever gotten a word out of her — not even a glance. How could she suddenly have a man?

He grabbed a passing disciple. "Are you talking about Cousin Qingqiu?"

"Li Yang? What's a piece of trash like you doing at the training grounds?"

Contempt. As always. His fists tightened.

"And what right do you have to call our heir 'Cousin Qingqiu'? You're worthless, Li Yang. If it weren't for your bloodline, you'd have been thrown out long ago. What — is a waste like you actually harboring feelings for our heir? Ha! What a joke."

Li Yang burned. But he knew he couldn't win a fight. He breathed deep and swallowed it.

The other disciple sneered, shoved him, and walked away. Within the Li family, sparring between clansmen required mutual consent and came with penalties for violations. So Li Yang was never truly beaten — just insulted and pushed around.

"Ha ha ha, guys — Li Yang the waste actually has a thing for our ice goddess! Delusional!"

"Li Yang? That trash is dreaming if he thinks he has a shot."

"Honestly, compared to her, we're all trash."

"At least I have the self-awareness to know it. Li Yang just lives in fantasy."

"Fantasy or not, it's over. Our goddess has been claimed, and the man who did it is someone none of us can cross."

Li Yang hid in a corner and listened. It was confirmed — Cousin Qingqiu had been taken. Someone had seen them in broad daylight, Qin Jiang carrying her openly, and she'd been blushing. Others even claimed she'd kissed the man first — details and all.

Li Yang listened until rage blurred his vision. He stumbled out of the training ground, muttering. "How... this can't be real... it's fake, all fake..."

He staggered back to his courtyard in a daze and collapsed there, vacant-eyed. The Chaos Sword trembled at his waist. Three spectral figures materialized, waving a hand in front of his face. "Hey — kid!"

"Elders..."

Li Yang snapped back. He smiled bitterly at the three. "Am I really a once-in-an-eternity genius?"

"Of course!"

"Then why am I such a waste? I couldn't even stop Cousin Qingqiu from being..."

Stolen? She was never his. They'd met fewer than ten times. Never spoken once. And he'd claimed ownership? The three sword spirits exchanged helpless looks. What a delusional fool.

Li Yang's shoulders slumped. All those years driving himself forward — all for the dream that one day, Li Qingqiu would look at him. Just one look. That would have been enough. But now... what was the point?

He looked back over his life. Adored as a child, abandoned within six months of starting cultivation. Then years of mockery, failed resistance, and forced humility. Until the day he first saw Li Qingqiu.

In that moment, every sneer had gone silent. Every gaze had turned to her. And for the first time, no one was laughing at him — which meant no one was looking at him at all. Near her, he'd found peace. And then attraction.

She never noticed anyone. Her eyes held only ice. He'd deliberately put himself in her path — she'd shown no sign of registering his existence.

Over the years, he'd seen her fewer than ten times. Each meeting, barely a glimpse. Yet her image had carved itself into his soul. Everything he did revolved around her.

And now she belonged to someone else.

Li Yang — the clown. The pathetic clown crawling through the shadows.

He sat on the ground, lost and hollow. His reason for training was gone. Cousin Qingqiu had been taken. And no matter how hard he worked, he'd still be trash.
