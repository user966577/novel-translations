"She actually reeled in a big one?"

Qin Lian'er's excitement piqued his curiosity. He jumped across to the other ship, and his sister came running over, carrying something on her shoulder.

A person.

Qin Jiang's cheek twitched. What she was carrying—no, hauling—was a young woman.

Qin Lian'er deposited the woman at his feet with a giggle. "Brother—big treasure!"

She pointed proudly at the woman.

Qin Jiang stared.

"Princess!"

The armored man's panicked shout broke the silence. He rushed over and shielded the woman behind him.

"Princess?" Qin Lian'er's eyes lit up. That title was a perfect match for her brother!

Meanwhile, the system's voice echoed in Qin Jiang's mind:

【A Child of Destiny has formed a connection with the Host. One spoiler is available. View now?】

Another one had appeared.

It was clearly related to this princess. He held off on checking the plotline. Fortune heroine, he assumed—better claim her now.

The princess herself was still disoriented. When the marauders attacked, she'd hidden in her quarters. The moment the fighting stopped, she'd poked her head out to investigate—only to run straight into Qin Lian'er, who'd slung her over one shoulder without a word and trotted back out.

"Young Master, this is a princess of the Divine Dragon Empire. I trust you will show her the proper respect," the armored man said carefully.

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile. "Of course. As a show of respect, I'd like to invite Her Highness to my private chambers for a chat."

The man's jaw nearly hit the floor. Respect? Every man alive knew what that invitation meant.

He opened his mouth to protest, but Qin Jiang waved him off. "That's enough."

He snapped his fingers. Guards flooded the deck, their gazes fixed on the armored man with unmistakable menace.

Qin Jiang smiled pleasantly. "Relax. I brought them over to protect you, not threaten you. Go ahead—take over the ship."

Then he turned to the armored man. "I'm posting some of my people to ensure your safety. You don't mind, do you?"

Mind? The man's mouth twisted. As if his opinion mattered. Watching Qin Jiang's guards crudely commandeer the vessel, he thought bitterly that these people were worse than the marauders. At least marauders had professional standards—steal the goods, leave the people.

Qin Jiang's crew took everything, people included.

The princess, now grasping the situation, let her composure crack. Panic flickered in her eyes. Qin Jiang was looking at her the way a wolf looked at a lamb.

"Your Highness, shall we?"

His voice was warm, his smile gentle. Qin Lian'er rolled her eyes behind his back. A shameless scoundrel pretending to be a gentleman—he was fooling exactly no one.

Facing Qin Jiang's invitation, the princess glanced at her guard captain. Clearly, he was in no position to help.

She took a deep breath and drew herself up. "I may be only a princess, but when I travel abroad, I represent the dignity of the Divine Dragon Empire. If anything untoward befalls me, the Empire will be furious. Consider your actions carefully, Young Master."

She was banking on the Divine Dragon Empire's reputation to deter him.

It didn't work.

Qin Jiang waved his hand, and a squad of female guards—Qin Lian'er's personal entourage—surrounded the princess.

"Your Highness, please."

They spoke politely. Short of a direct order, they preferred not to force the issue. After all, they knew that once this woman entered Qin Jiang's chambers, she'd become one of their mistresses.

Better not to make a bad first impression.

"Just take her," Qin Jiang said, patience spent.

The female guards obeyed without hesitation, subduing the princess while the armored man found himself frozen in place by an invisible force.

Once the princess was aboard, Qin Jiang ordered the fleet toward the Divine Dragon Continent. Then he returned to the Void Divine Temple.

When the princess saw the gaggle of stunning women swarming around Qin Jiang, her eyes went wide. This man had that many women already? And he'd still kidnapped her?

Could he even handle all of them?

After extricating himself from the crowd, Qin Jiang led the princess to a spare room. "You'll stay here."

She lifted her gaze. She'd regained her composure, though a hint of bemusement lingered. "Those women earlier—they're all yours?"

"Problem?"

She shook her head, but her mind was racing. That many women, and every one of them looked healthy, satisfied, not a trace of neglect anywhere. Just how capable was this man?

An unexpected heat stirred inside her.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang was checking the spoilers. A few lines in, he shot the princess an odd look. He'd gotten it wrong.

She wasn't a fortune heroine at all.

She was a villain princess—one who specifically antagonized the Child of Destiny.

Of course, minor villains like her never fared well. The spoilers didn't show her ultimate fate, but every time she moved against the Child of Destiny, she failed spectacularly. Rather than gaining anything, she ended up feeding the protagonist's growth.

Knowing this, Qin Jiang regarded her with something almost like tenderness. Such a beautiful woman—how could any protagonist bear to hurt her?

At least he was softhearted enough to treat her right.

His gaze made the princess's scalp prickle. She edged away instinctively.

The reaction darkened Qin Jiang's expression. He rolled his eyes.

"Introduce yourself."

"Third Princess of the Divine Dragon Empire—Long Xin'er. Appearance: you can see for yourself. Measurements: feel free to check with your hands. Depth: measure it yourself. Age isn't important, is it? Ask whatever else you want."

The bluntness caught Qin Jiang off guard. Villains and fortune heroines really were different breeds—this one was refreshingly direct.

He had nothing else to ask. The spoilers had already told him everything he needed to know. She was an unfavored princess, nothing more. Pitiable, when you thought about it.

This particular outing had been on the Dragon Emperor's orders—every prince and princess had been commanded to search for a rare medicine for the most favored child, the Ninth Prince. Long Xin'er had drawn the short straw and run into Chaos Marauders. For a princess of the Divine Dragon Empire, her escort was laughably thin—a single Saint Realm cultivator.

Genuinely pathetic.

Qin Jiang's heart softened. He walked toward her.

"Since your introduction was lacking, I'll just have to explore the details myself. And from now on, with me by your side, you'll be the most honored woman in the entire Divine Dragon Empire."
