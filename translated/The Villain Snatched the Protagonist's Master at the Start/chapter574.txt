Dao Covenant in hand, Qin Jiang returned to the immortal ship. With this marriage contract, he'd effectively gained another wife—and she was the daughter of an Immortal Emperor, no less. Quite the strategic asset.

Not that he was in any rush to claim the betrothal. There was still an Immortal Emperor's secret realm to deal with first. It might even draw in more Children of Destiny. Of course, before opening it to the public, every treasure inside had to be extracted. An empty shell of a realm would serve his purposes just fine.

There was just one issue—Little Xu still needed a bit more time. His strength wasn't quite sufficient yet.

About a month passed.

The spatial barrier around the Immortal Emperor's secret realm had grown paper-thin. After repeated attempts, Little Xu finally managed to phase through without damaging the realm itself.

Half a month later, Little Xu emerged, practically bouncing with excitement. He presented every last treasure to Qin Jiang.

Not bad at all—several Immortal Emperor-grade treasures among them. But Qin Jiang suspected the realm still held something bigger, something an ordinary person wouldn't be able to find. Only a Child of Destiny would have the fortune to uncover and claim the true prize.

He gave the haul a cursory look and waved his hand. "Pick a few for yourself. Toss the rest into the treasury."

"Yes, sir."

Little Xu gathered everything up—temporarily, not claiming it all—and stowed it away.

"Also, start preparations. It's time to open this realm."

Little Xu nodded, acknowledged the order, and departed.

Three days later.

Deep beneath the Dream Cloud Sea, the Immortal Emperor's secret realm—buried for untold millennia—finally emerged.

Pillars of radiant light erupted from the ocean, suffusing the entire sea and blazing across the sky. Within a radius of several million miles, every living creature turned to look. Countless powerful cultivators recognized immediately that a secret realm had surfaced, and major factions mobilized at once.

In less than half a day, the surface of the Dream Cloud Sea was packed with life. The various sea tribes appeared as well, eyeing the outsiders with undisguised hostility. They knew full well that an Immortal Emperor's secret realm wasn't something they could monopolize—attempting it would unite every major faction against them. But this was their territory, and that gave them an edge in confidence. The outsiders, for their part, had no desire to provoke the sea tribes unnecessarily. Both sides wanted the same thing.

Inside the Merfolk Royal Palace, Qin Jiang, An Xihe, and Mengjin all gazed toward the emerging realm.

"I had no idea there was an Immortal Emperor's secret realm buried in our Dream Cloud Sea," Mengjin remarked. She'd been an Immortal Emperor for years, yet never once suspected what lay beneath the ocean floor.

She turned to Qin Jiang. "This secret realm is the real reason you came to the Dream Cloud Sea, isn't it?"

"No." Qin Jiang shook his head and smiled. "I already told you—I came for you."

"As if I'd believe that." Mengjin pouted.

Qin Jiang shrugged helplessly. He spoke the truth, and nobody believed him.

Dropping the subject, he turned his attention to the surface. Countless auras churned above the sea—most of them unremarkable, but a few Immortal Kings were mixed in, likely escorting their factions' disciples. What Qin Jiang cared about most was whether any Children of Destiny had been drawn in. But with so many people, he scanned for a long time without spotting anything definitive. He gave up. No rush—any Child of Destiny would inevitably cause a commotion. If one had shown up, the signs would become obvious soon enough.

The realm hadn't fully opened yet. The gathered masses waited, their numbers swelling by the hour. Numerous factions with Immortal Emperor backing had sent disciples. Mengjin dispatched the Third Elder to maintain order—without authority present, any eruption of conflict would hurt the sea tribes most.

The wait wasn't long.

After just three days, a thunderous boom rolled up from the ocean floor. A massive whirlpool formed on the surface, churning the water until it coalesced into a colossal human figure. The water-formed silhouette towered over three thousand feet, its features indistinct, but the pressure radiating from it made everyone hold their breath.

A moment of silence. Then the enormous figure lowered its gaze upon the gathered multitude. Its mouth opened, and a booming voice echoed across the sea:

"I am the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor! Unmatched in my era, I created the Heavenly Waters Thirty-Six Strikes—a technique that transcends Immortal Emperor methods. At full mastery, it renders one invincible among peers. With this technique, I once slew an Immortal Emperor with a single strike! Those with the affinity may enter my realm and claim my legacy!"

A beat of silence. Then the crowd erupted with excitement, every eye burning with anticipation. Each person harbored the conviction that they would be the one chosen.

Down in the Royal Palace, Qin Jiang spared the display a glance and muttered: "What a load of bull."

"Hey—don't get distracted. I'm almost there!" An Xihe whined.

Qin Jiang pulled his gaze back to her, grinned, and said: "Want me to pick up the pace?"

"Yes~"

An Xihe nodded.

Nearby, Mengjin's cheeks flushed pink. She was still waiting her turn—it should come soon, since An Xihe was nearly finished. But the anticipation was agonizing. They were taking too long. She could barely stand it.

Taking a deep breath, Mengjin lifted her head and stared at the giant water figure, trying to distract herself. That said, Qin Jiang had a point. This self-proclaimed Great Emperor was full of it. Transcended Immortal Emperor methods? Killed an Immortal Emperor in one strike? As a fellow Immortal Emperor, she knew everyone at that level had trump cards. Being killed in a single blow? Please.

Mengjin's internal monologue continued, but her hand moved on its own, finding its mark with unerring precision—a habit Qin Jiang had taught her. She frowned slightly. This distraction technique wasn't working. She still wanted it.

Just then, she heard An Xihe cry out. Mengjin's eyes lit up—finally, her turn. She turned just in time to see Qin Jiang approaching. Her cheeks flushed as she threw herself into his arms, and he caught her effortlessly.

He leaned down to kiss her lips, then smiled. "Couldn't wait, huh?"

"Mm~ I need you~"
