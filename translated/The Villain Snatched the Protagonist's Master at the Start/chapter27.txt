"You called me here just to see this?"

Yan Shiya's voice was frigid.

Yan Yun's cheeks flushed as she shot Qin Jiang a reproachful look.

Qin Jiang smiled faintly:

"Of course not."

He appraised Yan Shiya, nodded in satisfaction, and said:

"I can help you get your revenge."

The words landed like a thunderbolt. Yan Shiya's eyes flashed. Yan Yun's body went stiff.

"I know that you and your niece aren't from the Heavenly Mystery Continent. You came here to escape your pursuers while building up your strength, hoping that one day you'd be able to take revenge.

But with your abilities, even ten thousand years might not be enough."

Yan Shiya glanced at Yan Yun. Their identities were a secret known only to themselves—never revealed to anyone.

"Don't look at her. She didn't tell me."

Qin Jiang smiled:

"When the Qin family wants to investigate something, there's very little we can't uncover."

Yan Shiya's eyes showed a flicker of shock. She stared at Qin Jiang in silence for a moment before speaking:

"It seems everyone has underestimated the Qin family."

Qin Jiang chuckled. The Qin family couldn't actually have uncovered the identities of these two—but through his spoilers, he knew everything.

This world wasn't limited to the Heavenly Mystery Continent.

It encompassed the Nine Heavens, Ten Lands, and Three Thousand Realms. The Nine Heavens were the nine most powerful continents—places where Great Emperors were commonplace, and beings even beyond Great Emperor existed.

Below the Nine Heavens were the Ten Lands—ten continents second only in power.

The Heavenly Mystery Continent was one of the Ten Lands.

Generally speaking, Great Emperors could be found among the Ten Lands as well. But the Heavenly Mystery Continent had experienced a cataclysmic war between Emperors, supposedly fought over a supreme treasure.

The war had raged for centuries, nearly shattering the continent. And when it ended, the unthinkable had happened—every Great Emperor on the continent had vanished.

To this day, the Heavenly Mystery Continent hadn't recovered to its former glory.

The Qin family's three Great Emperor ancestors had also disappeared during that war, leaving behind only a single Emperor weapon.

Based on the state of that weapon, the Qin elders speculated that the three Great Emperors might not have perished but were trapped somewhere.

Of course, that was merely a guess.

And even if they were trapped, the Qin family had no way to help—after all, if Great Emperors couldn't escape, what hope did lesser cultivators have?

Setting that aside—

Yan Yun and Yan Shiya hailed from one of the Nine Heavens, from a powerful clan with Great Emperor ancestors of their own.

The reason they'd fallen to the Heavenly Mystery Continent was clan infighting—similar to the Ye family's situation, but far more brutal.

The losing side had been nearly exterminated.

Only the two of them had escaped, secretly building their strength on the Heavenly Mystery Continent. Unfortunately, with their abilities alone, the hope of revenge was nonexistent.

Their situation mirrored Ye Xuan's—both victims of failed clan power struggles. This was precisely why, in the original plotline, they'd sympathized with each other and joined forces.

Within a year of the story, the aunt and niece had provided enormous help to Ye Xuan. Less than a year after meeting him, they'd even revealed their true origins.

Whether that was trust in Ye Xuan, simple naivety, or perhaps the intelligence-dampening aura of the Child of Destiny at work—was anyone's guess.

But if not for that, Qin Jiang would never have known their backgrounds.

"Since you know where we come from, you must also know what enemies we face?"

Yan Shiya said.

Qin Jiang nodded:

"Naturally."

Seeing his composure, Yan Shiya pressed:

"Our enemies include Great Emperor-level beings—and more than one. Are you certain the Qin family is willing to provoke enemies of that caliber?"

"So what if they're Great Emperors?"

Qin Jiang scoffed, brimming with confidence:

"You have no idea how powerful my family truly is."

Yan Shiya's heart trembled. For a moment, his sheer confidence was overwhelming.

Could the Qin family really be that terrifying?

But on paper, the Qin family didn't seem to have any Great Emperors...

If the Qin ancestors could hear him right now, they'd be screaming: 'Don't drag us into your bluffing!'

Yan Shiya took a deep breath and glanced at Yan Yun. Regardless, her niece was already committed. The Qin family's power could at least be leveraged.

At the very least, the Qin family was far stronger than the two of them alone.

"You must have other conditions."

Yan Shiya said.

Qin Jiang nodded:

"Of course. I'm quite interested in you as well."

Yan Shiya's expression turned frosty:

"Forget it."

She'd already given up her niece—and now he wanted her too?

Absolutely not. This deal was too lopsided.

"You're at the Unity Realm, correct?"

Qin Jiang asked.

Yan Shiya's talent was quite impressive. She was roughly Ye Lingtian's age—possibly younger—yet stronger than him.

In an assassination, she could take Ye Lingtian's life with a single strike.

Yan Shiya nodded. At her age, reaching the Unity Realm made her a certified prodigy.

"Decent talent, but still a long way from Great Emperor."

Qin Jiang shook his head.

Yan Shiya knew this well. Without extraordinary fortune, her chances of reaching Great Emperor were almost nil:

"You can help me?"

The question slipped out before she could stop it.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded, producing a scroll. Yan Shiya watched curiously—could Qin Jiang really help her reach Great Emperor?

"What is this?"

Qin Jiang unfurled the scroll, revealing an exquisite painting. Within it, seven positions stood empty, each seeming to outline a woman's silhouette.

"The Seven Beauties Painting. If you become one of the Seven Beauties, you can reach the Supreme Realm in a short time."

Supreme Realm!

And beyond Supreme... was Great Emperor.

Yan Shiya's eyes lit up, but she quickly furrowed her brow:

"There must be restrictions."

"Correct. Once you become one of the Seven Beauties, you'll obey my commands unconditionally. If I die, you die.

But the benefits are substantial. As long as I live, you can never truly perish. And when I eventually ascend to Great Emperor, you'll ascend alongside me!"
