The next day, the Pill Emperor brought Dan Yu to visit.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. Spotting Dan Yu winking frantically at him behind the Pill Emperor's back, he put two and two together—the Pill Emperor's visit was likely the girl's doing.

"Have a seat," he said with a smile.

Only the three of them were in the parlor. The other women were still resting.

Without an audience, the Pill Emperor relaxed slightly—though the memory of what Dan Yu had said the night before still made her pulse quicken. And seeing Qin Jiang again stirred something new. Where yesterday there had been anger and confusion, today there was nervousness... and a sliver of shyness.

In her previous life, theirs had been a bond of master and disciple. Yesterday had brought fury and heartbreak. But today...

Two delicate feelings, trembling beneath the surface.

After the women sat, Qin Jiang poured tea for both of them and asked with a grin, "What brings you here?"

The Pill Emperor nodded. She looked at Qin Jiang, opened her mouth—and realized she didn't know what to call him.

Keep calling him "Master"?

That wasn't impossible, but if the man was openly lusting after her, and she was already entertaining certain... ideas, then calling him "Master" felt distinctly wrong.

Qin Jiang read her hesitation and offered: "In this life, my name is Qin Jiang. Just call me by my name. As for the past—one lifetime of reincarnation means one lifetime put to rest. Each life is a fresh start for me."

He paused, meeting her eyes with open admiration. "Last time around, we were master and disciple. This time... starting over as dao companions wouldn't be so bad."

The Pill Emperor's cheeks turned pink. "You've changed so much," she said quietly.

Her face colored—his directness was overwhelming.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Like I said—every life is a new beginning."

'Changed a lot? Try completely different.'

He wasn't Chen Changsheng. That man was a fraud—a hypocrite who secretly harbored desires for his own disciple but spent an entire lifetime pretending otherwise.

The Pill Emperor nodded slowly. "Then... I'll use your name from now on."

"Of course."

Qin Jiang agreed readily. He wasn't Chen Changsheng and had no intention of letting the Pill Emperor pine for some other man while being with him. He was no cuckold.

"So—what's the occasion?"

The Pill Emperor glanced at Dan Yu, then spoke. "Nothing major. I wanted to invite you to stay in the Heavenly Pill Palace. The Myriad Pill Assembly begins in three days, and I was hoping you'd attend."

"Stay in the Palace?" Qin Jiang's brow rose. Then he smiled and nodded. "Sure. But if I remember right, you have a private courtyard. I'll just stay with you."

"What?" The Pill Emperor's eyes widened. No man had ever set foot in her courtyard, let alone moved in. Before she could object, Qin Jiang declared: "It's decided."

Two hours later, Qin Jiang and his entourage were installed in the Heavenly Pill Palace.

Watching everyone make themselves completely at home, the Pill Emperor felt oddly displaced. This was her residence, yet somehow she felt like the outsider. The only comfort was that Dan Yu remained by her side, keeping her from feeling entirely out of place.

But the moment night fell, even that lifeline was severed. Qin Jiang summoned Dan Yu.

The Pill Emperor watched Dan Yu walk away and felt her last thread of composure snap.

She knew exactly what Qin Jiang was doing in there.

An itch she couldn't scratch bloomed somewhere behind her sternum. She stared at the door to Qin Jiang's room, her expression shifting between resolve and uncertainty.

She stood there, frozen, for the entire night. The Pill Emperor didn't sleep a wink.

---

The next morning, well past sunrise, Qin Jiang's door finally opened.

He stepped out. In a stolen glance, the Pill Emperor caught sight of the scene inside and immediately averted her eyes.

Qin Jiang walked over to her. His face wore a gentle smile, and with the ease of someone who'd rehearsed the move a thousand times, he took her hand in his.

"You were out here all night?"

The Pill Emperor stiffened. She tried to shake free, but his grip only tightened. The more she pulled, the firmer he held.

Her lips pressed together. She looked at him, and a quiet thought surfaced: 'Might as well start getting used to this.'

She stopped resisting.

"Mm," she murmured with a small nod.

"How about... I keep you company tonight?"

The Pill Emperor shook her head frantically. She was trying to be open-minded, but not that quickly.

"No—absolutely not."

Qin Jiang wasn't surprised by the rejection—but he wasn't about to give up either.

He pulled her hand and drew her into his arms.

The Pill Emperor's face erupted in scarlet. Her mind scattered.

She hadn't prepared for this at all.

From their very first meeting to this moment, this was the first time they'd been truly alone.
