Nangong Yun gritted his teeth and leaped into the void space.

Inside, he found an endless desert under searing heat — so intense his spiritual energy nearly ignited on contact. But his expression was pure joy. His constitution was naturally yang-aligned, and he thrived in environments like this. The extreme heat would even accelerate his cultivation.

"Heaven is on my side!" he murmured.

Void spaces were essentially small worlds. Some formed naturally, but most were carved out by powerful cultivators. A Human Immortal could create a stable one; this particular world was stable, rich with spiritual energy, and meticulously crafted — likely the work of a True Immortal. And worlds like this often contained hidden treasures.

Treasure could wait. Recovery first, then breakthrough.

He found the hottest spot in the desert and sat down. Fire-attribute energy poured into his body, healing his wounds at a visible pace. In less than a day, he was whole again.

"Time to become a Great Emperor."

For ordinary cultivators, the step above Nine Tribulations Supreme was half-Emperor. But for a true genius, there was no such thing as half-Emperor — they went straight to Great Emperor. Nangong Yun had the foundation and the talent.

"Wait for me. Once I break through, I'll collect some interest for my brothers first!" His voice was cold. He had full confidence that as a Great Emperor, he could kill anyone at the same level. The Zhou family's Great Emperors who'd slaughtered his Alliance — he'd take a few of their heads as a down payment. As for the rest of the debt, that could wait. But it would be repaid in full.

He closed his eyes and began.

While Nangong Yun pushed toward Great Emperor, Qin Jiang was pushing toward something far higher — Human Immortal. Mu Yunxiao was already at that level, though her body's ice-fire imbalance had previously prevented her from wielding her full power. Now, with Qin Jiang's help, the balance was steadily restoring, and her cultivation was climbing rapidly. He estimated that once fully recovered, she could attempt True Immortal.

She finished refining the treasure, opened her eyes, and gazed at him tenderly. "Shall we continue?"

"Can you handle more?"

She considered for a moment, then nodded. "I think so."

"Then let's refine a bit more."

Her arms wound around his neck, and she settled softly against his chest. Over these past days, she'd come to understand him better and had gradually started believing what he'd told her. The scoundrel had been deliberately scaring her — just to bully her, maybe to see her cry. A total villain.

But whenever she actually broke down sobbing, he'd hold her and comfort her until she calmed. If only one eye was crying, though, he seemed to get excited. He'd watch intently. She'd lost count of how many times she'd cried. Practically every moment at his side was spent teary-eyed, with plenty of full-blown sobbing sessions mixed in.

Right now, she felt like having a good cry — let him see what she was made of.

Qin Jiang held her, brow raised. "Xiao Xiao's crying again."

"Hmph, and whose fault is that?" She pouted.

He laughed. "Seems like I haven't been thorough enough — that's barely a few tears. You need to really cry to showcase my skills."

"I don't want to!" She shook her head vigorously.

Qin Jiang understood perfectly. He resumed without mercy, and within half an hour, she was weeping openly. He held her and soothed her until she settled, face flushed from the tears.

She looked at him shyly. "Can I have the treasure now?"

"Not quite enough yet. How about... one more round of crying?"

"No!" She shook her head vigorously.

He took that as his cue and continued. She glared, small hands pushing against his chest. "I said no!"

"I understand! Women always mean the opposite. You say no, you mean yes. I get it."

She gaped at him. The first time, sure — she'd meant yes. But right now she genuinely didn't want more. Not that this scoundrel would listen.

With a resigned look, she gave in. A full two hours later, through a haze of tears, he finally relented and delivered the treasure.

She still needed to refine it, absorbing the fire-attribute energy with his help. "Your ice and fire should be nearly balanced now?" he asked.

She nodded. "Almost. But if my cultivation rises further, the gap will widen again. The ice origin grows faster." His treasure was more effective than fire-attribute medicines, but it couldn't solve the problem permanently.

"That's a minor issue." He smiled. "We'll be together from now on. Whenever your cultivation improves, I can immediately compensate the fire-origin gap."

"Together... always?" Her eyes brightened.

He nodded and pulled her close. "Always."

"But I heard there are other sisters you haven't brought along. Isn't that separation?"

He looked off in a particular direction. "Not really. They're all keeping tabs on me right now. I can feel their eyes." He flashed a grin and waved at thin air.

"They're watching? Right now?" Mu Yunxiao went scarlet, suddenly feeling invisible eyes on her from every direction.

"Not all of them. Maybe a hundred or so."

She buried her face in his chest, mortified. "I'm embarrassed!"

He patted her back. "You're all sisters. It's fine. Wasn't it the same when you were with Lian'er and the others?"

She kept her head buried, voice muffled. He chuckled and rubbed her back until she eventually surfaced. He pinched her cheek. "Don't overthink it. Let's refine the treasure. I'll help."

"Okay."
