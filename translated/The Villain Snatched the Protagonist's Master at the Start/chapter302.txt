With the harvest complete, Qin Jiang handed all the Great Emperor and Ancient Emperor-grade laws over to Black Dragon. At this point, laws of that caliber were beneath his notice — Azure Cloud Heaven was swimming in Great Emperors, and acquiring their laws was trivial. He let Black Dragon handle the distribution.

Qin Jiang himself sought out Liu Shuwan to discuss allocating the immortal-path laws. "What's going on, hubby?" Liu Shuwan didn't mind the interruption to her cultivation. She hooked her arm through his and pulled him toward their room, eyes smoldering. She'd been planning to drain Qin Jiang dry, but once the great formation activated and the Chaos District's spiritual energy surged to unprecedented levels, she'd given him a reprieve to focus on cultivation.

The pressure on her was mounting. After arriving in the Central Regions and seeing the caliber of women at Qin Jiang's side — Human Immortals, True Immortals, all orbiting the same man — she felt increasingly ordinary despite having stepped onto the immortal path herself. She needed to push harder.

Still, effort was effort, and when Qin Jiang needed her, she would never refuse. Besides, she'd been cultivating for over two weeks without him and was far from satisfied. Now that he'd come to her on his own — letting him escape would be criminal.

Qin Jiang had come to discuss immortal-path laws, but faced with Liu Shuwan's enthusiasm, he decided the laws could wait. There were more pressing matters to attend to first.

"Hubby, I'm hungry..."

Liu Shuwan pouted, her eyes shimmering as her fingers traced his chest. He pulled her close and licked his lips. "I'll feed you. But after you're full, you feed me."

"Deal."

She nodded, cheeks flushed. Against Liu Shuwan, Qin Jiang found himself on the receiving end for once — and her appetite was no joke. One helping after another, it took nearly half a day before she was anywhere close to satisfied.

Liu Shuwan's eyes curved with delight as she ran her tongue across her lips. She nestled against him. "Want me to feed you now?"

"Is there anything left?" He glanced at her. She'd gotten a bit overeager earlier and lost some of what she'd taken in. Wasted.

She huffed proudly. "Of course! I've got plenty."

This was nothing. She might not be confident about filling him up completely, but she could at least make sure he didn't go thirsty.

"Then... feed me?"

She nodded, blushing, and began. Several more hours passed. She was flagging, and seeing that he still looked unsatisfied, she gritted her teeth. The man was insatiable.

"All gone?"

He looked up. He wasn't full yet.

She shot him a look, pulled him upright, and wiped a trace of residue from his face. "That's it. If you're still hungry, go find the other girls."

Qin Jiang smacked his lips. Still not full. Each woman had a different flavor, and mixing them together had its own appeal — but right now, he preferred Liu Shuwan's. He held her close and kissed her cheek. "Then rest a while. Once you've recovered, make me some more. I like yours best."

"Rascal..." She blushed, curling against him. She was genuinely tired, and within moments of closing her eyes, she was fast asleep.

Just then, a system notification chimed. Qin Jiang pulled up the interface, and surprise flickered across his face. Chen Wuming was dead? He'd actually gotten caught in the crossfire?

With that scrawny body of his, dragged into a battleground between Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng... he'd probably been battered to death. A grim way to go.

Chen Wuming's death naturally came with rewards. One item in particular caught Qin Jiang's eye.

"The Yin-Yang Law!"

He'd been contemplating whether to try comprehending it on his own just recently. Now the system had handed it to him directly. Truly thoughtful.

"System, I really do love you."

The system didn't respond. She'd heard his sweet talk before. He only loved her when she gave him good rewards. If the prize didn't meet his expectations, complaints followed instantly. The man could flip faster than a page. Still... the flattery was nice to hear.

And so —

【Ding — critical bonus triggered. Reward: Kidney Treasure Pill formula upgrade.】

Not the biggest prize, but Qin Jiang was thrilled. He loved this reward. He pulled up the formula eagerly — it had been upgraded several times already. This latest version reduced the ingredient tier requirements and used creative combinations to achieve even better results. With this, he could go back to popping Kidney Treasure Pills like candy.

He tucked away the formula with satisfaction, then reviewed the rest of the rewards. Various resources, as expected. There was also an immortal artifact, though by his standards, it was barely worth noting.

One more item stood out: the Immortal Pill Dao. He examined it — a cultivation method exclusively for alchemists. A shortcut to refining immortal-grade pills. And once an alchemist succeeded in creating immortal pills, they could use this method to break directly through to Human Immortal.

"This Immortal Pill Dao — it's perfect for Linglong."

Linglong's alchemy had been stuck just below the immortal threshold. He and she had spent time comparing notes on pill refinement, making progress but never achieving the breakthrough. He suspected she was one step away. This Immortal Pill Dao might be exactly what she needed — and if she succeeded in refining an immortal pill, she'd have a shot at breaking through to the immortal path in one leap. The Heavenly Pill Palace would grow even more powerful. Higher-quality pills would serve Qin Jiang well on the road ahead.

"Not bad — this one's quite useful."

He was satisfied. His ambitions extended beyond Azure Cloud Heaven. As he'd declared on the Divine Dragon Continent, his goal was to unify all realms. That meant war, and war demanded pills — one of the most critical military supplies. He continued scrolling through the rewards. The rest were unremarkable but perfectly adequate.

All in all, Qin Jiang was pleased. This was only Chen Wuming — the weakest of the bunch, barely a footnote. Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng were the real prizes. Those two would drop the real loot.
