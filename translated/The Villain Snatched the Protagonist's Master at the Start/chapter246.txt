Watching the group divide the spoils, Chen Changsheng fought to contain his fury. He stared coldly at them. "Can I go now?"

"Sure, sure." The old man waved him off, grinning ear to ear. "Seeing as you're so honest—here's a freebie: honesty won't get you far in this sect."

Chen Changsheng's frown deepened. The more he saw of the Human Dao Sect, the more it resembled a massive criminal enterprise. Swindling, scamming, extortion—they had the full repertoire. Was this how one of the three great powers conducted itself?

He took a breath and left, regretting his choice more with every step. He should have gone to the Limitless Holy Land. At least they had the dignity of a proper holy land. They wouldn't be like this.

'If I want to join the inner sect, I wonder what the requirements are.' He considered asking around but dreaded running into another scam artist. His eyes flickered. Subtlety would be required.

Late that night, Chen Changsheng returned to the spot where he'd been fleeced. Under a large tree, the old man was feasting on a roast chicken—bought with Chen Changsheng's money. With a cold snort, Chen Changsheng appeared behind him in a flash and knocked him unconscious with one strike. He slung the man over his shoulder and carried him to a secluded spot, then woke him up.

The old man jolted awake. "My chicken! Where's my chicken?!"

"..."

Chen Changsheng was speechless. Kidnapped and knocked out, and his first concern was the chicken. He tossed the roast chicken back. The old man clutched it to his chest, then finally took stock of his situation and eyed Chen Changsheng warily.

"You? What do you want with me?" He backed away two steps, hugging the chicken protectively. When he tried to read Chen Changsheng's cultivation, he found he couldn't. "You hid your realm earlier?"

A flash of panic crossed his face.

"Relax," Chen Changsheng said flatly. "I'm not here to hurt you."

"Then you're here to hurt the Human Dao Sect?"

"...No! I just want to know how to join the inner sect—or at least get the higher-ups' attention."

The old man's eyes darted. "What are you really after?"

"I admire the Human Dao Sect. I want to join the inner sect."

"Really?" He looked skeptical, then waved his hand. "Whatever. Doesn't matter what you want. If you want to know how to join the inner sect, heh heh..." He extended his palm with a grin. "You know the drill."

"Five hundred spirit stones." Chen Changsheng tossed them over without hesitation. Still trying to charge for information while being held captive. True commitment to the hustle.

The old man caught the stones, somewhat disappointed at the amount, but given his current position... he smacked his lips. Fine. Less was better than nothing.

"Joining the inner sect is straightforward. There's a selection every year, open to all outer disciples. Meet the requirements and you're in." He paused. "The selection is about a month away."

A month. Not too long. Chen Changsheng nodded. "What are the requirements?"

"Heh, they're a bit strict. I certainly never qualified." The old man grinned. "First—if you can produce a million spirit stones, you skip the exam entirely. But given how stingy you are, probably not happening. Second—if the Sect Master or an elder takes a personal interest, they can admit you directly. Third—anyone at the Supreme Realm automatically qualifies. Fourth—the standard examination. It changes every year, and if you pass, you're in. That's about it. Meet any one condition and you're in. Meet all four, and you've got a bright future."

Four conditions. Not exactly demanding. A million spirit stones? He could afford it. Impressing the Sect Master or elders with his talent? Trivially easy. Supreme Realm cultivation? Already there. As for the exam—Chen Changsheng smiled to himself. He wanted to see just how challenging it was.

"Doesn't sound too hard," he said.

"Not hard?" The old man gnawed on his chicken and gave him a contemptuous look. "Get into the inner sect first, then brag."

"Are you an inner sect disciple?" Chen Changsheng asked curiously.

The old man shook his head emphatically. "I'm not."

"Then where is the inner sect's base?"

"Right here."

"Here?" Chen Changsheng's eyes widened. This run-down place? He'd assumed it was a front concealing something grander.

"The Limitless Holy Land carved out their own pocket dimension. The Azure Lotus Divine Palace has golden halls and jade towers. And the Human Dao Sect, fellow great power..." He trailed off, at a loss.

The old man sniffed dismissively. "Young people. Our Human Dao Sect has returned to the fundamentals. The sect is its people. Wherever our disciples stand—that is the Human Dao Sect!"

Chen Changsheng's eyebrow twitched. That sounded almost profound—

"Of course, if you can't beat the other guy, then it's his turf. Heh heh."

'There it is.' So the grand philosophy boiled down to "seize territory by force." This sect...

He shook his head. Whatever its quirks, the Human Dao Sect was powerful. That was undeniable.

As he turned to leave, the old man followed. "Hey kid, the selection's a month out. On your own, you'll keep getting scammed. Want to stick with me? Ten thousand spirit stones, and I'll keep you safe for the whole month."

Chen Changsheng paused. He'd already tasted how treacherous this place was. Going solo, he'd almost certainly get swindled again.

"Deal."

At the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, Qin Jiang walked hand in hand with Ning Xue'er. Her gait was slightly awkward, her brow furrowing now and then.

"I'll just carry you," he offered.

After a moment's hesitation, she nodded, face pink. He scooped her up, and she wrapped her arms around his neck, whispering: "If you carry me like this, won't Qing Chan get upset?"

"..."

Qin Jiang looked at her, his expression twitching. He'd come to realize that every woman had latent green-tea potential—imperceptible on normal days, but in the right moment, the "tea fragrance" came pouring out.

And Ning Xue'er had gone from zero to full brew in no time flat.
