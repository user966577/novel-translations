The titanic silhouette departed, leaving only a golden vortex hanging in the sky.

Qin Jiang's women immediately crowded around him.

"Qin Jiang, what's going on? You know the Grand Sovereign's daughter?"

"How did you meet her? Was it in Azure Cloud Heaven?"

"Is she pretty?"

"When are you bringing her back so we can meet her?"

"Wait — don't tell me you two got separated by her father? The Grand Sovereign disapproves?"

"Well, that's fine. Once we're stronger, we'll definitely help you steal her back!"

"Yeah! That Grand Sovereign dares to keep lovers apart? We won't stand for it!"

The women chattered over each other, and within the span of a few sentences, had collectively resolved to abduct the Grand Sovereign's daughter.

Qin Jiang opened his mouth, then closed it. His expression twitched. What were they even talking about?

"You're all overthinking this," he said helplessly.

He'd already formed a theory. The Grand Sovereign was very likely the creator of the Myriad Realms Tower. After all, back when he'd been inside the tower, he'd asked its master whether he had a daughter — and had been promptly thrown out.

So there really was a daughter.

He just hadn't expected the man's status to be this astronomically high, and his strength... beyond imagination. The mere messenger who'd delivered the decree dwarfed An Xihe's power, so the Grand Sovereign himself had to be incomprehensibly stronger.

And a being like that had only given him an Immortal King Seal? How stingy.

Still, Qin Jiang was magnanimous. He wouldn't hold the man's cheapness against him. Instead, he began contemplating how to win over the Grand Sovereign's daughter. That would more than make up for it.

The women pressed him for details, so Qin Jiang shrugged and gave them a brief account of what had happened at the Myriad Realms Tower.

Hearing this, the women looked disappointed. "So you haven't even met her?"

"But now we know for sure — the Grand Sovereign really does have a daughter. Hehe, Qin Jiang, you're not telling me you haven't thought about it?"

"Careful, or he'll break your legs~"

"Qin Jiang definitely isn't afraid. So this new sister is officially reserved!"

They were all egging him on.

And naturally, Qin Jiang shared the sentiment. Break his legs? Ha. He'd show up at the man's doorstep with his daughter on his arm and see if he dared.

"We can worry about that later. Right now, the Heavenly Domain is what matters." Qin Jiang looked up, pointing at the vortex still swirling in the sky.

The women's expressions turned serious as they followed his gaze.

"To enter the Heavenly Domain, we'll need to meet certain standards. We still don't know what those are."

"Probably talent, cultivation level, that sort of thing."

"It's likely some kind of assessment — like a sect entrance exam. The Heavenly Domain must have screening criteria, otherwise everyone would flood in and it'd be chaos."

"The question is how difficult it'll be."

"We have thirty years. Every one of us needs to get stronger — at the very least, we all need to qualify."

They looked at Qin Jiang. He was definitely going to the Heavenly Domain. And if they wanted to stay by his side, they had to qualify too.

"Don't worry. You'll all be fine," Qin Jiang said with a reassuring smile, sensing their anxiety.

He didn't know the Heavenly Domain's exact requirements, but every one of his women was a fortune heroine — and under his cultivation, they'd undergone complete transformations. If even they couldn't meet the standard, he couldn't imagine how impossibly powerful the Heavenly Domain would have to be.

So he wasn't worried about them. They'd definitely make the cut.

But the Qin family — at least some of them needed to qualify too. His roots were in the Qin family. The family had to grow stronger, and the Heavenly Domain was the perfect opportunity to accelerate that growth.

"I'm going to head back to the Qin family for a while. Do you want to come with me?"

The women's hearts clenched. Going to the Qin family meant meeting Qin Jiang's parents.

Some of them had only seen his parents briefly during the occasional contact, exchanging a sentence or two at most. Actually meeting them in person made them all nervous — even An Xihe was no exception.

"When are we leaving?"

Despite the nerves, there was no question they'd go. Visiting and meeting his parents meant truly becoming part of the Qin family.

"Once Huaxia Manor's affairs are settled, we'll head out."

The women exchanged glances, silently encouraging each other, then nodded in unison. "Okay~"

Lian'er, however, was sulking.

All this time, she still hadn't found her chance. And now they were about to go home — which meant her chances would only shrink further. Once they were back with their parents watching, how could she possibly make a move?

She also knew that once Qin Jiang returned home, he'd probably stay for a long time. He might even remain until the Heavenly Domain passage opened. That was a full thirty years.

Thirty years of being able to see him, touch him — but not have him.

The torture would be unbearable.

She could practically envision the next thirty years stretching out before her, bleak and dark.

'Stupid brother. Stupid Qin Jiang. Not giving me a single opening.'

Lian'er grumbled under her breath. Huaxia Manor's affairs were already settled. Tomorrow, they'd be heading back to the Qin family.

Maybe she could find an opportunity on the airship?

She sighed, feeling her frustration build. Keeping it all bottled up was making her irritable. Only being around Qin Jiang eased it somewhat.

If she could hug him, kiss him, or maybe even go further — that would be perfect.

But time spent with her brother was limited to hugs at most, with the occasional stolen peck on his cheek. As for those tempting lips of his, she could only stare from afar, so close yet so impossibly far.

She couldn't begin to imagine how wonderful it would feel to actually kiss them.

Her only recourse was to secretly watch him kiss one of her sisters-in-law. Or send Little Red to kiss him, then kiss Little Red afterward — an indirect kiss, at least.

She watched as the women bustled about nearby, preparing gifts for the trip home, with Qin Jiang in the middle of them offering suggestions.

Lian'er's eyes held a trace of longing. Years ago, her brother used to give her the occasional kiss. But now, it had been ages. He only kissed the sisters-in-law.

Just then, the women looked over and called out to her: "Lian'er, come here! Help us figure out what Mom would like."

"Oh! Coming~"

Lian'er trotted over and began offering suggestions as she examined the gifts. Truthfully, she didn't know her parents' preferences that well either.

But she knew one thing — whatever the sisters-in-law gave them, her parents would love it.

So anything would do.
