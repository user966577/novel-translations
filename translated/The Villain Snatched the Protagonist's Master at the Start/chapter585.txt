They'd barely turned around before running straight into Black Dragon. The collapse had scattered everyone, but luck hadn't been on their side—he was right there. At least it was just him.

Liu Xing pushed Zhao Sheng behind him, face grim. "Go. I'll hold him off."

"Liu Xing—"

"No arguments. Move!"

Zhao Sheng clenched his jaw. With his strength fallen back to Human Immortal and his body badly wounded, he'd only be dead weight. "Be careful." He turned and fled.

The moment he was out of sight, the tension evaporated. Liu Xing's serious expression melted into a fawning grin. "So, Boss—how was my performance?"

"Not bad." Black Dragon clapped him on the shoulder with an approving nod. "Couldn't have done it without you. That Immortal Emperor legacy might've slipped away otherwise."

Without Liu Xing guiding them through the maze, they'd never have found the legacy. Zhao Sheng would have claimed it unopposed.

"All for Huaxia!" Liu Xing beamed.

While they chatted, they made sure to generate plenty of noise—thunderous crashes and explosions—to sell the illusion of a fierce battle. After a while, Black Dragon sent Liu Xing on his way. Before leaving, Liu Xing roughed himself up thoroughly—covered in dirt, smeared with blood, face ashen. The picture of a man who'd barely escaped with his life.

Black Dragon nodded approvingly. This guy was a natural. He'd put in a good word when filing the report.

"I'm off, then?"

"Go."

Liu Xing headed in the direction Zhao Sheng had fled. Even without an audience, he stayed in character—stumbling, staggering, the very image of a desperate fugitive.

He passed a mountain peak and knew Zhao Sheng was hiding there, but he kept running. Stopping would arouse suspicion. Zhao Sheng, to his credit, poked his head out when he saw Liu Xing. "Over here!"

"Zhao Sheng!" Liu Xing's face lit up. He hurried over and they ducked into cover together.

"Are you okay?" Zhao Sheng asked, eyeing Liu Xing's pallor with concern.

Liu Xing swallowed a mouthful of blood and wiped his lips. "I'm fine. Just scratches." The words had barely left his mouth when a violent cough wracked his body. Blood sprayed out, and his face turned another shade paler. He nearly collapsed.

Zhao Sheng caught him and produced a pill. "Here—a healing pill."

"No, you take it. Your injuries are worse than mine," Liu Xing protested weakly.

Zhao Sheng's heart swelled with gratitude. He fed the pill directly into Liu Xing's mouth. "I already took one. I'm recovering."

"...Fine." With the pill already in his mouth, Liu Xing had little choice but to swallow it. Internally, he grimaced. What garbage medicine was this? Since joining Huaxia, he'd never once stooped to consuming something this low-grade. You couldn't pay a dog to eat this stuff.

"How's it feel?" Zhao Sheng asked hopefully.

"Works well," Liu Xing said with a strained smile. He still looked weak, but some color returned to his cheeks.

While they talked, Black Dragon's silhouette swept past nearby—apparently tracking someone. One had to keep up appearances, after all. Liu Xing and Zhao Sheng both suppressed their auras until he passed. Only then did they breathe again.

Liu Xing whispered, "That man is incredibly strong. Even at my peak, I couldn't match him. I only got away because he underestimated me."

"Who is he? Someone that powerful shouldn't be unknown."

"No idea." Liu Xing's face turned grave. "But judging by his methods and the people around him, he's from an Emperor-level faction at minimum. Way beyond what you or I can challenge."

"Emperor-level..." Zhao Sheng's fists tightened. If he'd obtained the Immortal Emperor's legacy, he might have reached Immortal Emperor himself someday. Now, with the legacy stolen, that path had gotten infinitely harder.

Sensing his frustration, Liu Xing patted his shoulder. "I can tell you have enormous potential. Even without the legacy, you'll likely reach Immortal Emperor in the future. Don't let one setback break your resolve."

"You're right." Warmth filled Zhao Sheng's chest as he nodded.

They remained hidden for about fifteen minutes before cautiously emerging and heading in the opposite direction. After they'd gone, Black Dragon appeared where they'd been, watching their retreating figures. "Hope you're the one the Young Master's looking for," he murmured, then left. There was an Immortal Emperor's legacy to bring home.

The Huaxia operatives had assembled. Before them sat the Immortal Emperor's legacy, and more than a few eyes burned with desire. An Immortal Emperor's legacy—who wouldn't want it? But when Black Dragon appeared, those hungry gazes quickly dimmed.

He paid their looks no mind and turned to the legacy. Little Xu was standing guard beside it—this was his chance to redeem his earlier failure. He wasn't about to let it out of his sight.

"Alright, stop hovering. Time to go," Black Dragon said.

Little Xu looked over. "Everything taken care of on your end?"

"All done." Black Dragon nodded. "Let's hope that guy is really who the Young Master's been searching for. Otherwise, it was all for nothing."

"Not entirely for nothing. We got the Immortal Emperor's legacy at least." Little Xu grinned. He'd been the one to miss it initially, but now he'd reclaimed it. That balanced the books.

Black Dragon chuckled. An Immortal Emperor's legacy was nothing to scoff at.

Without lingering further, Black Dragon and Little Xu led the rest of the Huaxia operatives out of the Immortal Emperor's secret realm, bringing the legacy with them. Outside, plenty of people were still waiting. Their emergence drew attention, but the sea tribe's Immortal King protectors quickly materialized, flanking Black Dragon's group. Though the legacy attracted stares, no one outside the realm knew what it was, and faced with the sea tribe's might, none dared make a move. Black Dragon's team carried the Immortal Emperor's legacy safely back into the Dream Cloud Sea.
