Outside the Merfolk royal palace, a middle-aged man paused and took a deep breath. Resolve hardened in his eyes as he strode inside.

He climbed the tiers of steps and stopped before the audience chamber. Two guards flanked the entrance—attractive Merfolk women, the Empress's personal escorts.

"Grand Elder."

They offered a respectful bow.

The Grand Elder. His features were refined, his gaze soft. He smiled pleasantly at the guards. "Is the Empress in?"

They nodded. "She's in the chamber."

"Please announce me."

They moved to comply, but the chamber doors swung open first. A light, clear voice drifted out. "Come in, Grand Elder."

He bowed toward the chamber, then stepped inside. The vast hall was empty save for one figure—the Merfolk Empress sat above, languid and captivating, reclining against her throne. A thin veil concealed her features, lending an air of mystery.

The Grand Elder kept his expression neutral, his gaze sliding away from her after a brief appraisal.

"A party from Skyreach City has arrived in the Royal City."

"I'm aware."

"There are eleven of them—ten Third-Class Elders and one unidentified male. His identity remains unknown, but his status is clearly extraordinary. They're staying at the Third Elder's estate. Over these past days, only the ten Elders have been seen. The male has vanished entirely. I suspect their purpose here is not benign."

"Oh." The Empress barely stirred. "What do you think they want?"

"Unknown." The Grand Elder shook his head, then looked at her. "In this Royal City, only you would warrant deploying such a force. Their arrival may be connected to you, Your Majesty."

"Perhaps."

"Doesn't that concern you?"

"Heh. Would worrying help?" She raised her gaze toward the chamber entrance, as if locking eyes with someone beyond the walls. The moment passed. "That man—whatever his identity—has ten Third-Class Elders serving him as master. That alone tells you how terrifying his background is. Whatever he wants, the Merfolk tribe will cooperate."

She looked at the Grand Elder. "Don't concern yourself with this, Grand Elder. We cannot afford to offend someone like that. Now—was there anything else?"

"One more thing."

He nodded, and his hand turned over. A pink droplet appeared on his palm, and something hot flickered in the depths of his eyes—quickly concealed.

His earlier maneuvering had already scattered the Empress's attention and dulled her wariness. She eyed the droplet with curiosity. "What is that?"

"Does Your Majesty recall the ten thousand young women who've gone missing from our tribe in recent years?"

The Empress straightened, expression turning grave. "Are you saying this is connected to the disappearances?"

"It is."

The Grand Elder cupped the droplet and stepped forward. The Empress leaned down, eyes narrowed, studying it intently.

They were barely ten feet apart when he flicked his finger.

The droplet shot toward her like a bullet. She instinctively moved to block it, but the thought that it was connected to her missing tribeswomen made her hesitate for just a fraction of a second.

That was enough.

The droplet burst. Her hand deflected part of it, but the rest splashed across her body and sank through her skin in an instant.

Simultaneously, the Grand Elder swept his arm. The chamber doors slammed shut.

The Empress's brows knitted. She didn't feel anything unusual—yet. She fixed the Grand Elder with a cold stare. "What is the meaning of this?"

"Heh heh. Your Majesty, this droplet was refined from the purest yin essence of ten thousand young women. Would you like to know its effect?"

His mask of courtesy had dropped entirely. He raked his gaze over her with undisguised hunger.

The Empress's aura flared. She rose to her feet, eyes blazing with killing intent. "The missing women—that was you?"

"Such a compassionate empress. Right now, you should worry about yourself."

That was as good as a confession. The Empress raised her hand, intent on slapping him dead where he stood.

But then her expression shifted. Something stirred inside her—a warmth that shouldn't have been there. She frantically channeled her power to suppress it, but the more energy she poured in, the worse it grew.

"Heh heh. Feeling it now? Ten thousand women's yin essence—all Merfolk, sharing your bloodline. The stimulation is something even an Immortal Emperor can't resist."

The Grand Elder laughed openly and stepped toward her.

"Get back!"

Her aura erupted, slamming him backward. She still had fight in her, but her face was already flushed crimson and her body trembled. A heat she couldn't name blazed through her, clouding her vision, drowning her reason in primal urges.
