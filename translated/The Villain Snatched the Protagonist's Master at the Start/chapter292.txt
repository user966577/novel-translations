Days passed.

Spiritual energy in the Chaos District grew denser by the hour. The bulk of it was concentrated within the seal, but what spilled over had already transformed the area into a cultivation paradise.

Seizing the opportunity, Qing Chan and the others stationed themselves near the seal, cultivating while standing guard over An Xihe. Even their time with Qin Jiang had dwindled as they focused on training.

Outside the seal, Qin Jiang watched his women meditating in neat rows and could only sigh. Every last wife was hard at work. And here he was, bored out of his mind.

Still, the view was pleasant enough. All those beautiful silhouettes did wonders for his mood, even if there was nothing else to do.

Then Black Dragon's voice reached him from outside.

Qin Jiang stepped out.

"Young Master." Black Dragon bowed quickly before continuing. "Our people have spotted Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming entering the Chaos District."

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. Perfect timing—just when he was dying of boredom, a toy had delivered itself to his doorstep.

He waved his hand. "Take me to them."

"Yes, sir."

Following Black Dragon's lead, Qin Jiang arrived at a tavern and peered down from a private balcony.

Two... women?

"That's Chen Qi'er?"

Down in a small teahouse across the street, Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming sat in full women's clothing, sipping tea and seemingly asking around about something.

Black Dragon gave a firm nod. "That's him. I've been in contact with Chen Wuming in secret—he confirmed the other one is Chen Qi'er."

Qin Jiang recalled that the pair had been caught peeping at An Xihe, and Qing Chan had subsequently... removed their qualifications. But he hadn't expected them to lean into it this thoroughly. Couldn't be men anymore, so they'd gone ahead and become women. These were Children of Destiny, for crying out loud.

He shook his head. "Any idea what they're here for?"

"Not sure. But Chen Qi'er keeps asking about anything unusual in the Chaos District."

Black Dragon had good reason to know. The entire Chaos District was effectively his territory—at least ninety percent of it. Since the River Dragon Gang had merged with the Chaos Sect, the combined first- and second-largest factions had swallowed up everything else almost instantly. Loyalty wasn't ironclad, but for minor errands like this, his people got the job done.

Case in point: the person chatting up Chen Qi'er right now was one of Black Dragon's underlings.

Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed. Chen Qi'er's intentions were far from innocent. In the original storyline, Chen Qi'er was the one who disrupted An Xihe's breakthrough and stole Azure Cloud Heaven's origin power. It seemed he still had the same goal.

Not that it mattered. His current strength was a far cry from what the original plot had granted him, and even at full power, with Qin Jiang's preparations, Chen Qi'er wouldn't have stood a chance. The Immortal King Killing Formation was already in place.

Just as Qin Jiang was contemplating how to handle Chen Qi'er, a knock came at the door. Black Dragon answered—one of his men.

"Boss, Second Boss." The man bowed respectfully.

Qin Jiang nodded absently, still deep in thought. Black Dragon took the lead. "What is it?"

"Second Boss, our people spotted Chen Changsheng—the one you flagged for priority surveillance."

Qin Jiang's head snapped up. "Chen Changsheng's here too?"

"Yes, sir. He just entered the Chaos District a few minutes ago. He's in rough shape—looks like he's been injured."

A spark of interest crossed Qin Jiang's face. True to form, Children of Destiny couldn't help sticking their noses into everything. He stood. "Take me to him."

Chen Changsheng demanded more attention than Chen Qi'er. After all, the Reincarnation Law was still parked inside Chen Changsheng. Qin Jiang needed to check on his investment regularly.

He left Black Dragon behind to keep tabs on Chen Qi'er—no need for dedicated surveillance when practically everyone in the Chaos District answered to them. Chen Qi'er also had a mole right beside him.

Qin Jiang found Chen Changsheng quickly. The man looked terrible. The power inside him was barely contained, continuously battering his body—destroying and repairing in an endless cycle. The constant agony must have been excruciating, yet Chen Changsheng walked forward without a flicker of emotion. Credit where it was due: Children of Destiny could take punishment.

If it were Qin Jiang, he'd have been crying and burying his face in his wife's chest, begging for comfort.

Watching Chen Changsheng leave a bloody footprint with every step, Qin Jiang's eyes widened. "Who's been bullying my Reincarnation Law? Wait—he's a Great Emperor now? Has my Reincarnation Law matured?"

His excitement faded as he took a closer look. Something was off. If the law had truly matured, Chen Changsheng wouldn't be in this sorry state. Had something gone wrong? Had his Reincarnation Law been ruined?

After a moment's thought, Qin Jiang gave an order. "Arrange for Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng to run into each other."

"Right away."

Watching Chen Changsheng, Qin Jiang wanted Chen Qi'er to test-drive the goods—see just how far the Reincarnation Law had grown.

Engineering the encounter wasn't hard for his army of underlings. Both targets were asking around about the same thing—anomalies in the Chaos District. A few well-placed misdirections and they'd walk right into each other. Children of Destiny were absurdly trusting. They'd never been properly exposed to the art of the con.

And so, under the expert guidance of Qin Jiang's minions, Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng met.

Chen Qi'er blinked, then burst out laughing. "Well, well! I'd already given up hunting you, and here you come waltzing right to me!"

Chen Changsheng's face went dark. He'd fled all the way to the Chaos District—how had this lunatic followed him here?

From the shadows, Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. They'd already crossed paths? Understanding dawned—his Reincarnation Law had been knocked around by Chen Qi'er. Close call. At least the man hadn't killed it.

Chen Qi'er attacked immediately. Chen Changsheng fought back.

Qin Jiang watched from concealment, eyes brightening. The Reincarnation Law was growing fast. Not quite fully mature, but getting close. At this point, he could harvest it and finish the job himself with a bit of effort.

Observing the clash unfold, he murmured, "I knew it. For Children of Destiny, pressure equals growth. Clearly, I wasn't applying enough before—that's why the Reincarnation Law was developing so slowly. But Chen Qi'er really came through. Good brother-in-law, helping me fill in the gaps. First-rate pressure."
