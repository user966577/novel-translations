The Pill Emperor's brow furrowed. Dan Yu had been taken?

"Rest assured, Palace Master—the Saintess is not in danger," the Grand Commander quickly added.

The Pill Emperor looked at him, her delicate brows knitting tighter. "Tell me everything. At once."

The other Palace elders nodded emphatically. This man had been doling out information one sentence at a time, keeping them all on the edge of a cliff.

The Grand Commander grimaced, then laid out the full account in one go. At the end, he added: "So the Saintess should be safe. At worst, she might... lose a little blood."

He left the rest unsaid, but the Pill Emperor and everyone present understood perfectly well what he meant.

"Where is Dan Yu now?" the Pill Emperor asked.

Her expression was placid, but her voice was ice. A faint pressure radiated outward, blanketing the room.

The Grand Commander hunched his shoulders. "She should be... at one of the restaurants."

---

The Pill Fragrance Pavilion—the largest restaurant in Pill City, backed by the Heavenly Pill Palace itself. Business was booming.

Dan Yu brought Qin Jiang and his entourage here and, leveraging her authority as Saintess, secured a luxury suite.

"Room's ready. I'm leaving," Dan Yu announced.

Qin Jiang shook his head with a smile. "I've been studying alchemy lately and hit a snag. Help me work through it, and then you can go."

Dan Yu's hand clenched into a fist. 'I knew it. No escape.'

She took a steadying breath. "You'd better actually be studying alchemy."

"Of course," Qin Jiang said. "Solve my problem, and I'll let you walk right out."

"Fine!"

After entering the suite, Liu Shuwan and the other women each claimed a room. Qin Jiang, meanwhile, led Dan Yu into the suite's private chamber.

She'd braced herself for the worst—expected him to pounce the moment the door closed. Instead, to her utter astonishment, Qin Jiang actually produced a pill furnace.

"You really are studying alchemy?" Dan Yu asked, stunned.

Qin Jiang nodded. "I've been at it for a while, but I keep running into issues when refining immortal-grade pills."

"Oh, immortal-grade pills. Actually, when it comes to immortal-grade—" Dan Yu began answering on reflex before catching herself. Her voice cut off mid-sentence.

She stared at him. "Did you say immortal-grade?"

She'd briefly believed his alchemy story, but now she was certain it was just a pretext. Who casually talks about immortal-grade pills? Even her master couldn't refine those.

"I'm only a Saint-grade alchemist. Immortal-grade is beyond me," Dan Yu said flatly. "If you have Saint-grade questions, I can help."

"Saint-grade?" Qin Jiang scoffed and tossed the furnace aside. He pulled out a handful of spirit herbs instead. With a wave of his palm, a fire dragon materialized and devoured the ingredients whole.

The dragon danced through the air, and under Dan Yu's stunned gaze, it reduced every herb to refined essence in moments. She recognized the technique—this was alchemy. And at a level her own master might not be able to match.

Shock rooted her in place as she watched the pill take shape. The fire dragon dissipated.

Qin Jiang caught the finished pill and tossed it to Dan Yu. "Saint-grade. Child's play."

Dan Yu caught it. It was indeed a Saint-grade pill—and a high-quality one at that. She looked at Qin Jiang with wide eyes. To produce something of this caliber in so little time... this man's alchemy rivaled her master's.

"You... you're really working on immortal-grade pills?"

"Obviously." Qin Jiang nodded. "But it looks like you can't help me after all."

Dan Yu: "..."

She was a Saint-grade alchemist. How could she possibly troubleshoot immortal-grade refinement? Even her master might fall short.

Qin Jiang stepped closer, plucked the pill from her hand, and popped it directly into her mouth.

The pill dissolved instantly, sending a current of warmth flooding through her body.

Dan Yu startled. "What pill was that?!"

"What do you think?" Qin Jiang smiled, his eyes roaming over her appraisingly. "Feeling a little warm?"

"You—"

Her cheeks flushed. The pill's effects were kicking in. Warmth cascaded through her in waves, and her entire body felt like it was heating up.

Beyond the heat, she felt something crawling across her skin—a maddening itch, as if ants were marching over every inch of her.

She clenched her fists, fighting the urge to—

"Getting hotter, right? Maybe even a little itchy?" Qin Jiang asked, his tone infuriatingly casual.

"Shameless!" Dan Yu snapped, though her voice came out soft and trembling. Tears welled in her eyes as her body quivered.

She wanted to run, but in her current state, leaving would only make things more humiliating. And Qin Jiang clearly wasn't about to let her go.

Only one outcome seemed to await her.

Her resistance crumbled. Biting her lip, her fingers trembling, she reached for her buttons...

Qin Jiang's eyes went wide.

Dan Yu squeezed her eyes shut, but she could feel his scorching gaze on her. "Just... get it over with," she whispered, her voice shaking.

Qin Jiang was not the kind of man to refuse meat delivered to his doorstep. He let out a low chuckle and wrapped an arm around her waist. "You're the one who started this."

"Hmph—"

Dan Yu let out a muffled cry. Her face went pale for a heartbeat, then flushed scarlet.

The private chamber filled with the sound of a beautiful, agonizing melody.

---

About four hours later, Dan Yu lay exhausted, glaring at Qin Jiang with unconcealed resentment.

Qin Jiang looked completely at ease. "Why are you looking at me like that? Don't forget—you started it."

"I started it?" Dan Yu nearly cracked her own teeth from clenching so hard. "You drugged me!"

"Drugged you? Don't slander me!" Qin Jiang feigned an exaggerated look of shock. "You didn't actually think I drugged you, did you?"

"That pill—"

"That pill was a body-tempering elixir. It's designed to enhance your physique—specifically tailored for alchemists. Try checking your control over fire. You'll find it's improved significantly."

"A body-tempering elixir?"

"Yep."

Dan Yu's face went blank. The pill Qin Jiang had given her was just a body-tempering elixir?

Thinking back, the pill's effects hadn't actually been... that kind of thing. It was Qin Jiang's suggestive words that had led her mind astray.

And what was done was done. Knowing the truth now changed nothing.

"Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Dan Yu's voice trembled with barely contained frustration.

She strongly suspected Qin Jiang had done it on purpose. And even if the pill was genuinely what he claimed, he could have easily slipped something extra in. With his level of skill, adding a little something to the formula would've been effortless.

Qin Jiang spread his hands innocently. "I thought you were so moved by my generosity that you decided to offer yourself willingly."
