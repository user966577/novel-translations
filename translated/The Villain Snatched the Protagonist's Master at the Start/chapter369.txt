Jian Yao caught the murderous gaze and drew her sword across his face, opening a bloody line. "Old man, I wasn't planning to kill you. But are you seriously thinking about revenge?"

She'd left him off the list because he'd been in seclusion during the original events. Tacit approval or not, he hadn't directly participated. She'd been willing to let it go.

But killing intent toward Qin Jiang? That sealed it.

Her eyes flooded with lethal resolve. She swept her sword through the remaining names on her list — every tagged elder in the hall fell in a single pass. Then the blade came to rest on the ancestor's neck.

He swallowed hard, feeling the cold edge against his skin. "Jian Yao, don't be rash. I once taught you—"

Desperation made him reach for old bonds. But the moment Qin Jiang was threatened, Jian Yao's sentimentality evaporated.

She smirked. The blade flashed, piercing clean through his neck. His body crumbled under the force, but his Primordial Spirit — a wisp of white light — tried to flee.

An Immortal King and two True Immortals stood in the room. A single Human Immortal's soul had nowhere to go.

Mo Mo snorted and snatched it from the air with a tendril of demonic qi. Agonized screams echoed from within as black bubbles corroded the spirit. Her fingers danced, methodically shredding and reshaping it until the once-proud ancestor stood hollow-eyed and inky black — stripped of will, reduced to a mindless demonic thrall.

"Done!" Mo Mo snapped her fingers cheerfully.

The surviving elders stared in horror, teeth chattering. "D-demon... the great demon..."

Mo Mo arched an eyebrow. "And? I didn't kill you, did I? One more word and I'll convert the lot of you."

They pressed their faces to the floor.

Jian Yao checked her list. Some names were still unaccounted for — not everyone had been in the main hall. She displayed the remaining faces to the cowering elders. "Know them?"

"Yes."

"Take me to them."

They complied without hesitation. The rest of the targets were found quickly, though some had died of natural causes over the millennia, and others had left the sect entirely. Every listed name still within the Sword Sect was executed.

When the killing stopped, the surviving elders looked like ghosts. The sect had been gutted.

"These people aren't bad," Qin Jiang said, appraising the remaining members. "Merge them into the Holy Sword Sect." The Sword Sect had raised Jian Yao — it shouldn't vanish entirely. A memento was worth preserving.

Jian Yao nodded, looking around. The place hadn't changed much in tens of thousands of years. It was shabby by Grey Cloud Heaven standards, but still leagues above the Holy Sword Sect back on the Heavenly Mystery Continent.

"Actually... why not move the Holy Sword Sect here instead?"

Qin Jiang considered this and agreed. The Nine Heavens were superior to the Ten Lands in every way. Once Huaxia consolidated its hold over all realms, he'd relocate the Qin family to the best location he could find.

With the Sword Sect settled, there was one more matter. Qin Jiang gathered every disciple for a scan — searching for a Child of Destiny. With every classic trope checked off, surely there had to be one lurking somewhere.

Nothing. Not a single one.

'Strange,' he thought. 'Did I arrive too early? Is the protagonist still out there somewhere?'

He felt a twinge of regret. Should've brought Lian'er — her system never missed.

"Let's go. The Zhao family."

Their territory wasn't far — less than two hours away. The Zhao family's domain was vast, spanning millions of miles, with countless vassal clans living under their shadow. Here, the Zhaos were absolute rulers.

"Straight to the main estate," Qin Jiang said.

Jian Yao nodded. Destroy the main house and the family crumbled. Of course, knowing Qin Jiang, one estate wouldn't satisfy him. Every drop of Zhao blood would be accounted for.

"Mo Mo, you have a technique that kills through bloodline, right?"

She nodded eagerly. "The Bloodline Curse. It can kill everyone who shares the Zhao bloodline. Want me to use it?"

She'd been itching to deploy it since the Yan family operation, where it had been shelved because Yan Yun and Yan Shiya shared the target bloodline.

"Use it on the Zhao family."

Jian Yao turned to Mo Mo. "Can it really kill them all?"

"Of course!" Mo Mo said proudly. "Though anyone stronger than me can resist. The Zhao family's True Immortal will survive, so Xihe will need to handle him. Once I have his blood, the technique will take care of the rest."
