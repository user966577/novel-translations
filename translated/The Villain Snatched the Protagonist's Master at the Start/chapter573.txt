"What to divine?" Qin Jiang studied Tianji for a moment, then smiled. "How about we divine how much longer you have to live?"

Tianji's face went rigid. The crowd erupted in murmurs. This was pure provocation.

Behind Tianji stood several young cultivators—disciples of major factions who'd been stuck in Dream Cloud City due to the lockdown. With nothing better to do, they'd stumbled upon Tianji, let him read their fortunes on a whim, and quickly become admirers. Now, seeing someone openly challenge him, they frowned and stepped forward to intervene.

But they'd barely moved when Black Dragon and Little Xu appeared at their sides, arms draped over their shoulders. The crushing force pinning them in place made their hearts skip. They tried to struggle free but couldn't budge an inch.

Black Dragon flashed a toothy grin. "Behave. Don't disturb our Young Master." As he spoke, the arm draped over their shoulders gave a few firm pats. The faint sound of cracking bone was unmistakable. Pain twisted across the disciples' faces. They went still.

Tianji, meanwhile, collected himself and let out a dry laugh. "Sir, you jest. Fortune readings are done for oneself. There's no reason to—"

"I want to do yours."

Before he could finish, Qin Jiang cut him off, watching him with that same faint smile. Tianji swallowed hard. Cold sweat trickled down his forehead as he frantically tried to cast a reading for himself. But his mind was in chaos—nothing came clear.

After a long silence, he sighed and looked at Qin Jiang with a bitter smile. "Sir, I'd like to know—how have I offended you?"

"You haven't."

"Then why—"

"You will in the future."

"???"

Tianji's cheek twitched. Who was reading whose fortune here? He was the Daoist, wasn't he?

"Ha, just kidding. Actually, I know a thing or two about divination myself. How about I give you a reading?"

Tianji could only force a smile. "That would be my honor."

"Good. Let me take a proper look."

Qin Jiang's expression turned serious. He fixed his gaze on Tianji and studied him intently. Under that scrutiny, Tianji's skin crawled.

After a long moment, Qin Jiang clicked his tongue twice and spoke. "That pallor—almost greenish, really. Classic signs of, shall we say, deficiency. I'd stake my reputation on it: you're destined to be cuckolded."

Silence.

Was this fortune-telling or a medical diagnosis? More importantly, he was not deficient. Not in the slightest. And he most certainly was not going to be cuckolded! This man was spouting complete nonsense.

But he didn't dare argue. He squeezed out a smile. "I don't have a wife, so being cuckolded would be rather—"

"You don't?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "If my reading's correct, you should have a marriage contract. Sealed with a Dao Covenant, no less."

Tianji's eyes went wide, disbelief written across his face. This man could actually divine?

"Seems I wasn't wrong." Qin Jiang smiled serenely.

Tianji recovered and immediately launched into praise. "Your insight is truly extraordinary, sir! I do indeed have a marriage contract. My master arranged it. I haven't even met the woman yet—it may or may not work out—"

"It won't."

Tianji's fist clenched. This man kept cursing his future! He'd divined this betrothal himself. Though he hadn't met his promised bride, he was absolutely certain they were a match made in heaven, with nothing to disrupt it. Yet this man flatly declared it wouldn't work out.

Taking a deep breath to force down his anger, he offered a pained smile. "Thank you for the warning, sir. In that case, I won't hold on to false hopes."

"Glad you understand." Qin Jiang smiled, then extended his palm. "Alright. Pay up."

"Excuse me?"

"The reading fee." Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed. He fixed Tianji with a glare. "What, you get your fortune read and stiff me on the payment? Trying to cheat the fortune teller?"

Tianji's face darkened. 'You're the one who forced this reading on me! And it wasn't even accurate! And now you want money?'

This was highway robbery.

But he couldn't resist. Something in Qin Jiang's presence told him that defiance would mean death. He managed a stiff smile. "My oversight. Allow me to pay at once."

He produced a treasured artifact and held it out. "Will this suffice?"

"Let me see." Qin Jiang took the artifact, examined it briefly, and pocketed it.

Tianji breathed a sigh of relief.

Then Qin Jiang added: "Not enough."

"..."

"I don't want anything else. Your marriage contract—it's not going to work out anyway. Hand over the Dao Covenant. I'll take on that betrothal for you."

Tianji shot to his feet. Black Dragon and Little Xu stepped forward instantly, each seizing a shoulder and slamming him back down.

Qin Jiang remained perfectly composed, watching him calmly.

Fury blazed in Tianji's eyes. Through clenched teeth, he ground out: "Sir, the Dao Covenant is already sealed. Taking it would serve no purpose."

"Who says it wouldn't? Kill you, and that Dao Covenant becomes a worthless piece of paper."

The Dao Covenant stipulated that both parties would become Dao companions. If one party died, the other would naturally be released from its binding—they wouldn't be forced into lifelong celibacy. If this man truly killed him and then claimed his fiancee, it was entirely possible.

His fists clenched. After a long, silent deliberation, weighing the costs and consequences, Tianji smiled bitterly. He felt powerless. Shaking his head with a sigh, he withdrew the Dao Covenant and handed it to Qin Jiang.

"When the contract was originally made, my master had done a great favor for the woman's family. Because of that, she cannot back out—but I can voluntarily dissolve the betrothal."

He didn't dare hide anything. Otherwise, this man would simply kill him and take his fiancee by force.

Qin Jiang accepted the Dao Covenant and glanced at it. Standard marriage contract—two names inscribed: the woman's, and Tianji's. He nodded. "Good. Dissolve it."

"Very well."

Having made his decision, Tianji wasted no more time. He pressed a fingertip until a drop of blood welled up and flicked it onto the Dao Covenant. His name vanished instantly.

Not only could the covenant be cancelled—it could also transfer to someone else.

Qin Jiang grinned. He took the Dao Covenant and inscribed his own name where Tianji's had been.

"Perfect."

Admiring the updated document, Qin Jiang nodded with satisfaction. Then he looked at Tianji and smiled. "So? Was my reading accurate or not?"

With that, he rose, beckoned to Black Dragon and Little Xu, and strolled away, laughing.

Tianji sat there, fists clenched. The betrothal really had fallen through. And technically, he'd been cuckolded too.

The bastard really was accurate.
