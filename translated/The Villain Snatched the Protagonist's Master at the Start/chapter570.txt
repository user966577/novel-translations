Mengqian shoved him away with a pout—and before he could react, she grabbed him by the most sensitive handle available.

"I'll bite you to death!"

True to her word, she chomped down. Qin Jiang sucked in a sharp breath, his whole body going rigid with alarm.

Thankfully, she wasn't serious.

He relaxed and ruffled her hair. "You really are sharp-tongued."

"Hmph~" She snorted, then pressed down just a little harder. "Fine—if you don't want me, I'll never need this again anyway. Might as well bite it off!"

He grimaced. The girl was issuing threats. "You're the one who said you didn't want to stay."

"I never said that!"

His cheek twitched. She could flip faster than a page. All logic had left the building.

She looked up at him, teeth still lightly clamped, grinding ever so slightly—a very clear threat.

Taking the hint, he said quickly, "Who said I don't want you? I came to the Merfolk tribe entirely for little Mengqian. How could I not want you?"

She paused. He'd come for her? That was obviously a lie. Still, it was the attitude she'd wanted. She eased the pressure but didn't let go.

He tried to pull her up. She refused.

"I'm hungry. You need to feed me~"

The Empress had told her to feed Qin Jiang. She couldn't manage that—but making him feed her? That was doable.

Qin Jiang was happy to oblige. He stroked her hair and smiled. "I've got plenty. You'll be full."

"Good~"

She started out feisty, but had quickly turned docile—the earlier banter had been playful foreplay. Now it was time for the main course.

The girl had quite an appetite. Half a day later, Qin Jiang had finally satisfied her. She lay in his arms, content.

As for Qin Jiang? Satisfied was a stretch. She hadn't even qualified as an appetizer.

She could tell. She glanced down, face reddening, and hesitated before whispering, "Do you... want more?"

"You're up for it?"

She looked away, face burning. "There are... other ways."

"!!!"

He raised an eyebrow, appreciating the initiative. "Worth a try."

"So... try?"

"Try."

Over the past five days, most of his attention had gone toward detoxifying Mengjin. His time with Mengqian had been limited—lots of ground left to cover.

Now that she was volunteering, he was going to be thorough.

Mengqian cooperated, even though she knew she couldn't satisfy him—she wanted to at least take the edge off.

Another half-day, and she was completely spent. She gazed at him with a trace of fear in her eyes. The man was insatiable. Like a bottomless pit.

Seeing her exhaustion, Qin Jiang felt a twinge of regret. He'd barely scratched the surface.

Shaking his head, he scooped her up. She yelped and clung to his neck. "I can't anymore~"

"I'm taking you to rest. Get your mind out of the gutter."

She sagged with relief. At least the brute had a merciful streak.

He carried her to where Mengjin was sleeping—still not recovered, even after a full day. He set Mengqian down and told them both to rest.

"I have something to take care of."

They agreed instantly. Keeping him around right now was the last thing either wanted.

Qin Jiang left the palace and headed back to the Third Elder's estate. There was still a certain little someone waiting for him. After days apart, she had to be missing him.

He entered the estate like he owned the place—which, at this point, he basically did—and made his way to Shanshan's room, slipping inside.

The girl was lying on her stomach across the bed, a scroll of illustrated artwork spread before her. Her bare feet kicked idly in the air as she studied it with intense concentration.

She was so absorbed she didn't notice Qin Jiang sidle up beside her. He leaned in to see what she was reading, and his eyebrows shot up.

"This position looks good—I'll definitely try it when he comes back," she mumbled. "This one too..."

After a while, she pounded the mattress in frustration. "That jerk! How many days has it been? Why isn't he back yet? Ugh—I miss him~"

She tossed the scroll aside with a pout and rolled over. Then she froze, staring up at Qin Jiang.

Was she hallucinating? She blinked. Rubbed her eyes.

He laughed. "Miss me?"

"Oh!"

Reality confirmed, she squealed and launched herself at him. He caught her easily, and she wrapped around him as he sat on the bed with her in his lap.

Eyes sparkling with delight, she locked her arms around his neck and kissed him fiercely—pouring all her pent-up longing into it. He responded in kind.

When they finally broke apart, she was grinning from ear to ear. "I missed you so much~"

"Yeah?"

"Mm~"

She nodded vigorously.

He smiled, reached over, and snagged the scroll she'd been reading. "So when you miss me, you study this?"

She turned beet red. Since meeting Qin Jiang, she'd developed an interest in such materials and had been collecting illustrated scrolls to study.

Flipping through it, Qin Jiang had to admit the artwork was exquisite.

"Want to try some of these?"

She perked up immediately, pointing to one of the illustrations with shy excitement. "This one!"

"Done."

He tossed the scroll aside. He didn't need reference material—there wasn't a technique he hadn't mastered. Hands-on instruction was always better.

Time to teach Shanshan the advanced curriculum.
