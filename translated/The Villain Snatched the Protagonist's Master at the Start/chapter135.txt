Life in the Imperial City had settled into a comfortable rhythm for Qin Jiang. When he wasn't enjoying himself in the Void Divine Temple, he was strolling the city with his women—a spectacle that had become something of a local landmark.

Meanwhile, the situation at the frontier was entirely under his control. The Demon Hall answered to him now, and their every move was his to direct.

Half a month slipped by.

On this particular day, Qin Jiang had Xia Qianling perched on his lap. Her shy, delicate manner was endlessly tempting to tease. Ever since her Mystic Yin Body had awakened, she radiated a subtle allure that, paired with her innocent face, was impossible to resist.

So these past few weeks had been rather... taxing for her.

But the rewards were substantial. Her cultivation had surged. Barely a month of training, and she'd already reached Golden Body Realm—though her combat experience still needed work. Qin Jiang would have to tutor her personally.

Just then, a painting streaked through the void and appeared before him. The Demon Hall Founder.

Qin Jiang had left her to her own devices. With the seal as leverage, she wasn't going anywhere.

The painting quivered, her voice sharp with frustration. "All you do is fool around with women. When are you going to break my seal?"

Qin Jiang had told her he'd break the seal once she was no longer a threat—meaning his strength needed to grow. But she'd been watching him for weeks now, and the man never cultivated. At this rate, the seal would never come off.

Qin Jiang glanced at the painting. "You're an immortal-path powerhouse. Can't you be a little more patient?"

The Demon Hall Founder: "..."

Patient? Try being sealed for millions of years and see how patient you are. That she hadn't gone insane was miracle enough.

Suppressing her fury, the painting rattled violently, broadcasting the Founder's mood to anyone nearby.

"Fine! I'll be patient. But don't think I'll work for free forever. Five thousand years—that's my limit. If you haven't broken my seal in five thousand years, I'll... I'll leave immediately!"

Five thousand years was the blink of an eye for an immortal-path cultivator. Then again, Qin Jiang was only nineteen. Five thousand years was beyond his imagination. But breaking the Founder's seal definitely wouldn't take that long.

Jian Yao was already on the verge of her breakthrough.

Qin Jiang studied the painting, curiosity flickering in his eyes. "Can you show yourself? Your actual appearance?"

He'd never seen what the Demon Hall Founder looked like. The original story hadn't revealed her face either, but Qin Jiang suspected she might be a fortune heroine. If so, she definitely wasn't hard on the eyes.

"No!" came the frosty reply.

From her observations of Qin Jiang, the man was obviously scheming something involving her. The audacity. She was a grand demoness, an immortal-path powerhouse—no one had ever dared harbor designs on her.

"Pity," Qin Jiang said with a regretful shake of his head.

The Demon Hall Founder scoffed, vanished from sight, and left only a parting line: "You have five thousand years."

Qin Jiang chuckled, eyes glinting thoughtfully. "Sealed for millions of years... I wonder how much strength she has left."

The Demon Hall had been sustaining her all this time, but for an immortal-path cultivator, what the Demon Hall could provide was a pittance. After millions of years, she'd probably lost most of her power. At the very least, she wouldn't recover immediately after being unsealed.

And that, perhaps, was an opportunity.

A smile spread across his face.

"Qin Jiang, that smile of yours is... a little perverted," Xia Qianling murmured from his lap.

His smile dimmed. He rubbed his chin and looked down at her. This girl was getting bold after spending so much time around him. Calling him perverted? She'd need a lesson.

The frontier.

Over the past two weeks, the Demon Hall had unleashed havoc across the border region. They'd even sacked an entire city, prompting a furious decree from the Dragon Emperor ordering the frontier garrisons to annihilate them.

Half the frontier mobilized.

As a general, Long Yu was naturally called to action. He stood before his assembled troops, face alight with ambition. This was his moment to build a legacy of merit.

With military achievements came authority. With authority came control over the frontier. And once he controlled the frontier, even the Dragon Emperor would have to take him seriously.

In his palm, a message stone pulsed.

A smile crossed his face. He checked the message, then swept his arm forward.

"Soldiers! The chance for glory is here—follow me to kill the enemy!"

"Kill! Kill! Kill!"

Outside a frontier city, Long Yu led his thousand-man unit. His keen gaze swept a tree line several hundred yards ahead. Then he barked: "Movement in those trees—charge!"

His soldiers hesitated. Attacking blind? They didn't even know who was there or how strong they were. Just rush in?

But on a battlefield, orders were absolute. After a moment's pause, the thousand-man force surged forward.

The instant they entered the tree line, shadowy figures became visible among the trunks.

Morale soared.

"Demon Hall—that stench is unmistakable!"

"It really is the Demon Hall! The Ninth Prince spotted them from that distance—incredible!"

"Kill!"

The soldiers threw themselves into the fight. Long Yu rode the wave of praise, charging at the forefront.

And then a horrifying aura detonated from deep within the forest, freezing every soldier in place.

"A Saint!"

"No—there's a Demon Hall Saint in here!"

"Protect the general!"

Normally, a general's position required Saint Realm at minimum. Long Yu, however, was the exception—a prince who'd been handed the title.

His soldiers' best were only Yin-Yang Realm. Even with formations, a mere thousand couldn't match a Saint. And the Demon Hall didn't have just one.

Long Yu's face darkened. A Saint? What the hell? The arrangement had been one Unity Realm cultivator—an easy kill for easy credit. Had the Demon Hall decided that was too small a prize and sent a Saint instead?

Wasn't that a bit too obvious?

'Forget it—kill first, ask later!'

Long Yu steeled himself. He was the Demon Hall's Holy Son, his authority second only to the Founder's. The arrangement was clear: some Demon Hall members would let themselves be killed to pad his record. A Saint should submit just the same.

He roared: "Don't be afraid—watch this general slay him!"
