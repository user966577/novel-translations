On the airship, a cluster of fox cubs scampered and played. Nearby, Chen Ningshuang lay on the grass, bored, chin propped on her hands, bare feet swaying lazily behind her. She wore only a loose gauze dress, slightly translucent. Her skin gleamed white in the light.

A pack of fox cubs bounded over. One nuzzled her cheek. "Xiao Shuang, come play with us!"

She shook her head. "Not in the mood."

"She's definitely daydreaming about that scoundrel again. No wonder she doesn't want to play with us," another fox giggled.

Chen Ningshuang's cheeks reddened. She glared. "I am not!"

"Oh please. Everyone knows you spend all day figuring out how to get into his bed." The other foxes nodded sagely. Her intentions were an open secret.

"You all want the same thing!" she fired back.

"Not the same. We want it, sure, but we're not scheming to throw ourselves at him every day. Besides, we're still young. And so are you. He may be a bit of a pervert, but he's good to us. You're too little — even if you climbed into his mouth, he wouldn't bite. It might hurt you." The fox's tone was perfectly serious.

These fox cubs were older than they looked. By fox-race standards, they were still minors. The same applied to Chen Ningshuang.

She pouted and looked down at herself. "What do you mean little? I'm already big!"

Qin Jiang had raised her well — perhaps too well. Nutritionally speaking, she'd already surpassed her older sister, and she still had room to grow. The fox cubs peered over, wide-eyed and envious. In human form, they looked about ten — flat as boards. Chen Ningshuang was the same age but looked years ahead.

"She really isn't small anymore," said a voice laced with amusement.

Her face lit up. She'd recognize that voice anywhere. She scrambled to her feet as Qin Jiang materialized before her.

"Big brother!" She launched herself into his arms. The foxes swarmed too — one on his shoulder, another on his head, several tugging at his pant legs. He held Ningshuang with one arm and rubbed fox heads with the other.

"Why are you here?" She beamed up at him.

"Didn't I promise to check on you regularly? It's been a while since the last checkup."

"Mm!" She nodded eagerly, privately thrilled. She loved his checkups.

He could already tell she'd grown just from holding her. She'd been diligent with the exercises he'd taught her.

"We want checkups too!" the foxes chorused.

"Transform first. I'll examine you all."

They shifted into human form — tiny, adorable girls. And completely unclothed.

"Ahem. Maybe put some clothes on?"

They shook their heads, giggling. "No outsiders here! And how do you examine us with clothes on?"

He swallowed. They were young, but that porcelain skin was genuinely distracting. Chen Ningshuang glanced between the foxes and Qin Jiang, then wriggled free. A moment later, her gauze dress pooled at her feet and she pressed back into his embrace. "You can start now, big brother."

He looked down. This was going to be torture. They were all so young... But she really wasn't small anymore.

He took a steadying breath. No. Be patient.

Checkup first.

"One at a time. Ningshuang goes last." He winked at her. She understood immediately — special treatment — and nodded happily.

The fox cubs went first. One by one, he examined them, dispensing his verdicts.

"Too small. Growing slowly. Are you not eating enough?"

"Cultivation's fine, but nothing's developing. Maybe spend more time in the Space-Time Temple."

"You're small too, but that pet of yours is nice — still drooling, I see."

The fox with the drooling pet turned crimson, crouched down, and frantically wiped its mouth, glaring at Qin Jiang.

He smiled. Small now, but every one of them would be stunning when they grew up.

"You're all healthy — just developing slowly. I'll provide more spirit medicines, and spend time in the Space-Time Temple when you can. You'll mature before you know it."

They nodded eagerly. They all wanted to grow up and experience what their older sisters described — that feeling of soaring through the clouds.

His gaze settled on Chen Ningshuang. "Your turn. Come here. Let me take a good look."
