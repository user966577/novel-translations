Qin Jiang's eyebrow rose. He couldn't resist a squeeze.

Ning Xue'er froze with a tiny whimper, her teeth sinking into her lip. Her eyes turned to him, glistening with a plea that made one's heart ache.

He flipped her over, continuing the interrogation. "Still going to disrespect me?"

"I wouldn't dare~" Ning Xue'er answered meekly.

Qin Jiang nodded with satisfaction. It was obviously just lip service, but that sweet, soft voice was pleasant enough. He closed his eyes, cradled her, and asked lazily: "Then what should you call me?"

"Big brother Jiang~"

"Good girl. Say it again."

"Brother~ Big brother Jiang~"

Her voice was honeyed and coquettish. She snuck a glance at Qing Chan—calling Qin Jiang that in front of the ancestor's lover might not go over well.

"Again."

"Brother~"

Her voice dipped quieter. She was getting nervous—Qing Chan's expression was starting to darken.

She leaned close to Qin Jiang's ear and whispered: "Qing Chan looks angry."

"Hm?" He opened his eyes and looked.

Qing Chan waved a hand. "Don't mind me. You two have fun. I'll step out."

Ning Xue'er: "..."

With that, Qing Chan vanished.

Ning Xue'er turned to Qin Jiang. "See? She's upset. She's definitely jealous. Shouldn't you go after her?"

"..." Qin Jiang shot her a look, scanning the surroundings. "Go after her how? Qing Chan's a True Immortal and I'm just a Supreme. Forget catching her—I can't even sense where she is."

He was about to resume his lessons when he felt Qing Chan's aura flicker briefly nearby.

He looked up. On purpose?

He glanced at Ning Xue'er. Never mind—he should go find this little ancestor first. She was the real prize. Win her completely, and the entire Azure Lotus Divine Palace would be his.

"I'll go look for her. Wait here."

Setting Ning Xue'er down, he headed toward where the aura had flickered. He didn't get far before the world shifted—he was yanked into a pocket of folded space. Qing Chan stood before him, wearing an unmistakable pout.

Qin Jiang stepped forward and pulled her into his arms. She wriggled briefly, then gave up.

"Unhappy?"

"Hmph. Look at my face."

Qin Jiang leaned back, studied her features, then reached up and stretched her cheeks into a smile. "See? You look perfectly happy."

"Stop it~" She swatted his hand, exasperated. So childish.

He laughed. "Xue'er said you're jealous, but I don't think that's it."

With this many women around him, if jealousy was the issue, it would have come up long ago. Qing Chan confirmed with a small nod.

"So what's bothering you?"

She placed her hands on his shoulders. "If you know it's not jealousy, then guess."

'Did all women do this? Force you to guess?' Even True Immortals weren't above it, apparently.

He thought back. She'd seemed off since the Chaos District. It was probably about—

"You feel like I don't trust you?"

"Oh?" She looked surprised. "You read me that well?"

"Of course. After these past few days, we know each other inside and out."

Qing Chan's cheeks colored, and she gave his chest a light smack. "Don't change the subject. You don't trust me, do you?"

"That's true." He nodded.

"..."

Just going to admit it like that?

He looked at her with some helplessness. "Trust has to be earned over time. We've known each other, what—a few days? Even with our... thorough communication, that's just a beginning. Can you honestly say you trust me completely?"

"Yes!" Qing Chan nodded. "You're this handsome—of course I trust you."

"..."

Right. He'd forgotten he was dealing with a face-worshipper—one whose obsession had literally become the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's first criterion for recruitment.

"I gave you my purity—hundreds of thousands of years of it—and you still don't trust me?" Qing Chan said reproachfully.

That gave him pause. She was right. A woman had given him her most precious virtue, and he was still keeping walls up. It hadn't always been this way. Somewhere along the line, with so many women in his life, he'd started taking this for granted.

"Hey, what are you spacing out for?" Qing Chan waved a hand before his eyes.

He caught it, smiled, and said: "You're right. Not trusting you was my mistake."

He ruffled her hair, then pivoted. "But you're not blameless either."

"How so?"

"Remember—you kidnapped me. And you're far stronger than I am. Can you blame me for being cautious?"

"..." She blinked, then murmured: "Oh... right. I did kidnap you. A little wariness is fair."

"Exactly. This whole thing is your fault. You gave my heart a scare from the very beginning, and I still can't fully trust you. You should take full responsibility!"

"I'm sorry. It's my fault." Guilt tinged her voice.

Qin Jiang waved magnanimously. "I forgive you."

"Really?" Her eyes brightened. "Does that mean you trust me now?"

"We'll see how you do. The better you treat me, the faster the trust builds."

"What counts as treating me well?"

"For starters, keeping me safe. And also—tying up Ning Xue'er and the others and delivering them to my bed."

"I already tied up Xue'er for you!"

Qing Chan peered through the folded space. There was Ning Xue'er, eyes darting about, clearly plotting her escape.

"She's running!"

In the next instant, Qing Chan grabbed Qin Jiang and hurled him through the air—landing him directly in front of Ning Xue'er.

"Holy—!" Qin Jiang stumbled in surprise.

Ning Xue'er shrieked. Seeing it was him, she blinked. "Did Qing Chan throw you? I told you she was mad! Did you not manage to calm her down? Want me to help? Just untie me and—"

"She's realized the error of her ways."

"???"
