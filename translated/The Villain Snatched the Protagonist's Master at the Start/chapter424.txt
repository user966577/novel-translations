They sat across from each other, chatting casually. Qin Jiang made no move to advance, which let Yue Weiwei's nerves settle somewhat — until he asked:

"You have a junior brother, don't you?"

Her heart jolted. She glanced at him, then nodded. "I do."

"I hear he's been pursuing you?"

"Mm. But I don't have feelings for him. I've always just treated him as a junior brother."

She added a few extra sentences, almost as if explaining herself. After she finished, she snuck a look at Qin Jiang. Seeing no change in his expression, she quietly exhaled.

"So it's a one-sided thing on his end," Qin Jiang said.

Yue Weiwei hesitated. "Not exactly. He hasn't been too persistent about it. He occasionally sends me gifts and makes his feelings known, but most of the time he's busy with his own affairs."

"I see." Qin Jiang nodded, then fixed her with a look. "And you've been helping him?"

"He's my junior brother. Before Master went into seclusion, she told me to look after him..."

"So you helped him create an anti-Huaxia alliance?"

"Yes."

She nodded and continued. "He was taken in by my master about a year ago. His family was destroyed because of Huaxia, and they were even framed — accused of being the source of the chaos."

"And you believed that?"

"There are plenty of rumors saying Huaxia engineered the unrest to conquer the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. I thought they had some merit."

"Oh?" Qin Jiang smiled, regarding her with open amusement. "Do you know who I am?"

"Hm?"

"Allow me to introduce myself. I am the Lord of Huaxia — Qin Jiang."

Yue Weiwei's face went rigid. Black Dragon and his people had abducted her, but she'd genuinely had no idea they were Huaxia's. She'd assumed Qin Jiang was some young lord from a powerful family.

The Lord of Huaxia. And she'd just...

"You think those rumors have merit?" he asked, still smiling.

She clenched her fists, sat in silence for a moment, then managed: "There's some logic to them. But rumors are just rumors. Most of the time, they can't be trusted."

"These rumors — they came from your junior brother?"

"Yes."

The Child of Destiny's name was Nangong Yun, heir of the Nangong family. The Nangong family had been wiped out by Huaxia for spreading the truth about the chaos. Nangong Yun barely escaped, was found by Yue Weiwei's master, and taken in as a disciple out of pity. He'd been given the alias Gu Yun to avoid Huaxia's pursuit.

After the master went into seclusion, Nangong Yun — far bolder than anyone anticipated — founded the anti-Huaxia alliance. He'd even managed to rally survivors from other destroyed families.

A gift-wrapped target, really. Gathering all of Huaxia's enemies in one convenient location saved Huaxia the trouble of hunting them down individually. One clean sweep.

Yue Weiwei had merely been following her master's instructions to support him. As for the anti-Huaxia alliance itself, in Huaxia's eyes, it was barely more than children playing house. If not for Qin Jiang's explicit orders to leave them alone, Huaxia would have exterminated the lot long ago. Nangong Yun might escape thanks to his Child of Destiny fortune, but everyone else would be dead.

Yue Weiwei was only a Great Emperor — yet she ranked among the alliance's top combatants. That was how weak they were.

"Weiwei..." Qin Jiang couldn't help but ask. "Do you have any idea how strong Huaxia is?"

How had she dared — alongside some Supreme Realm nobody — to create an anti-Huaxia alliance? Was this the Child of Destiny's intelligence-draining aura at work?

She blinked, then nodded. "I do. The number one power in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. An Immortal King at the helm, numerous True Immortals, and over a hundred Human Immortals."

"And your anti-Huaxia alliance?"

"Three Great Emperors, sixteen Supremes, and some Saints..."

She trailed off, face reddening as the absurdity sank in. That gap. What on earth had possessed her to think this was a good idea?

Qin Jiang couldn't suppress a laugh. Yue Weiwei's blush deepened. It really was kind of funny.

"Your master is decent — a Human Immortal. But do you know how many Human Immortals have fallen at Huaxia's hands?"

Yue Weiwei's head snapped up, alarm written across her face. "My master has nothing to do with this! It was all my and my junior brother's idea!"

"Your idea?" Qin Jiang shook his head. "Do you know Huaxia's code?"

"What code?"

"One person sins — nine clans perish."

"!!!"

The color drained from her face. She was an orphan, raised by her master since childhood. They'd lived in seclusion, just the two of them — a quiet, simple life she'd loved.

And now, because of one junior brother and a reckless anti-Huaxia alliance, her master might be dragged into this.

Panic and self-recrimination flooded through her. Why had she ever helped create that stupid alliance? Huaxia had been minding its own business — why antagonize it?

But it was too late for regret. She looked at Qin Jiang. His smile had faded, replaced by something colder — a regal authority that suggested a single word from him could decide the fate of millions.

Tears welled in her eyes, threatening to spill.

Then Qin Jiang stood, walked to her, and tilted her chin up with one finger. His lips curved into a faint smile.

"Huaxia's code was established by me. And only I can override it."

He leaned in, close enough that his breath fell on her lips. Her hands balled into fists, her heart hammering.

Looking at his approaching face, feeling his warmth — she closed her eyes. Her body tensed, chin lifting slightly, lips parting, as if waiting for him.

But the contact never came. After a long moment, she opened her eyes. He'd taken her hand and pulled her to her feet, bowing slightly with a smile.

"Whether Huaxia's code gets enforced... depends on your performance."
