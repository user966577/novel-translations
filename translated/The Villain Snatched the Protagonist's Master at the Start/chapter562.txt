Looking at Shanshan's guileless face, a twinge of guilt flickered through Qin Jiang's mind.

It was quickly replaced by excitement.

He glanced down, licked his lips, then asked, "Actually, I'm curious about Merfolk physiology. How does a fish tail become human legs?"

"Huh? You're not Merfolk?"

"I'm human."

"Human?" Shanshan's mouth fell open. She studied him carefully. "You look the same as us."

"In the ocean, we'd be different. And even now, there are differences."

"Where?"

"Underwater, I wouldn't grow a fish tail. As for right now—want to see?"

"Sure!"

"Heh heh. Let's compare."

Qin Jiang grinned. They couldn't very well compare through their clothes, so those would have to go. In broad daylight, Shanshan felt a bit self-conscious, so she brought him to her room instead—at least there she'd feel safer.

And so, Shanshan began her very serious anatomical comparison.

"We really are different!"

She studied him, then studied herself, unable to suppress a gasp of surprise. And for some reason, the parts where they differed seemed to exert a strange pull on her.

"Don't you feel like even though we're different, the differences actually complement each other perfectly?"

She looked more carefully and nodded with genuine wonder. "It really does seem that way."

"Want to try fitting them together?"

"Sure!"

She leaned in and hugged him, attempting the experiment. But after several tries, she couldn't figure it out. Her brow furrowed as she looked up at him with a pout.

"They don't seem to fit after all."

"Silly girl." He laughed and pinched her cheek, then lifted her by the thighs. "Let me help."

He guided her through the process. Shanshan's face reddened as she clung to his neck, her body squirming slightly.

"It feels so strange~"

He smiled, one hand supporting her, the other at her waist. "Shanshan, relax."

"Okay~"

She was shy but not nervous—her ignorance shielded her from anxiety. She relaxed easily.

"Good girl."

In the next moment, her expression tightened. Pain flickered across her features and she clutched him hard, eyes misting over. He was hurting her?

"Don't be scared. It's supposed to hurt at first."

His gentle voice calmed her. He rubbed her back soothingly, and she bit her lip, trusting him. Someone this handsome wouldn't lie to her.

Sure enough, the pain faded quickly. What replaced it made her face bloom with warmth. She looked at his lips and kissed him, then began moving instinctively.

Her instincts awakened, though her movements were clumsy—rough enough that she risked hurting herself. Qin Jiang matched her pace carefully, keeping things under control.

About two hours later, Shanshan had been going at it like she was possessed, her body coiled tightly around his. Eventually, she went limp in his arms.

He sat down and settled her on his lap. She gazed up at him with unfocused eyes, still savoring the afterglow. He kissed her cheek and tweaked her nose. "How was it? Did you like it?"

"Mm~" She wrapped her arms around his neck, nodding. "I liked it. I liked it so much~ Way better than kissing~"

"So we fit together perfectly after all?"

"We really do." She beamed with delighted surprise, then giggled. "We're so compatible—we must be meant for each other."

"If we're talking about compatibility, I fit together with a lot of people this way."

"Huh?" Her face fell. She wasn't the only one?

Qin Jiang flicked her nose gently. "If it were just you, I'd probably wear you out."

"Oh~ Then how many people are you compatible with?"

"About a thousand."

"That many?" Her jaw dropped. The disappointment deepened.

"But you're the only Merfolk."

It was probably temporary, but for now, it was true. Her eyes regained some of their sparkle. The only Merfolk—that was at least special.

"Do you like Merfolk?"

"I like Shanshan. Though I'll admit Merfolk are a bit different from humans."

"How so?"

"The sensation is different. Want to find out? We could try again."

"Yes, please!"

She agreed without a moment's hesitation, and he carried her to the bed. She looked confused—before, they'd been standing.

"There are lots of ways to do this."

"Oh." Her eyes went wide with curiosity. She wanted to try them all.

"Then... go ahead~"

He smiled, leaned down, and kissed her softly. "I'll show you every way there is."

"Mm, okay~"

She kissed him back, losing herself in it instantly. This time, Qin Jiang took the lead—not as rough, but more instructive. Teaching her things.

Another four hours passed. Shanshan was exhausted from learning, but Qin Jiang kept going. She forced herself to keep up.

Finally, when he'd imparted everything he had to teach, class was over. He looked down at her and smiled. "How'd you do?"

"Not bad."

"What I taught you today was just the basics. Memorize it all?"

"The basics? Got it~"
