Looking at Qin Jiang, the Pill Emperor blinked. "You have some serious misconceptions about yourself."

Qin Jiang paused, then brightened. "You mean I'm not actually depraved on the surface either?"

The Pill Emperor: "..."

'Oh, the misconception is even worse than I thought.'

"What I mean is—you're depraved on the surface and on the inside."

"Uh..."

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched, his expression deflating. They'd been together for only two days—how had she figured that out already?

He touched his own face. Surely "depraved" wasn't literally written there?

The Pill Emperor caught the gesture and raised an eyebrow. "Well, now I know. Your depravity is plastered all over your face."

Qin Jiang: "???"

---

Several hours later.

Qin Jiang emerged from the room. Jian Yao and the others were already in the courtyard, and he greeted them with his usual easy smile.

Just then—

A door slammed. Everyone turned toward the sound and saw Qin Lian'er stomping out, her face a mask of righteous indignation. She glared at Qin Jiang, fuming silently.

From night to day, from day to night—nonstop. Was he not going to let anyone rest?

Qin Jiang regarded his little sister's angry face with nothing but concern. "What's wrong, Lian'er? Who upset my precious little sister? Tell your big brother—I'll straighten them out!"

Lian'er: "..."

She shot him a withering look, huffed, and turned away. She had zero interest in speaking to him right now.

'Like a stallion. Honestly.'

Besides, she wasn't that young anymore. Living in this kind of atmosphere, she couldn't help having... thoughts. But she was Qin Jiang's sister. Participating was out of the question, which meant she could only secretly...

It was beyond frustrating.

She snuck a glance at Qin Jiang, and a wistful sigh escaped her. 'Why did I have to be his sister?'

A man this outstanding, and she couldn't have him. What a waste.

Lian'er grumbled internally, sighing every few seconds, feeling genuine resentment toward her own identity for the first time. Worse, with Qin Jiang as the standard, every other man fell laughably short.

"Am I going to be single forever?" she muttered.

Then again, she still wanted to try...

The thought sent her eyes sliding toward Qin Jiang again. A daring idea whispered through her mind:

'What if... I knocked him out somehow? Just a little taste—he'd never know, so it wouldn't really count, right?'

Lian'er's eyes lit up.

Once the idea took root, it refused to leave. Cultivators were supposed to follow their hearts, after all.

'But he's too strong. How would I even knock him out?'

She pondered the problem. Qin Jiang was only at the Saint Realm on paper, but Lian'er knew better than anyone how many trump cards he held. Even if he had zero guard up around her, it wouldn't be easy.

Then, a spark of fire flashed between her brows.

Her face went blank with surprise before lighting up with glee. She hurried to communicate with the Immortal Fire in her mind.

'You have a way to knock out big brother?'

'Uh... there's a condition? You want me to feed you so you can take physical form faster? You want to be big brother's wife too?'

Lian'er blinked. That was perfectly fine by her. She'd already discussed this with Qin Jiang ages ago, and the Immortal Fire had said the timing wasn't right. Apparently it was worried she'd forget, so it was raising the issue again now.

Lian'er nodded solemnly. "Don't worry! I'll definitely make you one of big brother's wives!"

There was also Little Red, who spent most of her time in seclusion these days. She'd probably achieve human form soon, and when she did—another wife for big brother.

As for herself... she could only sneak around.

While she was secretly conspiring with the Immortal Fire, Qin Jiang strolled over and ruffled her hair. "What are you muttering about over here?"

"Huh?"

Lian'er nearly jumped out of her skin. She spun around, saw it was Qin Jiang, and immediately felt guilty. Averting her eyes, she stammered: "N-nothing."

Before he could press further, she shot to her feet and bolted for the courtyard exit. "Big bro, I've got something to do. Going out!"

"Wait—let me send someone to—"

She was gone before he finished the sentence.

Qin Jiang frowned. "What's gotten into that girl?"

He turned to the others. "Yao'er, go keep an eye on Lian'er."

"Alright." Jian Yao nodded and vanished on the spot.

All the women were fond of Lian'er. They'd never let anything happen to her.

By evening, Lian'er and Jian Yao returned to the Palace. The moment she was back, Lian'er dove into her room without so much as a glance at Qin Jiang.

He stared after her, baffled. He turned to Jian Yao. "What did she go out to do?"

"Nothing much. She bought a bunch of odd spirit herbs. Said she wanted to study alchemy."

"Alchemy?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "She wants to learn alchemy and doesn't come to me? Trying to figure it out on her own?"

"Maybe she doesn't rate your skills."

Qin Jiang: "..."

He mulled it over for a moment, then walked to Lian'er's room and knocked. "Lian'er, need your big brother's help with alchemy?"

"No!" came the immediate reply. "The Immortal Fire is teaching me."

Qin Jiang blinked. The Immortal Fire knew alchemy? Then again, it was supposed to be Xiao Fan's fated treasure—the protagonist's path probably involved alchemy, so it made sense for the fire to have that knowledge. If it could tutor a Child of Destiny, it could certainly teach Lian'er.

He relaxed. "If you get stuck, come ask your big brother."

"Okay~"
