The next day, the city lord brought Qin Jiang to a room, claiming he had a big surprise waiting.

"What kind of surprise?"

"Heh heh. Go inside and you'll see. I guarantee you'll love it."

Curiosity piqued—maybe the man had a hidden treasure?—Qin Jiang pushed open the door. A folding screen stood just inside, someone's silhouette visible behind it. He raised an eyebrow and stepped in.

The door closed behind him. The screen parted to reveal a plush bed, upon which a voluptuous woman lay on her side. The figure was impressive.

Her expression was a mix of reluctance and melancholy. But the instant her eyes found Qin Jiang, they lit up like lanterns. She stared and swallowed hard.

She hadn't wanted to do this. As the city lord's wife, she had principles. Then again, principles were negotiable—and she'd just met someone worth negotiating for.

She lifted the hem of her dress, revealing a shapely leg and a tantalizing glimpse of what lay beyond.

Qin Jiang understood. This was the "surprise"—the city lord had actually sent his wife. But compared to his own women, she barely met the minimum threshold. Better to save his energy for them.

He shook his head and turned to leave.

She'd been posing provocatively, and seeing him turn away, panic flooded her face. Abandoning all pretense, she scrambled off the bed and threw her arms around him from behind.

"Don't go~"

Her voice was soft and urgent. Her arms clung tight, and the substantial pressure against his back made Qin Jiang's pulse jump.

She seemed genuinely desperate, pressing herself against him.

He grasped her wrists and gently pried her off, turning to face her. "Did the city lord force you into this?"

"No." She shook her head vigorously and grabbed him from the front. "I'm the city lord's wife. I came willingly."

"The city lord's wife?" Qin Jiang was genuinely surprised. The man had really sent his own wife? "Wait—something's off." He held her at arm's length, studying her. "You're really the city lord's wife?"

"Mm."

"Then how are you still a maiden? Did the city lord pressure you into claiming to be his wife?"

Qin Jiang's eye for these things was unerring. This woman was unmistakably untouched. The city lord probably wanted to bribe him but couldn't bear to part with his actual wife, so he'd found a stand-in.

It seemed the messenger had faithfully relayed his comment about liking married women. The city lord had taken it literally.

The woman hesitated, then spoke. "My lord, I truly am his wife. It's just... he can't perform."

Her voice dropped on those last words—preserving some shred of the city lord's dignity.

"Can't perform?"

She nodded. "It's a birth defect. Even after reaching Immortal King, he couldn't overcome it. That's why, despite being married... I'm still untouched."

The spoiler system had mentioned this city lord, but this detail had never come up. The storyline centered on Children of Destiny, and the protagonist had no way of knowing about the city lord's condition.

As Qin Jiang processed this, the woman grabbed him again, looking up. "Everything I've said is true."

He quietly activated a divine ability. She wasn't lying.

Seeing his silence, she pressed closer, afraid he'd reject her. "I'm clean. The city lord married me precisely because of his condition—he felt inferior and didn't want people talking. In practice, we have no real relationship. I help maintain appearances; he provides a comfortable life. We barely even see each other. My lord—I've never been touched. I haven't even had my first kiss."

She tightened her embrace, trembling. "Please... I need this~"

After years of an empty marriage, she truly needed a man. That was the only reason she'd agreed to the city lord's arrangement.

Everything she'd said was truthful. Qin Jiang licked his lips. Something was stirring.

She felt the change immediately, pressed herself against it, her eyes going hazy. "My lord, I really am clean. I won't dirty you. Please... give it to me~"

"How clean?"

His arms encircled her. The feel of her was exceptional.

She blushed. "When I've had... needs, I've handled them myself. He's never touched me. This is the first time I've ever been this close to a man."

"Really?"

"Mm~"

She nodded and rose on tiptoe to kiss him. But with zero experience, it was more gnawing than kissing. Qin Jiang had to stop her before she drew blood.

She flinched, thinking he was disgusted. "Everything I said is true~"

"I believe you." He smiled, tilting her chin up. "But you can't bite my lips off, either."

"I..."

Her face went crimson. Then Qin Jiang leaned down and kissed her properly.

She stiffened for an instant, then responded—clumsily, eagerly, disastrously.

When they finally separated, she'd gone boneless in his arms. Just a kiss felt this good? Then what came next...

She looked up, eyes burning. Her voice turned sultry. "My lord... I want more~"
