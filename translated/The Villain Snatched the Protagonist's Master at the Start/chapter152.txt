The Grand Commander gritted his teeth, his head bowed. He shot a venomous look at the men with severed arms standing off to the side.

'This is all their fault. Couldn't keep their damn mouths shut!'

His eyes flashed. He took a deep breath and spoke.

"Senior, these men are wanted criminals of the Heavenly Pill Palace. We'd assumed they'd fled long ago—never expected them to show up so brazenly in broad daylight! Fortunately, Senior stepped in and apprehended them. The Heavenly Pill Palace owes you a great debt, and we shall express our gratitude accordingly!"

Before his words had even settled, he flipped his palm and produced a collection of medicinal pills—every last one at the Supreme Realm level or above. His heart bled as he shoved the entire batch toward Qin Jiang.

"Consider these a token of our appreciation."

Qin Jiang caught them with a wave of his hand and raised an eyebrow at the Grand Commander. The man was willing to hemorrhage resources—there was even an Emperor Pill in the mix. And his ability to flip the narrative on a dime was worthy of a Great Emperor's cunning.

"The Heavenly Pill Palace certainly has sharp eyes," Qin Jiang said with a grin.

The Grand Commander's mouth twitched. He could hear the mockery plain as day, but what could he do? Facing an immortal-path cultivator, he could only swallow his pride and even manage a stiff smile: "It's all thanks to your group's assistance."

Qin Jiang pocketed the pills, and the Grand Commander finally exhaled. If they were accepting gifts, that meant they were open to talking.

He looked at Qin Jiang cautiously. "Might the young master be here for the Myriad Pill Assembly?"

Many powerful factions sent representatives during the Assembly to observe and recruit promising alchemists once the competition concluded.

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile.

The Grand Commander relaxed further. If they had a purpose here, they were unlikely to cause more chaos. He offered: "If there's an alchemist who catches your eye, the Heavenly Pill Palace would be happy to arrange an introduction."

"Is that so?" Qin Jiang's interest piqued. He grinned. "I've taken a liking to the Pill Emperor. Can you introduce me?"

The Grand Commander's expression froze. The Pill Emperor was the Palace Master herself—she'd never join another faction.

He forced an awkward laugh. "You jest, young master. The Pill Emperor is our Palace Master. She wouldn't join an outside power."

Qin Jiang smiled noncommittally and didn't push the issue. He waved his hand. "Fine. Consider this matter closed. Handle the rest however you see fit."

"Of course, young master."

The Grand Commander nodded, then directed the enforcers to haul away the armless men. Once that was done, he noticed Qin Jiang showed no signs of leaving. Worried something else might go wrong, he asked tentatively: "Does the young master need a guide?"

"A guide?" This wasn't exactly a tourist destination, but Qin Jiang's gaze drifted to the Heavenly Pill Palace Saintess standing nearby. "She'll do."

"The Saintess..." The Grand Commander's expression turned peculiar. Only now did it dawn on him that every single person around Qin Jiang was a stunning beauty. Had his Saintess caught the young man's eye too?

Entirely possible. She was a looker, after all.

Wait—

It hit him suddenly. Qin Jiang had said he'd taken a liking to the Pill Emperor. Had he meant her looks, not her alchemical talents?

A chill ran through him. If this man could control even an immortal-path powerhouse, and he set his sights on the Pill Emperor...

She probably couldn't resist.

After all, the Pill Emperor had zero experience in that department.

But the immediate problem was the Saintess.

The Saintess was watching Qin Jiang warily, still reeling from the revelation. Who could've guessed that behind this young man stood not only a Great Emperor but an immortal-path cultivator?

And from the very beginning, he'd made his intentions clear—he wanted her as his woman.

Being told to play guide was obviously a pretense. The real purpose was self-evident.

"Saintess, if you would," the Grand Commander said.

He knew Qin Jiang likely had ulterior motives, but he couldn't refuse. Besides, if the Saintess actually managed to form a connection with the young man, it might benefit the Palace in the long run.

Like the Grand Commander, the Saintess didn't dare refuse either. She nodded.

She was already consoling herself internally.

"Where would you like to go?" she asked Qin Jiang.

Instead of answering, he asked: "What's your name?"

The Saintess paused, then replied: "Dan Yu."

Qin Jiang nodded and walked over to her side with a smile. "I hear the Heavenly Pill Palace has some excellent restaurants. Take me to one?"

"A restaurant?" Dan Yu bit her lip. Restaurants were for eating and lodging, but judging by Qin Jiang's intentions, food was clearly not what he was after.

She steeled herself. "You don't need a guide for that."

"Sure I do. I'm broke. Take me there and spot me the bill."

"It's complimentary."

"That won't do." Qin Jiang shook his head. "A man of my stature, eating for free? That's an insult."

Dan Yu: "..."

'Free food isn't good enough, but you want me to pay? And after I pay, you probably want to "experience a humble lifestyle" too, right? Getting every possible benefit out of this!'

Her face cycled through several shades as panic crept in. Dealing with a shameless rogue who also happened to be backed by overwhelming force left her with absolutely no sense of security.

Under Qin Jiang's relentless pressure, she could only grit her teeth. "Fine. I'll take you."

Even as she said it, a wave of resignation washed over her. She'd already mentally prepared herself for the worst.

She glanced at Qin Jiang. The one silver lining was that he was undeniably handsome—which made whatever was about to happen slightly less unbearable.

---

As Qin Jiang left with the Saintess, the Grand Commander wasted no time. He dove straight into the Palace's inner sanctum and summoned every high-ranking member. Even the Palace Master herself was alerted.

"Palace Master—we have a situation."

The Pill Emperor's expression was calm. Incidents during the Myriad Pill Assembly were par for the course. "What happened?"

The Grand Commander took a deep breath, his voice grave: "An immortal-path powerhouse has appeared in Pill City."

The air went still. Every eye turned to him. Before anyone could press for details, he continued: "And this immortal-path powerhouse has had a direct conflict with our Heavenly Pill Palace."

The frozen atmosphere shattered into chaos. Even the Pill Emperor's aura wavered.

"However, the matter has been resolved."

Hearts that had leapt into throats began to settle—but before the relief could fully take hold, the Grand Commander added: "But..."

Every gaze locked onto him again. The emotional whiplash was getting unbearable.

"The Saintess has been taken."
