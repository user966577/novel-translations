He held her gently and tested the waters. "Lan'er..."

"Hm?"

A flicker of surprise crossed Yu Lan's face. It was the first time he'd called her that. But... it didn't sound bad. She certainly didn't mind.

Seeing no objection, Qin Jiang's spirits lifted. He hesitated for a moment, then pressed on. "Lan'er, if I'd lied to you... would you still want me to treat you?"

"Lied to me?"

Yu Lan's expression turned peculiar. Her brow creased, eyes blinking. "You mean about the remaining toxins?"

She assumed his "lie" referred to the bloodline poison—that he knew the threat was gone but kept claiming otherwise to justify more sessions.

Qin Jiang stared at her, caught off guard.

Reading his reaction, Yu Lan took the initiative, wrapping her arms around him. Her fondness for him swelled another degree.

"Silly. Don't you think I know my own body? The poison stopped being a real threat days ago. I kept agreeing to treatment because—can't you tell how I feel?"

A rosy blush spread across her cheeks.

Qin Jiang went quiet. He understood her meaning perfectly.

But that wasn't the lie he'd been referring to.

Still, her response made one thing crystal clear: she had genuine feelings for him now. She was openly hinting at it.

Looking at the softly blushing empress, Qin Jiang shook his head and spoke in a low voice.

"The truth is... I've been deceiving you from the very start."

The warmth in Yu Lan's eyes flickered. She searched his face, unease rising.

From the very start?

Her fingers tightened. She pressed her lips together and waited.

"I didn't save your people. No Snake Race soldiers ever found Ru'er and the others. I came in by seeing through your formation and breaking it open myself. Everything you were told was a story Ru'er and I concocted to win your trust."

His voice was quiet and even.

Yu Lan went rigid, as though struck by lightning.

It was all fabricated? And Ru'er had helped him deceive her?

"Ru'er didn't betray you willingly. From the beginning, I set my sights on both of you. I pressured her—forced her hand. She had no choice—your people's safety hung in the balance, and she couldn't fight back. As for how she feels now... ask her yourself. I don't think she hates me. I suspect she never did. She's got a wonderful personality—a bit fiery, a bit bold, but soft underneath. I'm quite fond of her, actually. And a little adorably gullible. She went along with the scheme to trick you mostly because I talked her into it."

He chuckled.

He glanced at Yu Lan. She'd recovered from the initial shock. Her expression was complicated, but she made no move to lash out—just listened in silence.

"Every good impression you have of me was manufactured. The heroic rescue story was designed to build rapport fast. Your bloodline poison—I had plenty of ways to cure it. But you're too beautiful. Your beauty was reason enough, so I chose the dual cultivation method. The pure, righteous man you thought you saw? Heh. I'm nothing like that. To everyone else, I'm greedy, lustful, depraved. Like right now."

He paused, drew a deep breath, and let something dark and predatory surface in his eyes.

The sudden shift unsettled Yu Lan.

He cupped her chin and tipped her face up, his smile sharp-edged. "There. Now you know everything. But it doesn't change a thing—you and your sister are both mine. My women."

Before she could respond, he dipped his head and kissed her. Hard. Demanding. He took his time before pulling away, rising from the bed in one fluid motion. Mo Mo was still waiting for him.

Yu Lan lay there, slightly dazed. She watched his departing back, a bitter smile tugging at her lips.

"Greedy, lustful, depraved..."

She murmured the words he'd used on himself. Then she shook her head and whispered, "At least... you're honest."

Her voice carried a note of melancholy. She'd rather not have known. But the beautiful image in her heart had been a deliberate construction all along.

Just as she was lost in thought, a knock sounded at the door. Yu Lan frowned—it wasn't Qin Jiang. He'd have walked straight in.

"Sister, are you asleep?"

Yu Ru's voice, from outside.

Yu Lan exhaled. A pause. "No. Come in."

The door opened. Yu Ru crept inside, shut it behind her, and watched her sister with cautious eyes. Qin Jiang had made a detour to her room, and she'd expected the worst—but instead, he told her he'd confessed everything to Yu Lan.

Yu Ru had immediately exploded, biting and clawing at him in a frenzy of outrage. Only after venting thoroughly and chasing him out did she come here.

Yu Lan regarded her younger sister. This girl had conspired with Qin Jiang to deceive her.

"You know everything, don't you, Sister?"

Yu Ru's voice was small and tentative.

Yu Lan's face was stern. She nodded. Qin Jiang had claimed he'd coerced Yu Ru, but the girl hadn't given her a single hint. Yu Lan strongly suspected the schemer had been a willing participant—that she'd deliberately served her sister up on a silver platter.

She fixed Yu Ru with a sharp look.

Yu Ru shrank back. She was about to explain when Yu Lan cut in.

"You helped a stranger trick your own sister! I treated you so well, and this is how you repay me? Even if you were threatened, couldn't you have given me some kind of signal?"

Hearing the scolding, Yu Ru blinked. 'I was threatened?'

That... didn't sound right. But she was quick on the uptake—Qin Jiang had covered for her.

Her eyes blinked innocently, and she slipped on her most aggrieved expression. "Sister, you don't know how scary Qin Jiang is! If I'd tipped you off, he definitely would've noticed, and then our people..."

Yu Ru laid it on thick.

In truth, Yu Lan wasn't all that angry anymore. The earlier lecture had burned through most of her fury. She listened to Yu Ru's excuses, drew a long breath—none of this mattered now. What was done was done. What mattered was the present.

She looked at her sister. "Ru'er, how do you truly feel about Qin Jiang?"
