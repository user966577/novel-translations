Lin Chen's body continued to decay. Wisps of light emerged, and then a short, pudgy spectral figure materialized from the corpse.

"Ugh." Qin Lian'er made a face. This apparition looked barely better than the rotting body.

"Brother, what happened to Lin Chen?" she asked, bewildered. Had her brother really been practicing some dark art?

Qin Jiang studied the specter. "Lin Chen died a long time ago. What's been living inside his body was just a cuckoo in a stolen nest—a parasitic primordial spirit."

He swept his arm, yanking the spirit toward him. It flickered in and out of existence, looking like it might dissolve at any moment. At its center, however, a bright point of light pulsed with a faint glow.

Qin Jiang plunged his hand into the primordial spirit. The tearing pain jolted "Lin Chen" awake. Seeing Qin Jiang, his eyes filled with terror.

"Qin Jiang, spare me! I was a Great Emperor once—I'm useful! I can serve you. I'll be your slave! Please don't kill me!"

The spirit begged frantically. He didn't want to die. He'd already died once, and having clawed his way back to life, the thought of dying again was unbearable.

"Too ugly. You're an eyesore," Qin Jiang said flatly.

His hand closed around the glowing point within the spirit. Its weight surprised him—dense with power. He braced himself and wrenched it free.

The spirit shrieked. Its already translucent form went completely transparent.

The light rested quietly in Qin Jiang's palm, pulsing softly. He didn't know what it was, but from the spoilers, he knew that "Lin Chen" had used this very thing to become a Great Emperor. Even after death, it had kept his primordial spirit alive. This was definitely something valuable.

"System, do you have an appraisal function?"

The system was silent for a beat, then replied: 【For the right price, yes. Appraisal available.】

"Seriously? What is this light?"

【Villain Points.】

"Fine."

A mere ten thousand points—pocket change for Qin Jiang.

【Points deducted. Appraising... Appraisal complete!】

"Well? Spit it out."

【Immortal Path Seed.】

"In plain language, please."

【An Immortal Path Seed can be nurtured into an Immortal Path Law. Like a Great Emperor Law, an Immortal Path Law can cultivate a single Immortal Path powerhouse.】

Qin Jiang's face lit up. He'd been worrying about exactly this. Beyond the Heavenly Mystery Continent lay far stronger beings, and above the Nine Heavens, Immortal Path powerhouses existed. Without one in their ranks, the Qin family would always be vulnerable. But if they could produce an Immortal Path powerhouse—that changed everything.

【The Host may place the seed beside the Immortal Marrow. Within one month, it will successfully mature into an Immortal Path Law.】

Qin Jiang nodded appreciatively. "How thoughtful."

He didn't even have to ask—the system was answering preemptively now. Credit where credit was due.

Storing the Immortal Path Seed, Qin Jiang turned his gaze back to the weakened spirit. Stripped of its Great Emperor Law and Immortal Path Seed, "Lin Chen" was at death's door. Qin Jiang regarded the pathetic figure with contempt, then struck with a single palm. The spirit didn't even have time to scream before it disintegrated completely—body and soul, utterly annihilated.

Immediately, the system chimed: 【Host has altered a major plotline. Rewards: Time-Space Disc fragment; Emperor-grade Airship (capable of traversing the Chaos); Assorted specialty stockings—white silk, black silk, sheer, and more (wearing increases cultivation speed and attack speed); Emperor-grade Bloodline Pill x10 (enhances beast bloodline, breaks through Great Emperor bottleneck); Villain Points: [credited].】

Lin Chen was barely dead and the rewards were already flooding in.

The Time-Space Disc fragment—an old friend by now. Qin Jiang didn't even bother looking at it. As for the Emperor-grade Airship, was the system preparing him for life beyond the Heavenly Mystery Continent?

His real interest, though, was the third reward. Assorted stockings? And multiple pairs? The effects were decent enough—increased cultivation speed and attack speed—though he wasn't entirely sure the "attack speed" part was meant seriously.

The cultivation speed boost alone made them worthwhile. His own cultivation speed was never the issue—that depended entirely on his mood. But his women would inevitably fall behind. These stockings might help close the gap somewhat.

The Emperor-grade Bloodline Pills were beast-only, capable of shattering the Great Emperor bottleneck. After taking one, a beast could advance straight to Great Emperor with no obstacles. Black Dragon needed one—despite having refined the Ancestral Dragon Blood Essence, he was still too weak and kept embarrassing Qin Jiang at critical moments. The Void Beast deserved one too. His personal mount should be at least a Great Emperor. Anything less was beneath his dignity. The remaining pills could wait.

"System, I've noticed that your rewards always give me the least useful stuff."

After a pause, the system replied: 【The Host is already perfect. This system's primary mission is to help those around the Host keep pace with his growth. Otherwise, when the Host reaches the pinnacle, he will stand there alone.】

"Was that a compliment?" Qin Jiang's face broke into a broad grin. Flattery or not, everyone loved hearing nice things.

【Yes. The Host is perfect.】

Qin Jiang was practically glowing. "System, I love that about you—so honest, always telling the truth."

【...】

Satisfied, he was about to head back when the system spoke again: 【Host has completed a hidden mission. Lin Chen's fortune will be transferred to the Qin family.】

Qin Jiang blinked, then broke into a smile. Fortune—intangible as it was—had very real effects.

"Transfer it. Now!"

He glanced at Lin Chen's rotting corpse, then asked, "System, does killing a Child of Destiny always yield fortune?"

The first time he'd gained fortune was from a system mission; killing Xiao Fan had just been incidental. This time, it came after killing Lin Chen. Ye Xuan, on the other hand, had been psychologically destroyed but hadn't yielded any fortune.

【A Child of Destiny who submits to the Host can also yield fortune. Ye Xuan has been detected pining for the Host day and night. He has submitted. His fortune is available for collection. Collect?】

Qin Jiang's expression froze. Pining for him day and night? What the hell? His skin crawled despite never having laid eyes on Ye Xuan.
