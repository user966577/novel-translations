Offered herself willingly?

Dan Yu's face burned crimson. Technically, yes, she'd been the one to make the first move—but only because she'd thought she'd been drugged. She never expected...

Looking at Qin Jiang's innocent expression, she wanted to cry but had no tears left. She was the victim here, yet somehow he managed to look even more aggrieved than she did. And she couldn't even argue the point.

She had no idea what to do next. Who could've imagined that the esteemed Saintess of the Heavenly Pill Palace would lose her first time so casually—to a complete stranger whose name she didn't even know?

Her eyes reddened. The more she thought about it, the more wronged she felt.

Qin Jiang walked over, gave her a playful squeeze, and smiled. "Get some rest. I'll take you back later."

"Don't touch me." Dan Yu swatted his hand away and turned her head, cheeks still flushed.

Qin Jiang shook his head with a grin and said nothing more. He found a spot nearby, sat cross-legged, and closed his eyes.

'System, show me the spoiler.'

He'd triggered the connection to a Child of Destiny the moment he met Dan Yu, but hadn't checked the details until now. The activity was over—time to see what the new protagonist was all about.

The spoiler unfolded in his mind. The opening scene showed a young man striding through Pill City's gates, his eyes scanning the streets with deep emotion. His gaze was profound and weathered—far too old for the youthful face it belonged to.

Qin Jiang recognized that look instantly. It reminded him of Lin Chen—a young body harboring an ancient soul.

'Another case of possession?'

He murmured to himself and continued watching.

The new Child of Destiny was named Chen Changsheng. He hadn't stolen someone else's body—this was reincarnation in the truest sense. And not just once. He'd been through the cycle ten times. This was his tenth life.

"Ten reincarnations. This one's impressive." Qin Jiang was genuinely intrigued for once.

He opened his eyes and glanced at Dan Yu. She'd been exhausted enough to fall asleep already, curled up under the blankets.

"This Child of Destiny is a real piece of work," he muttered.

Both the Pill Emperor and Dan Yu were fortune heroines. In the original storyline, Chen Changsheng had been the Pill Emperor's master in his previous life—which made Dan Yu his grand-disciple. And yet, in this life, Chen Changsheng intended to claim both of them.

"Truly despicable. Thank god I'm here—otherwise that old monster's sick fantasies would've become reality."

Qin Jiang grumbled, cursing Chen Changsheng with one breath and congratulating himself with the next.

Just then—

BOOM!

A massive impact rocked the building. The private chamber trembled, and an Emperor's might descended from above. Qin Jiang immediately sensed Liu Shuwan's aura flaring in response.

Dan Yu jolted awake. "That's my master!"

She looked at Qin Jiang. "My master is here."

Dan Yu's master was none other than the Pill Emperor—the other fortune heroine.

A spark of interest lit in Qin Jiang's eyes.

He stepped out of the chamber and into the suite's main hall. Besides Liu Shuwan and the other women, an unfamiliar figure stood among them.

The Pill Emperor.

Qin Jiang's expression shifted. He strode directly to the Pill Emperor, and when he spoke, his eyes softened with tenderness and deep nostalgia. "Linglong... do you remember me?"

His voice had changed subtly—a perfect imitation of Chen Changsheng.

The Pill Emperor's body went rigid. She stared at Qin Jiang in disbelief. That voice, that expression, that intimate tone...

"Master?"

Her voice trembled. Her aura retracted completely as she searched Qin Jiang's face, unable to look away.

Qin Jiang gave her a "warm" smile and took another step forward, grasping her hand. "Linglong, you do remember your master after all."

But the Pill Emperor frowned almost imperceptibly and withdrew her hand. Something was off. Her master would never have been this physically affectionate—there had always been a proper distance between them.

And she couldn't sense any familiar aura on Qin Jiang. She knew Chen Changsheng had been through multiple reincarnations, but each life should've preserved at least a trace of the previous one. On Qin Jiang... there was nothing.

Her raging emotions settled as logic reasserted itself. She looked at Dan Yu—at the pallor of her face, the telltale flush, the way she moved—and her expression turned frigid. Her master would never have done that to a woman, let alone his own grand-disciple.

"You're not my master. Who are you, and why are you impersonating him?"

Qin Jiang let his smile fade, brow creasing. "Linglong, you don't recognize me anymore?"

"Enough! You are not my master. Say another word, and regardless of your backing, I will make you regret it!" Her voice cut like a blade, her eyes blazing.

Qin Jiang blinked, then let a pained expression wash over his face. "I never thought... even you wouldn't recognize me. Don't you remember, Linglong? Back then, when those bandits had you cornered with their blades—your master is the one who saved you. Have you truly forgotten?"

The Pill Emperor's composure cracked. That incident was something only the two of them had ever known.
