A few days later, Qin Jiang set off in the traveling palace with Huo Qing'er and Qin Lian'er, heading for the Fire Tribe.

He'd wanted to bring Liu Shuwan along, but she'd gone straight into seclusion to fully integrate the Sword Heart and attempt a breakthrough to Great Emperor. Ye Ling'er and the other women had also chosen to stay behind and cultivate. Their talent couldn't match Qin Jiang's, and if they didn't train hard, they'd be left further and further behind.

So it was just Huo Qing'er. Qin Lian'er tagged along because Qin Jiang wanted to test whether his sister's ability to detect Children of Destiny worked in new locations. If it did, she'd make an excellent radar.

The Fire Tribe was situated in a remote area. Though not one of the ancient clans, their status was elevated by their alchemy. Countless ancient clans came to the Fire Tribe seeking pills, giving them extensive connections and making them a faction no one wanted to antagonize.

The Qin family, of course, was the exception.

Along the way, Huo Qing'er shared the story of her downfall.

She had been the Fire Tribe's Saintess. The tribe possessed a Legacy Flame—a sacred inheritance. Any Saintess who successfully absorbed the flame would gain absolute, unquestioned authority over the entire tribe.

But during her absorption ritual, the Fire Tribe's designated Holy Son candidate had led an armed assault on the chamber, killing the guardians protecting her. The disruption caused the Legacy Flame to backlash against Huo Qing'er.

She'd fought her way out using the flame's power, but her injuries were too severe to sustain control. In desperation, she abandoned the flame and fled the tribe. Even then, she couldn't hold on.

In a last-ditch gamble, she destroyed her own body and used a Spirit-Anchoring Stone she'd once obtained to craft a ring, hiding her soul inside it. That was the only reason she survived.

Over the following centuries, the ring changed hands until it ended up with Xiao Fan—and was then snatched by Qin Jiang.

"The one who betrayed you—Huo Lie?" Qin Jiang asked.

Huo Qing'er nodded, though her expression was surprisingly calm. Having seen so much at Qin Jiang's side, she'd long since stopped taking her old enemy seriously.

Qin Jiang produced a scroll detailing Huo Lie's information. "He's the current clan leader. He absorbed the Legacy Flame years ago. In just three centuries, it took him from Unity Realm Perfection all the way to Nine Tribulations Supreme. He's the strongest person in the Fire Tribe now."

"The Legacy Flame is the clan leader's sigil," Huo Qing'er explained. "Each departing leader infuses all their power into the flame before death, so it can rapidly elevate the successor to Supreme Realm. Back then, Huo Lie was weaker than me, but from the look of it, he's fully refined the flame's accumulated power."

She was only at the early Saint Realm—no improvement in three hundred years.

Qin Jiang studied the scroll, smiled, and pulled her into his arms. "I'll get it all back for you."

"Mm~" She nestled against him, nodding softly.

Several days later, they arrived at the Fire Domain.

"This place is sweltering," Qin Jiang remarked.

Huo Qing'er gazed through the void at the scorching expanse, nostalgia flickering in her eyes. Three hundred years—she'd never imagined she'd actually return.

"The entire Fire Domain sits above a magma sea, which is why the temperatures are so extreme. It's home to over ninety percent of the continent's fire-attribute cultivators—a paradise for them. And the Fire Tribe is, at least nominally, the domain's ruling power."

"Nominally?" Qin Jiang smirked.

Huo Qing'er laughed ruefully. "Plenty of factions in the Fire Domain are no weaker than the Fire Tribe. If not for our alchemy, they would've banded together and overthrown us long ago."

Qin Jiang tossed her another scroll. "For the past thousand years, those factions have been studying alchemy themselves—even sending people to the Fire Tribe under various pretexts to learn. Their skills are catching up. Once they reach eighty percent of the Fire Tribe's level, they'll stop playing nice. There are already signs."

Huo Qing'er opened the scroll. It contained a detailed report on the Fire Tribe's current state. Her brows creased.

Though she had a grudge against Huo Lie, she still cared about the tribe itself. But before her worry could fully take hold, she glanced at Qin Jiang. She had him! With Qin Jiang around, what was there to fear?

Were those factions powerful? Her husband was Qin Jiang. Were they learning alchemy? Her husband was still Qin Jiang.

When it came to comparing husbands, she was unbeatable.

Her worries evaporated. She tossed the scroll aside. "With my husband here, I'm not afraid of any of them."

She leaned into his embrace with a warm smile. The word "husband" brought a grin to Qin Jiang's face—a woman's soft voice saying it was truly music to his ears.

After half a day of traveling through the Fire Domain, they arrived at the Fire Tribe's territory.

"A celebration?" Qin Jiang peered through the void. Red lanterns hung everywhere, colorful banners fluttered, and people bustled about in festive spirits.

Huo Qing'er looked too, equally curious. This scale of decoration suggested a wedding. And given the grandeur... could the groom be Huo Lie himself?

Just then, the sound of drums and gongs erupted. Following the noise, they spotted an eight-man palanquin carried through the cheering crowd toward the Fire Tribe compound.

Huo Qing'er frowned. The aura of whoever was inside the palanquin felt vaguely familiar.

As the procession drew close, a middle-aged man strode toward the palanquin. At the same time, an elderly woman attendant lifted the curtain and offered her arm. The bride placed her delicate hand on the old woman's arm and stepped out slowly.

A breeze teased the edge of her red veil, revealing half of a stunning face.

"Ying'er!" Huo Qing'er's eyes went wide. She whipped toward Qin Jiang. "Qin Jiang, that's my friend!"

Qin Jiang stared. The best friend was marrying her enemy?

His expression turned odd. Huo Qing'er's whole reason for coming was to introduce said friend to him. And now someone had beaten him to the punch?

Unacceptable.

"Qin Jiang, please help Ying'er! She must have been forced into this. She hated Huo Lie more than anyone back then—she'd never marry him willingly!" Huo Qing'er clung to his arm.
