"Sis, this guy isn't one of your suitors, is he?" Yu Ru asked curiously, having heard Chen Changsheng call Yu Lan by name.

Yu Lan shook her head and turned to Qin Jiang. "I don't know him," she whispered, seemingly worried he might misunderstand. Inwardly, she was furious with Chen Changsheng. Not only had this fool destroyed the concealment formation, he'd dared call her by name. If Qin Jiang got the wrong idea, what then? A thread of nervousness wound through her chest.

Qin Jiang squeezed her hand gently and gave her a reassuring smile, easing her tension somewhat.

Meanwhile, Chen Changsheng steadied himself. He looked a bit disheveled but wasn't actually injured—Yu Lan still remembered that Chen Changsheng was useful to Qin Jiang, so she hadn't struck with any real force.

"Yu Lan, don't you remember me?" he called out. "I'm Chen Fan! I helped you once, years ago." In that particular life, Chen Changsheng had gone by the name Chen Fan. He stared at Yu Lan, his expression full of indignation. He'd imagined that after tens of thousands of years apart, their reunion would involve a warm embrace. Instead, what greeted him was a backhand across the face.

"Chen Fan?" Yu Lan's brow furrowed, and she shook her head. Still didn't ring a bell.

Chen Changsheng's expression froze, a flush of shame coloring his face. He'd traveled millions of miles with his heart brimming with anticipation, only to discover that the dear friend he'd been thinking of didn't even remember him.

"Impossible!" he growled. "I'm Chen Fan! Thirty thousand years ago, I helped you! Don't you remember how I encouraged you and predicted that you'd achieve great things someday?"

His composure was cracking.

Yu Lan listened, then studied Chen Changsheng more carefully. The memory surfaced at last. Back when she'd been training in the Demon Domain, she'd run into an idiot. At the time, she'd been deliberately seeking out a stronger opponent, hoping to use the pressure to trigger a bloodline breakthrough. But just as she was on the verge of success, some moron appeared out of nowhere and joined her fight against the enemy. The result? Not enough pressure. Breakthrough failed.

And then that same moron had put on airs like some high-and-mighty expert, spouting platitudes about how she was "destined for great things." No kidding—what a waste of breath.

The Yu Lan of that era couldn't be bothered with him. She'd been desperate to advance her bloodline, just one step away from royal status. But Chen Changsheng kept pestering her, even claiming he'd take her on as his disciple. Fed up, she'd returned to her tribe and never encountered him again. Eventually, the whole incident faded from memory. She never expected that tens of thousands of years later, she'd run into this brain-dead fool once more.

"Qin Jiang," Yu Lan said with complete seriousness, "this guy is an idiot."

Even Qin Jiang was momentarily stunned. The normally icy Yu Lan—swearing?

Yu Ru blinked in surprise, then her eyes lit up with recognition. "Sis! Is this the same idiot you ranted to me about? The one who ruined your royal bloodline breakthrough?"

"That's him!" Yu Lan confirmed with a nod.

Chen Changsheng stared at her, dumbstruck. In her mind, his image was... an idiot?

Qin Jiang couldn't help but laugh. He knew some of this from the storyline, though not the full picture—only that when the two first met, Yu Lan's attitude toward Chen Changsheng had been terrible. In the original plot, Chen Changsheng would have gradually won her over through displays of prowess, sparking her curiosity and eventually her attention. But now, with Qin Jiang in the picture, Chen Changsheng's image was beyond salvaging. At least in Yu Lan and Yu Ru's minds, this guy was nothing but a brain-dead moron.

"Qin Jiang, can I beat him up?" Yu Ru asked.

Qin Jiang still had a use for Chen Changsheng, but roughing him up a bit shouldn't be a problem, right? Yu Ru still remembered—it was because of Chen Changsheng that her sister's bloodline advancement had been delayed by more than half a year before finally breaking through to royal status.

Qin Jiang glanced at their surroundings. "Hold that thought. The Snake Race is here."

Before his words had faded, Yu Lan and the others saw figures closing in from every direction, surrounding them completely.

"Ha ha ha ha! Empress, so this is where you've been hiding!" A booming laugh echoed through the air.

In the sky above, a host of Black Water Serpent powerhouses radiated terrifying pressure, their overwhelming power bearing down like a storm. Yu Lan and her people tensed, but when she glanced at Qin Jiang beside her, her heart steadied. Something nagged at her, though—how had they arrived so quickly? The formation had only just been destroyed, and they were already surrounded.

One of the Black Water Serpent Supremes leaned toward a companion and murmured, "We followed him here. Looks like he's the one who broke the formation."

The Black Water Serpent Emperors turned warm gazes on Chen Changsheng. "Young friend, you're quite talented. Would you consider joining our Black Water Serpent clan? We'll give you all the resources and training you could want."

Anyone capable of dismantling the formation had to be a skilled array master, and the yao race had never been particularly gifted in such arts. Recruiting one would be a significant boon.

Chen Changsheng's expression darkened. He hadn't come to the Demon Domain to help the Black Water Serpent clan. Yu Lan and her people's faces turned cold as well. So it was this fool who'd led the Black Water Serpent forces straight to them. Damn him.

"Don't worry. I'm here," Qin Jiang whispered, squeezing Yu Lan's hand.

Her expression softened, and she nodded. Thank heavens she had Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang surveyed the enemy ranks. The strongest among them were merely Great Emperors—not a single Ancient Emperor in sight.

"Mind if I kill some of these serpent clan members?" he asked Yu Lan. Though they weren't the same faction, they were all technically part of the Snake Race.

Yu Lan nodded without hesitation. "Go ahead. You could kill every last Black Water Serpent and it wouldn't matter."

The Snake Race was powerful but far from united. Competition between factions was fierce. As far as Yu Lan was concerned, aside from the Purple-Scale Serpent faction, any other snake clan was fair game.

Qin Jiang grinned and turned to Mo Mo and Xue Mei. Dealing with Great Emperors was obviously their department. "Mo Mo, Mei Mei..."

"No survivors?" Mo Mo asked.

Qin Jiang nodded.

A flash of excitement crossed Mo Mo's delicate face. It had been a while since she'd had the chance to really cut loose. "Xue Mei, you protect Qin Jiang. I'll handle this myself," she said, licking her ruby lips.

With a casual wave of her hand, she sealed the surrounding space entirely. A smile graced her porcelain features as she stepped forward, and the full weight of her Immortal-path aura erupted outward.
