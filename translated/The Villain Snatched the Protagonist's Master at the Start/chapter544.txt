The Immortal King Killing Formation, at full power, could slay an Immortal King. But Wu Tian was now nothing more than a Primordial Spirit—a reincarnated Immortal Emperor's Primordial Spirit, yes, but inside the formation, he was still hopelessly outmatched. In moments, he'd been battered into a wretched state.

If not for his lingering Emperor's might shielding him, his Primordial Spirit would have been scattered long ago.

Wu Tian roared in defiance, charging left and right, trying to break free. But his remaining power was simply too weak. Every escape attempt was blasted back. His Primordial Spirit grew more translucent with each failed charge, and even his Emperor's might was crumbling.

After all, he was only a reincarnation. In his previous life, even as a bare Primordial Spirit, the Immortal King Killing Formation wouldn't have been able to touch him.

Still, Qin Jiang didn't let his guard down. An Xihe and the others remained battle-ready, prepared to intervene at any moment.

Wu Tian's gaze swept across them all. His despair deepened—there wasn't a single opening. They were treating him like a true Immortal Emperor, but he didn't have an Immortal Emperor's power anymore.

Just then, the formation's assault came again. Wu Tian clenched his jaw.

"All or nothing!"

His protective Emperor's might surged violently. He'd been playing weak this entire time, hoping Qin Jiang and the others would lower their guard so he could find an opening to escape. But clearly, it wasn't working. If he kept feigning weakness much longer, the pretense would become reality—each successive attack was genuinely eroding his power.

The moment his Emperor's might erupted, the Immortal King Killing Formation's power was instantly weakened, then obliterated entirely.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. The man was finally fighting back.

He had to admit—an Immortal Emperor's power truly operated on a different plane. Residual Emperor's might from a previous life could effortlessly suppress Immortal King-level force.

No longer holding back, Wu Tian unleashed his Emperor's might and went on the offensive. Formation runes shattered one after another.

Qin Jiang wasn't concerned. He'd never expected the Immortal King Killing Formation alone to defeat Wu Tian—he'd only wanted to drain more of his power.

He watched Wu Tian systematically destroy the runes. Then, finally, Qin Jiang clenched his fist.

The formation's power froze. In the next instant, every remaining ounce of energy condensed into a single point and crashed down on Wu Tian. Simultaneously, the entire Immortal King Killing Formation self-destructed.

Annihilating force engulfed Wu Tian from every direction. Qin Jiang and the others retreated hastily, barely avoiding the blast. Everything within tens of thousands of miles was reduced to nothing—and that was just the shockwave. Wu Tian had absorbed most of the impact. Had the full force swept across Mystic Cloud Heaven, half the realm would have been turned to wasteland.

The destructive energy continued to rage. Wu Tian was engulfed somewhere within, completely still. Qin Jiang and the others gathered their power, ready for anything.

A full hour passed.

Then a streak of light erupted from the rampaging energy and shot toward the sky, plunging straight into the Chaos. Dense Emperor's might still flickered around it.

Wu Tian!

An Xihe and the others gave chase immediately, but Qin Jiang stayed behind. His gaze remained locked on the ground below as he swept his arm, dispersing the lingering energy. There was nothing left—not a trace of life.

"Qin Jiang, he ran! Aren't we going after him?" Wu Yingtao asked, her eyes tracking An Xihe's group as their figures vanished into the distance. She could still sense their immense auras streaking through the Chaos at incredible speed. They hadn't caught up yet.

Qin Jiang said nothing. Instead, he drove his fist into a specific spot on the ground.

A thunderous boom—and another streak of light burst out, stumbling several steps before trying to flee. Qin Jiang intercepted it instantly.

It was Wu Tian's Primordial Spirit. His expression was grim—even as a spirit, he looked haggard.

Wu Yingtao blinked in surprise. He hadn't run? Then the one carrying Emperor's might had been a decoy to lure them away?

"Heh. Quite the bag of tricks." Qin Jiang chuckled.

He studied Wu Tian. This Primordial Spirit had no Emperor's might left whatsoever—it was no different from an ordinary soul.

Wu Tian's face was ashen, teeth clenched, eyes boring into Qin Jiang. "How did you know I hadn't left?"

To draw them away, he'd poured most of his remaining power into a split soul, even infusing it with every last shred of Emperor's might to prevent suspicion. If everyone had given chase, he could have slipped away undetected. He would have hidden deep in the Chaos where even Huaxia couldn't find him, no matter how thoroughly they searched the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Given time, he'd have rebuilt his strength and found a chance for revenge.

But he'd been found.

Qin Jiang smiled faintly, his expression calm and calculating. "Did you think I detonated the formation just to wound you?"

The instant he'd triggered the self-destruction, he'd used a portion of the formation's power to place a tracking mark on Wu Tian's Primordial Spirit. When the decoy fled, he'd sensed that part of the mark remained stationary—so he'd stayed behind.

As for An Xihe and the others, he hadn't stopped them either. He couldn't be certain which Wu Tian was real. Perhaps both were.

The Wu Tian before him had no fight left. Qin Jiang didn't bother explaining further. He turned to Wu Yingtao. "Yingtao, go ahead."

"Okay."

She nodded. Power gathered in her palm, her eyes blazing with killing intent. "Today, your life pays for my brother's."

Silence.

Wu Tian's face twisted with bitter resignation. He wanted to explain—but one look at Wu Yingtao told him it was pointless. No matter what he said, she wouldn't believe him. And the truth was, he really couldn't explain it clearly.

All he could manage was: "Yingtao, I really wasn't lying to you. Whether you believe me or not—"

"Hmph. On death's doorstep and still trying to disrupt my dao heart?"

Wu Yingtao scoffed. The evidence was overwhelming, and this man was still trying to wriggle free. He had to be trying to shake her conviction. Unforgivable.

She didn't hesitate. Her palm rose, and devastating force slammed into Wu Tian. This fragment of his Primordial Spirit was pathetically weak. It offered no resistance. Under her strike, it disintegrated into ash.

But the system didn't award any rewards. Wu Tian hadn't truly perished yet.

Qin Jiang's gaze turned toward the depths of the Chaos. He took Wu Yingtao's hand. "Come on. Let's catch up."
