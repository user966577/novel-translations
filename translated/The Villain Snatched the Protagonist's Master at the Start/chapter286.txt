Over the following days, An Xihe ordered her forces to begin preparations for the breakthrough.

As for the subordinates who'd backstabbed her—since she needed all hands on deck, and Qin Jiang put in a good word for them, she let them off with a light punishment. This only deepened their gratitude toward him.

An Xihe herself stayed at Qin Jiang's side. Her cultivation had long reached True Immortal Perfection—one step from Immortal King. There was nothing left to prepare on that front. But she worried. If the breakthrough failed, the backlash would leave her grievously wounded at best. So while time remained, she clung to every moment with him.

The other women welcomed their new sister warmly. Through their joint "sparring" sessions with Qin Jiang, they'd discovered that An Xihe was a fierce and valiant combatant. A fine sister indeed.

Qing Chan and An Xihe buried the hatchet completely. Battle after battle together forged a genuine friendship—close enough that they regularly conferred on Qin Jiang's weaknesses. Their conclusion: one-on-one, victory was impossible. Even if An Xihe achieved Immortal King, it wouldn't change that calculus. But together, they might have a chance. And so they set a shared goal: defeat Qin Jiang, just once.

The challenges began. Defeat after defeat failed to dampen their spirits. Outside of rest, they went at it with tireless enthusiasm. Yet victory remained elusive.

The challenger roster grew. Ning Xue'er, Baizhe, Jian Yao, Mo Mo, Yan Shiya, Pill Emperor Linglong... everyone joined in. Qin Jiang, magnanimous as ever, saw no issue with being outnumbered.

The Second General was undefeated. Numbers would change nothing.

A month passed, and An Xihe's preparations were largely complete. Her forces rivaled any of the Central Regions' three great factions, and with full mobilization, they worked with impressive efficiency. Qin Jiang had also coordinated with the Snake Race and Fox Race to support the operation. Everything was nearly in place.

On this particular day, the women had opted not to challenge him. They were still recovering, casting faintly resentful looks his way. The man had no concept of leaving the fields fallow.

An Xihe walked over on unsteady legs and settled directly onto his lap, arms looping around his neck. "I need to go prepare," she said softly.

He held her waist and nodded. "Before that, there's one more thing to take care of."

"What?"

"We need to have a chat with old Dao Zhen."

Qin Jiang's grin turned mischievous.

Dao Zhen was cradling a lotus-wrapped roast chicken, about to take his first bite, when three figures materialized before him: Qin Jiang, Qing Chan, and An Xihe.

The chicken nearly slipped from his hands. He stared at An Xihe, stunned. This woman... how was she out? And how had she ended up with Qin Jiang?

"Heh heh, Brother Dao Zhen! Having chicken?" Qin Jiang grinned. With two True Immortals backing him, he was brimming with confidence. He swiped the chicken right out of Dao Zhen's arms, peeled open the lotus leaf, and inhaled deeply.

"Mmm!" A satisfied nod. Excellent chicken. Fragrant just from the smell.

He tore off both drumsticks and handed one to each of his wives. "Here, darling. Try some."

Dao Zhen stared as Qin Jiang distributed his chicken like a gift. His eye twitched. But the chicken wasn't the issue right now. The issue was the Celestial Formation Fairy. How had she gotten free? And how had she wound up with Qin Jiang?

And had he just heard Qin Jiang call her... "darling"?

This woman was even fiercer than Qing Chan, and Qin Jiang had gotten his hooks into her? Young people these days—were they really this competitive? Even poaching from his generation?

After feeding his wives, Qin Jiang tore off a wing for himself and spoke through a mouthful of chicken. "Good stuff, right?"

Both women shot him a look. They still had some dignity—beautiful women didn't gnaw on drumsticks like barbarians. They nibbled delicately, nodding in acknowledgment.

Watching the three of them devour his chicken without so much as a word to him, Dao Zhen swallowed hard and finally spoke up. "Brother Qin, what exactly is..."

"Oh, right. Almost forgot." Qin Jiang spat out a bone, flicked his fingers clean with a pulse of spiritual energy, and pulled An Xihe against him. "Brother Dao Zhen, allow me to introduce my wife—An Xihe. You might know her by a different name: the Celestial Formation Fairy. Ring any bells?"

Dao Zhen's face twitched violently. Know her? He'd helped seal her. Was this payback?

Facing two True Immortals—especially when one was the Celestial Formation Fairy—he didn't stand a chance. Qing Chan shifted behind him, her aura locking him in place. An Xihe leaned into Qin Jiang's embrace, but her eyes were fixed on Dao Zhen like a predator tracking prey.

He was surrounded from all sides. His own energy flared in response. He couldn't win, but he could run.

"What's this about, Brother Dao Zhen?" Qin Jiang smiled easily.

He released An Xihe. The Immortal King Seal appeared in his palm, and a razor-sharp aura slammed into Dao Zhen. A wave of mortal dread made his pupils contract and his scalp tingle. That tiny stamp radiated world-ending power. If it went off, he wasn't sure he'd survive—and that was before factoring in the two True Immortals.

After a tense heartbeat, his aura retracted. A broad, sunny smile spread across his face. "Why, Brother Qin! I was just trying to think of a suitable gift for your lovely wife. Got a bit lost in thought, that's all."

He produced a formation plate with a flourish, though pain flickered in his eyes. "A True Immortal-grade formation plate. First time meeting the missus—hope she likes it."

He sent it floating toward An Xihe, making a point of emphasizing "first time meeting." The message was clear: whatever happened in the past, let's start fresh.

Qin Jiang intercepted the plate and examined it. Compared to his Immortal King Killing Formation Plate, it was far inferior. "Xihe, like it?"

She took it from him. Formations were her specialty, and True Immortal-grade formation plates were genuinely rare. A smile played at her lips. "Not bad."

The Human Dao Sect might be poor, but Dao Zhen had lived longer than anyone in Azure Cloud Heaven. He had quite the collection.

Seeing An Xihe accept the gift, Dao Zhen exhaled with relief. Money spent, disaster averted.

Qin Jiang nodded approvingly. He turned to Dao Zhen with a warm, friendly smile. "Brother Dao Zhen, how would you say our relationship is?"
