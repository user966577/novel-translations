The battle drew attention from across the Demon Domain. None of the observers could detect An Xihe, of course, so in their eyes, Xue Mei was terrifyingly powerful.

Fellow Human Immortals, similar auras — yet Xue Mei's attacks landed like critical hits, battering the Horse Tribe ancestor senseless. He felt it most keenly. Every incoming blow seemed manageable at first, then detonated on contact. Was she toying with him?

Blood seeped from his lips. He glanced down at his tribe — they were getting trampled. Literally. Enormous rabbit feet stomped relentlessly, leaving bruises on everything they touched.

He tried to surrender. "Fairy Xue Mei, I was wrong before. I'm willing to compensate—"

"Too late."

It had been too late the moment he'd agreed to help the Black Serpent move against Qin Jiang. Living this long was already a bonus.

After about two hours, An Xihe signaled that the time was right.

Xue Mei unleashed her ultimate technique. An enormous spectral rabbit materialized behind her, its eyes blazing with killing intent. A bizarre energy enveloped the Horse Tribe ancestor.

"Petrification!"

Xue Mei's voice resonated with ancient power, as if echoing across the river of time. Petrification — the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's most devastating bloodline ability, usable only by those with the purest lineage. In the entire tribe, only Xue Mei and Xiao Jiu qualified.

The ancestor's legs turned to stone before he could react. He flared his power to break free, but An Xihe's invisible grip locked him in place, suppressing his strength. In an instant, the petrification climbed to his thighs.

He thrashed wildly, but with barely a tenth of his power available, resistance was futile. In under fifteen minutes, he was a statue, plummeting from the sky.

Xue Mei exhaled, slightly pale. An Xihe had handled the suppression, but the killing blow was entirely Xue Mei's own power — and the cost was significant.

Qin Jiang appeared beside her instantly, took her hand, and pressed a pill to her lips. "Recover first."

She swallowed it, her tongue deliberately brushing his fingertips. He raised an eyebrow. She was getting bold.

The two flirted while the Horse Tribe burned. Every spectator in the Demon Domain was stunned — the Horse Tribe's ancestor, dead. Outmatched in plain sight, then annihilated with a single devastating technique. And Xue Mei appeared completely unharmed.

Qin Jiang knelt beside the petrified corpse and extracted the immortal-path law with the Myriad Dao Stone. Cracks spiderwebbed across the statue. One kick reduced it to rubble.

He'd hoped to bring the body back for Chu Hanyan's puppets, but petrification was thorough.

The battle raged on below. Qin Jiang joined in personally, treating it like a game. Ugly horses? Slapped dead. Handsome ones? He tried to mount them and ride them into submission, throwing the battlefield into chaos.

Xue Mei stayed close, clearing anything above Great Emperor while Qin Jiang dominated everything below. At Great Emperor himself, it was pure bullying — and he loved every second.

A day and a night later, the Horse Tribe was effectively wiped out. Only about a thousand handsome specimens remained, trembling under the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's guard. Qin Jiang intended to breed them as future mounts — the pretty ones for formal occasions, while his Void Beast could take holidays.

He instructed the Celestial Rabbit warriors to secure the horses, then turned to Xue Mei. "Still got the Eagle Immortal to deal with. Need a break?"

"No." She shook her head. The real fighting had all been An Xihe's doing. Xue Mei just needed to put on a show and deliver the finishing blow. She barely needed rest.

"Then let's go."

He took her hand and they set off. The Eagle Immortal's position had been tracked for days. He had nowhere to run.

And indeed, the Eagle Immortal had seen the Horse Tribe ancestor's fate and immediately tried to flee. But at some point, a trapping formation had sealed off the area around him.

Less than an hour later, Qin Jiang and Xue Mei found him — face ashen with despair.
