Zhao Juncai saw it all — the lingering closeness, the whisper, the blush — and his teeth ground together. Jealousy coiled in his gut.

What did that loser have that he didn't?

Their contest continued. Li Yang was fired up, but the invisible hand stacking the deck against him wasn't something willpower could overcome. He fell further and further behind.

Zhao Juncai had long since left him in the dust, throwing the occasional look of contempt over his shoulder. Meanwhile, Ye Xuan stayed at Li Yang's side.

He was touched — and tormented. Her loyalty only proved how much of a burden he was.

He looked up at Zhao Juncai, jaw clenched. Then at Ye Xuan. "Go ahead. Don't wait for me."

"But—"

"This test matters. It determines your status in the academy. I can't hold you back."

Ye Xuan's expression flickered with hesitation. She took a breath, met his eyes, and shook her head. "We'll go together."

"No."

Her willingness to stay only made it worse. Li Yang had his pride — he couldn't drag someone else down for his sake.

"Listen to me. Go on ahead. If you earn a higher rank, maybe you can help me out once we're inside. Right?" He tried for a joke. It landed poorly.

Ye Xuan weighed the situation, then sighed. "Fine. I'll go. But once we're in the academy, come find me if you need anything."

"Deal."

He managed a smile. Ye Xuan held his gaze a moment longer, as though reluctant to leave, then turned and accelerated.

He watched her go, smile fading, fists clenched white. 'I really am pathetic.'

His performance all but guaranteed a remedial ranking. He steeled himself and kept climbing, glancing up whenever he could. Ye Xuan's figure was still visible, shrinking steadily.

That thought — 'She'll leave him behind' — kept him moving.

Then he noticed she'd caught up to Zhao Juncai. The two were climbing side by side.

His stomach dropped.

Ye Xuan and Zhao Juncai walked in step. Without Li Yang nearby, her demeanor toward the young man shifted entirely. The frosty distance evaporated, replaced by warmth — even a smile.

Zhao Juncai could hardly believe it. "You..."

"I'm Ye Xuan," she offered.

His face lit up. He'd heard Li Yang call her by name, but she'd never introduced herself to him directly. Now she had.

"May I call you Miss Ye Xuan?"

"Of course." She graced him with a radiant smile that left him momentarily stunned.

Then her expression softened with contrition. "I owe you an apology, Zhao Juncai. I wasn't trying to be cold to you earlier."

"Don't worry about it!" He waved both hands.

"It's just..." She glanced back toward Li Yang, who happened to be looking up. She offered him a gentle smile and a nod, then turned back, lowering her voice. "I felt sorry for him. I couldn't stand watching him freeze to death on the ice, so I helped — and then I couldn't bring myself to abandon him. He seemed so fragile."

She paused. "I was cold to you because I was afraid of hurting his pride. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to."

A trace of sorrow crossed her face, delicate and vulnerable. "I know what it's like to be ignored and looked down on. It's awful. I've been through it."

Zhao Juncai felt his heart crack. What a pure, kindhearted girl. He moved toward her, wanting to comfort her — but she sidestepped neatly.

He caught himself, embarrassed. "Sorry. That was presumptuous."

"No, it's my fault for getting emotional." She dabbed at the corners of her eyes, which had turned faintly pink.

Zhao Juncai ached for her. This beautiful, gentle soul had once been treated cruelly? Who on earth could be so heartless?

No wonder she'd been cold to him — his behavior had dredged up painful memories. He was a monster.

He stammered through an apology: "Miss Ye Xuan, I'm truly sorry. I had no idea. From now on, I swear I won't bully anyone again. I'll try to be like you — treating people with kindness."

"You're too kind, Zhao Juncai. What you showed before was just your honest nature. I know you have a good heart underneath."

She smiled sweetly, and whatever remained of Zhao Juncai's resistance dissolved. He vowed silently: this girl would be his, and he would protect her from any and all harm.

Far below, Li Yang watched them walking together, teeth nearly cracking from the pressure of his clenched jaw. Then he saw Zhao Juncai lean toward Ye Xuan — as if trying to embrace her.

'I haven't even hugged her!'

Ye Xuan dodged. She clearly found Zhao Juncai repulsive.

Li Yang exhaled. He wanted to catch up, but couldn't. And no matter how many times he looked, the two kept walking side by side, the gap between them and him growing ever wider.

Ye Xuan, meanwhile, had no trouble maintaining conversation with Zhao Juncai. He was arrogant, yes, but not without ability. As a former Child of Destiny herself, she recognized genuine talent when she saw it. He was barely keeping up — but the fact that he could keep up at all was respectable.

Eventually, even Zhao Juncai reached his limit. "Your talent is extraordinary, Miss Ye Xuan. I can't keep pace any longer. Please — go on ahead."

Unlike Li Yang — bitter, self-loathing, and resentful — Zhao Juncai was gracious about it. Even proud of her.

He knew that with talent like hers, the academy would invest heavily. Her future was limitless.
