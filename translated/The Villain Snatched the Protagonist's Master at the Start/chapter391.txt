Several hours later, Li Qingqiu woke, cheeks still tinged with pink.

"Awake?" Qin Jiang squeezed her hand.

She nodded and whined softly, nuzzling deeper into his chest. "Mm, Qin Jiang~ Hug me~"

"Sure~ Hugs~"

He wrapped the clingy little creature up tight, threw in a few bonus kisses, then patted her backside. "Qingqiu, come home with me in a few days."

"Home?" Her eyes brightened, and she nodded without hesitation. "Okay."

She'd always been alone at the Li compound. Nothing to keep her here. Where Qin Jiang went, she went.

Though...

She looked at him, blushing slightly, suddenly fidgety. "Before we go... shouldn't I prepare some gifts? For our... our parents, and the elders..."

"No need." He ruffled her hair. "They don't lack anything. Besides, when we go home, we're the ones receiving gifts."

"But... wouldn't that be rude?"

She pouted, brows knitting, and shook her head. "No, I should bring something."

She hopped off the bed, dressed quickly, and pulled him up with a grin. "I'll ask Xihe and the others — they'll know what's appropriate."

"Alright, let them help you pick."

An Xihe and the others had indeed brought gifts the last time. Lian'er had chosen them — randomly, as it turned out. But it was the thought that counted. The family didn't need anything; they just wanted their people home. And if those people happened to be carrying grandchildren, even better.

The Qin family elders had already started pressuring Qin Jiang about babies.

Li Qingqiu found the women and explained her intention. Their eyes lit up.

"Leave it to us, Qingqiu!"

"We've got experience — just follow our lead."

"Let's go, let's go — we'll pick them out right now!"

"Don't be nervous. The Qin family elders are lovely. Come on, gifts!"

Their enthusiasm eased her anxiety. She led them straight to the Li family treasury, which held the accumulated wealth of a million years. Impressive — though none of these women were easily awed. They kept their composure.

"The Qin family doesn't need anything practical, so we're sending the thought, not the value."

"Right. Nothing too extravagant."

"Pick pretty things. Even if they're useless, they make nice decorations."

"This pearl is lovely — perfect little gift."

They browsed and selected while Qin Jiang trailed behind, watching their choices. He couldn't help rolling his eyes. Not a single useful item. All style, zero substance — exactly Lian'er's selection criteria, faithfully adopted by every woman here.

But it didn't matter. The family had everything already.

Under their guidance, Li Qingqiu cleared out every attractive item in the treasury, then winnowed the haul to a generous pile. "Is this enough?"

An Xihe nodded. "More than enough. There aren't that many people qualified to receive gifts from you."

Only Qin Jiang's immediate family and the ancestral elders warranted presents from the young lady of the house.

"In that case, Xihe, you should all pick some too." Li Qingqiu gestured at the remaining treasures.

"Thank you."

No one refused. A trip abroad meant souvenirs. They selected from the already-curated pile, taking only a few pieces each and leaving the lion's share for Li Qingqiu. They only needed gifts for Qin Jiang's closest kin.

With the gift-giving settled, An Xihe turned to Qin Jiang and took his arm. "Aren't you bringing anything home for the girls?"

"Already prepared."

"Oh? What?"

"Me." He grinned. "I'm the gift. Well-rested, fully charged — they'll be very satisfied."

"Well-rested?" An Xihe gave him a withering look. "You need rest? And since when have you been resting? Every single day, you—"

She broke off, blushing, and swatted his chest.

He caught her hand, leaned in, and kissed her earlobe. "How about I start conserving energy now? Save it all for when we get home."

"Absolutely not!"

She pinched his side. Hard. "You'd better keep cooking for us, or—"

"Is Xihe threatening to dine and dash?"

"So what if we are?"

"Hss~ Well... that could be interesting."

He blinked thoughtfully. Being overpowered once in a while had its own appeal.

An Xihe caught his expression. "Pervert!"

She seized him and addressed the room. "Everyone rested up?"

The women nodded, having heard the entire exchange. Conserving energy? Starting now? Absolutely not!

They'd been resting for a full day. Peak condition. Every pair of eyes fixed on Qin Jiang with laser intensity.

An Xihe, gripping Qin Jiang's arm, saw her sisters' fighting spirit and raised a rallying cry. "Come on, girls! Let's go home and eat our fill — his treat!"

She dragged Qin Jiang forward. Li Qingqiu and the others fell in behind. Qin Jiang wore a put-upon expression, playing the reluctant victim, but his body told a different story — plastered against An Xihe, moving faster than she was.

Clearly eager.

She shot him a look and tapped his chest. "Why are you walking so fast? We're forcing you, remember? You should be resisting."

"Resisting?"

Qin Jiang considered this, then arranged his face into an expression of theatrical anguish.

"Ladies, please — I already have wives! I couldn't possibly betray them! Don't do this! Otherwise... otherwise I'll scream!"
