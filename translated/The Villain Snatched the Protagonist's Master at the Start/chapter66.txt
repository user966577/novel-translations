About 25,000 feet deep.

A crude stone hut stood conspicuously in the vast emptiness of Sword Valley.

"Lord Sword Emperor, wait here—I'll go fetch him." Sun Yang flashed a grin.

By now, Qin Jiang had learned the old man's name—Sun Yang—and the person they'd come to find was his good friend, Wang Chao.

Sun Yang rubbed his hands together with a chuckle and sidled up to the stone hut. Then, to Qin Jiang's astonishment, he slapped it with one palm and the entire structure shattered to pieces.

This was his good friend?

Qin Jiang felt like he'd been duped.

"Sun, you old bastard! What the hell is wrong with you?!" A furious roar erupted from the rubble, followed by a surge of power that sent every stone fragment flying. A dusty, disheveled old man emerged from the ruins, teeth clenched, glaring murderously at Sun Yang.

This, presumably, was the "good friend" in question.

Sun Yang grinned at him, then darted behind Qin Jiang and pointed at Wang Chao. "Lord Sword Emperor, that's Wang Chao. He definitely knows where the Saintess is."

Wang Chao looked over with a slight frown. He hadn't expected Sun Yang to bring someone else—and a young man at that. But anyone who could reach this depth was no ordinary person.

He sneered. "Sun, you old bastard. Can't beat me yourself, so you brought a kid to gang up on me?"

Sun Yang's weathered face split into a brilliant smile. He turned to Qin Jiang. "Lord Sword Emperor, he's looking down on you."

Qin Jiang: "..."

He'd figured it out. They might genuinely be friends, but they were also old rivals—and from the look of things, Sun Yang had always been on the losing end. Bringing Qin Jiang here was partially about settling a personal score.

Qin Jiang didn't bother with explanations. He simply unleashed his Sword Heart and turned Sword Valley's ambient power against Wang Chao. Compared to Sun Yang, Wang Chao was indeed stronger—he held out for several breaths before his legs buckled and he collapsed. He stared up at Qin Jiang in shock, having clearly sensed the nature of his power. Then realization dawned, and he whipped his glare toward Sun Yang. "You old bastard—you set me up!"

Sun Yang just chuckled and said nothing, looking to Qin Jiang for instructions. After Qin Jiang nodded, he finally spoke. "Old Wang, I brought Lord Sword Emperor here because he has a question for you."

Qin Jiang withdrew his pressure. Wang Chao immediately scrambled to his feet, shot Sun Yang a dirty look, took a deep breath, and hurried over to Qin Jiang. Despite his still-pale face, he managed a radiant smile. "Lord Sword Emperor, what would you like to know?"

Sure enough, these two were friends for a reason. They wore the exact same sycophantic expression.

"I want to know where Liu Shuwan is," Qin Jiang said.

"The Saintess?" Wang Chao blinked, then answered, "The Saintess has been in seclusion near the 27,000-foot mark. Are you looking for her, Lord Sword Emperor?"

Just as he'd hoped—this old man knew the way.

"Take me to her," Qin Jiang ordered.

Wang Chao nodded. Sun Yang, meanwhile, looked somewhat disappointed—his limit was this depth, and he couldn't stay long. Wang Chao's limit was the 27,000-foot mark, though he couldn't linger there either, which was why he usually cultivated around 25,000 feet.

Sun Yang stayed behind while Wang Chao led Qin Jiang deeper into the valley. At this depth, Wang Chao's pace was slow. It took a full hour before Qin Jiang spotted a dwelling—slightly more refined than the huts belonging to Sun Yang and Wang Chao.

"Lord Sword Emperor, that's the place." Wang Chao pointed.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Got it. You can head back."

Wang Chao hesitated, then spoke up. "Lord Sword Emperor, the Saintess can be... rather cold. If she offends you in any way, I hope you'll be understanding."

With that, he departed.

Qin Jiang smiled faintly and approached Liu Shuwan's sanctuary.

Inside the dwelling, a beautiful woman sat cross-legged on a cushion. She wore a moon-white sword robe, her elegant hair pulled into a high ponytail, with a longsword resting across her knees. She cut a dashing, heroic figure. Yet her complexion was somewhat pale, and her delicate brows knit occasionally, as if she were in pain.

The moment Qin Jiang approached the door, she opened her eyes. A sharp gaze pierced through the walls toward his location. She'd been in seclusion here for thousands of years—occasionally visited by old acquaintances checking whether she was still alive—but this presence was utterly unfamiliar.

Liu Shuwan frowned. Then came a knock at the door—polite, at least. The old fossils who usually visited just shouted from outside, which she found endlessly irritating.

She stood, hung her longsword at her waist, and walked to the entrance. The door creaked open, and to her surprise, a handsome young man stood on the other side.

Liu Shuwan's eyes brightened. It had been ages since she'd seen someone so young, let alone this good-looking.

Seeing Liu Shuwan, a flash of admiration crossed Qin Jiang's eyes as well. She was even more striking in person than in the system's plot data. Despite her age, her outfit and bearing radiated youthful vitality—two contrasting qualities existing in one person, creating a striking effect.

"You must be Miss Liu?" Qin Jiang spoke first.

This ancestral elder might be ancient in years, but her mindset was still young—her style of dress made that obvious. As expected, his choice of address brought a pleased look to her face.

"You came looking for me?" she asked. Her voice was clear and crisp, with an almost girlish quality to it.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. "I did. Finding you took quite a bit of effort."

Curiosity glimmered in Liu Shuwan's eyes. "I don't know you. What do you want with me?"

Her voice carried warmth beneath its clarity—nothing like the coldness Wang Chao had described.

Qin Jiang hesitated, studying her face. He seemed to wrestle with something, opening his mouth several times without speaking. This only piqued her curiosity further.

"Why don't we... talk inside?" she offered.

Qin Jiang immediately nodded and followed her in. The interior was simple and compact, but more than spacious enough for two.

"Have a seat." Liu Shuwan gestured toward a stone stool, then sat on another across from him, resting her chin in one hand against the stone table. Perhaps she'd been alone too long—Qin Jiang's arrival had sparked her interest in conversation, which was why she'd invited him in.

"So," she said, watching him, "can you tell me now? What did you come to see me about?"
