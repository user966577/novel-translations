Arriving at the Human Dao Sect's inner sect, Chen Qi'er looked up at the traveling palace drifting in the sky, puzzled.

"That's the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's traveling palace? What are they doing at the Human Dao Sect? Some kind of alliance?"

He shook his head and dismissed it. He was here to find his sister—and he hadn't forgotten about Chen Changsheng either. Tearing his gaze away, a rare flash of excitement crossed his face.

"It's been tens of thousands of years. She must be even more beautiful now."

He looked down at himself. To see his sister, he'd changed into fresh clothes and styled his hair into something dashing and handsome. He rubbed his cheeks to loosen up his smile, then stretched his limbs—when he saw her, he'd sweep her into a great big hug. Maybe she'd throw herself into his arms first.

The thought made his smile deepen. He rubbed his hands together, barely able to contain himself.

Scanning the surroundings, he released his soul power in a vast web, blanketing nearly the entire inner sect. But he couldn't find any trace of his sister.

"Where is she?" he muttered. "She's not at the sect?"

Perhaps she'd gone out—that was understandable enough, but it meant their reunion would have to wait.

At that moment, a surge of force slammed into his soul. Chen Qi'er grunted, and an instant later, a figure appeared before him: Dao Kun.

Chen Qi'er's complexion paled slightly, but upon recognizing the Sect Master, a smile spread across his face. It was Dao Kun who had taken his sister away all those years ago. Only later did he learn the man was the Human Dao Sect's Sect Master. He owed Dao Kun a great deal—the man had changed both their fates. Without him, he and his sister might have become a pile of bones tens of thousands of years ago.

"Senior Dao Kun, it's been a long time."

Dao Kun studied him with a slight frown. This stranger had been scanning the sect's inner grounds with his soul power just now—brazen and disrespectful. But he was polite enough in person, and there was something vaguely familiar about him.

"You are..."

Dao Kun sized him up, secretly startled. This man's strength was likely no weaker than his own—and he was reputed to be the strongest below True Immortal. Where had this person come from?

Chen Qi'er smiled. "Don't you remember me, Senior? Tens of thousands of years ago, you took Baizhe away and left me a spirit stone."

Dao Kun's eyes went wide. "You! The little beggar boy from back then?"

"You remember." Chen Qi'er grinned.

Dao Kun stared hard at him. The shivering figure from that ruined temple gradually merged with the man standing before him. It really was that beggar.

"You're still alive..."

He could hardly believe it. The boy's aptitude had been atrocious—that was precisely why he'd only taken Chen Baizhe. At best, he'd estimated the boy might reach Heavenly Soul Realm in a lifetime. Yet tens of thousands of years later, this same boy was no weaker than him. How?

"Of course I'm still alive. And I have you to thank for that spirit stone, Senior—without it, I don't know how long it would've taken me to join the Human Dao Sect's outer sect and earn my one spirit stone per month."

Chen Qi'er spoke with genuine gratitude. He was truly thankful to Dao Kun and to the Human Dao Sect. Without the sect's policy of giving every outer disciple a monthly spirit stone, he might have remained a beggar for life.

His words made Dao Kun flush slightly. One spirit stone...

"One spirit stone doesn't mean much to someone as powerful as you."

Chen Qi'er shook his head earnestly. "Back then, that single spirit stone was everything I had. Without it, there'd be no me today. That stone was the foundation of everything."

Dao Kun couldn't help but smile. Building goodwill with a powerhouse like this was certainly no bad thing.

"You're here to see Baizhe, I take it?"

"Exactly." Chen Qi'er nodded, then asked, "She's not at the sect? I couldn't detect her aura just now."

"Oh, don't worry—she's here," Dao Kun chuckled, pointing up at the floating palace. "She's in the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's traveling palace."

"Ah, that explains it." Chen Qi'er nodded. His soul scan had covered the entire inner sect, but he'd overlooked the palace itself.

He gazed up at it, a fresh smile spreading across his face, though he didn't rush over. Instead, he turned to Dao Kun. "How has Baizhe been doing?"

"Quite well," Dao Kun said. "She's just found a Dao companion, in fact. They seem very much in love—I haven't seen Baizhe that happy in ages."

Though the situation gave him headaches, he could hardly tell Chen Baizhe's brother that she'd gotten together with a walking catastrophe. In his eyes, Chen Qi'er was essentially her parent coming to check on his child. He couldn't cause the man worry.

What he didn't notice was the way Chen Qi'er's expression slowly froze.

Dao Kun continued, gazing at the palace. "Actually, until recently, Baizhe was quite lonely. She'd shut herself away in her courtyard all day, doing nothing but cultivate. I worried she'd wither away in there. Fortunately, a few days ago, a remarkable young man came along, and they hit it off wonderfully. I can tell she's genuinely happy—she even brought him to meet me. You should've seen them together. Truly a perfect match, a golden couple. As her brother, you'd be thrilled."

He turned back to Chen Qi'er and found him silent, his expression stiff.

"What's wrong? Worried the young man might not treat her well?" Dao Kun offered a reassuring smile. "Don't be. He treats her very well—Baizhe's temperament wouldn't allow her to fall for someone who didn't. And don't let his current cultivation level fool you—his talent is excellent and his backing is formidable. He'll be able to stay by Baizhe's side for a long, long time."

Dao Kun leaned in conspiratorially. "Between you and me, at the rate those two are going, it won't be long before you're an uncle and I'm a grand-teacher. When that happens, you'd better bring a nice fat red envelope."
