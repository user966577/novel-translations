Every eye in the crowd locked onto that figure, burning with desire.

The woman's expression was cold, devoid of emotion. She surveyed the crowd coolly.

"Defeat me and earn my approval, and you may become my husband."

She was Chen Ningbing—the star of the tournament.

The moment she spoke, the crowd erupted:

"She really is Azure City Town's most beautiful woman! If I could just get close to her, I'd die happy!"

"Miss Chen's beauty isn't limited to Azure City Town—she ranks in the top ten across the entire Qin Domain. Countless prodigies consider her a goddess.

"With our caliber, we might as well give up."

"Heh, not necessarily.

"Word is, this tournament wasn't the city lord's idea at all. Miss Chen organized it herself."

"What?"

"I heard the city lord wanted to marry Miss Chen off to some powerful family's wastrel. She refused, so she's holding this tournament as an act of defiance.

"And because it was organized in a rush, news barely got out. Not many real prodigies could make it in time."

"Wait—so we actually have a chance!"

"Are you trying to get yourself killed?

"Miss Chen organized this to rebel against her father—that means going against the city lord! Mark my words, whoever becomes her husband will mysteriously vanish the next day!"

The crowd buzzed with excitement, but as more details spread, most of them cooled down. Though dying beneath a peony was supposedly a glamorous way to go, when it came down to it, most people valued their lives—especially when they probably wouldn't even get the peony.

Still, a few reckless souls remained.

A young man leapt onto the stage, eyes blazing with undisguised lust.

"Miss Chen, if I defeat you, can we go straight to the bridal chamber?"

He licked his lips, grinning lewdly.

Disgust flashed in Chen Ningbing's eyes, but she still nodded.

"Defeat me, and you may do as you please."

Her sword pointed toward the young man, and her aura erupted—a sharp, cutting pressure that made his expression shift.

"Golden Body Realm!"

The lust in the young man's eyes dimmed somewhat.

Chen Ningbing wasted no words and struck directly—one slash, with no mercy.

She'd organized this tournament to defy her father, yes, but she wouldn't settle for just anyone. At the very least, her husband had to defeat her and earn her respect.

And this man clearly didn't qualify.

Under that single slash, the young man stumbled backward, face pale, eyes wide with alarm.

Chen Ningbing didn't move from her position. She struck three more times in succession.

Each blow stronger than the last.

The young man immediately cried out:

"I surrender!"

BOOM!

Her savage attack slammed into the stage beside his feet, sending the whole platform shuddering.

The young man trembled, cold sweat drenching his face.

He shot Chen Ningbing a terrified look and scrambled off the stage. In mere breaths, he'd been utterly defeated.

The crowd stood stunned.

They'd all heard of Chen Ningbing's beauty—they hadn't expected her to be this strong as well.

"The Golden Body Realm..."

"Isn't Miss Chen only eighteen?"

"An eighteen-year-old at the Golden Body Realm—who knew her martial talent was this extraordinary!"

"Sigh, I'm out of the running. I'm twenty-eight and still at Meridian Condensation."

"Your age doesn't even qualify. She requires challengers between eighteen and twenty. You're practically an old man!"

The crowd murmured their amazement.

Chen Ningbing sheathed her sword and stood tall, cutting a striking figure that only drew more attention.

People stared, eyes glazing over.

From the restaurant window, Qin Jiang smiled appreciatively.

"Beautiful indeed."

Ye Ling'er felt a flash of admiration herself, but hearing Qin Jiang's praise sparked an involuntary comparison—along with a twinge of irritation.

The scoundrel had her in his arms, yet he was openly complimenting another woman.

She didn't like him—despised him, even—but it still felt... wrong, somehow.

Perhaps that was simply a woman's nature.

Several more challengers took the stage, but Chen Ningbing defeated them all.

After all, news of the tournament had only spread for a few hours. Most of those who'd arrived were locals from Azure City Town.

Not many genuine prodigies among them.

Chen Ningbing was somewhat disappointed, though also quietly relieved. She'd organized this tournament to defy her father. If she happened to meet an outstanding man, she'd genuinely consider marrying him.

If not...

This tournament would serve as a statement to her father: stop arranging marriages for her. Otherwise, she really would marry the first random person who came along.

"Any more challengers?"

Chen Ningbing called out.

Though many were tempted, her strength and the dangers that came with winning discouraged most. Sighs of regret filled the air, but no one stepped forward.

From the restaurant, Ye Ling'er looked at Qin Jiang.

"Aren't you going to make your move?"

With Qin Jiang's strength and background, victory would be assured the moment he stepped up.

Qin Jiang shook his head, smiling.

"No rush. The surprise is almost here."

About fifteen minutes later, Qin Jiang's eyebrow quirked. He spotted a familiar figure. His arm around Ye Ling'er tightened slightly.

"Here comes the surprise."

"What?"

Ye Ling'er was confused.

Qin Jiang said nothing more, simply watching the stage.

Chen Ningbing sat cross-legged on the platform. The tournament would continue for the full day, allowing time for prodigies who'd received word to arrive.

Finally...

A figure leapt toward the stage.

"Miss Chen, if you please!"

In the restaurant, the corner of Qin Jiang's mouth lifted. He looked at Ye Ling'er, whose expression had gone rigid.

"Well? Surprised?"

Her pretty face had gone pale. Her jade-like hands clenched into fists, and her slender body trembled. She stared at the figure on the stage, a wave of confusion washing through her.

"See that?

"That's your dear Xiao Fan. You were taken from him, and instead of trying to rescue you, he's already chasing another woman.

"Heh. Doesn't feel great, does it?"

The person on the stage was indeed Xiao Fan.

Without the Fire Tribe woman suppressing his talent, Xiao Fan's abilities had returned in full. In just over twenty days, his strength had undergone a dramatic transformation. He'd left the Xiao family and arrived at Azure City Town.

In the original storyline, it would have taken at least six more months for Xiao Fan to come here, and for the tournament to begin. But the altered plotline had triggered a butterfly effect.

The tournament had come early—and so had Xiao Fan.

His goal in entering wasn't Chen Ningbing herself, but a rare flame in the Chen family's possession. Of course, if things followed their original course, Chen Ningbing would inevitably have become part of Xiao Fan's harem.

But with Qin Jiang here, that was all about to change.

Looking down at Ye Ling'er, lips pressed tightly together in his arms, Qin Jiang smiled softly.

"Ling'er, shall we go say hello to Xiao Fan?"

Ye Ling'er snapped back to reality. Her beautiful eyes were clouded with confusion as she stared at Xiao Fan on the stage, disappointment written across her face.
