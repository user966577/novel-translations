Wu Tian cast one last glance at the airship, then dragged his battered body away.

In his current state, rescuing his sister was out of the question. He needed to preserve himself first. The enemy hadn't pursued him—probably assumed that strike had killed him. But if they discovered he was still alive, he might truly have no escape.

His injuries slowed him to a crawl. He avoided populated areas; he understood all too well the reach of Huaxia's influence. Instead, he plunged deeper into the dense forest.

After an unknowable distance, Wu Tian grew dizzy and lightheaded, his complexion even more ashen than before. Night was falling. He took a deep breath—once darkness came, he could absorb moonlight to restore his injuries. At the very least, he needed enough strength to protect himself.

He scanned his surroundings and found a concealed spot, then collapsed.

As night descended, threads of moonlight enveloped him. His pallor gradually took on a healthier hue, though his aura remained feeble. These wounds wouldn't heal anytime soon.

Near dawn, Wu Tian's eyes snapped open. He stared in one direction, a sharp edge in his gaze. "Who's there?"

"Oh, decent reflexes."

Before the voice finished, two figures appeared nearby, flanking Wu Tian from both sides.

"Old Black, this guy's no joke. We only just got here and he spotted us instantly. Since when does a Saint have that kind of awareness?"

The speaker studied Wu Tian with visible irritation. This was none other than the Void Beast.

The other was, naturally, Black Dragon. He clicked his tongue. "Obviously! The young master personally flagged this guy—you think he'd be ordinary? But you're one to talk, you useless lump. Bragging about how nobody below True Immortal could detect you, and then a Saint picks you up immediately."

"You just said yourself he's no joke. How's that my fault?"

The Void Beast snorted. He glared at Wu Tian, hostility burning in his eyes. This man had made him lose face spectacularly. If not for the young master's explicit orders—no direct combat, and absolutely do not kill him—the Void Beast would have attacked on sight.

The two bickered while Wu Tian watched them warily. One Ancient Emperor, one Great Emperor. Normally, he wouldn't fear them. But now...

Feeling the pitiful remnants of power inside him, Wu Tian gritted his teeth. If they pushed him to the brink, he'd destroy this body before letting them have their way. His Primordial Spirit would survive—a mere Ancient Emperor couldn't extinguish that. The problem was that this body was perfectly suited to him. Destroying it would mean needing rare treasures to reconstruct a physical form, and the damage to his foundation would be severe. As for possession, the consequences would be even worse. In this life, his ambitions extended far beyond merely recovering his former cultivation. He intended to reach even greater heights.

While Wu Tian was on guard, Black Dragon rolled his eyes and waved a hand. "Enough talk. Let's do this."

Black Dragon's body shimmered, transforming into an enormous dragon the size of a mountain, his massive draconic eyes fixed on Wu Tian. On the other side, the Void Beast revealed its true form as well. A single roar silenced the entire forest.

Both possessed high-level bloodlines. Under their call, weaker yao beasts from across the forest converged rapidly, and within moments, an uncountable tide of creatures surrounded Wu Tian.

Though most were individually weak, the sheer numbers...

Wu Tian's expression darkened.

Black Dragon let out a roar, and under the pressure of his bloodline, the entire beast tide surged toward Wu Tian.

Meanwhile, Black Dragon and the Void Beast retreated to a safe distance. Qin Jiang had specifically warned them: no direct confrontation, and if anything seemed off, run immediately. From that alone, they knew this man was far more than a simple Saint. After all, the young master had never been this cautious about anyone.

They absolutely would not underestimate him. The fact that Wu Tian had detected them the instant they arrived only heightened their wariness. The Void Beast had already cloaked both of them in spatial energy, ready to tear through the void and flee at the first sign of danger.

Staying alive was the priority. He still had a carriage to pull for the young master—dying here was not an option.

Black Dragon sidled up to the Void Beast and whispered, "Don't forget to take me with you when you run."

"Why don't you run on your own?"

The Void Beast rolled its massive eyes.

Black Dragon chuckled and wrapped his tail around the Void Beast's body. "You're the fast one."

"Get off me!"

The Void Beast shook violently, trying to throw Black Dragon off, but the dragon clung tight. If he didn't latch on now, this beast really might abandon him when the time came to flee. After a long struggle, the Void Beast gave up and glared at Black Dragon before resignedly turning its attention back to Wu Tian.

"This guy really isn't simple," Black Dragon remarked.

The Void Beast nodded.

Despite his severe injuries, Wu Tian was holding his own against the beast tide. Even Saint-level yao beasts couldn't withstand his attacks. But his freshly recovered wounds were deteriorating again under the strain, his face growing paler by the second. Weakness flooded his body.

He glanced up. Black Dragon and the Void Beast were the real threats. He had to find an opportunity to eliminate them.

That single glance immediately put both beasts on high alert.

"Watch out," Black Dragon sent telepathically.

The Void Beast tensed, the spatial energy around them growing denser, enveloping both in a cocoon of folded space. The moment Wu Tian made a move, they'd plunge into the void and vanish.

And indeed, Wu Tian was covertly gathering his power, preparing a killing blow against the pair. He was confident he could do it. The only downside was that after destroying these two massive beasts, his injuries would worsen considerably.

But he had no choice.

His accumulated power surged higher and higher. The moment he drove back the beast tide, he snapped his head up—

At that exact instant, the Void Beast and Black Dragon were wrapped in spatial power and vanished without a trace.

Wu Tian's attack had already launched. It streaked skyward and detonated with a thunderous boom, like an enormous firework.

Wu Tian stared in disbelief. These two... how had they fled so fast? A moment ago they'd been swaggering and posturing, but the instant he'd raised his hand—no, before he'd even raised his hand—they were gone.

Had they been preparing to run the entire time?

The realization hit him like a physical blow. His face went white and he coughed up a mouthful of blood, his body swaying, nearly crumpling to the ground.
