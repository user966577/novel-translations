He pulled her close, tilting her chin up with one finger. "Exactly. Yueyue's right outside. And Auntie Qing'er wouldn't want her finding out that you've been seducing her husband, would you?"

"I—when did I seduce you?!"

"Oh? You didn't?"

"I did not!"

Her face burned—with anger this time. She glared daggers at him.

Before she could say more, he kissed her again.

"You didn't?"

"You--"

Another kiss cut her off. And another. And another. Until finally:

"You didn't?"

This time, Murong Qing rose on her toes and pressed her lips firmly against his before he could move. She even bit down lightly. If Xue Yue weren't right outside, she'd have drawn blood.

She pulled back and glared. "Fine. I seduced you. Happy? What do you want?"

He blinked. Married women really were something else.

He leaned down until their foreheads touched. "What I want... is you."

She shoved at his chest. "Don't even think about it!"

"Auntie Qing'er doesn't want to?"

"I don't!"

"Really?"

His eyes gleamed. In one swift motion, he pushed her onto the bed. She looked up at him, a flicker of panic crossing her face. His hands found their targets with unerring precision, and she nearly cried out. She bit her lip hard, staring up at him with something close to pleading.

Yueyue was right outside. Absolutely not.

But she couldn't fight him off, and she couldn't make a scene. She wrapped her arms around him, brought her lips to his ear, and whispered, "Not now. Yueyue's out there. Later... I'll give you everything. Please?"

"I thought Auntie Qing'er didn't want to?" His hands didn't stop. If anything, they grew bolder.

She looked at him helplessly. "I... I do want to. Please, stop..."

"There's my good Auntie Qing'er."

He kissed her gently, and she could only kiss him back. It went on long enough that she was starting to lose her composure.

"Enough. Yueyue's going to get suspicious if we take too long."

"I want to kiss Auntie Qing'er."

"I just let you."

"I want to kiss the other lips."

She froze. He'd touched, yes, but kissing... she was afraid she wouldn't be able to handle it.

"Come on, Auntie Qing'er. My lips are so dry—they need moistening." He was already moving.

Her face was on fire. She shook her head, but she couldn't stop him. In the end: "Then hurry up."

"Heh. Gladly."

When he finally lifted his head, her eyes were unfocused, her expression dazed. "Satisfied?" she breathed.

"Mm. Thank you for the hospitality, Auntie Qing'er."

"Hmph."

She gave him a withering look, then took a moment to compose herself. They straightened up and walked out.

Xue Yue linked arms with both of them. "All packed?"

"Yes," Murong Qing said, stealing a glance at Qin Jiang—a silent warning to keep their secret. He only smiled.

In truth, he preferred things out in the open. But sneaking around with Murong Qing had its own thrill. He was fairly sure Xue Yue had already figured it out, though. She knew his nature. He didn't volunteer to help people pack.

"Want to say goodbye to anyone?" he asked.

Murong Qing shook her head without hesitation. Xue Yue did the same. The Blood Tribe had expelled her and imprisoned her mother. Nothing here was worth a farewell.

The three rose into the sky and flew to the airship. The women came out to greet them. The sight of so many beautiful faces made Murong Qing's head spin.

This many? She'd known about his reputation, but seeing it in person was something else. Could he even keep up?

Looking at those women—every one of them glowing, radiant, full of vitality—the answer was obviously yes.

Someday soon, she'd experience it for herself. After all, she'd made a promise back in that room. She was a woman of her word.

She took a steadying breath.

The other women studied her with open curiosity. They all knew who she was—Xue Yue's mother. That Qin Jiang had brought her back said everything. Everyone understood what it meant.

Well, everyone except Murong Qing herself.
