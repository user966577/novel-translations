The three went inside. This time, Qin Jiang kept his hands to himself around Xue Yue's mother. She was his actual mother-in-law, after all. Despite the fact that she was undeniably beautiful.

'A person can be beastly, but shouldn't be worse than a beast. Although... where exactly is that line?'

He pondered this, eyes occasionally drifting to Murong Qing while mother and daughter talked.

"Mother, did something happen while I was away?" Xue Yue finally asked.

Murong Qing blinked. "You don't know?"

"Know what?"

Looking at her oblivious daughter, Murong Qing let out a bewildered laugh. "You didn't hear? The Blood Tribe very publicly expelled you from the family."

"What?!" Xue Yue's mouth fell open. She turned to Qin Jiang, eyes seeking confirmation.

He nodded apologetically and rubbed her head. "After they found out about the Anti-Huaxia Alliance, they broadcast your expulsion everywhere to cut ties with you. But you were hiding in the mountains back then, so you never heard."

Understanding dawned. The tribe feared Huaxia and had thrown her overboard. That explained everything—the chief's awkwardness, the elders' guilty looks. It all made sense now. She was smart enough to piece it together instantly. Hurt and amused in equal measure. The Blood Tribe had played themselves spectacularly.

Murong Qing sighed. "In terms of the bigger picture, the Blood Tribe wasn't wrong. But for the two of us, it was heartless and unforgivable."

She glanced at Qin Jiang. Only with his backing could she afford to demand justice.

"Mother, what did they do to you?"

"After you were expelled, I tried to find you. They locked me up instead. I was only released recently."

She held nothing back. The only person in the Blood Tribe she cared about was her daughter. They'd expelled Xue Yue and imprisoned her for trying to help. She had every right to her anger.

"Mother was imprisoned?" Xue Yue's fists clenched. Not only had they expelled her, but they'd confined her mother too. She turned to Qin Jiang, wounded. "Qin Jiang~"

"The Blood Tribe went too far," he said.

She nodded furiously. "Way too far!"

"So what does Yueyue want to do?"

She hesitated. They were still her people—she couldn't slaughter the whole tribe. She looked at her mother. "What do you want, Mother?"

"Anything goes?"

Xue Yue turned to Qin Jiang, who nodded. "Whatever mother-in-law needs to feel better. Anything goes."

"Really?" Something sharp entered Murong Qing's gaze. "I know who first proposed expelling Yueyue. I want him dead."

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. More ruthless than expected—killing her own tribesman without hesitation. But the man had it coming. Without Qin Jiang in the picture, the expulsion would have left Xue Yue utterly alone.

"Done. What else?"

"And Yueyue's father. As chief, he was spineless—abandoning his own daughter at the first sign of trouble. As a father, he was a coward. He deserves worse."

Xue Yue flinched. Kill her own father? He'd been wrong, yes, but death felt extreme. A punishment would suffice. She opened her mouth to object, but Murong Qing caught her expression and softened.

"Though... he is your father. Killing him might weigh on you." She turned to Qin Jiang. "Is there an alternative?"

"I've got plenty of options. Things that make death look merciful."

Xue Yue's eye twitched. She tugged his sleeve—fate worse than death was even worse. Murong Qing, however, was intrigued. She'd spent nearly a year locked up, racked with anxiety and fear for her daughter. She'd nearly gone mad. A few minutes of pain for the chief was nowhere near adequate.

Qin Jiang caught Xue Yue's frantic eye signals and jumped in before Murong Qing could agree. "Actually, prolonged torture would burden Yueyue too. Watching her father suffer would be hard on her."

"Well..."

"How about this—I restrict his freedom the same way he restricted yours." The True Spirit Slave Seal materialized on his fingertip. "This enslaves his Primordial Spirit completely. Total control—no free will."

Mother and daughter stared at the glowing seal. "What is that?"

"The True Spirit Slave Seal. Once applied, he answers to me in all things. His life, his actions—all under my control."
