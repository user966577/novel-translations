Meanwhile, Chen Changsheng had finally arrived at the Human Dao Sect's headquarters.

The buildings here bore no resemblance to other sects' grand architecture. They were plain to the point of poverty. Everything exuded a single word: cheap.

The Human Dao Sect was genuinely poor. With far more disciples than any other faction—most of them utterly useless, just dead weight on the payroll—and no real revenue streams, all they had was raw strength. Nothing else.

Chen Changsheng couldn't help a small sigh. One of the three great powers, and it looked like... well, "back to basics" was a charitable description. A hegemonic faction that resembled an enormous village. There was practically no security—people came and went freely, all Human Dao Sect disciples, so there was nothing to guard against. And because they were so poor, nobody would bother stealing from them. The occasional troublemaker could be handled easily, and unless the other two great powers attacked—which would never happen—there was no real threat. The Limitless Holy Land and the Azure Lotus Divine Palace had better things to do. As a result, the entire Human Dao Sect felt absurdly laid-back.

Chen Changsheng walked in without anyone stopping him. Just like strolling into an ordinary village. People were everywhere doing their own thing—flirting, fighting, bragging...

He twitched. 'This is really the Human Dao Sect?'

"Hey, kid—you new?" A voice came from the side. Chen Changsheng looked over. One of the braggarts, an old man, was waving him over. After a moment's hesitation, he walked up.

"Greetings, Senior." He gave a small bow. He could tell at a glance that the old man was only at the Yin-Yang Realm—practically the weakest level in the entire sect. But courtesy cost nothing, especially somewhere new.

The old man nodded, clearly pleased. "Not bad, young man." He clapped Chen Changsheng on the shoulder. "Come, sit. Keep this old man company for a chat."

Chen Changsheng glanced around. He'd just heard the old man boasting to anyone who'd listen, and nobody had been willing to engage. Still, seeing the man's enthusiasm, he hesitated only briefly before sitting down across from him.

"Heh heh, fresh face. Just joined, right?" The old man grinned.

Chen Changsheng nodded. "I did just join. Does Senior have any advice?"

The old man's eyes glinted. He straightened up, puffing out his chest. "Kid, I've been in this sect for millions of years. There's nothing I don't know, nothing I haven't seen. As a newcomer, you must need some intel, right?"

'Millions of years? How full of it can one person be?' Chen Changsheng was unimpressed, but the old man did seem like a seasoned operator. A mere Yin-Yang Realm cultivator who'd survived this long in the Human Dao Sect had to have some street smarts. He clasped his hands. "I would indeed appreciate Senior's guidance."

"Heh heh." The old man extended his palm and gave Chen Changsheng a meaningful wink.

"...?" Chen Changsheng blinked. "What does Senior mean?"

"Tch, dense as a brick." The old man rolled his eyes. "You think intel is free?"

"..."

Chen Changsheng's expression darkened. He eyed the old man suspiciously. After getting scammed at the steward's counter, he was fairly certain this geezer was trying to fleece him too.

Seeing his look, the old man slammed the table and glared. "The hell are you looking at me like that for?"

"Senior, cursing at people unprovoked is hardly appropriate."

"So what if I curse at you? I'll beat you too! Pay up, or I'll beat you to death!"

"..."

Chen Changsheng's face went black. 'This Human Dao Sect is basically a criminal organization. Not a single decent person here.' The steward had merely threatened him. This old man was outright robbing him. He snorted coldly, stood, and turned to leave.

But the old man flickered and appeared directly in front of him. Chen Changsheng's brow furrowed. He instinctively raised his hand, and the next moment—

"AAAAAH!!!"

The old man shrieked, flew backward a dozen feet spraying blood everywhere, and screamed at the top of his lungs: "Help! Help! Murder! This young person has no martial ethics—bullying an old man! Help!!!"

"..."

Chen Changsheng's face was black as coal. He hadn't even touched the man. The geezer had launched himself backward on his own. And for someone supposedly spurting blood everywhere, his lungs were working just fine. 'Does this make any sense?'

Sense or no sense, a crowd materialized instantly, surrounding Chen Changsheng with hostile glares. He took one look around and understood—they were all in on it.

"Oh, my dear grandfather! What happened to you? Who did this?" A young man rushed up with comically exaggerated grief.

The old man rolled his eyes at the terrible acting but, ever the professional, stayed in character. His finger trembled as he pointed at Chen Changsheng. "It was him! He came to buy intelligence from me, and after getting what he wanted, not only refused to pay—he tried to kill me! Oh, the injustice! Is there no decency left in this world? Bullying an old man like this?!"

"I didn't buy any intelligence," Chen Changsheng said coldly.

Useless, of course. They were all working together. Auras flared as the crowd pressed in, glaring. "Pay up!"

"You—"

They were Supremes at best. In a real fight, he could annihilate every last one of them. But he'd just arrived. Making a scene would cause more problems than it solved. He took a deep breath and looked at the old man. "How much?"

"Ten thousand for the intel, thirty thousand for my injuries!"

The old man's eyes flashed. Chen Changsheng almost laughed despite himself. Forty thousand, just like that. What a shakedown.

"What intelligence is worth that much?" he sneered.

Seeing his reluctance, the old man was unfazed. "The intelligence you 'bought' concerns the very survival of the Human Dao Sect. If word gets out, their strongest will hunt you to the ends of the earth!"

"You—" Chen Changsheng's face changed. That was too heavy a charge to bear. He steadied himself. "If you're selling sect secrets, aren't you afraid they'll come after you too?"

This worked—the crowd's expressions shifted. Seizing the opening, Chen Changsheng said: "Five thousand. Take it or leave it."

"Not enough. Thirty thousand at least!"

"Ten thousand. Final offer!"

The moment he said it, the old man popped up from the ground, perfectly healthy, and stuck out his hand. "Pay up."
