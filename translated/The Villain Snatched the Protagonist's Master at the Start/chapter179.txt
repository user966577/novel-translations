Hu Xian'er watched with a forlorn look as Qin Jiang plucked the Three Dawn Miracle Bloom.

One immortal herb, and she still couldn't afford to keep him. Instead, she'd gotten herself kept.

"When you leave, can I come with you?" she asked.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Of course."

"Then... can I bring the White Fox Tribe along?"

Hope lit up her face.

Bring the whole tribe?

Qin Jiang hesitated. Before he could respond, Hu Xian'er sidled closer, rose on her tiptoes, and whispered conspiratorially in his ear, "I'll tell you a secret. Our White Fox Tribe is an auspicious omen."

"Oh?"

In the system's plot data, Tang Yin had stolen the White Fox Tribe's immortal herb, traded it to the Celestial Rabbit Tribe for their alliance, and in doing so drawn the fury of the entire Fox Race. The foxes had moved to destroy the Celestial Rabbit Tribe and kill Tang Yin, but various circumstances delayed them long enough for him to grow stronger.

Qin Jiang hadn't seen past that point in the story. But the Fox Race's reaction had always struck him as disproportionate—mobilizing the entire race over a single small tribe?

He hadn't thought much of it before, but Hu Xian'er's words cast it in a new light.

'If the White Fox Tribe is special enough to provoke the entire Fox Race...'

"Auspicious omen..." he murmured.

"That's right! We're an auspicious omen—the embodiment of the Fox Race's fortune. Every White Fox is born carrying fortune, a heaven-blessed treasure."

Qin Jiang's brows rose. "Your entire tribe is the Fox Race's fortune?"

"Exactly! Anyone who opposes us is opposing the entire Fox Race. And anyone who crosses us will have terrible luck. Like those people who tried to steal the herb—Jian Yao chopped them to pieces!"

Hu Xian'er looked quite pleased with herself.

Qin Jiang nodded. The Tang family had certainly been unlucky—they'd run headlong into him.

As for opposing the White Fox Tribe bringing bad luck... there was something to that. The Fox Race was powerful, which meant their accumulated fortune was substantial. Ordinary people who crossed a group with that kind of fortune backing them? Bad outcomes were practically guaranteed.

In the original story, Tang Yin was a Child of Destiny, so he could suppress the Fox Race's fortune with his own. But now, with Qin Jiang in the picture, Tang Yin's status as a chosen one wasn't nearly enough.

While he was mulling this over, Hu Xian'er tugged on his arm, her face full of anticipation.

"Can we come with you? We're not very strong, but our fortune will bring you good luck! And besides..." She blinked. "I'll let you in on another secret—our White Fox Tribe is all girls. When they grow up, every single one of them will be gorgeous."

Qin Jiang stared at her. This airheaded little fox actually knew exactly how to push his buttons.

Still...

"Won't the Fox Race object to you leaving with me?"

"They don't interfere with us! As long as we're safe, they won't cause problems. And don't let our weakness fool you—we have connections!" She puffed out her chest proudly.

"Is that so?"

"Absolutely! The White Fox Tribe isn't actually a single bloodline. We're gathered from fox clans all across the Demon Domain. Whenever a white fox is born carrying fortune, she gets sent to us. So we have ties to every major fox clan."

'Well, well. That explains it.'

"And every single white fox is female?"

"Yep! All girls." Hu Xian'er launched into the explanation. "See, all the fox clans in Azure Cloud Heaven share a common ancestor—an ancient White Fox. That ancestor walked the path of fortune and supposedly gathered the fortune of every fox clan, becoming the Demon Domain's most powerful being. But then she disappeared. After that, white foxes started appearing sporadically in various clans, each one born with fortune. The fox elders say we're all incarnations of that ancestor, so gradually, they collected us into the White Fox Tribe. It just kept growing until we became what we are now. And since the ancestor was female... all of us are girls."

"So you're all incarnations of that ancestor?"

"I don't know." Hu Xian'er's lower lip jutted out. "I don't want to be anyone's incarnation. I just want to be Hu Xian'er."

Qin Jiang reached over and rubbed her head. "You are Hu Xian'er."

She melted under his touch, disappointment evaporating instantly. Just like a child—emotions came fast and left faster.

"Since the Fox Race won't stop you, come along for now."

He smiled. His current forces, formidable as they were, weren't enough to go toe-to-toe with the Fox Race head-on. No need to invite conflict before it was necessary.

Hu Xian'er's face lit up. She threw her arms around him. "I'll definitely bring you good luck!"

Qin Jiang chuckled and looked to Jian Yao and the others. "Let's rest here tonight. Tomorrow, we head for the Celestial Rabbit Tribe."

---

Deep in a murky forest, a ragged figure staggered along.

"Sss..."

He hissed through his teeth with every step, limping badly, one hand clutching his backside where blood still seeped.

"Damn those boars! How dare they ram my—"

It was Tang Yin.

After fleeing the White Fox Tribe, he'd bolted straight into a boar territory in his blind panic. The memory of what followed made his face twitch. Hundreds of crazed boars had slammed into him from every direction, nearly trampling him to death.

The most humiliating part? Several of them had aimed specifically for his lower half.

There was no defense against it.

He'd very nearly been rendered a eunuch. He'd managed to shield the front just in time, but the back...

His fists clenched, eyes burning with hatred.

Finding a relatively safe spot, he rested briefly. Drawing a shuddering breath, he took stock. The Tang family was essentially finished—first Qin Family City, now the White Fox Tribe. They'd been picking fights everywhere and running into Immortals at every turn.

His eyes flickered as he weighed his options. After a long silence, he murmured to himself.

"I can't go back to the Tang family. But the Celestial Rabbit Tribe... might be worth a visit."
