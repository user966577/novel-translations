It was him.

The Empress recognized Qin Jiang instantly. A visitor of unknown identity who might threaten the Merfolk tribe? Of course she'd investigated. She hadn't uncovered anything useful, but she knew what he looked like—and the impression had stuck.

In person, he was even more striking than the portrait. And in her current state, seeing him was like pouring oil on a fire. The heat nearly overwhelmed what little reason she had left.

She'd been about to flee. Now, instead, she found herself drifting toward him—involuntarily, as if drawn by gravity. Her legs gave out, and she collapsed into him. Qin Jiang caught her deftly, saving her from the fall.

Couldn't have her getting bruised. He'd feel bad.

He looked down. Her eyes were glazed with desire, and the moment she was in his arms, she clung to him—writhing, coiling around him like she meant to fuse with him.

She raised her face, lips parted, and breathed, "Please~"

Across the ruined chamber, both the Grand Elder and Mengqian had seen Qin Jiang appear. They stopped fighting simultaneously.

The Grand Elder's expression tightened. He'd recognized Qin Jiang too. Mengqian's face flushed with fury.

"Let go of the Empress!"

Qin Jiang raised his head, arms open in a gesture of innocence. The Empress was tearing at his clothes. "You should be telling your empress to let go of me."

Mengqian faltered. He had a point. He was just standing there—it was the Empress who'd latched onto him, squirming desperately against his body.

Seeing her condition, Qin Jiang understood she was past her limit. He secured her with one arm, preventing her from flailing.

Then his gaze turned cold as it fell on the Grand Elder. "Still here? Get lost."

"Young Master, isn't this a bit much? I spent years preparing that drug, and I personally administered it. You're swooping in to claim the prize—doesn't that seem beneath your station?"

Qin Jiang's frown deepened. "Swooping in? I'm performing a heroic rescue."

He waved his hand impatiently. "I don't have time for you. Leave now, or I'll kill you where you stand."

The Grand Elder's face darkened. He weighed his options—fight or flee. Against two Immortal Kings, victory was unlikely. And his own reinforcements were clearly out of the picture.

If they hadn't come by now, they weren't coming. Something had gone wrong the moment Qin Jiang appeared—his people had probably been neutralized.

Years of planning, and nothing to show for it. The bitterness was suffocating.

Taking a deep breath, the Grand Elder forced a conciliatory smile. "The Empress is yours, Young Master. Once you're finished, might I—"

"Get lost!"

Immortal Emperor pressure crashed down. A figure materialized beside Qin Jiang.

An Xihe.

She hadn't shown herself these past few days, but she'd been at Qin Jiang's side the entire time—even exchanging a few covert probes with the Merfolk Empress. Nothing that drew attention.

The Grand Elder went white. Another Immortal Emperor. He'd felt that level of power before—under the Empress's casual aura burst, he'd been injured. A fully unimpaired Immortal Emperor? He couldn't even run.

He dropped to his knees without a second thought, kowtowing furiously. "Young Master, this lowly one was ignorant and reckless! Please forgive me, I'll remove myself—"

True to his word, he prostrated himself and rolled toward the palace exit. Actually rolled.

Qin Jiang let him go. Outside the palace, his Immortal Kings were waiting. The moment the Grand Elder emerged, they'd seize him.

The palace interior wasn't a good place for spectators, after all. There was business to attend to.

Mengqian didn't relax just because the Grand Elder was gone. One predator had been replaced by another.

"So you get to play the hero again." An Xihe eyed the Empress in Qin Jiang's arms.

He grinned. "This is a genuine rescue. Though I've only saved her halfway—more work to do."

He loosened his hold, giving the Empress room to move. Within moments, all pretense of clothing was gone.

Nearby, Mengqian's face burned red. She strode forward. "Don't you dare harm the Empress!"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. He didn't even glance at her. "I'm saving your empress."

"Liar! Let her go!"

"Are you blind? She's been poisoned. If I don't help her, she'll die. Unless you'd rather do it?"

"That's not how you save someone!"

"It's an aphrodisiac. What other method is there? Can you do it?"

"I—"

Mengqian choked. Tears welled in her eyes. The Empress—a woman of spotless virtue—was she truly going to be violated?

"Is there no other way?"

"No."

The answer was final. Mengqian's shoulders sagged. She turned away, unable to watch. She could only imagine how the Empress would feel when she regained consciousness.

But survival was better than death.

Then she heard the Empress's voice behind her—unmistakable relief, unmistakable surrender. Mengqian's body went rigid.

'Your Majesty, I hope you can accept this when it's over.'

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang was multitasking. He looked over at An Xihe. "Xihe, want to join in?"

"Not here. It's not safe. I'll keep watch. Hurry up."

"Alright." He sounded mildly disappointed. Then his gaze settled on Mengqian's back. "Hey—you want in?"

Mengqian clenched her fists. Her heart ached for the Empress even more. This man was nothing but a playboy. Could the Empress ever accept him?
