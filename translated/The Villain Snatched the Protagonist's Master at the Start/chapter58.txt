Lin Chen attacked relentlessly, violent energy tearing across the arena—yet failing to so much as budge Qin Jiang.

"Is that all you've got?" Qin Jiang didn't hold back his mockery. He was a villain, after all. Taunting the protagonist was practically in the job description.

Lin Chen took a deep breath, his mind reeling. His Sword Intent was completely ineffective against Qin Jiang—simply overpowered. He furrowed his brow, unable to make sense of it. After a brief pause to collect himself, he fixed Qin Jiang with a cold smile.

"I don't care what tricks you have. Before absolute power, none of it matters!" He raised his sword, his aura surging. "Heh, everyone assumes I've only comprehended Sword Intent. But the truth is, my sword comprehension has already reached Sword Force. Qin Jiang—you're the first person who's forced me to go all out. You should be proud!"

His voice, dripping with arrogance, carried across the entire arena. Sword Force! The two words sent shockwaves through the crowd.

"Sword Force? He's actually reached Sword Force?"

"At his age, achieving Sword Force means he could potentially break through to Sword Heart in the future. The Holy Sword Sect really did find a gem."

"Could Jiang'er be in danger?"

"Let's watch. On Qin family grounds, Jiang'er will be fine."

The Qin family elders studied Lin Chen with a mixture of astonishment and an unreadable expression. A Sword Heart master could claim the title of Sword Emperor—sovereign of all sword cultivators. Among sword cultivators, there was an unspoken rule: a Sword Emperor could command every sword cultivator under heaven. Those who defied this authority would be hunted by all. And sword cultivators were the most numerous faction on the Heavenly Mystery Continent. The emergence of a Sword Emperor could rally a force rivaling any of the great ancient clans in short order. Yet for tens of thousands of years, no Sword Heart master had appeared.

"Sword Force! Lin Chen really has reached Sword Force!" Bai Jingyun's face was alight with excitement. He understood the implications perfectly. If Lin Chen could advance to Sword Heart, the Holy Sword Sect would become the holy land of all sword cultivators. Countless powerful swordsmen would flock to join.

Bai Susu, meanwhile, wore a look of concern. She'd long suspected Lin Chen's sword comprehension had reached this level, and now it was confirmed. "Father, warn Lin Chen—don't let him hurt Qin Jiang," she whispered.

Bai Jingyun's excited expression faltered. Qin Jiang had been toying with Lin Chen this whole time and he hadn't intervened. Asking Lin Chen to hold back now seemed a bit unfair.

"Father, this is the Qin family's territory. If Lin Chen injures Qin Jiang, neither of you will come out unscathed," Bai Susu added quickly, her cheeks flushing as she realized how her first request had sounded. She forced out a more practical justification.

Bai Jingyun glanced at his daughter. Though he questioned her true motives, one look at the Qin family elders—whose expressions had turned rather ominous—sent a jolt through him. He was about to call out a warning when Qin Jiang's unhurried voice rang across the arena.

"Actually, I know a thing or two about swordsmanship myself."

Qin Jiang stood there with a casual smile. Lin Chen's Sword Force pressed down on him from all sides, razor-sharp energy woven into the pressure, yet it caused him no harm whatsoever.

"Jiang'er knows swordsmanship?"

"Since when? I've never seen him practice the sword."

"I've never even seen him cultivate..."

The Qin family members stared at the arena, eyes alight with anticipation. Given Qin Jiang's performance so far, if he truly understood swordsmanship, his level couldn't possibly be low. Could he have also reached Sword Force?

"Qin Jiang knows swordsmanship?" Bai Jingyun asked, turning to Bai Susu.

She shook her head. "I don't think so. As far as I know, he's never trained. All he does is eat, drink, and enjoy himself." She gazed at Qin Jiang on the arena, her expression puzzled. With how lazy he was, how could he possibly be this strong? It didn't make sense.

Qin Jiang stood on the arena, swordless—yet his entire being had become a blade. He released no aura, no pressure, and yet the sword in Lin Chen's hand began to tremble uncontrollably. Not from the strain of battle, but as if it were afraid. As if it were worshipping.

Lin Chen's body shook. He stared at Qin Jiang in disbelief. The entire arena was blanketed by his Sword Force—this should have been his domain. And yet Qin Jiang had seized control of everything.

"Sword Heart! That's Sword Heart!" Lin Chen bellowed.

A flash of genuine fear crossed his eyes. He'd reached Sword Force through the accumulated experience of two lifetimes. For Qin Jiang—a young man—to have attained Sword Heart? Was that even possible? Absolutely not. Unless Qin Jiang, like himself, was a reborn soul who'd seized a body—and one whose previous life had been far more terrifying than his own. He might have even seen through Lin Chen's identity entirely. The "short, fat, round" taunt before the fight began—that was Qin Jiang hinting that he already knew.

Lin Chen's thoughts spiraled into chaos. The longer he looked at Qin Jiang, the more his fear grew.

His shout had also stunned everyone present. Sword Heart? Qin Jiang? Even Bai Jingyun and the Qin family members couldn't believe it at first.

"Jiang'er's sword comprehension has reached Sword Heart?"

"I don't practice swordsmanship, but there really is a transcendent quality about Jiang'er."

"Sword Heart! Hahahaha! Our Qin family's young patriarch truly is a once-in-a-generation talent!"

"With Jiang'er's gifts, reaching Sword Heart is perfectly normal, isn't it?"

"Pfft, a mere Sword Heart. Nothing to make a fuss about. For Jiang'er, reaching Sword Heart is the baseline. If he hadn't reached it—now that would be strange."

The Qin family members adjusted their mindset with remarkable speed. From initial disbelief, it took them all of a few breaths to conclude that Qin Jiang achieving Sword Heart was only natural. 'Hasn't reached Sword Heart? Then you're not our young patriarch. Fess up—who are you really?'

Bai Jingyun had already gone rigid. He'd sensed it vaguely before Lin Chen's announcement, but hadn't dared believe it. Now that Lin Chen himself—a Sword Force master, a king among swordsmen—had confirmed Qin Jiang's Sword Heart, there could be no mistake.

"Sword Heart, Sword Heart, Sword Heart..." he murmured over and over. The ultimate realm that countless sword cultivators aspired to had actually been achieved.

He gazed at Qin Jiang on the arena with something approaching reverence. A Sword Emperor—revered by all sword cultivators under heaven! Though Qin Jiang wasn't a Holy Sword Sect disciple, he was his son-in-law. That practically made him half a sect member, didn't it? By that logic, saying the Holy Sword Sect had produced a Sword Emperor wasn't much of a stretch...

As this thought took hold, Bai Jingyun's excitement nearly overwhelmed him.

Beside him, Bai Susu watched her father trembling uncontrollably and snapped him out of his reverie. "Father, are you having a seizure?"
