"Li Yang — that's a nice name," Ye Xuan said sweetly. She pulled her hand back and gestured ahead. "Want to walk together?"

"S-sure!"

He scratched his head, flashing a goofy grin. She smiled and started forward. He watched her go, momentarily lost in the way she moved.

'Am I falling in love? No, no — Qingqiu is the only one for me.'

"Hey, come on!" Ye Xuan called over her shoulder, waving him forward.

He laughed and jogged to catch up. She turned back around, hands clasped behind her back, practically bouncing along the ice staircase as if the cold didn't exist. Her energy was infectious.

Li Yang's heart fluttered despite himself. He swallowed hard, quickened his pace to walk beside her, and kept sneaking glances. He felt... happy. Genuinely happy.

Ye Xuan noticed every sidelong look. She took the initiative: "Li Yang, you were frozen back there — are you hurt?"

"What? No, no, I'm fine."

He waved both hands. Being the only person frozen on an ice staircase full of geniuses was humiliating enough without dwelling on it.

"Good. You seem pretty composed now. You just got distracted earlier, right?"

"Yeah... got a bit distracted."

He exhaled in relief, his opinion of Ye Xuan climbing another notch. She wasn't looking down on him — she was making excuses for him.

'What an incredible girl.'

"Distracted? Ha. Waste of space, more like. What kind of excuse is that?"

A mocking voice cut in. Li Yang's expression stiffened. He turned to find a young man sneering at him with undisguised contempt.

Li Yang's face darkened. He'd just made a friend, and now someone was humiliating him right in front of her. Intolerable.

He clenched his fists, and his aura surged outward.

"Yin-Yang Realm?" The young man's eyebrow rose. His disdain deepened as he flared his own pressure — Great Emperor.

Li Yang grunted under the force, nearly buckling on the ice. Among all the students, Great Emperors were a tiny minority. Just his luck to pick a fight with one before even setting foot in the academy.

"Pathetic." The young man dismissed him and turned to Ye Xuan with a charming smile. "Miss, would you care to walk with me? The entrance trials ahead might be challenging — perhaps I could be of assistance."

"Not interested." Ye Xuan shook her head. She stepped to Li Yang's side and took his arm gently. "Let's go."

"Okay."

He glanced at her, then quickly looked away, ears burning. His heart was hammering so hard he thought it might crack a rib. 'Is this what it feels like? Am I... in love?'

'But what about Qingqiu? I like her too...'

He was torn.

The young man's brow creased at the rejection. He blocked their path, all pretense of courtesy gone. "Why trail behind a deadweight? If there are more trials, he'll only drag you down."

"You—" Li Yang's eyes blazed.

This prick kept calling him trash, and now he was trying to steal Ye Xuan away. Absolutely not. One look at that leering face told him everything — if Ye Xuan went with this guy, she'd be in danger.

But the power gap was too wide. Even with his extraordinary combat power, a Great Emperor was beyond him. Unless the three old monsters in the Chaos Sword intervened.

He glared helplessly. The young man's contempt only grew.

Ye Xuan's own eyes flashed with hidden disdain — well concealed — before she rounded on the man, her expression icy. "Move."

"Now, now, no need to be so—"

"Move!"

She struck with an open palm. Great Emperor-level force sent the young man stumbling backward. Half a year ago, she'd been a Saint. But the Ye family had poured resources into securing her academy slot, and combined with her prodigious talent, she'd broken through to Great Emperor in just six months.

The young man gaped. "Great Emperor?"

His wariness blossomed alongside a new appreciation. A woman like this was worthy of him. His gaze grew heated — but her cultivation kept him in check. After a moment, he smiled and stepped aside. "My apologies. After you."

Ye Xuan swept past with Li Yang in tow.

Watching her retreating figure, the young man's smile faded to something cold. "A waste like that doesn't deserve a woman like her. We'll see."

Once they were safely ahead, Ye Xuan looked at Li Yang. "You okay?"

"Yeah. You're... you're a Great Emperor?"

She nodded, then grinned impishly. "I'll protect you~"

Li Yang felt his heart nearly leap out of his chest. In that moment, Qingqiu didn't matter at all. He only wanted the girl in front of him.

But just as his pulse peaked, Ye Xuan turned away with a laugh. "Just kidding! A man can't let a woman protect him — people will call you a waste. Right?"

He deflated. That was exactly what had just happened.

He was struck by a pang of inadequacy. As things stood, he truly didn't deserve a girl like her.

"Come on, let's keep moving. There'll probably be more tests ahead."

He nodded. "Yeah."

They continued along the ice staircase, chatting as they walked. Li Yang's mood swung wildly with every word she said.

"The man I end up with has to be stronger than me."

"He can be weak now — that's fine — but he needs the courage to stand up for me. To shield me from everything."

"Your talent is probably incredible, right? Who knows — maybe you'll surpass me one day~"

"Hehe, I'd love to see that happen."

Li Yang's emotions were a rollercoaster. She had him in the palm of her hand, and he didn't even realize it. He walked in a daze, occasionally breaking into a goofy smile for no apparent reason.
