"Looking good." After a thorough examination, Qin Jiang nodded with satisfaction.

The residual Sword Valley energy had been fully purged, and the resulting injuries had mostly healed over the past two days.

"Without the valley's energy aggravating things, the remaining damage isn't a big deal," Liu Shuwan said softly.

She was right. The Sword Valley energy had been Sword Heart-level power, far beyond her ability to clear. But ordinary injuries were nothing for a cultivator of her caliber.

Qin Jiang smiled and produced a medicinal pill. "Here—take this." He popped it straight into her mouth. Her brows furrowed as she mumbled around it, "You're not drugging me, are you?"

Qin Jiang's eye twitched. He flicked her forehead. "Would I do that?"

Liu Shuwan nodded seriously. She'd give anyone else the benefit of the doubt—but Qin Jiang? He was absolutely capable of it. He'd already knocked her out during meditation with some kind of incense, multiple times. Still, she swallowed the pill. Qin Jiang wouldn't actually harm her. At worst... she'd lose a few more inches of dignity.

A cool, soothing sensation flowed through her body. The injuries from her Sword Valley attempts healed rapidly—even some old wounds improved significantly. She stared at him in surprise. "That really was just medicine?"

"What, you want me to add something extra?"

Liu Shuwan shot him a look, then studied him carefully. "I'm starting to wonder if you're really Qin Jiang."

Qin Jiang: "???"

He took a deep breath, a smirk forming. "Wifey, are you deliberately provoking me so I'll... flirt with you?" He pulled her closer. "We're practically an old married couple—if you want to be intimate, just say so."

"Who's an old married couple with you!" Her face flushed. He'd seen right through her.

Qin Jiang chuckled and abruptly released her. Liu Shuwan froze—that was it? She frowned. Since his return from the valley's depths, he hadn't been as... aggressive. Almost as if he'd lost interest. The thought hit her like cold water. Had he actually lost interest?

Her body tensed. She bit her lip and stared at him with wounded eyes, looking every bit the aggrieved wife.

Qin Jiang was confused. "What's wrong?"

"Hmph." She turned away, ignoring him.

Qin Jiang: "..."

Baffled. She'd been perfectly fine a moment ago. He must have pushed too fast—maybe calling her "wifey" was premature. They hadn't known each other that long, and the age thing was clearly still weighing on her. He decided to dial it back.

"Um... Miss Liu, I have something for—"

"What did you just call me?" Liu Shuwan whipped around, cutting him off. Her eyes shone with even more hurt.

He'd already changed his mind! Just moments ago it was "wifey," and now she was "Miss Liu" again.

"Uh..."

She seemed angrier than before. Qin Jiang was lost.

When he didn't respond, Liu Shuwan's voice quavered with injustice. "Playboy. Got what you wanted and stopped trying."

The words hit like lightning. He'd read the situation completely wrong—she wasn't upset because he was moving too fast. She was upset because he'd slowed down! He'd guessed the exact opposite.

Well, if that was the problem, the solution was easy. Women were simple creatures, really.

He wrapped his arms around her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder—cheek pressed to cheek. She turned her face away, lips pursed. But she didn't pull free of his embrace.

"Hehe, wifey, you smell amazing."

Liu Shuwan wrinkled her nose in disgust. "Pervert!"

Despite the insult, her expression softened. So that's what he was into. It made sense—from the very beginning, Qin Jiang had acted like a pervert. Liu Shuwan had apparently grown accustomed to that version of him.

With a resigned sigh, Qin Jiang leaned into the role. He wasn't actually a pervert—but if it made her happy, he'd play one for a day. Once he committed, there was no half-measures. And Liu Shuwan offered little resistance. Nature took its course.

The next day, Liu Shuwan gazed at Qin Jiang with a dreamy, dazed expression. Her cheeks were rosy, tinged with lingering shyness. She hadn't expected that one little tantrum would lead to... that. And she hadn't resisted. Not really.

With a soft sigh, she settled her warm gaze on Qin Jiang and nestled contentedly into his side.

"Wifey, ready to come with me now?" Qin Jiang asked suddenly.

Liu Shuwan tilted her head, studying him. "You have other women out there, don't you?"

Qin Jiang's expression tightened. Under her earnest gaze, he considered for a moment, then nodded. "Not that many. A few hundred, maybe."
