While the women lined up for their turn with the silk drapes, word had spread through the academy that Qin Jiang was back.

The first cohort of students all knew him personally. Some of the women among them had even been teased by him and carried lingering crushes. Then there were the beauties hand-picked during the Mystic Cloud Heaven selection, all of whom had been sent to the academy. Over a decade of silence from Qin Jiang had left them more than a little resentful.

Now, hearing he'd returned, twelve of them gathered and marched toward the restricted zone to demand recognition.

Standing at its perimeter, they exchanged nervous glances.

"Are we really going in?" one whispered.

"It's been over a decade. He probably doesn't even remember us."

"What if we barge in and he gets angry?"

"But he promised us! He said sending us to the academy was just to build our strength. He said he wouldn't abandon us."

"That was just to keep our families in line, wasn't it?"

Their voices were hushed, their expressions dim. When Qin Jiang had made his selection, he'd chosen thirteen. If he'd sent all thirteen away, they might have felt better about it. Instead, he'd kept one and shipped the rest off—leaving them feeling like discarded chess pieces whose only value was the factions behind them.

The thought deepened their melancholy.

In truth, Qin Jiang hadn't been that calculating. Huaxia was powerful enough that it didn't need romantic entanglements to secure alliances. But these twelve simply hadn't been as compelling as a genuine fortune heroine. At the time, he'd focused his attention on Wu Yingtao.

Their cultivation had been weak, so he'd provided resources and sent them to the academy with special instructions for their care. Now, after all those years, they'd all reached at least Ancient Emperor, with three at Human Immortal—a massive improvement.

As for Qin Jiang? He'd genuinely forgotten about them. With so many women around, even when the memory surfaced, it was quickly crowded out by someone else's needs. The academy had been his unofficial "cultivation farm"—he'd figured he could collect them whenever he pleased. He just... hadn't gotten around to it.

After much deliberation, one woman steeled herself. "We came all this way. We're not leaving empty-handed. Just think about how he looks—could you really give that up?"

The words conjured Qin Jiang's image in every mind. That handsome face—could they give it up?

Absolutely not.

Their resolve crystallized. This was happening. They deserved recognition!

Bolstered by the image of his face, they exchanged nods and stepped into the restricted zone. The guards recognized their status as women Qin Jiang had personally acknowledged and didn't dare stop them.

The moment they crossed the threshold, Qin Jiang sensed their presence—and finally remembered they'd been at the academy for over a decade. A small pang of guilt pricked him.

Inside the main chamber, he quietly accelerated the time flow. The group session was nearly finished anyway. Once done, these newcomers would make a nice dessert course.

The twelve women crept through the estate, gawking at their surroundings. They'd never set foot in the restricted zone before. After much searching, they finally spotted the imposing building at the center.

Muffled sounds drifted from within. They shared a look and approached cautiously—but before they reached the door, a figure emerged.

Qin Jiang.

He'd finished the session inside, time flow cranked to maximum, and stepped out to greet them. Seeing them, he smiled warmly and waved. "You're here."

The sight of him obliterated every last trace of resentment. All that remained was a faint undercurrent of hurt feelings. Faced with that face and that gentle voice, they simply couldn't stay angry.

But they didn't know what to say. They barely knew him, really. And the bold demand for recognition they'd rehearsed? Far too embarrassing to voice now.

Qin Jiang stopped half a step away, scanning their faces. "What's the matter?"

He could roughly guess what they were thinking. Over a decade of neglect warranted some resentment. He just needed to help them vent it. And the simplest method was a bit of exercise—work up a good sweat, and all the grievances would evaporate.

"You... you still remember us?" one woman asked, biting her lip.

Qin Jiang took her hand and pulled her into his arms. "Of course I remember you. What kind of question is that?"

"Then why didn't you come see us all these years? We thought..."

He patted her head, then addressed them all. "I'm sorry. I've been busy unifying the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands and couldn't find the time. But I came back this time specifically for you. From now on, you'll stay by my side. No more separations. How does that sound?"
