The frontier.

Long Yu's tent was a war zone of smashed objects. His expression was murderous.

Another operation had gone sideways. His entire unit—wiped out. Worse, the Dragon Emperor himself had caught wind and issued a blistering reprimand. Long Yu's generalship had been revoked.

"Those damned demonic cultivators—not a single one of them keeps their word!"

His face contorted with rage and regret. What had possessed him to ally with these people? Every last one of them was scum. Only he'd been naive enough to get played like a fiddle.

After a long bout of venting, Long Yu gradually stilled. His expression remained dark, but a calculating look entered his eyes. He clenched his fist, and a wisp of demonic qi leaked from his skin. He was one of them now—no turning back.

He exhaled slowly. Working with the Demon Hall directly had been a disaster. Every demonic cultivator was a treacherous snake; they'd never obediently march to their deaths for his benefit. But if they could backstab him, why couldn't he return the favor?

The Demon Lord materialized in his tent.

Long Yu glanced over without the explosive fury of last time. He simply regarded the Demon Lord with cold, flat eyes.

The Demon Lord raised an eyebrow. 'He's growing.'

He bowed slightly, voice dripping with contrition. "Holy Son, this operation's failure was caused by a rogue element who—"

Long Yu cut him off with a wave. "I don't need excuses. Prepare the next operation."

"But—"

"Did I stutter?"

Long Yu's voice hardened.

The Demon Lord paused, studying the young prince for a long moment. Then he nodded. "Your subordinate will see to it."

In the Imperial City, inside the Void Divine Temple.

A rare flicker of anxiety touched the Demon Hall Founder's crimson eyes.

"You're still..." Her voice was icy, but threaded with an unmistakable hint of shyness.

She couldn't even control herself anymore. The sensation was maddening—especially under Qin Jiang's teasing gaze, which made her cheeks flush despite herself.

What followed was Qin Jiang methodically unraveling her composure, pulling at her emotional threads with practiced ease.

...

He watched her with a faint smile as she struggled between defiance and surrender.

He was waiting for her to come to him willingly.

Under his relentless pressure, tears actually welled in the Demon Hall Founder's eyes. An immortal-path powerhouse... crying.

But Qin Jiang showed no mercy. This was a grand demoness. Sympathy was not on the menu.

She stared at him, unblinking.

He smiled.

She held firm, wiping the tears away with a fierce gesture and clamping her jaw shut.

But her defenses were crumbling.

Qin Jiang pressed his advantage, continuing to tug at every thread...

Deep in the Founder's mind, a voice she'd been trying to silence finally won: 'Just give in. It's not that big a deal.'

She talked herself into it. At this rate, she'd break anyway—better to capitulate on her own terms. She unclenched. The furrow between her brows smoothed.

This time, when Qin Jiang moved to leave, she spoke first.

"Don't go," she whispered, soft and pleading.

From across the room, Jian Yao huffed. "Hey—what's taking so long? My turn!"

The Founder spared her a glance, then ignored her entirely. Her gaze fixed on Qin Jiang. She clung to him as though terrified he'd vanish.

"I know what you want. I'll stay with you—same as her. I can protect you too. And once I recover my full strength, I'll be stronger than her. Much stronger."

"You?" Jian Yao scoffed. "Stronger than me? Funny—I don't recall the stronger one being the one who got captured."

"Qin Jiang," the Founder murmured, eyes only for him. She knew that despite Jian Yao's immortal-path power, the woman was utterly devoted to him. Win over Qin Jiang, and handling Jian Yao would be trivial.

A quiet, competitive hum stirred inside her. With her looks, winning Qin Jiang over was a foregone conclusion.

She was confident.
