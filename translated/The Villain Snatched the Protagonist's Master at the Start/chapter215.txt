From a hidden corner outside the ruined Black Water Serpent territory, Chen Changsheng watched the devastation in grim silence. A chill ran through him.

"Ruthless," he murmured.

He counted himself lucky. After Mo Ling's beating, he'd slipped out of the Black Water Serpent compound. If he'd stayed, he'd have been buried alongside them.

He exhaled slowly, his eyes glinting with cold determination. "The yao race — horned and scaled savages. Useless, the lot of them."

As things stood, countering Qin Jiang within the Demon Domain was virtually impossible. Two of the three great factions were now allied with him. Unless Chen Changsheng could convince the Wolf Race to intervene, he had no cards left to play here. But after his experience with the Black Water Serpent, he was wary of the yao. They were too crude, too violence-prone. They just liked hitting people.

"Am I really reduced to hiding from him?" he muttered, frowning. Passive avoidance would erode his dao heart beyond repair.

No. He couldn't run forever. If he did, his reincarnation in this life would never reach completion.

This tribulation had to be faced head-on.

After a long moment of brooding, he found his answer. "Mo Mo — the demon. That's still the angle. The yao race doesn't care about righteous versus demonic, but the human race's holy lands? There should be righteous cultivators willing to act. If I can convince a holy land to move against Qin Jiang..."

He cast one final glare toward the Purple-Scale Serpent territory, then vanished into the distance. "Qin Jiang, just wait. I will never submit."

Within the Purple-Scale Serpent territory, the Black Serpent Ancestor's body was being put to full use under Qin Jiang's expert hands. He'd set aside a portion of the meat, hoping to make snake stew. Unfortunately, Immortal-level flesh was absurdly difficult to cook—the result was bland and flavorless.

He thought of Lian'er. With her Immortal Fire, she could probably cook it properly. He preserved the remaining meat to bring home. Immortal-level meat was, after all, tremendously nourishing.

But the real prize was the Immortal Path Law.

Poison Dao.

Qin Jiang turned the Poison Dao Law over in his hands. It had already been purified by the system, scrubbed clean of any trace of the Black Serpent Ancestor—like a law born from nature itself. It had cost him a considerable sum of Villain Points.

The question was: who should receive it?

As he deliberated, Liu Shuwan settled in beside him, leaning against him naturally. "What are you thinking about?"

"This," he said, raising his hand. The Poison Dao Law coiled around his fingers like a living thing.

"An Immortal Path Law? From the Black Serpent Ancestor?"

"Mm. Poison Dao. Can't figure out who it suits. It's a bit... dark."

Liu Shuwan's brow creased thoughtfully. Poison Dao was certainly unsavory, and its practitioners were rarely welcomed in polite society. Still, an Immortal Path Law was an Immortal Path Law—people would kill for one.

"What about Ningbing?" she suggested.

"Ningbing?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

Chen Ningbing's talent was near the bottom among his women, but she'd been with him since the early days and was far from weak—currently at the Saint Realm.

"Her talent may not be outstanding," Liu Shuwan said, "but she's the hardest worker of all of us. Her willpower is iron. I believe she can master this."

Liu Shuwan understood Qin Jiang's harem better than he did. She knew each woman's personality inside and out.

"Ningbing, huh..." Qin Jiang hesitated, then looked at Liu Shuwan. "Do you think there's any chance she'd... poison her own husband?"

"Don't be ridiculous." Liu Shuwan rolled her eyes.

He chuckled. He still remembered the early days with Chen Ningbing—she'd been a handful. Her trait of being drawn to strength was fascinating. As long as Qin Jiang stayed dominant, she was the perfect wife. But he'd always wondered whether he'd truly tamed her.

"Let's give it to Ningbing."

With Liu Shuwan's endorsement, he made the call without further hesitation. Even if Chen Ningbing broke through to Immortal, he was confident he could keep her in line. Dominance wasn't just about one thing, after all.

He stored the law and turned to Liu Shuwan. "You need to start preparing for your own breakthrough too."

"Are we heading back?" Her face lit up.

Qin Jiang nodded. This trip to the Demon Domain had accomplished everything he'd set out to do—and then some. The Snake Race and Fox Race had both been thoroughly "cultivated." Of the three great factions, only the Wolf Race remained, and they were a different beast entirely. Better to return to human territory, develop for a while, and come back later.

Yu Lan, as the new Snake Race Empress, couldn't leave. Yu Ru would stay to help her sister. Xue Mei also needed to remain with the Celestial Rabbit Tribe, though Xiao Jiu would travel with Qin Jiang. Hu Xian'er—nominally the White Fox Tribe chief but utterly uninterested in governance—insisted on coming along and demanded Qin Jiang bring the entire White Fox Tribe with him.

Thankfully, the tribe wasn't that large.

In the end, Yu Lan, Yu Ru, and Xue Mei elected to stay in the Demon Domain. Everyone else would return with Qin Jiang.

He spent his final days in the Demon Domain giving the three women extra attention.

"Sure you won't come with me?" Qin Jiang asked, holding Xue Mei in his arms. Her plump, soft body was irresistibly comfortable. Most of the time, he simply liked holding her.

Xue Mei shook her head. "I have to watch over the Celestial Rabbit Tribe. Take Xiao Jiu with you—she'll grow faster at your side. Her ancestral bloodline reversion has incredible potential. Once it fully develops, she'll reach the Immortal path for certain. Take good care of her."

"You make it sound like I'd mistreat her."

"You wouldn't mistreat her. But with so many women around, you might neglect her," Xue Mei huffed.

Elsewhere, Yu Lan was having a similar conversation with Yu Ru.

"You really won't go with Qin Jiang?" Yu Lan asked.

"I want to! But you just became chieftain—without me helping, you'd be exhausted." Yu Ru pouted, then grabbed her sister's hand with a grin. "Once you've got things under control, I'll go find him!"

"Actually..." Yu Lan hesitated. In truth, having Yu Ru around or not didn't make much difference. Her sister's help was minimal at best.

But saying that out loud seemed cruel.

"Fine," Yu Lan said at last. "Stay with me for now. It won't take long before I have the Snake Race well in hand."

The sister might be useless, but her heart was in the right place. No need to crush her spirit.
