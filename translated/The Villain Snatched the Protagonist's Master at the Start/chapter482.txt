The massage continued, and without realizing it, they'd drifted closer and closer. Murong Qing leaned back until she was almost resting against Qin Jiang entirely, eyes closed, a faint smile on her face.

Qin Jiang gazed down at her. Her features bore a striking resemblance to Xue Yue -- perhaps 70 or 80 percent alike. He couldn't help wondering how similar they were elsewhere. He'd have to find out.

After about fifteen minutes, he withdrew his hands to her shoulders. "Feeling better, Auntie Qing'er?"

"You're stopping?" The words slipped out before she could think. She immediately regretted them. Only then did she realize she'd practically been leaning against him, his breath warm on her neck. Her face flushed and she quickly sat up straight.

"Much better," she said, not quite meeting his eyes.

She could still feel the warmth his palms had left on her temples. It really had felt wonderful. And that was just his hands. If it were something else... she didn't dare imagine.

Qin Jiang sat beside her, studying her. "Your color looks better now."

"Thank you. I've been quite tired lately. That helped a lot."

He caught the opening immediately. "So... how is Auntie Qing'er going to thank me?"

She blinked. It had been polite conversation. She hadn't expected him to take it seriously. And Qin Jiang lacked for nothing -- what could she possibly offer?

While she deliberated, he suddenly leaned closer. She startled but didn't pull away. Some part of her was hoping for contact.

He reached out and took her hand.

She squirmed, but weakly. Cheeks pink, she whispered, "Qin Jiang, what are you doing? Don't..."

"Auntie Qing'er." His expression shifted to something sad, almost vulnerable. "The truth is, I've lacked motherly love since I was little. With you, I feel that warmth for the first time. Could you... hold me?"

His eyes shone with longing. It tugged at something in Murong Qing. He'd grown up without a mother's love? Perhaps his childhood hadn't been as charmed as she'd assumed.

Of course, if Li Xueyi could hear this, she'd immediately grab a stick and beat some "maternal love" back into him.

Under his gaze, Murong Qing hesitated only briefly. She withdrew her hand from his, then opened her arms and pulled him into an embrace.

Qin Jiang leaned in gratefully, resting his head against her chest. He nuzzled back and forth, his arms wrapping around her waist, a contented expression on his face.

A little bigger than Xue Yue's.

In her embrace, he squirmed constantly, like a child with too much energy, each movement drawing a small gasp from Murong Qing.

After a while, she managed, "Qin Jiang... is that enough?"

"I've lacked motherly love since I was little..."

"Then I'll hold you a while longer."

She kept him close, but as he continued nuzzling and shifting, her face grew steadily redder. Thank heavens she'd expended so much energy the night before, or she'd be in serious trouble. Even so, she was reaching her limit.

"Auntie Qing'er, did you hold Yueyue like this when she was little?" he asked.

She looked down and shook her head. How could it be the same? Xue Yue had been a tiny baby. Qin Jiang was a fully grown man.

"It's different?" He sounded disappointed. "Could you hold me the way you held baby Yueyue?"

"That's not -- Yueyue was tiny. She sat in my lap. You're--" She tried to picture Qin Jiang perched in her lap. It made more sense the other way around.

"Fair point." He paused. "Then when you fed Yueyue as a baby, how did you do it? Could you show me?"

"...?"

"I've lacked motherly love since I was little..."

She stared, flustered. Breastfeed him? Absolutely not!

But Qin Jiang, with the practiced instincts of a newborn, had already located the source. Through the fabric, he latched on.

Murong Qing's entire body went rigid. She shoved his head away. "Ah! Stop -- Qin Jiang, don't!"

"You know, I've lacked motherly love since--"

"!!!"

That did it. She was now completely certain this whole "motherly love" routine was nothing but an excuse to take advantage of her. No amount of maternal deprivation justified this. And she didn't even have milk.

Fortunately, he didn't press further. After one nip, he let himself be pushed back. Seeing her anger, he put on a wounded expression. "Sorry, Auntie Qing'er. It's just... the absence of maternal affection made me lose control..."

She took a deep, steadying breath. She never wanted to hear the words "motherly love" again.

"So... can I have one more?"

She fixed him with a stare. Shameless. She threw up her hand to block his face. "No!"

"Alright." His voice was thick with regret. Then: "Yueyue told me you used to kiss her all the time when she was little."

"!!!"

"Could Auntie Qing'er kiss me the way you used to kiss Yueyue?"

His eyes were bright with anticipation. By now, Murong Qing was entirely certain. From the very beginning, he'd been teasing her. And she was Xue Yue's mother.

This couldn't happen.
