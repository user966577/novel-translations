The list was ready. Li Qingqiu scanned it and felt a chill run through her. Nearly every name belonged to a top-tier power in Grey Cloud Heaven. Several were True Immortals. And from what Qin Jiang was saying, the targets weren't limited to just these names — anyone connected to them would be uprooted as well.

By the time this was over, Grey Cloud Heaven would drown in blood. Every faction would be reshuffled from the ground up.

Qin Jiang studied the list with an appreciative whistle. Back then, with this many powerhouses hunting her, Mo Mo had still managed to escape Grey Cloud Heaven. The girl had some real tricks up her sleeve.

Mo Mo rubbed her hands together, practically vibrating with anticipation. "Qin Jiang, let's go!"

"Sure."

This was a perfect opportunity to bring the entirety of Grey Cloud Heaven under his control. But first, he needed to appoint a local manager. He certainly wasn't going to oversee an entire heaven himself.

As for Huaxia's existing leadership — their roots were all in Azure Cloud Heaven. Managing a different heaven required at least True Immortal strength to maintain authority. True Immortals were scarce in Huaxia. Qing Chan and Mo Mo were out — they stayed at his side. That left Dao Zhen, but the old man would never relocate. The Human Dao Sect's foundation was in Azure Cloud Heaven, and Huaxia's headquarters hadn't moved. With Dao Zhen's shrewdness, he'd never stray from the center of power.

Qin Jiang's gaze settled on Li Qingqiu. The Li family wasn't a bad option — strong enough, native to the region, and their heir was already by his side. He was confident he could ensure the Li family's loyalty.

Decision made. He smiled at Li Qingqiu. "Qingqiu, you know Grey Cloud Heaven. Lead the way for us."

"Alright." She nodded.

A map accompanied the list, marking every target's location. She studied it briefly. "Several targets are near the Li family. Start with them?"

"Works for me. Near to far."

Mo Mo wasn't picky. Every name on that list belonged to an enemy — none would escape. She could take her time.

With Li Qingqiu guiding them, Qin Jiang's group swept out of the Li compound toward the first target. The Li Family Ancestor followed at a distance, unwilling to let his heir out of sight. Not that it mattered — for all practical purposes, she was already gone.

Within an hour, they reached the first mark — a Human Immortal commanding a modest faction.

"I'll handle this myself. Nobody interfere!" Mo Mo's grin was sharp and eager.

She hovered above the compound, eyes gleaming with bloodlust. With a casual sweep of her hand, demonic qi poured forth in a tidal wave, laced with crimson streaks and the coppery tang of blood. In an instant, the entire faction was engulfed.

Disciples below felt a crushing oppression descend. Panic erupted. Screams echoed through the demonic fog as Mo Mo's demon spirits — savage, bloodthirsty things — fell upon every living creature, tearing flesh, drinking blood. Those killed by the spirits rose again as more of the same: hollow-eyed puppets, shambling and mindless.

Mo Mo watched the carnage with undisguised delight, directing her spirits with practiced ease. If Qin Jiang hadn't forbidden it, she'd have gone down to do the killing herself. She missed the feel of nails parting flesh.

Finally, amid the dying screams, a Human Immortal's aura erupted from below. The faction leader stood amid the demonic fog, expression grim. The energy signature was familiar.

Mo Mo locked onto him immediately, made a grasping motion, and a colossal hand of demonic qi seized him from the air. His eyes went wide. Then he saw her.

"You!"

"You remember me. How flattering." She tilted her head. "Didn't think I'd come back, did you?"

"Demon! You monster — you dare show your face here!"

He thrashed against her hold, power surging, but the gap was too vast.

"True Immortal! You've broken through to True Immortal!"

Mo Mo crushed his meridians with a negligent wave. "Not only did I come back, but everyone who once hunted me is going to pay. Every. Single. One."

"You—" He coughed blood, eyes blazing with grief and fury. "The heavens are blind! How could a demon like you reach True Immortal!"

"So what if I'm a demon? That's my business, not yours."

"Not my business? You slaughtered my wife and daughter! You destroyed my clan! And you dare say it's not my business?"

Mo Mo paused. She scratched her head. "Did I? I've killed so many people — how am I supposed to remember which ones were yours? And even if I'd known in advance, I'd have killed them anyway."

In her early days, she'd done terrible things to grow stronger. Later, when killing no longer provided much benefit, she kept at it out of habit. It was uncomfortable if she went too long without blood on her hands. That had earned her plenty of enemies.

Only after meeting Qin Jiang had her temperament begun to settle. Of course, that required Qin Jiang keeping her... satisfied. Her bloodlust had simply transformed into a different kind of appetite — and with Qin Jiang around, that appetite was never left wanting.

Her victim's rage was incandescent. But rage without power was just a tantrum.

"Since you love your wife and daughter so much, I'll do you a favor today — send you to join them."

Mo Mo made a fist. The demonic hand clenched. Crushing force turned his face purple, choking off any last words, until—

A wet crunch. The Human Immortal burst into a cloud of crimson mist.

"His wife and daughter were probably refined into demon spirits already. Might as well make him one too."

She plucked his remnant soul from the blood mist, and demonic qi consumed it instantly, forging another spirit for her collection.
