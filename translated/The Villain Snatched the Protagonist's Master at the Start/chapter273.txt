Chen Qi'er's face twitched.

Chen Baizhe blushed and tugged Qin Jiang behind her, facing Chen Qi'er head-on. "Qin Jiang is my husband. I won't let you lay a hand on him."

"Hehe. You're the best, sweetheart." Qin Jiang popped his head around her shoulder and planted a kiss on her cheek. Then he looked at Chen Qi'er with open provocation.

'I've got a wife, so I'll hide behind her. What are you going to do about it? Go find your own wife. Oh wait—if you do, I'll steal her too.'

The smugness on Qin Jiang's face made Chen Qi'er's blood simmer. He glared murderously but couldn't do a thing about it. All he could do was shake with impotent rage.

"Baizhe, I'm asking you one last time. You're really going to protect this man?"

His voice was frigid. Chen Baizhe drew a slow breath. Not a moment's hesitation—though her eyes held a trace of complexity as she regarded Chen Qi'er.

"Qin Jiang is my husband."

They stood at an impasse, each feeling the other had become a stranger. When Chen Baizhe's voice came, steady and certain, Chen Qi'er let out a cold laugh. He stared at her, nodding again and again.

"Good. Good. Chen Baizhe—from this day forward, there is nothing between us!"

He turned on his heel and strode away.

Chen Baizhe's fists clenched at her sides. This time, the break was absolute.

Qin Jiang caught her hand and pulled her gently into his arms. She pressed her nose against his chest, looked up at him, and spoke with a note of sadness. "No more lies. Promise me."

"Promise."

He nodded, holding her tight, and pressed a kiss to her forehead. "If you need to cry, it's okay."

She shook her head, nestling closer. "I told you I wouldn't give you any reason to be jealous. If I cried over another man, you'd definitely be jealous."

"Fair point," he conceded.

"But," he continued, a mischievous glint returning, "you don't only cry when you're sad. People cry when they're happy, or overwhelmed, or... well, if things get intense enough, all three of your eyes could water at once."

Three eyes...

Her face turned the color of a ripe peach. She looked up at his teasing grin, mortified. "You're terrible! Pervert!"

She wasn't wrong. One particular eye did tend to well up in Qin Jiang's presence—quite frequently, in fact. And every single time, this scoundrel studied the spectacle with rapt attention. He had no idea how embarrassing it was.

He chuckled, one arm around her waist, the other ruffling her hair. "Let's go back?"

"Mm." She nodded, face still flushed, knowing full well he wanted to see her cry—in the best possible way.

Chen Qi'er was nearly frothing at the mouth.

Between himself and Qin Jiang, Baizhe had chosen Qin Jiang without a flicker of doubt. It made him feel like a clown. Especially that expression on Qin Jiang's face—naked, undisguised mockery. His breathing grew ragged.

Anguish flooded through him. How good had he been to his sister? As children, he'd starved himself to feed her, frozen himself to buy her clothes. Most of the time, she'd still gone hungry and cold alongside him—but at least his intentions had been pure.

Yet now, without a heartbeat's hesitation, she'd cast him aside. His fists tightened, eyes burning with resentment.

'If I'd known it would come to this, back in that temple, I should've just...'

The thought startled him. Such a wicked notion—where had it come from? He shuddered, then couldn't help a bitter laugh. Wicked or not, the boy he'd been back then wouldn't have had the courage. Or the strength. He'd been a beggar whose greatest ambition was a full stomach. When his sister appeared in his life, he'd been content beyond measure. To him, she was a goddess—skinny, dirty, and perfect. He wouldn't have dared defile her.

Now, looking back, he felt only regret. What a perfect opportunity that had been. Wasted.

His sister no longer belonged to him—or perhaps, from the moment she was taken away, she never could.

He looked back. In the distance, Qin Jiang and Baizhe were embracing as they leapt back into the palace. He caught a glimpse of her flushed face, her shy smile. He didn't need to imagine what they'd be doing once they were inside.

His expression contorted.

The jealousy was almost more than he could bear. His breathing turned heavy, his mind cycling through treasured memories of Baizhe—but every vision ended with the same image: Baizhe in Qin Jiang's arms. And then came the darker imaginings, the ones he couldn't control.

Finally, unable to contain himself, he lashed out—a single palm strike that shattered a tree trunk.

The outburst vented some of the pressure. His face smoothed into something calmer, but beneath the surface, a sinister light glimmered in his eyes.

"Chen Baizhe..." His voice was barely a whisper. "If I can't have you... then perhaps I should destroy you."

His original target had been Qin Jiang. But now, the crosshairs had shifted.

Not that it mattered. Given Qin Jiang's nature, the instant Chen Qi'er showed any intent to harm Baizhe, Qin Jiang would annihilate him without a shred of mercy—regardless of how valuable a target he might otherwise be. In Qin Jiang's eyes, no treasure in the world was worth more than his women.

With one last cold glance at the palace, Chen Qi'er turned away.

"Chen Baizhe, I will make you regret today."
