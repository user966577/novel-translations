One was Qin Jiang's recommended candidate, the other was Qin Jiang's father-in-law.

The Ye family elders found themselves thoroughly torn.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang and the Fourth Ancestor were having a moment of their own.

"We're rich! We're rich!"

"Ha ha ha ha! Never imagined these ancient clans had so much wealth. Should've robbed them ages ago."

The two sprawled atop a mountain of treasures, eyes glittering, the very picture of two shameless hoarders.

The Supreme-level experts standing nearby could only watch in speechless exasperation. The mighty Qin family patriarch and young lord, acting like they'd never seen treasure before. Embarrassing!

Good thing there were no outsiders present.

"Fourth Ancestor, how do we split this?"

Qin Jiang grabbed a random pill, checked its effects, then popped it like candy. His Taotie Divine Body could refine any form of energy into pure spiritual power.

The Fourth Ancestor glanced at him:

"Pick out whatever's useful to you. Send the rest back to the Qin family."

Qin Jiang scanned the haul. They were all genuine treasures, but...

None of them were particularly useful to him.

"Forget it. Send everything back to the Qin family."

He waved dismissively. Whether something was a treasure or not didn't matter—the thrill of the heist was what counted.

The targeted ancient clans had lost both their soldiers and their wealth.

They were probably in agony right about now.

Just as the Qin family was wallowing in their riches, Black Dragon rushed in:

"Young Lord, there's been a... situation with Ye Xuan."

His expression was peculiar.

"Ye Xuan..."

Qin Jiang looked up. Now that Ye Qingtian had returned to the Ye family, it was time to deal with Ye Xuan.

"What kind of situation?"

Black Dragon's face twisted with conflict:

"It's...

It's a big problem and a small problem at the same time. Also, it's... a tiny bit perverted."

"Hmm?"

"Ahem, the thing is..."

Black Dragon scratched his face, made a chopping gesture downward with his hand, his whole face scrunching up in pain, and forced the words out:

"Ye Xuan...

Cut it off himself."

"Ugh..."

Watching Black Dragon's pantomime, Qin Jiang's eye twitched:

"Cut what off? What do you mean?"

"His mind seems to have... broken. Says he wants to be a woman, so he..."

Qin Jiang: "..."

The Fourth Ancestor and the others turned to stare at Black Dragon, stunned disbelief etched on every face.

In their nearly ten thousand years of life, this was a first.

"Holy shit!"

After a long silence, Qin Jiang couldn't help himself.

This was an outcome he genuinely hadn't anticipated.

Truly worthy of a Child of Destiny—blazing trails nobody else would dream of!

At the same time, curiosity gnawed at him. What exactly did Ye Xuan look like now?

"Take me to see him."

In this moment, even the treasure pile lost its appeal.

The Fourth Ancestor and company looked equally curious.

"Uh..."

Seeing their faces, Black Dragon gulped:

"You're sure?"

"What's the matter?"

"The changes to Ye Xuan are... significant. I'm afraid the Young Lord won't be able to handle it."

"How bad can it be? Lead the way!"

"Very well."

---

Ye City!

In a secluded courtyard, the group had barely reached the gate when a series of... enthusiastic sounds reached their ears from within.

Qin Jiang's expression turned strange.

The voice had changed somewhat, but he could tell—this was Ye Xuan.

"Young Lord, shall we go straight in? Or shall I have them tidy up first?"

Black Dragon asked considerately.

Listening to the sounds, images he definitely didn't want were forming in Qin Jiang's mind. His stomach lurched. He waved his hand:

"Have them tidy up first."

"Yes, sir."

Black Dragon nodded, took a deep breath—as if steeling himself—and charged through the door like a man heading to his execution.

About fifteen minutes later, one figure after another filed out of the courtyard. All of them were burly, rough-hewn men.

"Young Lord, it's been tidied up."

Black Dragon emerged, face noticeably pale.

Qin Jiang nodded and walked into the courtyard. A pungent smell hit him immediately, making his brow crease.

Black Dragon pointed to one of the rooms:

"Ye Xuan is in that room."

He led Qin Jiang over. Just as he was about to push open the door, Black Dragon gave one more warning:

"Young Lord, brace yourself."

Qin Jiang nodded.

Black Dragon opened the door. Qin Jiang had barely stepped inside when he saw the figure on the bed, and his entire body went rigid.

"You're...

Ye Xuan?"

On the bed reclined a heavily made-up...

Man!

Wearing a translucent gown, posing provocatively...

Upon spotting Qin Jiang, he threw a coquettish wink.

"Oh my, if it isn't Young Lord Qin~"

Ye Xuan giggled, his voice shrill and grating, his gaze burning as it fixed on Qin Jiang.

Every syllable dripped with seduction.

Qin Jiang's face drained of color. His stomach heaved violently, and for the first time, genuine horror flickered in his eyes.

Ye Xuan slid off the bed, hips swaying, and sauntered toward Qin Jiang:

"Stop—stop, stop! Don't move!"

Qin Jiang stumbled backward, shouting.

Ye Xuan paused, a flash of hurt crossing his eyes. Then he stopped and offered a curtsy from several feet away:

"This humble maiden thanks Young Lord Qin. Were it not for your... arrangements, I never would have discovered such a wonderful life."

Qin Jiang: "..."

Ye Xuan raised his head, gazing at Qin Jiang's face:

"I've heard the Young Lord is quite the expert. If the opportunity arises, might you grace me with a private lesson..."

Before he could finish, Qin Jiang's composure shattered completely.

He turned and bolted.

He barely made it to the doorway before dry-heaving overtook him, but he didn't stop for a second, fleeing toward the Ye estate.

Watching Qin Jiang's retreating figure, Ye Xuan blinked, then smiled softly, a wisp of wistfulness in his voice:

"What an interesting man.

What a shame..."

Black Dragon spared Ye Xuan one last glance, ordered guards posted around the courtyard, then chased after Qin Jiang.

He finally found his master outside the Ye estate, braced against a wall, retching violently.

"Young Lord, are you alright?"

Black Dragon hurried over.

Qin Jiang's face was ashen. He dry-heaved once more:

"You... ugh...

Cough cough. Ye Xuan is that twisted and you didn't warn me?!"

Black Dragon looked aggrieved:

"I did warn you..."

Seeing that Qin Jiang had emptied his stomach, he quickly fetched fresh water for him to rinse his mouth.

It was a while before Qin Jiang recovered.

In two lifetimes combined, he'd never been this revolted.

"Young Lord, about Ye Xuan...

What should we do with him? Should we..."

Black Dragon drew a finger across his throat, a ruthless gleam in his eyes. These past few days had been equally traumatic for him.

Qin Jiang took a sip of water and shook his head:

"No!

I've already been scarred. Why should everyone else get off easy?

Release Ye Xuan. Send him back to Ye Qingtian."

'If I have to suffer, nobody else gets to be comfortable!'

Black Dragon's face twitched. He suppressed a laugh and nodded. The Young Lord had a point—trauma was meant to be shared.
