Another two hours later, the city lord heard his wife's voice break into desperate pleas—and then silence. What had been passionate cries softened into muffled whimpers. After another hour or so, the door opened again.

Qin Jiang and the woman emerged, leaning on each other. The city lord had gone numb.

He did notice that her lips looked somehow even fuller and more alluring than before. He didn't dare ask why.

Qin Jiang held her close and smiled down at her. "Tired?"

"Mm~ A little."

"Come back with me, then. My bed is bigger and softer."

"Okay~"

She agreed shyly.

Qin Jiang looked up at the city lord. "I'm taking your wife. Don't worry—I'll take very good care of her. Keep her well nourished."

They brushed past the city lord, who could only force a smile. His mission was accomplished, in a sense. But his heart felt hollow.

He watched them go, expression forlorn. In the end, he sighed and shook his head. This was his own choice—and it was for the best. He'd gained a powerful patron, his wife had found satisfaction, and Qin Jiang was happy. Everyone won.

Except that she was no longer his wife. Or rather, she'd never truly been his wife. Now she'd simply met the right man—and he was the one left behind. But he'd chosen this, for everyone's sake.

While the city lord nursed his heartbreak, Qin Jiang brought the woman—Mu Lan—back to his quarters. The other women were all there.

They barely batted an eye at the new addition. Business as usual.

Mu Lan, however, was stunned by their numbers. Qin Jiang had mentioned having "a few" companions. She hadn't expected anything close to this.

She looked at Qin Jiang, a flicker of doubt in her eyes. With this many, could he really keep up?

She'd only gotten an introductory taste of his abilities—he'd been gentle on account of her inexperience. So she had reason to wonder.

To Qin Jiang, though, that look was a challenge. It practically screamed: Can you handle all of us?

Questioning any man's capability was the ultimate provocation. The city lord excepted, of course. He genuinely could not.

"Sounds like you have doubts," Qin Jiang said, pulling her close.

She trembled and burrowed into his chest, blushing furiously. "No doubts at all. Darling is the best~"

She didn't know his full stamina, but she knew she couldn't last. She'd already begged for mercy earlier. A challenge was the last thing she needed.

"Your eyes say otherwise."

Her face fell. She only had a tiny sliver of doubt!

But she was still recovering. It hurt. She'd bled. She gazed up at him with glistening puppy-dog eyes, the very picture of fragile innocence—calculated to melt hearts.

A drama queen, this one. Qin Jiang loved drama queens. Perfect for roleplay. And the role that suited her best was the devoted wife—since she actually had a useless husband.

Still, she was genuinely wounded, so he'd let it slide. In a couple of days, once she'd healed, he'd show her his true capabilities.

"Knock off the act." He pinched her nose with a grin. "I'll let you off today. But I'm keeping a tally. Sooner or later, you'll see what I'm really made of."

"Hehe, okay~"

Her woeful expression vanished instantly, replaced by a mischievous grin. She threw her arms around his neck. "I can't wait to experience the real thing~"

"Oh? Right now?"

"No~" She pouted. "Let me heal first~"

"Heh. Fine. Day after tomorrow, we'll do a proper group training session. That'll show you what real stamina looks like."

"Group training?"

She blinked, not understanding. Qin Jiang grinned and gestured at the assembled women. "Training means everyone. Together."

"Together?" Her mouth fell open. "All of them?"

"Every one."

Mu Lan's face turned beet red. That many people at once—she couldn't even imagine it.

The women gathered closer, eyes lighting up.

"Training again?"

"I didn't perform well last time. This time, I absolutely won't hold the team back!"

"You? Please. We need Xihe, Zifu, and Yingtao to carry."

"I'm strong too! I can go eight hundred rounds with Qin Jiang—verbal and physical!"

"Pfft. As long as I'm seductive enough, I can weaken him for sure!"

"That just makes him stronger!"

The debate raged on. Every training session was a chance to defeat Qin Jiang, and they were all determined.

After a spirited discussion, they turned to Qin Jiang, eyes shining. "When's training?"

"Day after tomorrow," he said, glancing at Mu Lan. She was wounded—deeply—and needed time to recover. With some therapeutic massage, he estimated she'd be fully healed by then. Her first group session should be at full strength for maximum participation.

Surrounded by eager faces, Mu Lan stayed quiet, cheeks burning.

Qin Jiang pinched her cheek. "I'll give you a massage before training. Should speed up the healing—we want you at your best."

"Okay~"
