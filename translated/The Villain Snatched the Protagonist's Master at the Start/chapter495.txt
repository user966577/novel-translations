Under Qin Jiang's influence, Wu Yingtao's suspicions about Wu Tian deepened. She was determined to find an opportunity to confirm, using the method Qin Jiang had described. Check the primordial spirit. If Wu Tian refused, he was definitely hiding something.

"Don't worry about it now. When the chance comes, I'll take you to find out." He ruffled her hair, then stood, scooping her up in his arms.

With a yelp, she found herself tossed onto the bed.

He couldn't let her dwell on it. Too much thinking, and she might see through the manipulation. While Wu Yingtao was currently in a suggestible state, there was no guarantee she wouldn't have a sudden flash of clarity. Better to scramble her thoughts.

The simplest method? An intense workout.

"Now then -- let's get down to business." He smiled.

Wu Yingtao's face turned crimson, and she snatched the blanket, wrapping herself in it. All thoughts of Wu Tian vanished instantly.

She looked at Qin Jiang, shyness in her eyes but no real resistance.

He sat beside her and leaned in. She tensed. "What are you doing?"

"You!"

"Huh?" She blinked, then raised her hands against his chest. "No..."

"Your mouth says no, but the rest of you disagrees." He tapped her lips with a teasing grin. "You say you don't want it, but you're drooling."

"I'm not--" She clapped a hand over her mouth, mortified. But her strength was no match for his. He pried her hand away effortlessly, pinning her in place.

She couldn't even squirm.

After one last glance at him, she closed her eyes and surrendered.

He got to work -- but he didn't go all the way. Just enough to tease, then he pulled back. His goal was to scramble Wu Yingtao's thoughts, not satisfy her. Keeping her wanting would ensure she thought of nothing else.

Two hours of this, and Wu Yingtao was thoroughly undone.

Then Qin Jiang stopped.

She opened her eyes, confused.

He smiled, pinched her cheek, and said, "Since you don't want to, I won't force you."

"???"

What? Forced her halfway and then suddenly developed a conscience?

She stared at him, desire swimming in her eyes.

But Qin Jiang acted as though he didn't notice. He straightened his clothes, leaned down to kiss her forehead, and said, "Get some rest. I've got things to do."

He stood and walked out without looking back.

She watched the door close, still in a daze. It was a long time before she came back to herself. Her fists clenched the sheets, teeth biting her lip, eyes brimming with frustration.

"Jerk!"

She slapped the bed. She took deep breaths, trying to quell the fire inside her. But his scent still clung to everything around her.

"Jerk, jerk, jerk!"

Who does that? Pushes you to the edge and then just walks out? Leaves you alone, burning with need?

She clutched the blanket -- still carrying his scent -- and closed her eyes. His image filled her mind, and her face flushed deeper.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang didn't linger after leaving. He did have things to attend to. As for Wu Yingtao, she wouldn't be thinking about anything else for a while. Of that, he was certain.

After all, during his teasing, he'd also slipped her a tiny dose of something... truly just a tiny dose. Any more and she wouldn't have been able to handle it.

This was only safe because they were aboard the airship. Out in the open, this kind of situation was exactly how fortune heroines ended up in the arms of Children of Destiny. But on the airship, there was nothing to worry about. Without Qin Jiang's permission, no one could get in -- and Wu Yingtao couldn't get out.

He glanced back, then stepped off the airship.

The faction leaders were still waiting. The moment he appeared, they rushed forward and bowed. "Greetings, Manor Lord Qin."

"Find a place where we can talk."

They led him to a premium establishment -- a high-end pleasure house.

"Manor Lord Qin, do you find this venue satisfactory?"

He glanced around. Alluring women in revealing outfits danced gracefully. The quality was a bit lacking, though.

"It'll do."

His own 360 songstresses could dance circles around these women. Once you'd had the best, everything else fell flat.

The faction leaders' smiles stiffened. They'd chosen this place specifically to put him in a good mood during negotiations. Clearly, it wasn't working.

He took the seat of honor and waved them down. "Sit. Don't be so formal."

They sat ramrod-straight.

He grabbed a spirit fruit and ate while talking. "The thirteen women I selected -- they came from your various factions, correct?"

Twelve factions were represented. He'd picked thirteen women -- the cream of each faction's offering. The Wu family had contributed two; everyone else, one. They nodded.

"Then we're practically family now." He smiled. "And since we're family, we should support each other. Your factions seem a bit weak. How about this -- I'll lend a hand. You all submit to Huaxia and become subordinate factions. What do you say?"
