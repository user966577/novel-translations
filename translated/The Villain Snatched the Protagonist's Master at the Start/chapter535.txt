First, Qin Jiang returned to Huaxia Academy and tracked down Ye Xuan.

Her eyes lit up the moment she saw him. "Young Master Qin, you've come~" She gave a graceful bow.

Qin Jiang waved it off. "No need for formalities."

Looking at Ye Xuan, he had to marvel. If he hadn't witnessed the transformation himself, he'd never believe she had once been a man. There wasn't a single masculine trait left.

She straightened and gestured toward the courtyard. "Please, come in."

Inside, Qin Jiang settled into a stone chair while Ye Xuan brewed tea. She stood to the side, quietly watching him. When the tea was ready, she poured a cup and set it before him. "You're here about Li Yang, aren't you?"

He nodded, took a sip, and said, "Your assignment is over. You've done well. I'll have the academy arrange a reward."

"Serving Young Master Qin is reward enough." Her gaze hadn't left him since he'd arrived. Qin Jiang understood her feelings perfectly well—he simply couldn't accept them. He changed the subject. "Call Li Yang over."

"Of course~"

She sent a message via communication stone. Less than fifteen minutes later, hurried footsteps approached. A knock at the gate was followed by Li Yang's voice, brimming with excitement. "Xuan'er, I'm here~"

It was the first time Ye Xuan had ever initiated contact. He'd raced over immediately—maybe something special was about to happen.

On the way, he'd even picked a flower as a small gift. After knocking, he struck what he imagined was a dashing pose—one foot forward, head tilted down, one hand on the gate frame and the other holding the flower over his chest. The moment Ye Xuan opened the door, she'd see it immediately.

Except Ye Xuan, who rarely got this close to Qin Jiang, wasn't about to waste the opportunity on a door. She flicked her wrist, and the gate swung open on its own.

Li Yang, leaning against it, stumbled forward and nearly faceplanted. He caught himself, quickly smoothed back his hair, and thrust the flower forward with soulful eyes aimed squarely at Ye Xuan.

Then his expression froze. He saw Qin Jiang—the man who'd stolen his first love.

Was he here to steal Xuan'er too? No!!!

Li Yang inhaled deeply, steadied himself, and bowed. "Greetings, Lord Manor Lord."

"Heh." Qin Jiang gave a light chuckle, then glanced at Ye Xuan and jerked his chin toward Li Yang. "Tell him the truth."

"Yes."

Ye Xuan's gaze turned frigid as she fixed Li Yang with a look that made his blood run cold. Truth? What truth?

"Don't call me 'Xuan'er.' You don't deserve to," she said flatly.

Li Yang recoiled, eyes going wide. This wasn't his gentle, caring Xuan'er. Something was wrong—she must be protecting him. Qin Jiang had obviously threatened her!

He looked at Qin Jiang, certain he understood everything now. His heart swelled with emotion. Even under threat, she was trying to shield him. He couldn't make things harder for her. He clenched his fists and said nothing.

Watching this display, Qin Jiang could only shake his head. Ye Xuan really had done a number on this Child of Destiny—she'd shaped him into a thoroughly obedient tool.

Ye Xuan's voice remained ice-cold. "From the very beginning, everything between us was on Young Master Qin's orders."

"What?" Li Yang's head snapped up in disbelief.

"Impossible!" He shook his head frantically, refusing to believe it. He stared at her. "Xuan'er, you're lying. You must be. Aren't you?"

"Lying?" She sneered. "Don't you have any self-awareness? If not for Young Master Qin's orders, the sight of you would make me sick. Why would I ever willingly associate with someone like you?"

The words struck Li Yang like a physical blow. After Li Qingqiu, Ye Xuan had become his whole world. From the very start—helping him, speaking up for him, protecting him—she had been everything.

For someone who'd never known warmth, her kindness had fostered an overwhelming dependence. And now he was being told it was all fake? That another man had ordered it?

His heart shattered in an instant. He looked at Ye Xuan, lips trembling. "Xuan'er..."

"I told you not to call me that!" She slapped him across the face from a distance, knocking him to the ground. Then, coldly, she continued laying out the truth.

One revelation after another—every sweet memory he'd cherished was stripped bare, its ugliness exposed. He'd been nothing but a dog on a leash.

Under her contemptuous gaze, Li Yang slowly came back to himself. Looking back, he'd spent years in a daze, orbiting Ye Xuan like a satellite, making her his entire universe.

He laughed bitterly. All fake. Every last bit of it.

Struggling to his feet, he looked at her, voice thick with anguish. "Fine. From this moment on, we have no connection whatsoever."

He turned to leave, but Ye Xuan sealed the gate with a wave of her hand and appeared before him in a flash. "I'm not finished."

"What's left to say? It was all lies."

She chuckled, licked her lips, and tilted his chin up with one finger. Despite knowing the truth, Li Yang's heart still skipped a beat. He lost focus for just a second.

Ye Xuan's smile widened. She leaned in close and whispered, "I'll let you in on one more secret. Actually... I used to be a man."
