"Intimate contact?"

Yu Lan's face went blank. She hadn't expected the "cost" to be... this.

She stared at Qin Jiang, expression shifting between doubt and turmoil. For a moment, she suspected he was merely coveting her beauty.

Her brow knotted. Her fingers curled tight. After an agonizing internal battle, she asked in a small voice, "How intimate, exactly?"

Her royal bloodline was the hope of their entire faction. If it could be restored, she was willing to make sacrifices—within reason.

"Your poison has progressed too far. So I'm afraid it would need to go... all the way. You understand what I mean, right? Essentially, it's..."

Whatever fragile hope remained in Yu Lan's eyes shattered. Her face froze.

Absolutely not.

Her gaze flickered, teeth pressing into her lower lip. The doubt in her eyes intensified as she scrutinized Qin Jiang.

He met her stare with a face of flawless integrity.

'I'm absolutely lying through my teeth,' he thought, 'but I feel no guilt whatsoever—because I'm shameless, and I have no conscience.'

So Qin Jiang's expression didn't so much as flicker. He radiated righteous composure.

And somehow, that composure convinced Yu Lan. She withdrew her gaze, eyes downcast. Outwardly calm, her hands had been squeezed white.

"Can we... go a step less?"

The question came out barely above a whisper. Her face was crimson. Even one step short wouldn't change much in reality—it was merely a psychological comfort. As long as it didn't reach the final act, she could tell herself her virtue was intact.

But in truth...

Qin Jiang sighed, looking at her. "I won't deny that your beauty moves me. But the method I described really is the only way I can cure your poison."

His apparent candor eased some of her tension. She nodded slowly. "I understand my own situation. That you have any method at all is already beyond my expectations."

"Look—I don't like taking advantage of people in distress. So, like you said, I'll try to keep things... a step short. But if there's truly no alternative..."

He held her gaze with perfect sincerity.

Yu Lan understood. He would try his best, but if the moment demanded it, there'd be no holding back.

What she didn't know was that when that moment came, whether it was "truly necessary" would be entirely Qin Jiang's call.

She took a steadying breath and made her decision. She looked at him and nodded.

"All right."

The instant she agreed, Qin Jiang's eyes glinted. He leaned closer. "So... shall we start now?"

Yu Lan's cheeks flushed. It was still broad daylight—not that it mattered at their cultivation level, since darkness and light made no difference to their sight.

But something like this... felt better done at night.

"Could we... wait until tonight?"

Her voice was soft, almost pleading—nothing like the ice queen from before.

Qin Jiang didn't push. He nodded. She did need rest; her body was in no condition for anything strenuous right now. After a day's recovery, she'd have more stamina. And that meant things could last longer.

Night draped itself over the formation.

The room was pitch dark. The only sound was the soft rhythm of breathing.

Qin Jiang pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The treatment began.
