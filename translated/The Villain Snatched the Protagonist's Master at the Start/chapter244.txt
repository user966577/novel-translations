Originally, Qing Chan had lived alone in this sea of flowers. But since Qin Jiang's arrival, over a dozen cottages had been added.

Qin Jiang carried Ning Xue'er into one of the rooms, her cheeks faintly pink. She'd already realized that what was supporting her included more than just his hands.

He kicked the door shut, set her down, and her legs immediately buckled. He caught her at once. "How are your legs still weak?" His eyes carried a teasing glint.

Ning Xue'er tilted her head away, unable to meet his gaze. "They're... numb," she mumbled shyly.

"Oh?" He guided her to the edge of the bed and knelt down. "Let me rub them for you."

"N-no, that's okay—"

She felt strange right now. She couldn't keep letting him touch her like this, or she really wouldn't be able to hold back. She tried to grab his hand, but had no strength behind it. Instead, he took hers and placed it on her leg, then set to work.

Ning Xue'er's body trembled. The numbness was real now, spreading from her legs through her entire body. She tensed, every muscle taut. If this continued much longer, she truly couldn't restrain herself.

"Y-you should change your clothes first," she managed, her voice quavering. Each word seemed to ease the pressure slightly.

Before Qin Jiang could respond, she suddenly let out a long, shuddering exhale. He happened to look up at that exact moment—then jerked his head aside. He glanced down, his expression twitching, and looked back at her. "Were you... trying to give me a facial?"

"I— I wasn't—"

Ning Xue'er clapped both hands over her face, her ears blazing crimson, her body going limp. Even she was stunned. She'd never imagined she could do that. Absolutely mortifying.

Qin Jiang studied her with a meaningful look. That sort of capability wasn't something just any woman possessed—it was highly dependent on constitution. And in his expert opinion, this was an exceptional constitution indeed.

Still, he was curious. Through her clothes, how did she manage to—unless...

His expression shifted as realization dawned. This woman was more daring than he'd thought. Going commando?

"Are you going to change or not?" Ning Xue'er pressed, desperate to change the subject.

He stood with a smile, looking her up and down. "Your clothes seem dirty too. Why don't we change together?"

"I'm fine—"

"Let me help."

He went hands-on without hesitation. Ning Xue'er yelped and tried to resist, but with her cultivation sealed and her body still weak from moments ago, she had nothing left. Before long, she was curled in on herself, arms wrapped tight around her body, eyes glistening as she glared at him. "You're the worst!"

She could have died of embarrassment. Her little secret—discovered.

Qin Jiang's expression was peculiar. He couldn't help but ask: "Have you always been like this?"

"I... no, it's only been the last few days," she whispered.

His eyebrow rose. The last few days? The days she'd spent with him?

"So you'd already prepared yourself to give it all up?"

He leaned in and pulled her into his arms, grinning. Ning Xue'er trembled, face burning, and murmured: "It was... for your convenience."

"Hm?"

Qin Jiang sucked in a breath.

Ning Xue'er shot him a resentful look. She'd been ready for days, and this man had done nothing but scratch the surface. She'd practically thrown herself at him and gotten zero response.

The more she thought about it, the more aggrieved she felt, staring at his face mere inches from hers. She'd already lost every last shred of dignity in front of him. So why not just pin him down and be done with it?

Her eyes flashed. While he was still processing, she lunged, wrapped her arms around him, and toppled him onto the bed. Then she climbed on top and pinned him firmly beneath her.

Qin Jiang: "..."

'Again? Do all Azure Lotus Divine Palace women insist on being on top? Qing Chan pinned me down, and now you're doing it too?'

Still, with her cultivation sealed, even if she was an Immortal, she couldn't actually overpower him. His lips curved as he prepared to reassert control—but then Ning Xue'er pressed herself against him, and her soft lips found his.

The strength he'd been gathering evaporated. His arms came up to hold her. Under her clumsy, earnest kiss, Qin Jiang surrendered completely.

'Honestly, letting someone else take charge once in a while isn't so bad.'

He guided her subtly, and after a long while, she raised her head and gazed down at him, dazed. He blinked, gave her hip a light pat, and said: "Keep going."

"Huh?"

Ning Xue'er fidgeted, embarrassed. "What do I do next?"

"You don't know?"

"It's my first time, okay?" She pouted. Though just the kissing alone had already felt wonderful.

Qin Jiang gave her a look, delivered another pat, and said flatly: "You don't know what you're doing and you pinned me down anyway?"

"Whose fault is it for never making a move?" she shot back.

She started to climb off, figuring she'd let him take the lead. But Qin Jiang kept his arms around her waist, holding her in place. She looked at him, confused.

"I'll guide you," he said with a smile.

Color flooded her face, but her eyes lit up with a spark of excitement. She nodded. "Okay."

"First, relax."

"Mm."

"Don't tense up—it'll hurt more if you do. Relax... that's it..."

He coached her patiently, occasionally taking her hand and pressing his lips to it, helping her ease into it gradually. He simply watched, letting her learn at her own pace.

Finally—

Ning Xue'er's brow furrowed tight. Her body went rigid, lips parting in a silent gasp, fingers digging into his shoulders. After a long moment, she lowered herself against him. A new warmth smoldered in her eyes as she kissed his lips. "Like this?"

"Not bad."

He murmured encouragement and continued guiding her.

Hours later, Ning Xue'er lay draped across Qin Jiang's chest, spent and flushed. He kissed her cheek and smiled. "Rest for a bit. I'll have Qing Chan unseal your cultivation later."

"Unseal my cultivation?" Her eyes lit up instantly. She struggled upright. "No need to rest—have her do it now!"

"..." He paused, then said with some exasperation: "Shouldn't you clean up first?"

"Oh..." She looked down at herself, cheeks reddening again. She nodded. "I'll go wash up."

"Wait—I'll come too. We can go together."

"Pervert."
