Hearing his words, Yue Weiwei trembled. She looked at him, teeth pressing into her lower lip, understanding his meaning perfectly.

"As long as you don't involve my master... I'll do anything."

"Is that so."

Qin Jiang smiled, leaned close, and spoke softly. "Then perhaps you should show a little sincerity."

She flushed, staring at the handsome face inches from hers. Summoning her courage, she rose on tiptoe and placed her lips against his — then pulled away almost immediately. That brief contact alone sent her heart hammering as if it might burst from her chest. Her cheeks blazed scarlet.

She looked at him in a daze. Her first kiss, just like that. It had been soft. Nice. But the contact had been too brief. She should have lingered longer.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow and gave her a dismissive look. "That's it?"

Her heart clenched. Was he unsatisfied with her?

He shook his head. "Do you even know how to kiss? You just pecked and ran — like I forced you."

She wasn't being forced... was she? Probably not. Maybe. Probably not.

Her small hands twisted together. "It was my first time... I don't know how," she said, sounding slightly aggrieved.

Before she could finish, he wrapped an arm around her waist and pulled her into his embrace. "Don't know how? I'll teach you."

He lowered his head and kissed her. She stiffened, then felt the heat of him — her eyes widened briefly before her arms circled his neck of their own accord and her eyes fluttered shut. Under his guidance, she finally understood what a real kiss was supposed to feel like.

When he finally lifted his head, she was limp in his arms — dazed, breathless, lips slightly parted.

It took her a moment to come back to herself, her eyes soft with shyness.

He tilted her chin up. "Did you learn?"

"Mm..." She nodded. Still unpolished, but she understood the mechanics now.

She looked up at his lips, a trace of hope in her expression. Shouldn't he let her demonstrate?

But he just watched her, saying nothing — as if doubting whether she'd truly absorbed the lesson.

After a beat, she bit her lip and spoke up. "I... I can show you."

"Please do."

Her face flaming, she hooked her arms around his neck, rose on tiptoe, and kissed him properly this time — even pushing sweetness into his mouth of her own initiative. It was clumsy, but real. She was learning.

When they separated, she was panting softly. "Did I pass?"

"Barely."

He nodded, then added: "But just kissing isn't nearly enough."

"I can do anything..." Her voice dropped to a murmur. At the same time, she told herself firmly — this was all to protect her master. Not because she wanted it.

As for her junior brother, he'd been completely forgotten.

Qin Jiang leaned to her ear and whispered, "Then... shall we move on to something else?"

"Mm." She nodded, then pointed to a room in the courtyard. "Can we go inside?"

"Of course."

He scooped her up and carried her to the room. It was sparsely furnished — she'd been brought here as a captive, after all, and hadn't bothered decorating. He set her on the bed and joined her.

Brushing a strand of hair from her forehead, he asked, "What would you like to learn?"

"Anything."

"Have you heard of the 'three connections'?"

"Three connections?" She nodded, puzzled. That was a plumbing term — something mortals dealt with.

"Today, you'll learn a different kind of three connections." He grinned, tapping a finger lightly against her lips.

She was still confused. Then he began the lesson, and she understood. Oh. That kind of three connections. Though it was embarrassing, she applied herself diligently.

It took an entire day before she'd grasped the basics. She was thoroughly exhausted.

Yue Weiwei curled up in Qin Jiang's arms, eyes half-closed, unwilling to move. But the feeling — she liked it very much.

He pinched her cheek. When she opened her eyes, he teased: "You seemed to enjoy the learning process quite a bit."

"I did not." She looked away, face still flushed, though significantly more relaxed than before. She pouted and protested: "I only did it to protect my master."

"Oh? Is that right?"

He tightened his hold slightly. "Well, your efforts so far have been enough to earn your master's life."

"Huh? That's enough?" She blinked. Already? But they'd barely gotten started. How could it be enough? Was her master's life worth so little?

Her hand pressed against his chest, fingers curling into the fabric. He wasn't going to send her away, was he?

"However — you haven't paid the price for your own life yet."

She blinked again. Her own life needed saving too? That meant at least one more round. And wait — she still had a junior brother to save. And the people in the anti-Huaxia alliance. If she could save them too...

All those people. She had the ability to save them. If she didn't, the guilt would eat at her.

They all needed saving.

She looked at him, slightly abashed. "Can I save other people too?"

"Who do you want to save?"

"My junior brother, and the people in the anti-Huaxia alliance. They're all my friends. If I don't try to save them, my conscience won't let me rest. So... can I?"

"All your friends?"

"Mm."

"Fine. Write me a list. Let's see how many people need saving."

Yue Weiwei froze. She didn't personally know even ten people in the entire alliance. How was she supposed to write a list?

Maybe she could... fudge it a little?

A sly gleam entered her eyes. He'd asked her to write a list, which meant he probably didn't know how many people were in the alliance. She could put down whatever she wanted — save as many as she felt like. When the time came...

She glanced at Qin Jiang, face pinkening with a touch of guilt. "Okay. I'll write the list."
