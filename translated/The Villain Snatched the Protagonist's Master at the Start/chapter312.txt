Boom!

The ground heaved violently. All five True Immortals were swallowed by the formation's devastating power.

When the shockwave finally dissipated, Qin Jiang swept his arm and cleared the dust. In a massive crater, the five True Immortals lay motionless. Three had been knocked unconscious outright. The two who remained awake convulsed on the ground, too broken to even stand.

Qin Jiang didn't bother with another strike. Instead, he produced the Myriad Dao Stone and tossed it in front of them. Its power surged.

A scream tore from one True Immortal's throat. His eyes flew open, face contorted in agony. His entire body shuddered uncontrollably as the Myriad Dao Stone wrenched his law from his body. As the law drained away, so did his life force, growing weaker with every passing moment.

It took a full fifteen minutes before the extraction was complete. The True Immortal's crimson eyes stared wide, blazing with impotent fury — but there was no life behind them anymore. Only the residue of bitter defiance.

The first True Immortal had fallen.

The screams jolted the other four awake. They felt the same deathly chill and thrashed desperately, but their battered bodies could barely twitch, let alone resist. Qin Jiang repeated the process four more times, stripping each True Immortal of their law. Even their final, desperate counterattacks were effortlessly suppressed.

They were already too broken. The time for fighting back had passed.

All five True Immortals — dead. Qin Jiang exhaled a long breath.

The battle was decided.

He turned toward the other battlefield and flickered over. Rather than jumping straight into the fight, he first gathered the corpses scattered nearby and extracted their laws before storing the bodies away.

Qing Chan appeared before him. "You don't need to step in. We can handle the rest. It's good combat experience for the girls."

Life-or-death battles at the Human Immortal level were rare opportunities. Might as well make the most of them.

Qin Jiang nodded, though he didn't particularly care for this kind of training. He preferred overwhelming advantages — an Immortal King stomping True Immortals, a Human Immortal crushing Great Emperors, and if the realms were equal, then two-on-one, three-on-one. Fights like Mo Mo's and Ning Xue'er's, where they were outnumbered, weren't his style. Too easy to get hurt. Too much risk.

The formation still held more than half its charge. Qin Jiang kept his eyes on the battlefield. Though he didn't intervene, he was ready at every moment. With this kind of advantage, how could he let his women get injured? The instant any of them showed the slightest disadvantage, he'd flatten the threat.

But his women were more than capable, especially with Qing Chan watching over them. He never needed to act. He simply stood at the edge of the battlefield, collecting the corpses of every enemy his women killed, tidying up the field, and blocking escape routes.

The enemy had brought eighteen Human Immortals. After the five True Immortals fell, those eighteen had already lost hope. Some even tried to surrender, but every plea was rejected. You came to kill my women, and now you want to live? Dream on.

Three full days of fighting later, all eighteen Human Immortals were dead.

Combined with the five True Immortals, this battle had yielded twenty-three immortal-path laws.

Qin Jiang tallied the haul with a gleeful grin, then swept his gaze across the surroundings. Beyond the Chaos District's borders, a number of Human Immortals lingered, watching from a distance. They'd observed the entire battle.

When they noticed Qin Jiang looking their way, every one of them shuddered. Nobody dared treat him as a mere Great Emperor anymore. This man had slaughtered five True Immortals.

A moment of silence hung over heaven and earth. Then, one by one, the Human Immortals revealed themselves at the Chaos District's edge and bowed respectfully to Qin Jiang. Without a word, they withdrew.

He let them go. He was building a faction, and he needed a foundation. These Human Immortals would become the first pillars of his organization. Didn't agree? The True Spirit Slave Seal would handle that.

He turned to his women, his expression softening. "Tired?"

"Not really." They shook their heads. If anything, sparring with Qin Jiang was more exhausting than actual combat.

Qin Jiang smiled. "The threats are dealt with. Let's head back and rest."

"Okay~"

The women followed him back. Dao Zhen, An Xihe's five subordinates, and the Chaos Sect's forces exchanged glances and dispersed as well.

Back at the estate, the women weren't particularly fatigued, but their reserves were depleted. With An Xihe's breakthrough still pending, they couldn't afford any surprises. They immediately entered cultivation to recover.

Qin Jiang visited the seal. Inside, An Xihe remained undisturbed. Her aura was stable and steadily climbing. He breathed a sigh of relief, then produced a wealth of resources, shifted into his Taotie form, and recharged the Immortal King Killing Formation. No letting their guard down until the breakthrough was complete.

A month passed in the blink of an eye. Azure Cloud Heaven was eerily quiet. The Chaos District had become a de facto forbidden zone — nobody dared set foot inside.

The formation was fully charged. The women had long since recovered to peak condition. And with Qin Jiang's... attentive care, the frustrations from the interrupted battle had been thoroughly vented. Morale was high.

One day, Qing Chan sat on Qin Jiang's lap, idly lifting his shirt to trace her fingers along his sculpted abs, giving them an occasional squeeze. After a while, she looked up at him. "You still haven't fulfilled your promise to me."

"Huh?" Qin Jiang blinked. "What promise?"

Qing Chan's lips pouted. She swatted his chest and huffed. "You forgot? You promised to win over those girls and then punish them in front of me."

"..."

"You've only gotten Xue'er so far, and I helped with that. There are still four more in our palace. When are you making your move?"

Back then, the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's senior members had eavesdropped on Qing Chan being "disciplined" by Qin Jiang — and overheard his embarrassing secrets in the process. At the time, he and Qing Chan had agreed: those women had to be punished. The plan had been Qing Chan's idea, and Qin Jiang hadn't dared refuse. With Qing Chan's help, he'd already handled one of them.

As for the other four — they'd been living alongside his women for some time now, fully integrated into the household. But Qin Jiang genuinely hadn't gotten around to them yet.

"Ahem. I've been busy with Xihe's breakthrough. Once she's through, I'll make my move."

Qing Chan nodded. "Don't forget — after you get them, bring them to me for punishment."

"No problem." Qin Jiang thumped his chest confidently. And when the time came, he'd punish Qing Chan a little too, for good measure.
