Wu Yingtao was now utterly convinced that Wu Tian had been possessed. She wanted him dead -- vengeance for her brother.

But she didn't know the imposter's true strength, and she worried about putting Qin Jiang in danger.

Qin Jiang sighed inwardly and said, "Let's not act rashly. If your brother really was possessed, the person inside him is likely no ordinary being."

"I know."

Wu Tian had called himself "this Emperor," but he definitely wasn't a Great Emperor -- a Great Emperor's soul couldn't have infiltrated the Wu family undetected, let alone possessed someone without raising alarm. And if Qin Jiang couldn't see through him at his level, then the imposter was something higher.

Not a Great Emperor, yet called himself Emperor. That likely meant Immortal Emperor -- someone from the Heavenly Domain.

Wu Yingtao's sharp little mind pieced it together quickly.

"Let's go back." If the imposter truly came from the Heavenly Domain, she didn't want to risk a confrontation here.

Qin Jiang looked at Wu Tian. "We could probe him. He doesn't know he's been exposed."

"No need." She shook her head. "I know he's not my brother. That's enough."

She took his hand.

He nodded. "Alright. I'll have people investigate quietly. Once we're sure, I'll avenge your brother. I promise."

"Thank you." Gratitude shone in her eyes as she leaned against him.

He held her, glanced back at Wu Tian with a faint smirk, and they slipped away.

This trip had accomplished its purpose. Wu Yingtao was now convinced her brother had been possessed. The sibling bond was severed -- at least on her end. And Wu Tian couldn't explain his way out of it. Reincarnation wasn't technically possession, but functionally, it was close enough. The original Wu Tian was effectively dead.

According to the spoilers, Wu Yingtao's Ancient God bloodline would have been a major asset for Wu Tian. But now that asset belonged to Qin Jiang.

The system rewards from this maneuver were substantial -- including a treasure that could purify Ancient God bloodline. Not that he needed help winning Wu Yingtao over. He was confident in his own abilities.

Back aboard the airship, he brought her straight to her room. Her spirits were low, and he needed to comfort her.

As for how... her flushed face on the walk back had already given him his answer.

They'd made a deal: once they returned, he'd satisfy her. And Qin Jiang was a man of his word.

Wu Yingtao's desire had been suppressed while confronting the truth about Wu Tian, but now, pressed against Qin Jiang's chest, the flood came roaring back. Especially once they were in the room -- Wu Tian vanished from her mind entirely, replaced by days of pent-up frustration.

She sat in his lap, arms around his neck, cheek against his chest. "Qin Jiang, I feel awful..."

She looked up, lip caught between her teeth, eyes smoldering.

He tilted her face up and kissed her. "Where does it hurt? Let me have a look."

"Mm... okay." She took his hand and placed it. "Here."

"Ah." He examined briefly. "I can treat that. Shall I?"

"Yes."

"Given your condition, we can skip the prep work and start right away."

"Okay."

"Here we go."

"Mm."

She could barely contain herself. She'd waited so long for this treatment.

Sensing his patient's urgency, Doctor Qin wasted no time.

Her condition was serious. The buildup had been going on for days, and she'd been mildly poisoned on top of it. Fortunately, Doctor Qin's skills were second to none. Otherwise, this case would have been quite tricky.

"Yingtao, the initial treatment might sting a little. Bear with it."

"I'm not afraid."

"Good. I'll make it as painless as possible."

Treatment commenced, and Wu Yingtao proved a cooperative patient.

The process was lengthy -- days of accumulated symptoms couldn't be resolved in a single session. Doctor Qin deployed his space-time power.

Ten full days.

Only then did Wu Yingtao's condition improve. Even Doctor Qin was impressed -- he hadn't expected her case to be this severe.

"The Ancient God bloodline is no joke," he muttered.

His expression turned thoughtful. Wu Yingtao was his patient, but in certain respects, she was also his opponent. Her constitution, empowered by the Ancient God bloodline, was genuinely formidable. Among all his women, Wu Yingtao now ranked near the very top -- and her cultivation level was still low, her bloodline thin. If she continued to grow, she'd become one of his most challenging rivals.

"Husband..." She crawled back to him, draping herself across his chest. She kissed his cheek. "Husband, I want more..."

"Bring it!"

He took a deep breath. This was only their first time, and he couldn't let her get too cocky. Earlier, he'd been holding back for fear of hurting her. But having felt her constitution, he was confident.

Full power. She could take it.
