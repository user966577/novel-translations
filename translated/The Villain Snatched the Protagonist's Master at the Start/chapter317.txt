One month later. Qin Family City.

Qin Jiang was back. The entire Qin family, led by Fourth Ancestor, turned out to welcome him. With the knockoff Space-Time Temple, their cultivation had improved significantly, and they were eager to show off.

But Qin Jiang didn't give them a second glance. A bunch of rough men couldn't compete with his soft, fragrant wives. He headed straight for the Void Divine Temple.

"I'm home!"

Doors flew open. Beautiful figures poured out and surrounded him. Liu Shuwan and the women who'd accompanied him exchanged looks and quietly stepped aside. They'd been with him the whole time — but the women here hadn't seen him in ages. They needed this reunion more.

Liu Shuwan guided the newcomers through the temple to choose their rooms. Qin Jiang, meanwhile, was thoroughly occupied.

Thankfully, most of the women were in seclusion at the Space-Time Temple and didn't know he'd returned. Otherwise, he'd be buried alive.

He didn't disturb those in seclusion. Settle the ones here first.

Amid a chorus of excited voices, the women ushered him into the Space-Time Temple. Their agenda was simple: wring him dry.

Another month passed before the immediate wave was handled — barely — with more women emerging from seclusion to join the fray. It took a considerable amount of energy.

Those settled, there were still others in seclusion. As master of the Space-Time Temple, Qin Jiang could observe any of them with a thought.

'Lian'er's really been working hard.'

She'd been his first check. In the past month, she hadn't emerged from seclusion once. He'd never seen her this dedicated.

And she wasn't alone. Little Red was with her. The baby phoenix had long since broken through to Supreme and taken human form — a proper bombshell. Tall, slender-waisted, voluptuous. She and Lian'er trained together, complementing each other's abilities.

"Nine Tribulations Supreme."

Lian'er had reached Nine Tribulations Supreme. Given the timeline, she must have been cultivating nonstop from the moment he'd left. He'd never seen her this motivated.

"That girl doesn't know when to take a break." He shook his head and began browsing the system shop for something suitable.

His eyes lit up. "True Phoenix Plume."

An Immortal King-grade treasure, forged from the genuine plume of an Immortal King-level phoenix. It contained true phoenix fire capable of burning heaven and boiling seas. Once bonded, it could summon a phoenix avatar.

"An Immortal King treasure. Lian'er's cultivation is a bit low, but with her Nirvana Divine Body, she should be able to channel part of its power."

【Note: The True Phoenix Plume contains phoenix blood essence. Upon recognition, the wielder gains the blood essence.】

No more hesitation. He bought it.

Eight hundred thousand Villain Points. More than double the Immortal King medicine. But this was a permanent weapon, not a consumable.

The True Phoenix Plume materialized in his palm — a vivid crimson feather fan traced with golden runes. Impressive craftsmanship. Lian'er would love it.

He was about to deliver it when he noticed Little Red sitting beside Lian'er. 'Need a gift for Little Red too.'

He opened the system shop again. A fire-attribute divine beast would benefit from rare flames.

Crimson Blaze. Fire born from a phoenix's nirvana — ferocious, domineering, capable of burning both flesh and Primordial Spirit. Cultivating with this flame would forge an indestructible golden body, though the process was agonizing.

'This would suit Lian'er too.' He rubbed his chin, but quickly shook his head. Burning your own body and soul to train? Absolutely not. Lian'er was not doing that. Little Red, though... she could probably handle it. An indestructible golden body was worth some pain.

Three hundred thousand Villain Points. Done.

Gifts in hand, he teleported to Lian'er's cultivation chamber.

He couldn't rudely interrupt seclusion, but the Space-Time Temple had gentle methods for waking its inhabitants. Since neither girl was at a critical juncture, Qin Jiang simply called Lian'er's name.

She stirred. Little Red woke with her. Both sat facing each other, eyes still bleary with sleep.

"Lian'er~"

A soft voice from nearby. Lian'er's eyes flew wide. She looked over — and vanished.

"Brother~"

Before the word was fully out, she'd already launched herself at Qin Jiang, latching onto him like a koala.

He caught her easily, one arm supporting her weight, the other ruffling her hair. "Did Lian'er miss me?"

"Uh-huh! Lots~"

She nodded vigorously, threw her arms around his neck, and smacked a kiss on his cheek. Her eyes sparkled with satisfaction.

Hehe, she'd kissed her big brother. He smelled so nice~

Meanwhile, a calculating gleam crossed her gaze. Could she take him at her current level?

"Brother, what realm are you at now?"

She studied him — and couldn't read his cultivation at all. Had she still not caught up despite all this effort?

Qin Jiang preened. "I'm already a Great Emperor. Lian'er still has a ways to go~"

Her face fell. Great Emperor. She needed more time.

And knowing her brother, his combat power was definitely far beyond an ordinary Great Emperor.

"Hey, Nine Tribulations Supreme is already impressive," he said quickly, reading her expression as disappointment. "Here — I brought you a present."

He produced the True Phoenix Plume.

"What is this..."

She took the fan and immediately felt the searing energy within it. Her spiritual power stirred with excitement.

"Immortal King-grade treasure. The True Phoenix Plume."

Her jaw dropped. An Immortal King treasure? Azure Cloud Heaven didn't even have an Immortal King — or hadn't, until now. Her eyes shone as she looked at her brother. He really did spoil her rotten. Casually handing out Immortal King treasures.

If only he'd give himself to her, too.

She felt a pang of regret, but then her mind started racing. With an Immortal King treasure backing her up, could she finally overpower him?

Maybe... she should test it.
