Chaos District.

An Xihe prepared to enter seclusion for her Immortal King breakthrough by returning to the seal chamber. But before she went, she dragged Qin Jiang along for three full days of "encouragement."

Outside the seal, An Xihe threw her arms around Qin Jiang's neck, rose onto her toes, and planted a fierce kiss on his lips. She pulled back with a radiant smile. "When I come out, I'll definitely be able to beat you."

With that, she swept into the seal chamber where she'd arranged her formation array's core. Even a surprise attack would be held at bay long enough for her to respond.

Watching her disappear into the seal, Qin Jiang clicked his tongue. The barrier that Qing Chan and the others had set up was utterly useless—An Xihe walked through it like it wasn't there. Flashy to look at, though. A nice decorative touch.

Through the seal, he could just barely make out a shadowy silhouette. He shook his head and turned to leave.

The moment he stepped out, an enormous head materialized right in front of his face.

"What the—!"

Qin Jiang nearly jumped out of his skin and threw a reflexive punch. A pitiful yelp followed.

Realization dawned, and he pulled back. "Little Xu?"

It was the Void Beast, tracking him by scent. The poor creature's reward for finding its master was a fist full of love, sending it tumbling through the air. Fortunately, its hide was thick enough to take the hit.

Seeing its master recognize it, Little Xu crept forward with a wounded look—but before it could get close, a figure shot off its back and dove straight into Qin Jiang's arms.

This time, he saw who it was. His face lit up as he caught her in a tight embrace. "Shuwan, you're here!"

Looking at that face he hadn't seen in so long, he kissed her without hesitation. Same as always—sweet and fragrant.

Liu Shuwan melted against him, her arms looping around his neck as she kissed him back with even more urgency. Compared to Qin Jiang's few months of separation, she'd spent decades alone inside the Space-Time Temple. The longing had been building for what felt like a lifetime, and now, wrapped in his arms, her body was already responding of its own accord.

As they kissed, the Void Beast tried to sidle up to them. Without breaking the embrace, both Qin Jiang and Liu Shuwan simultaneously swatted it away with a palm strike, sending the poor beast tumbling once more.

When their lips finally parted, Liu Shuwan gazed up at him, eyes swimming with affection. Her breathing was heavier than before. "Qin Jiang, I want..."

Her hands were already moving, and his shirt disintegrated in seconds.

"Shuwan, hold on—" Seeing her reach for her own clothes next, Qin Jiang quickly intervened. "We're outdoors. Let's go home first."

Nobody was around at the moment, but what if someone showed up halfway through? He wasn't about to let anyone see his wife exposed.

But Liu Shuwan pouted, unwilling to wait a second longer after decades of seclusion. She waved her arm, yanked Qin Jiang into a pocket of folded space, and whispered a single word that nearly buckled his knees.

He didn't argue after that.

---

They emerged the next day. Liu Shuwan's cheeks were flushed with contentment, her entire body draped over Qin Jiang like she couldn't bear to let go. Her lips kept finding his—she'd kissed him so many times that his mouth was swollen.

Nearly a full day and night had finally taken the edge off. From the look in her eyes, though, she intended to make up for every last one of those decades in seclusion. Qin Jiang was ready for the challenge. He would not leave his wife unsatisfied.

"So, Qin Jiang—where are we, exactly?" Only now did Liu Shuwan glance around, belatedly asking about practical matters. She'd only found this place thanks to the Void Beast.

"Central Regions. The Chaos District."

Qin Jiang smiled, supporting her weight as she clung to him. Liu Shuwan's delicate nose wrinkled—the place didn't look inviting. The air itself reeked of something sinister.

"The Chaos District has no order, no rules," he explained. "Survival here depends entirely on your fists. But these days, the whole district is our territory." A note of pride crept into his voice. He'd conquered this place, after all.

"Our territory?" Liu Shuwan's eyes sparkled, and whatever nascent distaste she'd been feeling evaporated on the spot. She gave him a loud kiss on the cheek. "My husband is amazing!"

As they walked, Qin Jiang regaled her with tales of his exploits. She listened quietly, watching him with soft eyes, inserting little compliments whenever he paused. He practically glowed.

"Are we heading home?"

"Yep."

"There are new sisters, aren't there?"

"..."

"You'll have to introduce me properly. And don't let them bully me!" Her voice turned sweet and pitiful, but her eyes sparkled with mischief.

Qin Jiang laughed. "Not a very convincing performance. I'll introduce you to one of the girls back home who's a natural at the whole helpless act. If you're interested, you could take lessons."

He was talking about Ning Xue'er—the esteemed Palace Master of the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, who somehow transformed into a coy, doe-eyed creature whenever Qin Jiang was around. It drove Qing Chan up the wall. Of course, Ning Xue'er only turned on the charm for Qin Jiang, which in his mind made her a perfectly wonderful sister.

"Oh?" Liu Shuwan pressed herself closer, lips curving into a pout. "So it seems my dear husband has been enjoying himself thoroughly in these Central Regions."

"..."

Qin Jiang froze, thinking she was genuinely jealous, and looked down—only for her rosy lips to dart up and catch his.

"Hehe, my husband tastes so good!"

She giggled, showing not a trace of jealousy. Or perhaps she was jealous but chose not to show it—the kiss was compensation enough. With this many women around Qin Jiang, adding a few more hardly made a difference. Besides, given his standards, every woman at his side was exceptional in her own right. Exceptional women tended to appreciate each other, which made for harmonious coexistence.

The most important factor, of course, was that Qin Jiang could keep them all satisfied. Hungry women forced to share the same table would inevitably turn on each other.

The largest estate in the Chaos District now belonged to Qin Jiang. Qing Chan and the others had all settled in. Dao Zhen, naturally, had been kicked out. An old man had no business loitering around a house full of women.

Inside, Liu Shuwan recognized some familiar faces: Jian Yao, Mo Mo, Yan Shiya, Zi Fu, Hu Xian'er, Linglong, and Dan Yu—all of whom Qin Jiang had brought from the Western Regions. The rest were new to her: Qing Chan, Ning Xue'er, the four Azure Lotus Divine Palace saintesses, and Chen Baizhe.

Qin Jiang introduced them one by one. Apart from Qing Chan, Ning Xue'er, and Chen Baizhe, the four Azure Lotus saintesses had not yet been "won over." But in the plans he and Qing Chan had drawn up, none of them would escape. They'd seen something they shouldn't have, and Qing Chan intended to punish them for it.

In Qin Jiang's assessment, this "punishment" was really more of a reward.
