The Ye estate.

After several days away, Qin Jiang finally returned.

The moment he walked through the gate, Ye Lingtian was there—face cold, eyes smoldering with anger.

"Well, well. Who's gone and upset Uncle Ye?"

Qin Jiang smiled.

Ye Lingtian glared:

"What have you been doing at Rose Casino these past few days?"

"Nothing much. Just clearing up a little problem for your Ye family."

This was Ye family territory—it was perfectly normal for Ye Lingtian to know his movements, and Qin Jiang hadn't tried to hide anything.

Besides, without his intervention, Yan Shiya genuinely could have become a headache for the Ye family.

So he said it with a perfectly clear conscience.

"Clearing up a problem?"

Ye Lingtian laughed in disbelief:

"Don't think I don't know what you've been up to. Fooling around at a place like that—do you think you deserve Ling'er?"

Qin Jiang frowned:

"Uncle Ye, these past few days while I was out, I was giving you and Ling'er more time together. I did it out of consideration for your family. How can you be so ungrateful?"

Ye Lingtian: "..."

'You're out chasing women behind my daughter's back, and I'm supposed to thank you?'

"If Uncle Ye feels like he has too much time on his hands, I'd be happy to spar with you again."

Qin Jiang added casually.

Ye Lingtian's eyes widened. 'Is this brat threatening me?'

But what truly stung was the bitter truth—he really couldn't beat Qin Jiang.

"You... you, you, you..."

Ye Lingtian jabbed his finger at Qin Jiang, utterly speechless.

Qin Jiang chuckled, walked over, and patted his shoulder:

"Uncle Ye, matters between us young people—we can handle them ourselves. No need for you to worry your old head about it."

With that, he sidestepped Ye Lingtian.

Ye Ling'er had her own private courtyard within the estate.

Qin Jiang pushed open the gate and was greeted by peals of feminine laughter.

Looking up, he saw three beautiful women chatting and teasing each other—a mother-in-law and two daughters-in-law.

"Qin Jiang!"

All three looked up at the sound.

Ye Ling'er beamed and dashed over, hugging his arm.

Chen Ningbing approached too, her nose twitching delicately. She shot Qin Jiang a look. 'This lecher's definitely been fooling around again.'

"Getting used to the Ye estate?"

Qin Jiang asked.

Both women nodded. This was Ye Ling'er's home—even though it was her first visit, it felt warm and familiar. As for Chen Ningbing, she could adapt anywhere.

"Little Jiang, you're back."

Ye Ling'er's mother walked over with a smile.

Though her eyes carried a subtle flicker—as the Lady of the Ye household, she naturally knew what Qin Jiang had been up to.

But seeing her daughter's happy face, she sighed inwardly and held her tongue.

After a brief exchange, Ye Ling'er's mother smiled:

"You youngsters just got back together. I won't be a third wheel."

With that, she took her leave.

Once she was gone, both Ye Ling'er and Chen Ningbing fixed Qin Jiang with pointed stares.

"What?"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

Ye Ling'er hesitated, then spoke:

"Have you been... snatching people again while you were out?"

"Hm?"

"Father and Mother have both been dropping hints—saying you're no good and that I should watch myself."

Qin Jiang: "..."

He studied Ye Ling'er with a strange expression:

"And you just sold them out like that?"

Ye Ling'er blushed and rolled her eyes:

"I already know what you're like. Just... try to show a little restraint around my parents..."

She herself had been snatched by Qin Jiang. Chen Ningbing too—stolen right off the fighting stage. Her tolerance for his antics was remarkably high.

Qin Jiang laughed:

"I didn't exactly snatch anyone.

You know how it is—with my personal charm, women throw themselves at me on the street. So..."

"Narcissist!"

Both women delivered the verdict in unison.

Qin Jiang flipped his palm, producing two exquisite necklaces:

"Here—presents for you."

Surface protests aside, both women would be jealous deep down. A little consolation went a long way.

The necklaces caught their eyes instantly.

Qin Jiang chuckled and personally clasped them around each woman's neck, then stepped back to admire:

"Beautiful!"

The compliment brought warm smiles to both faces. Then Chen Ningbing blinked in surprise:

"Hm? Is it just me, or has the spiritual energy around us gotten livelier since I put this on?"

"Oh, you're right~"

Ye Ling'er tested it, eyes brightening.

Seeing their wonder, Qin Jiang explained:

"These aren't ordinary necklaces. I crafted them from top-grade spirit marrow. They'll boost your cultivation speed and nourish your physiques. There's also a teleportation array inscribed inside—if you're ever in danger, it activates automatically and brings you to my side."

"Top-grade spirit marrow?"

"With a teleportation array?"

Both women were stunned.

The gifts weren't just thoughtful—they were immensely valuable.

Both felt a swell of emotion. Something like this had to be handmade—no one else would be extravagant enough to craft jewelry from top-grade spirit marrow.

In truth, Qin Jiang had spent Villain Points to custom-order them through the system. That counted as making them himself, right?

After all, he and the system were practically one and the same.

"Like them?"

Qin Jiang asked with a smile.

Both women nodded, cradling their necklaces with blissful expressions.

Qin Jiang grinned and slipped his arms around both their waists:

"So...

Do I get a reward?"

The two women nodded...

And Qin Jiang's face went blank.

He had a feeling they'd been plotting something during his absence.
