Inside the Merfolk Royal Palace.

Qin Jiang was all smiles, positively glowing with satisfaction. He was in an excellent mood.

Ever since Black Dragon and his team had made contact with Zhao Sheng, the system had alerted him—another Child of Destiny. Better yet, he hadn't needed to lift a finger. Black Dragon and the others had played this Child of Destiny like a fiddle, netting Qin Jiang a tidy haul of rewards in the process.

The only peculiarity was the blank sections in the spoiler. The same thing had happened with Tianji—frequent gaps in the plotline.

"System, what's with these blank sections?"

The system replied promptly:

【The blank sections exist because powerful beings are involved. Including them in the spoiler could allow those beings to detect it, potentially endangering the host.】

"Oh?" Qin Jiang's brow rose. "Just including them in the spoiler is enough for them to sense it?"

【Yes. Their power is so vast that anything related to them can be perceived. Unless the host surpasses them in strength.】

A sudden thought made Qin Jiang's eyes widen, and he asked with a hint of guilt, "So... I've been mentioning the Grand Sovereign pretty often. Can he sense that?"

【Yes.】

"..."

【However, since he hasn't bothered with you, it means he doesn't care about your mutterings.】

"Well, that's a relief."

Qin Jiang exhaled. The system had considered dropping another warning, but seeing his expression, it decided to stay quiet. After all, the Grand Sovereign wasn't the only one Qin Jiang had been mentioning. There was also the Grand Sovereign's daughter—and she was no pushover either.

While Qin Jiang was chatting with the system, Black Dragon and the others arrived at the Merfolk Royal Palace. Qin Jiang had them shown in right away.

Black Dragon and Little Xu presented the Immortal Emperor's legacy and bowed. "Greetings, Young Master."

Qin Jiang smiled warmly. "No need for formalities."

"Yes, sir."

They rose, set the legacy down before him, and reported, "Young Master, this is the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor's legacy. We've brought it back."

"Well done."

Qin Jiang nodded approvingly. This legacy was supposed to belong to Zhao Sheng, but Black Dragon's team had snatched it right out from under him. This Child of Destiny was rather lacking.

"Tell me about what happened in the secret realm."

Black Dragon and Little Xu nodded and launched into a detailed account, with particular emphasis on Zhao Sheng's situation. The rest—the smaller incidents and skirmishes—they summarized briefly.

When they finished, Little Xu lowered his head slightly. "Young Master, I was the one who overlooked the Immortal Emperor's legacy. Please punish me."

"It's just one Immortal Emperor's legacy." Qin Jiang waved dismissively. "Never mind that you recovered it—even if you hadn't, it wouldn't have been your fault."

The legacy had been prepared specifically for the Child of Destiny. Anyone else would have been unable to find it, let alone unlock it. The oversight truly wasn't Little Xu's mistake. Besides, Qin Jiang had known from the start that the secret realm likely held hidden treasures they'd miss. The fact that his team had managed to reclaim this one already exceeded his expectations.

"Alright, deposit the legacy in the Merit Hall. If someone wants it, they can exchange Merit Points for it."

Black Dragon and Little Xu nodded. Then Black Dragon couldn't resist asking, "Young Master, is Zhao Sheng the person you were looking for?"

"That's right." Qin Jiang smiled. "He's exactly who I was looking for. You all did well—go claim your rewards."

Good work deserved recognition, so Qin Jiang saw no reason to hide it. Besides, dealing with Children of Destiny required people like Black Dragon. Qin Jiang couldn't be bothered to handle every single one personally—far too time-consuming. After following him for so long, Black Dragon and Little Xu had undoubtedly formed their own guesses about his secrets. They simply never voiced them.

With nothing more to discuss, Qin Jiang dismissed them.

Two Children of Destiny would keep him busy for a while. But Tianji was the one who worried him. The man was still locked down in Dream Cloud City, and Qin Jiang genuinely didn't feel comfortable letting him leave. As for Zhao Sheng, that was much simpler—with Liu Xing embedded as an undercover agent, Black Dragon's team could manipulate him effortlessly without Qin Jiang's direct involvement.

"Tianji..." Qin Jiang murmured.

Keeping him confined forever wasn't a solution, but releasing him risked losing track of him entirely. The Celestial Secrets tradition was genuinely mysterious—once hidden, its practitioners were nearly impossible to find. He'd finally gotten his hands on a Child of Destiny; letting him slip away would be a devastating loss. Even leaving tracking measures behind wasn't reassuring. The man had his own bag of tricks and might find a way to dispel them.

'What about applying the True Spirit Slave Seal directly?'

Qin Jiang considered it. This particular Child of Destiny had remarkable abilities. If he could be put to work, the returns might rival the system's own rewards. The only question was whether the True Spirit Slave Seal could truly bind him.

'Might as well try.'

Ultimately, Qin Jiang decided to test whether the man could be brought into service.

Meanwhile, above the Dream Cloud Sea, nearly every cultivator had emerged from the Immortal Emperor's secret realm, and the details of what had happened inside quickly spread. A magnificent Immortal Emperor's secret realm, and there had been nothing in it—nothing except a single Immortal Emperor's legacy.

Obviously, that didn't add up, but no one could figure out what had actually happened. As for the legacy itself, they finally learned that it had passed right before their eyes when Black Dragon's group exited. Now it was in the sea tribe's possession, and with an Immortal Emperor backing them, no Immortal King present dared challenge them. Picking a fight with an Immortal Emperor over a single legacy was a losing proposition any way you sliced it.

The cultivators stared out at the Dream Cloud Sea, expressions tinged with regret. The entire trip had been a waste. Some factions had even lost powerful members—a net loss by any measure.

Beyond the legacy, another name was on everyone's lips: Zhao Sheng. During the struggle for the legacy, he'd beaten down plenty of people without killing any of them. Now, back with their elders, those cultivators were eager to tattle—pointing fingers and scanning the crowd for him.

But Zhao Sheng and Liu Xing had slipped away the moment they left the secret realm, quietly departing the Dream Cloud Sea altogether. There was no staying here—he'd offended too many people and had nothing to show for it.

Well, not nothing. He'd gained a sworn brother.

That wasn't bad at all.

Now, Zhao Sheng was heading home to the Zhao family with Liu Xing in tow, planning to lie low for a while.
