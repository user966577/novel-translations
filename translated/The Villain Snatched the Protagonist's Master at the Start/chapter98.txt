Qin Lian'er's words left Qin Jiang thoroughly exasperated. The Immortal Fire was actually interested in him? A flame. He shook his head—he did not currently possess an indestructible body. He couldn't handle it.

Turning his attention to the Legacy Flame, he drew it into his palm and examined it closely. His eyebrows rose in surprise. "It really is purified."

In less than fifteen minutes, the Immortal Fire had completely cleansed the Legacy Flame. All the chaotic, impure energy inside had been refined into a pure, directly absorbable form.

"Pretty impressive, right?" Qin Lian'er beamed.

Qin Jiang smiled and gave her a thumbs-up. "Impressive. My Lian'er is the best."

"Obviously!" She put her hands on her hips, face full of pride. Then her eyes rolled with a mischievous gleam, and she sidled up to him. "Brother, didn't you say you were going to put pressure on Chu Yuan? Bully him a bit?"

"What about it?"

"Take me along!"

Excitement was written all over her face. She didn't know why, but something about Chu Yuan just rubbed her the wrong way. If her brother was going to torment him, she wanted in.

Qin Jiang studied her with an odd expression. Children of Destiny and villains were natural enemies—Qin Lian'er's instinctive dislike of Chu Yuan made perfect sense. A bit of bullying to blow off steam wouldn't hurt anything.

"Fine," he agreed.

Qin Lian'er practically vibrated with eagerness, rubbing her hands together. "When do we go get him?"

"How about now?"

Two days had passed since his sister was taken, and Chu Yuan had spent them in a daze, sprawled on his bed, too numb to function. But hunger finally drove him up. Clutching his empty stomach, he groaned. "If Sister were here, she'd have food ready for me."

The thought made him miss her even more—and hate Qin Jiang with even greater intensity.

He tore through the house looking for something to eat but came up empty. He'd have to go buy food. Except...

"I'm broke."

All his money had gone into bets at the underground arena, and thanks to Qin Jiang, he'd lost every last cent. He was completely penniless. The injustice of it nearly overwhelmed him. Reborn into a second life, and he couldn't even feed himself. In his previous life, he'd never been this pathetic.

Chu Yuan was on the verge of tears. "This is all because of Qin Jiang!"

Since childhood, he'd never had it easy, but he'd never gone hungry either. Even in his previous life, he'd always been under his sister's wing.

"Hey, Brother, look—Chu Yuan's crying!"

Qin Lian'er's exclamation startled him. He quickly wiped his eyes and saw who had arrived. His expression immediately hardened. "What do you want?"

Behind Qin Jiang and Qin Lian'er stood two burly men whose faces practically screamed "violence," glaring at Chu Yuan with menacing grins.

Qin Jiang smiled casually. "The real question is, why are you still here?"

"This is my house. Why wouldn't I be here?"

"Your house?" Qin Jiang shook his head. "Sorry, but your house has been sold." He pointed at the two bruisers. "These gentlemen are the new owners."

The two men stepped forward, sneering at Chu Yuan. "Listen, kid—you need to get lost. This place doesn't belong to you anymore."

Chu Yuan stood frozen. His house... was sold?

"That's impossible! I'm the owner—you have no right to sell my house!"

Qin Jiang produced the property deed and handed it to the two men. "Your sister decided to come with me, so the house wasn't needed anymore. She gave me the deed and asked me to sell it."

The words hit Chu Yuan like a sledgehammer. His sister had always been the one managing their affairs, handling most of the family's assets. But... she'd sold the house?

How was that possible? And if she'd left with Qin Jiang, what was he supposed to do? Sleep on the streets?

One of the men waved the deed impatiently. "Don't make us get rough, kid. Beat it!"

Chu Yuan snapped back to reality. The deed was genuine, but—

"No. My sister would never sell the house. You stole this! Qin Jiang, where's my sister? Bring her out!"

His fists were clenched, his face dark with fury.

Qin Jiang was about to respond when Qin Lian'er cut in with a giggle. "Chu Yuan, Sister Yan doesn't want you anymore. She told me herself—I'm the cutest little sister. All you've ever done is cause her trouble. She's been wanting to get rid of you for ages! Now that she has my brother, she doesn't want to see your face. You're ugly, you're stupid, and standing next to my brother, you look like a street rat reeking of garbage. Eww! Just looking at you makes me want to puke."

By the time she finished her barrage, Chu Yuan was seeing stars—literally. Two days without food, combined with Qin Lian'er's verbal assault, left him swaying on his feet. His legs buckled, and he collapsed to the ground.

"What the—did he just flop?" Qin Lian'er stared in disbelief.

Qin Jiang looked at his little sister with new eyes. He hadn't expected such devastating firepower when she went all out. Had Chu Yuan actually fainted from sheer rage?

The two bruisers froze too, caught between action and uncertainty. They looked to Qin Jiang for guidance.

He waved them off. "This is your property now. Trespassers get thrown out."

He wasn't worried about killing Chu Yuan. As a Child of Destiny, the guy wasn't that easy to finish off.

The two men hauled the limp Chu Yuan up and tossed him out the gate.

"You..." Chu Yuan could barely see straight, bitterness and fury churning inside him. No money for food was bad enough—now he was losing his home too?

'Sister, why did you sell the house? You're living in a mansion with Qin Jiang, but did you forget you have a brother?'

He felt wronged to the core, tears prickling his eyes. Two lifetimes, and in neither had he been anyone important. His emotional resilience was roughly what you'd expect.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang was giving the two men their instructions. "Build yourselves a new place next door. This house stays off-limits." He pointed toward Chu Hanyan's room. Even with her gone, her space wasn't to be touched.

The men nodded vigorously, not daring to disagree.

"As for that one—" Qin Jiang gestured at Chu Yuan. "He's never allowed back. If he comes near this place, beat him. Beat him within an inch of his life. If he actually dies, that's fine too."
