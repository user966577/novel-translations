With the King of Gamblers at their side, Lian'er and Zi Fu were brimming with confidence. They fell in behind Qin Jiang, radiating the unmistakable energy of people here to settle a score.

They reached the front counter. Zi Fu was about to step forward and exchange chips when Qin Jiang simply kicked the entire counter over.

"Where's the manager? Get out here!" he barked.

Zi Fu: "..."

She glanced at Lian'er. Was this how the King of Gamblers operated?

The casino staff scrambled in a panic, but none of them stepped forward. Their monthly salary wasn't worth dying over. Before long, a man in brocade robes was summoned from the back. He took one look at the toppled counter and his expression cooled. "What's the meaning of this, young sir?"

"Hmph." Qin Jiang gave him a cold snort. "Today, my little sister and my—" He paused, glancing at Zi Fu. "—my wife came to your casino and ran into someone stacking the deck. They were too timid to say anything, but I'm not as easy to push around!"

Lian'er's eyes curved into happy crescents, and she shot Zi Fu a gleeful look. Her brother was incredible! Smooth as silk—he'd already started maneuvering without missing a beat.

Zi Fu's brow furrowed slightly. She'd been about to protest, but the word "wife" seemed to be nothing more than a convenient excuse. She opened her mouth, muttered something under her breath, and decided to let it go.

That was when it dawned on her: Lian'er's brother might not be the most upstanding person.

"Stacking the deck?" The man in brocade frowned. If the accusation was legitimate, a confrontation was reasonable enough—but it would need to be verified. He looked toward Lian'er and Zi Fu. The attendant from earlier stepped forward quickly.

"Sir, I served these two ladies this morning. They were gambling against Chen Qi'er."

"Chen Qi'er?"

The brocade-robed man scanned the room. The blind beggar—Chen Qi'er—was still in the casino, though he wasn't gambling. He sat quietly in a corner, utterly out of place amid the chaos.

"Ladies, you were gambling against Chen Qi'er?" the manager asked.

Lian'er shook her head. "I don't know his name. He's a blind beggar, though."

"That'd be him." The manager nodded, his gaze sharpening. "However, Chen Qi'er has been frequenting our casino for nearly a month now without a single loss. He's good enough to win without resorting to tricks. So tell me—how exactly did you catch him cheating?"

Both girls looked to Qin Jiang.

"What's this—trying to intimidate my sister and my wife?" Qin Jiang took a step forward and gave both girls a thumbs-up. "These two are true gambling queens—their skills are only a hair below mine. If the deck wasn't stacked, nobody besides me could beat them!"

Lian'er: "???"

Zi Fu: "???"

The girls stared at each other. Since when had they become gambling queens? Qin Jiang delivered the claim with such conviction that they almost believed it themselves. And a nagging thought occurred to both of them simultaneously: was this how Qin Jiang had earned the title "King of Gamblers" in the first place?

"That's impossible!" The attendant stepped forward. "They were complete novices—I've been working this casino for years, and I could tell instantly it was their first time gambling!"

"So you set a trap, knowing they were beginners, and let them get fleeced?"

"I—"

The attendant choked on his words.

Qin Jiang turned to the manager with a pleasant smile. "Well, well. The truth comes out."

"Young sir, you should know that our casino is backed by a Great Emperor," the man said, eyes narrowing. He'd confirmed what he already suspected—Qin Jiang was here purely to cause trouble. But no casino operated without powerful backing. Theirs had a Great Emperor behind it.

"A Great Emperor." Qin Jiang couldn't help but laugh. These days, his sights were set on the immortal path. A mere Great Emperor being waved around as a threat was genuinely amusing. The weak and their outrage were nothing but entertainment to the strong.

"Mo Mo," he said, glancing at her.

She shot him a petulant look. The dignified founder of the Demon Hall, a bona fide Immortal—being used to intimidate insects. How undignified.

Still, she stepped in front of Qin Jiang. Her eyes flashed, and an overwhelming wave of pressure crashed over the entire casino.

"Kneel."

The single word came out ice-cold. The brocade-robed manager dropped to his knees instantly, sweat beading across his forehead. As a Supreme Realm cultivator, he'd encountered plenty of Great Emperors. But none of them had ever exuded pressure like this. This woman was—

An Ancient Emperor? Or... an Immortal?

Either way, far beyond anything he could challenge.

"I'm saying your casino set up my sister and my wife to lose," Qin Jiang said casually. "Do you agree?"

The manager's body trembled. Agree? His boss would kill him. Disagree? He might not survive the next five seconds.

His eyes darted. "My lord—sir—my lord, it wasn't the casino! It was him—it was Chen Qi'er!" His voice shook as he pointed frantically toward the corner. "He must have been stacking the deck!"

The brocade-robed man's groveling knew no bounds as he heaped every shred of blame onto Chen Qi'er. The blind beggar sat in his corner, "watching" the scene unfold, his sightless gaze seemingly fixed on Mo Mo.

Qin Jiang had noticed him from the start. The new Child of Destiny. An Immortal who had sealed himself away, disguised as a beggar, tempering his dao heart in the mortal world. But Qin Jiang found it rather pathetic. The man dressed like a beggar but maintained a mysterious, lofty air the entire time. What kind of heart-tempering was that? If you're going to play the beggar, commit to the role. Otherwise, wearing rags while acting above it all had zero tempering value.

Take Qin Jiang himself—young patriarch of the Qin family, a refined gentleman of breeding. If he ever needed to temper his heart by playing a scoundrel, he'd be absolutely convincing.

"My lord, this beggar has been in our casino for a month, never losing once. We've long suspected him of cheating! Thanks to your sister and wife for catching him red-handed—otherwise we'd have had no proof. Please, everything your sister and wife lost, our casino will refund tenfold! And Chen Qi'er is yours to deal with as you see fit!"

The manager's words tumbled over each other as he shoved every last scrap of responsibility onto the beggar.

"But we didn't actually catch him cheating," Lian'er pointed out.

"No need for that! You two are the witnesses! With gambling skills like yours—second only to this lord himself—there's no one under heaven who could beat you fairly! Chen Qi'er must have been cheating!"

The manager laid on the flattery thick enough to spread with a knife—anything to stay alive.

Lian'er and Zi Fu exchanged bemused looks. They were officially gambling queens now. Casino-certified, no less.

Qin Jiang didn't waste much attention on the groveling manager. His eyes were on Chen Qi'er.

"Qin Jiang, there's something strange about that beggar," Mo Mo said quietly. Her brow creased—she couldn't quite pin down the man's actual strength.

Qin Jiang just smiled. "He's just a beggar."
