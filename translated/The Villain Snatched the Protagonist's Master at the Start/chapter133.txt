The great hall fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.

After a long pause, the painting trembled slightly. Being sealed, she truly couldn't act—all she could do was bluff.

However, a torrent of demonic qi spilled from the painting, engulfing the entire hall. Under its influence, every Demon Hall powerhouse felt their aura surge. Madness filled their eyes, rational thought evaporating completely.

"Kill!"

The cold command issued from within the painting.

The powerhouses charged Fourth Ancestor like rabid beasts. Several of them radiated auras that had been forcibly pushed to the threshold of Great Emperor.

Fourth Ancestor's expression hardened. Without a shred of hesitation, he met them head-on, bellowing as he did: "Stop hiding—everyone, move!"

The other three Great Emperors materialized instantly.

Their strength was leagues beyond these Demon Hall cultivators. If not for wanting to press-gang them into working for the Qin family, Fourth Ancestor and the others would have simply slaughtered them all.

After some effort, they subdued every Demon Hall powerhouse in the room.

Fourth Ancestor turned to the painting. "You may be an immortal-path cultivator, but you're sealed. Too many limitations. You won't beat us."

Demonic qi churned furiously—anyone could feel the rage of the immortal-path being within. But sealed inside the painting, she had no recourse.

The demonic qi gradually receded. She couldn't do anything to Fourth Ancestor and his companions, and they couldn't do anything to her either. A stalemate.

"Perhaps," Fourth Ancestor said, "we could talk."

A cold laugh answered him. "Talk? About how to annex my Demon Hall?"

Before the echoes died, the auras of the Demon Hall powerhouses plummeted. Those who had regained their senses went ashen with terror.

"Founder, mercy!"

"Founder, we would never dare betray you!"

They groveled, begging for their lives.

Fourth Ancestor's expression shifted too—these were premium laborers for the Qin family. Losing even one would hurt.

"Someone can break your seal!" he blurted.

The Demon Hall powerhouses' plummeting auras finally stabilized. Collectively they sagged to the ground, trembling, and knelt carefully before the painting.

A long silence followed before the immortal-path being spoke, her voice laced with derision: "You?"

Her seal had been set by an immortal-path cultivator. A mere Great Emperor couldn't even scratch it.

"Not me, obviously." Fourth Ancestor shook his head, then smiled. "But I know someone who can."

He meant Qin Jiang, of course. Qin Jiang hadn't explicitly said he could break the seal, but Fourth Ancestor had absolute faith in his Young Lord. If Qin Jiang already knew an immortal-path powerhouse lurked within the Demon Hall, then breaking her seal shouldn't be a problem, right?

The more he thought about it, the broader his confident smile grew.

The being in the painting studied him closely. That kind of confidence was genuinely hard to disbelieve.

"You have an immortal-path cultivator backing you?"

Fourth Ancestor's smile faltered. He shook his head. "No."

Disappointment colored the sealed being's voice. Without help from someone of equal caliber, breaking the seal was simply impossible.

"Without an immortal-path cultivator, breaking the seal is out of the question."

"He can do it," Fourth Ancestor insisted.

"He can't possibly—"

"Just try. You've got nothing to lose."

That gave her pause. Fourth Ancestor had a point—even if the seal wasn't broken, she'd lose nothing. But if it actually worked, the payoff would be immense. Besides, without an immortal-path cultivator on their side, she'd be free to dominate them all the moment the seal came off.

"Fine."

After a moment's deliberation, she agreed.

Fourth Ancestor grinned. "Then these Demon Hall members..."

"Yours."

She didn't even hesitate. The Demon Hall cultivators had only ever been tools she'd raised to sustain herself, ensuring her power didn't decay too much under the seal. If the seal could be broken, the Demon Hall served no purpose. And if it couldn't, she had no way of keeping them anyway—the most she could do was kill them all.

She simply didn't care about the Demon Hall.

Back in the Imperial City, at the Third Princess's mansion, Black Dragon hovered with the painting floating above his head. It faced Qin Jiang, as if appraising him.

"You can break my seal?" the immortal-path being demanded.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. "Easily."

He possessed the Immortal King Seal. Breaking her seal wouldn't be difficult at all. The problem was that he couldn't yet control an immortal-path powerhouse. He'd have to wait for Jian Yao's breakthrough before unsealing her.

"Hah. Bold claim."

Qin Jiang chuckled softly, pressed a finger against the painting, and covertly channeled the Immortal King Seal's power into it.

The painting shuddered.

He immediately withdrew his hand.

"Believe me now?"

Inside the painting, the immortal-path being was stunned. In that brief instant, the seal had actually trembled—and the one who'd caused it was just a young man.

"What kind of power was that?"

Qin Jiang shook his head, his smile brimming with mystery.

Impatience crept into her voice. "Break my seal, and the Demon Hall is yours."

"Breaking the seal is easy, but..."

"Whatever you want—just name it. Break the seal and I'll give you anything."

"But I don't feel like it."

"???"

The immortal-path being sounded genuinely incredulous. "You don't want to? Then why did you have them bring me here?"

"Wanted to see how pathetic an immortal-path powerhouse could get."

"..."

The painting quaked, demonic qi surging skyward. But before she could even get a threat out, Qin Jiang said mildly: "Maybe one day, when I'm in a good mood, I'll break the seal."

The demonic qi stuttered, then subsided.

She'd been sealed for eons beyond counting, drifting in and out of consciousness within the painting. Combined with an immortal-path cultivator's endless lifespan, it was pure torture. There were times she'd even contemplated ending it all. Only sheer willpower had carried her through. Now, finally, she saw a chance at freedom.

She wasn't about to let it slip away.

Once she'd calmed down, she asked seriously: "What are your conditions?"

"No conditions." Qin Jiang shook his head. "Stay with me for now. When the time is right, I'll break the seal."

"When will the time be right?"

"When you're no longer a threat to me."

"You don't trust me?"

"You're a major demon lord. Why would I trust you?" Qin Jiang curled his lip. A grand demoness having credibility? Please. Even he didn't have that kind of thing.

She fell silent, unable to argue.

After a long while, she spoke: "Fine. I'll stay with you for now. I hope you'll break the seal soon."
