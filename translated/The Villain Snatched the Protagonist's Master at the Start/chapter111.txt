One month later.

A colossal airship cruised through the Chaos, its silhouette resembling a flying castle. Walking its decks felt no different from walking on solid ground. Rows of guards patrolled the perimeter—every one of them at least a Yin-Yang Realm cultivator. Occasionally, a Supreme-level ancestor could be spotted among them. Further inside stood blocks of living quarters for the crew, and at the very center rose a magnificent palace—the Void Divine Temple.

With preparations complete, Qin Jiang had departed the Heavenly Mystery Continent. They'd been drifting through the Chaos for several days now.

The Chaos was boundless, the distance between continents essentially infinite. Without coordinates, losing one's bearings was terrifyingly easy—especially for someone like Qin Jiang, who was wandering aimlessly. Dangerous didn't begin to cover it.

Inside the Void Divine Temple, the women were doing their own things—some cultivating, some playing around. Qin Jiang lounged in a reclining chair with two beauties attending to him: Yan Yun and Yan Shiya. Neither woman was native to the Heavenly Mystery Continent; they hailed from one of the Nine Heavens, where enemies still awaited them.

"Now that we've left the continent, I'll take you home once the time is right," Qin Jiang said.

Both women nodded obediently. Yan Yun had never cared much about revenge one way or the other. Yan Shiya harbored genuine hatred, but as one of the Seven Beauties, Qin Jiang's word was law. Even if he told her to abandon her vendetta, she wouldn't argue.

Not that he would. His women had been wronged, and he intended to settle the score. But only when he could guarantee a crushing victory—anything less wasn't worth the trouble.

They continued sailing through the Chaos. No day, no night—time became meaningless.

Days later, Qin Lian'er came bursting into the Void Divine Temple.

"Brother, brother, brother! We've spotted other ships!"

She was practically bouncing. After a long wait, Qin Jiang emerged at a leisurely pace.

"Let's go have a look."

He stretched and beckoned to her. Before long, they reached the ship's edge and peered into the distance. Several airships sat motionless in the Chaos, surrounding a lone vessel.

"Well, well. Chaos Marauders?" Qin Jiang's eyebrow rose.

He immediately gave the order: "Go—let's watch the show!"

Under normal circumstances, encountering Chaos Marauders meant fleeing as fast as possible. Sailing directly toward them? That was the sort of thing only a fool would do.

The airship closed the gap in under half an hour, pulling up about 300 feet away before Qin Jiang ordered a stop. At that range, they were practically parked on the marauders' doorstep. And Qin Jiang's ship was larger than all the others combined.

The perfect vantage point.

Both the marauders and their victims stared up at the looming titan in utter bewilderment. Even the marauders' expressions turned grave.

The fighting had stopped entirely.

"Why'd you stop? Keep going!" Qin Jiang called down, thoroughly entertained. When neither side moved, he couldn't resist urging them on.

Qin Lian'er was draped over the bow, watching with gleeful excitement.

It was the victims who recovered first. A middle-aged man in gold battle armor—cracked and battered, but his bearing undiminished—looked up at Qin Jiang with desperate hope.

"Fellow Daoist! We are members of the Divine Dragon Continent's imperial family! Please lend us your aid—we will repay you handsomely!"

"Divine Dragon Continent?"

Before leaving, Qin Jiang had reviewed information on the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. The Divine Dragon Continent was one of the Ten Lands, and like the Qin Domain, it had been unified long ago under a single power: the Divine Dragon Empire.

Members of the imperial family were unquestionably high-ranking figures.

At that moment, the marauders' leader spoke up: "Sir, I advise you not to meddle. Our backers are not to be trifled with."

"Oh? Threatening me?"

"Merely stating facts, sir."

Chaos Marauders often had organizational backing—even major powers from the Nine Heavens secretly sponsored or organized marauder bands. The profits were simply too tempting for anyone to ignore. Whoever stood behind this particular group was clearly no small player.

Qin Jiang rubbed his chin and shouted: "Fourth Ancestor!"

Fourth Ancestor didn't even bother showing himself. He simply slapped down from inside the ship.

The devastating force hadn't even arrived before every marauder collapsed, their legs giving out beneath them.

"Wait—Fourth Ancestor, go easy! Keep the ships intact—there's definitely loot on board!"

Qin Jiang's frantic shout came just in time. The strike halted mid-air, then shifted with unexpected delicacy, plucking every last marauder out of their vessels with invisible force.

Then it came down.

Every marauder burst into a cloud of crimson mist.

The Divine Dragon party watched with twitching eyelids.

'A Great Emperor. He has a Great Emperor with him,' the armored man thought, his reverence spiking. Anyone who traveled with an Emperor-level bodyguard was no ordinary person. Likely the scion of a major Nine Heavens family.

"Thank you, Young Master, for your assistance."

His tone had grown noticeably more respectful, his form of address upgraded.

Qin Jiang ordered his people to commandeer the marauders' ships, then turned to the middle-aged man with a smile.

"If you really want to thank me, shouldn't you show it with something more... concrete?"

The man's face stiffened. The look in Qin Jiang's eyes sent a chill through him. It was beginning to feel like they'd escaped the wolves only to stumble upon a tiger.

"Young Master, we didn't bring many valuables on this voyage. Once we return to the Divine Dragon Continent, we will certainly repay you generously."

"No valuables?"

Qin Jiang frowned. Then Qin Lian'er sidled up beside him, grinning.

"Brother, let me take some people aboard to search. A ship that big—no way there's nothing good."

She waved her little hand and led a squad of guards leaping across. Fourth Ancestor and the others shadowed her invisibly—no risk of a hostage situation.

Qin Jiang smiled and let her have her fun.

Before long, Qin Lian'er's excited voice rang out:

"Brother! There really IS a big treasure! Come quick!"
