Dawn crept in.

The sounds in the room had gradually subsided. Qin Jiang gazed at the beauty in his arms, a satisfied smile playing at his lips.

Easy as breathing.

Of course, much of the credit belonged to Yu Ru. Thanks to her groundwork, Yu Lan had arrived with her guard already lowered—even harboring some goodwill, since she believed he'd saved her people.

And really, Qin Jiang didn't feel guilty at all. He absolutely could have slaughtered those Snake Race soldiers, so in a way, he had saved them. By that logic, Yu Ru hadn't technically lied. And Qin Jiang certainly hadn't—he genuinely could cure the bloodline poison.

'Not bad at all.'

He let out an appreciative sigh. This snake empress was even more exquisite than Yu Ru—especially those supple, serpentine curves. Enough to drive any man wild.

But a night of "treatment" had left Yu Lan utterly spent. Between her existing injuries and the exertion, she'd drifted off the moment he stopped.

He didn't leave. Instead, he shifted slightly, closed his eyes, and settled in for some rest himself—beautiful woman still nestled in his arms.

By noon, Yu Lan's eyes fluttered open. She looked up at Qin Jiang, emotions warring across her face. Memories of the night's "treatment" sent heat rushing to her cheeks.

At first, she truly had been focused on nothing but purging the poison. But as time went on, the original purpose had been all but forgotten.

Mercifully, Qin Jiang had remembered his task.

Only...

Qin Jiang opened his eyes as well. Their gazes met.

After a brief silence, he spoke first. "There's still some residual toxin in your bloodline. We'll need a few more sessions."

"Mm."

Yu Lan nodded. She knew her own body—the poison had indeed diminished significantly. By her estimate, one more session should suffice.

Qin Jiang's "few more sessions"...

She was fairly certain he had ulterior motives now. But it didn't matter anymore. What was done was done. One session or two made no difference. A few extra rounds could simply be considered... her payment.

The thought reddened her cheeks further. Calling it "payment" was a touch shameless, given that she'd also very much...

"Shall we continue now?"

Qin Jiang asked.

Yu Lan startled. "Now?"

She shook her head vigorously—her body absolutely could not take another round. But she eyed him with frank suspicion. How did he still have the energy? She'd felt him give everything he had. Was there really more left?

Seeing her refusal, Qin Jiang looked mildly disappointed. "Fine. Rest up, then let me know when you're ready."

He rose and tidied himself, thoughtfully tucking the blanket around her.

"I'll step out."

His voice was gentle.

Yu Lan watched him go, hesitated, then called out. "Wait. Can I ask you something?"

"What is it?"

"You and Ru'er..." Yu Lan's eyes wavered. "Did you two... the same as me?"

Yesterday, she'd noticed an odd scent on Yu Ru. At the time, she hadn't recognized it—she'd been entirely inexperienced. But now, with fresh perspective, she realized that the smell on her sister was the same one clinging to her now.

Qin Jiang raised a brow. He didn't bother hiding it. "Ru'er fell for me after I saved her. One thing led to another—we were together before you arrived."

If Yu Ru heard this, she'd curse him six ways to Sunday. What a shameless liar.

Yu Lan went quiet. So her sister had already been with him. Did that make her the one stealing her own sister's man?

She felt lost, awash in conflicting emotions.

Qin Jiang said softly, "Don't overthink it. Ru'er knows about us. She approves."

"She... what?"

Of course. In this cramped formation, Yu Ru couldn't possibly have been unaware that her man and her sister were...

Shame twisted through Yu Lan.

Qin Jiang said nothing more and left.

Outside, Yu Ru was already waiting. The moment he emerged, she rushed over. "How's my sister?"

"With me on the job? She's fine."

Qin Jiang grinned. "By the way—she knows about us now. I told her you fell for me after I rescued you, and we naturally became a couple."

Yu Ru: "..."

She stared up at him. "You're truly shameless, you know that?"

"What else was I supposed to say? The truth? Besides, you're the one who started this whole scheme to deceive her. How about we go confess right now? I've gotten what I came for."

"You—"

Yu Ru's teeth ground together. Looking at his unrepentant grin, regret stabbed through her. She'd fed her sister to a tiger.

Brow furrowed, she huffed. "We can't confess yet. But we can't keep lying to her forever, either."

"Relax. Once I've completely won her over, we'll tell her everything."

He figured that even now, coming clean wouldn't make Yu Lan turn on him—but it would devastate Yu Ru. Yu Lan's greatest soft spot was her sister, and learning that Yu Ru had conspired to deceive her would be a blow she couldn't easily absorb. So for Yu Ru's sake, Qin Jiang would have to put in a bit more effort.

Thinking this, he slid an arm around Yu Ru's waist.

"What are you doing? You just spent all night with my sister and you're still not satisfied?"

She wriggled against his hold.

Qin Jiang laughed. "I'm really not. So as the loving sister, shouldn't you pick up the slack?"

"No!"

Yu Ru shoved at him. "I'm going to check on my sister."

"No?" Qin Jiang tightened his grip, his smile turning mischievous. "Little Ru'er, you wouldn't want your sister finding out you tricked her, would you?"

Yu Ru: "???"

She gaped at him. She genuinely hadn't expected him to weaponize that against her.

Her jaw clenched. "You're absolutely shameless!"

"So—yes or no?"

He glanced meaningfully toward Yu Lan's door.

Yu Ru shot him a withering look, swatted his hand away, and sighed. "Let me check on my sister first. Then I'll come back and... feed you. Deal?"

"Deal."

Qin Jiang beamed. He released her.

She glared daggers at him one more time, then went to see Yu Lan. It wasn't long before she re-emerged.

Qin Jiang raised a brow. "That was fast. Eager, are we?"

"You—!!!"

She fumed, adorably bristling. "Do you want this or not? Because I can leave!"

"Want it. Absolutely want it!"
