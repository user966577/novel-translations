Qin Jiang's sudden ferocity caught the woman off guard. "Are you threatening me?"

"Yes!" He nodded. "What are you gonna do about it?"

"I..." She glared at him. She'd never suffered this kind of indignity while alive, and here she was, tens of thousands of years dead, being bullied by some punk. And she couldn't do a thing about it.

In the end, she reluctantly produced her treasure. "Fine—take it."

A streak of light appeared before Qin Jiang. What she'd thrown out was a heart—and it was still beating faintly. Dense sword energy pulsed through it.

"What is this?"

"My Sword Heart. Before I died, I condensed all my sword comprehension and power into this. Anyone who refines it will achieve Sword Heart."

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up as he took hold of it. "Excellent."

The woman pouted. It was the culmination of her entire existence—of course it was excellent.

Qin Jiang noticed her ghostly form flickering, growing more transparent. "Your remnant consciousness—it's sustained by the Sword Heart?"

"Yes. Without it, I would have faded long ago."

"Without the Sword Heart to anchor you, how long do you have?"

"I'm already dead. Just a wisp of consciousness—when it's gone, it's gone." She was surprisingly nonchalant about it. "And it's not just me. Once you take the Sword Heart, Sword Valley itself will gradually collapse."

Sword Valley's power was drawn from the Sword Heart. Without it, the valley would cease to exist.

Qin Jiang didn't care about Sword Valley—but letting such a beautiful woman fade away seemed like a terrible waste. He paused, then asked, "Do you want to live?"

"What do you think?" She rolled her eyes. "Nobody who's alive actually wants to be dead."

"I might have a way to bring you back."

The woman's eyes brightened, then narrowed with suspicion. "I'm just a wisp of consciousness. Not even a proper soul. You can resurrect that?"

"Want to give it a try?"

As he spoke, Qin Jiang produced a painted scroll—the Seven Beauties Painting. This item was extraordinary: it could restore any woman who met its requirements to her peak state, regardless of whether she was a soul, a corpse, or anything in between—and elevate her to the Supreme Realm. Moreover, as one of the Seven Beauties, she'd be bound to Qin Jiang's life force. Even if destroyed to the point of total soul dispersal, she could be revived as long as he lived.

The only limitation was that it could hold a maximum of seven women. So far, only Yan Shiya had been inducted. She spent most of her time inside the painting and had already reached the Fifth Tribulation Supreme.

"What's that?" The woman peered at the scroll curiously.

Qin Jiang unfurled the Seven Beauties Painting. "A treasure that might be able to bring you back." He wasn't certain it would work—she was merely a wisp of consciousness, and she'd been a Great Emperor in life, far beyond the painting's normal capacity.

"That woman inside... she's gorgeous," the founder remarked, spotting Yan Shiya's figure in the painting.

Qin Jiang smiled but didn't explain. Better to get her in first and sort out the details later.

"This painting can really revive me?" she asked.

"I'm not a hundred percent sure, but there's a chance. You're already dead—might as well try."

"Fair point." She nodded. "How does it work?"

"Don't resist. There's a pocket dimension inside the painting with a special environment. Regardless of whether you're a soul or a body, once inside, you can be restored to your peak. But since you're only a wisp of consciousness, I can't guarantee success."

"That powerful?" If what Qin Jiang described was true, it really might work.

"Don't resist. I'm going to start."

"Wait." She looked at him hesitantly. "My Sword Heart..."

"What about it?"

"I mean—if you can't use it, would you give it to a Holy Sword Sect disciple?"

Qin Jiang laughed. "I already told you, that was always the plan. And I've already picked the person. Don't worry."

"You're really going to give it to the sect?" she asked in surprise.

He nodded. "Of course. One of my women is the Sect Master's daughter, and another is the sect's Saintess from six thousand years ago. When you think about it, I'm practically part of the Holy Sword Sect myself."

The woman: "..."

Something didn't add up. "The Sect Master's daughter, fine—but a Saintess from six thousand years ago?" She eyed him strangely. "You can't be very old."

"Eighteen!"

"Then a six-thousand-year-old Saintess would be at least..."

"Please." Qin Jiang waved dismissively. "True love transcends age."

The woman rolled her eyes. "I may not know you well, but I'm sure that Saintess must be beautiful. Anyone who's survived six thousand years is at least a Supreme, and Supremes stay young forever."

"Astute observation." Qin Jiang nodded approvingly. "My wife is indeed gorgeous."

The woman chuckled—she'd never met a man who bragged about his wife this openly. But then her smile froze, as if a thought had struck her. She eyed him with sudden suspicion.

"You're going through all this trouble to revive me because..."

"You guessed it." Before she could finish, Qin Jiang flashed her a grin, his eyes roaming appreciatively. "You're stunning. On par with my wife."

Her eyes went wide. "I'm tens of thousands of years old! You'd really...?"

Looking at her pouty lips, her figure, her legs... Qin Jiang nodded earnestly. "I have zero problems with that."

The woman: "..."

'Well, I have problems!'

"Do you want to live or not?" Qin Jiang asked.

She hesitated. She really didn't want to die. She studied the young man before her—handsome, she had to admit. She wouldn't exactly be losing out. She nodded, a smile tugging at her lips. "Fine. Revive me, and I'll be your woman."

Though what she was actually thinking was: once revived, she'd teach this little rogue a lesson first. Whether she'd actually become his woman... well, that depended on his performance. For a handsome young man like him, she could lower her standards. Just a tiny bit.

Lucky him!
