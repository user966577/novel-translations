After giving Jian Yao the Immortal Path Law, Qin Jiang played with her for a while before she returned to the Seven Beauties Painting. She would spend the coming days refining the law and preparing to break through to the immortal path.

Before putting the painting away, Qin Jiang channeled a portion of the Immortal Marrow's energy into it. The Immortal Qi it produced might accelerate Jian Yao's breakthrough. Then he tucked the painting away and headed back to the Void Divine Temple.

Life in the temple was blissful chaos—the kind of soul-stirring indulgence that Qin Jiang never tired of.

Outside the Qin Domain, the ancient clans' plan was already in motion. Of the ten Great Emperor Laws Qin Jiang had distributed, one went to Qin Hao. The remaining nine went to the ancestors—seven to the half-Emperors, who could break through immediately upon absorption, and two to Nine Tribulations Supremes, who still needed time to fully refine them.

The seven half-Emperor ancestors wasted no time. One after another, they shattered through the barrier to Great Emperor.

The first breakthrough sent shockwaves through the continent. The ancient clans, who had just finished coordinating their attack, were forced to halt and reassess. One more Emperor they could perhaps handle.

Then a second aura erupted. And a third.

By the time the seventh new Emperor emerged, the eighteen ancient clans had abandoned their ambitions entirely. Their seventy percent of pooled reserves? Those would be repurposed as gifts—or more accurately, apology offerings. Fourteen Great Emperors was a force no coalition could challenge. The clans scattered to their homes, bitter but alive.

Back at the Qin estate, the women had all come out of the Void Divine Temple to watch the spectacle. Liu Shuwan stood at Qin Jiang's side, staring at the parade of newly ascended Emperors with her jaw hanging open.

"Your family... mass-produces Great Emperors?" she couldn't help blurting.

Qin Jiang wrapped an arm around her waist and shrugged. "The ancestors just work really hard."

Liu Shuwan rolled her eyes. Knowing the Qin family as she did, the real reason behind this avalanche of Emperors was almost certainly Qin Jiang himself. The way the ancestors deferred to him told her everything she needed to know.

"Including you, the Qin family has fourteen Great Emperors now," Qin Jiang said with a grin.

Liu Shuwan smiled, pleased that he counted her as part of the family. But then she tilted her head, blinking up at him.

"Fourteen? Shouldn't it be fifteen? Are you forgetting Yao Yao?"

She meant Jian Yao. The founder materialized from the painting almost every day. Though she could only stay for a couple of hours at a time, all the women had grown familiar with her. Liu Shuwan knew her full history—technically, Jian Yao could be considered Liu Shuwan's own ancestral grandmother from the Holy Sword Sect.

She was also the only woman among Qin Jiang's who could hold a candle to Liu Shuwan herself. In the cafeteria department, Jian Yao's... portions were truly generous. Liu Shuwan had already decided that if she ever had children, she'd let Yao Yao help with the nursing—the babies would never go hungry.

The other women, Ye Ling'er included, had entertained similar thoughts. Jian Yao's generous figure was the envy of every woman present, especially given how unabashedly Qin Jiang appreciated it.

"Yao Yao, huh." Qin Jiang smiled. "She won't be a Great Emperor for much longer."

"Hm?"

"You haven't seen her lately, have you? She's in seclusion. The next time she appears..." His eyes glinted. "She'll be on the immortal path."
