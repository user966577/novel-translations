Under the Demon Hall Founder's coquettish pleading, Qin Jiang eventually gave in and satisfied her request.

However, he didn't have her seal removed afterward. This was only the beginning—he needed to observe her for a while longer. After all, she was a grand demoness.

The matter of the Demon Hall Founder was settled for now. As for Long Yu, there was no longer any reason to keep him around. With Jian Yao and the Demon Hall Founder at his side, Qin Jiang had no intention of lingering on the Divine Dragon Continent. It was time to visit the Nine Heavens.

At the frontier.

This time, Long Yu had sought out other generals. He clearly wasn't planning to act alone again. By joining forces with other powerhouses, no matter what tricks the demonic cultivators pulled, they could be easily suppressed. The only downside was splitting the military credit—but that didn't matter. Anything was better than coming away empty-handed.

The problem was that Long Yu's reputation at the frontier had already soured. Every person he approached refused without exception. Both of his previous operations had ended in near-total annihilation—who in their right mind would partner with him?

Left with no choice, Long Yu went directly to the frontier's Commander-in-Chief. Prince or not, the Commander still had to show him some face. After hearing the request, the Commander frowned. "You can really find the Demon Hall's people?"

"Yes!" Long Yu answered without hesitation. "Both previous times, I located the Demon Hall. My forces were simply too weak, which led to the failures. But if I combine forces with other generals, I can absolutely wipe them out!"

The Commander stroked his chin. Long Yu had a point—no one else could even find the Demon Hall's whereabouts, yet Long Yu managed it with ease. His only problem was insufficient strength. Besides, the Dragon Emperor had been pushing hard for results. He really did need to act soon.

Looking at Long Yu, the Commander calculated his odds. If the operation succeeded, he could claim most of the credit. If it failed, he'd pin everything on Long Yu. Either way, he couldn't lose.

Having made up his mind, he pretended to deliberate before nodding reluctantly. "Very well. I'll assign several generals to accompany you. I trust you can find the Demon Hall's people."

Long Yu's spirits soared. "I have special methods—finding them will be effortless!"

"Let's hope so."

Half a day later, Long Yu led the assembled generals to the meeting point he'd arranged with the Demon Hall's powerhouses. Surveying the formidable force behind him, he nodded in satisfaction. 'This time, let's see how you escape!'

The location was a mountain valley. Long Yu assessed the terrain, then turned to the generals. "They're inside the valley. Have your men surround it completely—don't let a single one escape!"

Most of the generals were reluctant to follow his orders, but the Commander had already decreed they must obey Long Yu's command. Grudgingly, they began deploying their troops.

Just as the soldiers finished encircling the valley, figures burst from within, launching a vicious assault on the surrounding troops. Caught completely off guard, the soldiers suffered devastating losses. At the same time, a sinister cackle rang out.

"Hehehe, Holy Son, your tactic of splitting forces is simply brilliant! Picking them off one by one is so much easier."

Long Yu's expression changed drastically. That bastard had just called out his identity in front of everyone!

Beside him, the generals' faces darkened. Holy Son? Were they addressing the Ninth Prince? All eyes turned to Long Yu.

Long Yu forced himself to remain calm, his face settling into a cold mask. He swept the others with an icy glare. "What are you looking at me for? You actually believe them?"

Everyone paused. He had a point—why would they trust the enemy's words?

But then the voice rang out again. "Oh, my apologies for accidentally revealing the Holy Son's identity. But don't worry, Holy Son—based on the intelligence you provided, we've arranged more than enough forces. Not a single one of them will escape!"

As the words faded, more figures emerged from the shadows beyond the valley, executing a perfect counter-encirclement. Among them, several terrifying auras made the generals' faces turn ashen. This was clearly a premeditated ambush.

They turned to Long Yu again, voices trembling with rage. "Ninth Prince—care to explain?!"

Long Yu's face was thunderous. Those damned demonic cultivators had known his every move! His expression flickered between fury and calculation. Now it was clear—the only way to shake off suspicion was to kill everyone here. If word reached the Dragon Emperor, his father would investigate, and Long Yu had zero confidence he could survive that scrutiny.

His features twisted into something savage.

He struck without warning. Demonic qi erupted as he blasted a hole clean through one general's chest. The others recoiled in shock. The remaining generals went pale—the Ninth Prince really was a demonic cultivator!

"Break through!" someone shouted.

The generals rallied their troops, fighting off the Demon Hall's assault while attempting to flee. Yet among all combatants, the most vicious by far was Long Yu alone. The other Demon Hall cultivators were barely trying—putting on a grand show with little substance behind it.

Long Yu noticed this and roared in fury. "Go all out! Don't let a single one escape!"

No one listened. Word had come down from the Demon Hall's upper echelon—Long Yu was expendable. This entire operation existed solely to expose his identity. They wouldn't kill Long Yu themselves. They'd let the Dragon Emperor handle that.

The generals fought desperately to break free, never realizing that the Demon Hall's resistance was deliberately half-hearted. Even so, their losses were significant. A full hour passed before they finally broke through, the main frontier army within sight. The Demon Hall's forces halted their pursuit simultaneously.

Long Yu stood trembling with rage, glaring back at them. "Why?! Why did you betray me?!"

By now, even he understood. From the very beginning, these Demon Hall bastards had been playing him. Now that he'd served his purpose, they'd tossed him aside like garbage.

The Demon Hall cultivators responded with sneering contempt, looking at Long Yu as though he were an insect. 'Just a pawn, and he actually thought he was a Holy Son?'

The Demon Lord stepped forward, all pretense of deference gone, replaced by undisguised arrogance. His aura—Saint Realm Great Perfection—bore down on Long Yu so heavily the prince nearly buckled to his knees.

Long Yu clenched his teeth, staring down the assembled demonic powerhouses. In the end, he swallowed his rage.

"Endure," he muttered. "I have to endure."
