"???"

Hearing those impassioned cries, Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming stared in bewilderment. They'd only looked at her. Since when did that count as assault? And given this woman's power, could they even touch her if they wanted to?

Wait—something was wrong. Her aura had suddenly dropped to the Saint Realm, and her subordinates' energy signatures had weakened dramatically at the same time. Chen Qi'er was thoroughly confused. What kind of move was this?

Above, Qin Jiang and the others had emerged because Qing Chan sensed a powerful aura—possibly True Immortal level. But the moment they flew out, the first thing they noticed was Chen Qi'er's presence.

"That aura disappeared," Qing Chan said, brow furrowed.

Everyone looked toward Chen Qi'er. They'd all heard the frantic shouts from the woman in white's subordinates—someone assaulting a young woman, right here at the Human Dao Sect?

"Wait, isn't that Baizhe's brother?"

All eyes turned to Baizhe. She stared at Chen Qi'er with a tightly knit brow, her heart heavy with disappointment. He'd become this kind of person—trying to force himself on an innocent woman.

Qin Jiang took her hand, his eyes narrowing slightly. His attention, however, was fixed on the woman in white. She looked familiar. He'd seen someone similar in the century-long trajectory the system had once revealed. He closed his eyes briefly, searching through his memories.

He found her: a figure strikingly similar to the woman in white, though more mature, more coldly beautiful, and exponentially more powerful. By comparison, this girl seemed almost girlish, with only Saint Realm cultivation.

Opening his eyes, he studied her carefully—and noticed she was studying him right back. 'Interesting,' he thought.

He turned to the women with a smile. "Shall we go take a look?"

They nodded in unison. As fellow women, seeing another girl in danger naturally roused their indignation. In a flash, they appeared before the woman in white.

"Miss, are you alright?" Qin Jiang asked.

The woman shook her head. Her gaze lingered on Qing Chan for a beat, then shifted to Qin Jiang. "Thank you for saving me, young sir."

Her subordinates looked at Qin Jiang with genuine excitement—they'd finally gotten eyes on their target. "Young sir, we can't thank you enough! If you hadn't stepped in, our lady would've..." 'Our lady would've killed us.' Outwardly, their gratitude was heartfelt—and in truth, it was. They gushed with a fervor that bordered on excessive.

On the other side, Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming looked distinctly uncomfortable. Chen Qi'er's sharp instincts had caught something—the way this woman looked at Qin Jiang was off. Chen Wuming, meanwhile, was simply terrified he'd be executed as an assailant.

Then Qin Jiang glanced their way. Black Dragon had already reported in: Chen Wuming was thoroughly bamboozled, serving as an unwitting mole inside Chen Qi'er's camp. Being a Child of Destiny, the truth might dawn on him eventually—but for now, he was still a useful piece on the board. A small piece, given his pathetic cultivation. Unlike Chen Qi'er, whose every disrupted plotline generated substantial system rewards.

Just days ago, when Chen Qi'er had completely severed ties with Baizhe, the system had awarded an Immortal Path Law. A pure, universal law that could adapt to anyone who refined it—just like the one Jian Yao had absorbed, which had automatically converted into a Sword Dao Law. Qin Jiang didn't need it himself; the Space-Time Law and Reincarnation Law were more than sufficient. So he'd given it straight to Zi Fu, who had been overjoyed—so overjoyed, in fact, that she'd treated him to a full day of personal attention using the Snake Race's secret arts.

While his mind wandered, the women had turned murderous eyes on Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming. Degenerates deserved death. But remembering that Chen Qi'er was Baizhe's brother, they looked to her for guidance.

Baizhe's expression was perfectly flat, her heart hardened with thorough disappointment. "I have no relationship with him."

The words struck Chen Qi'er like a physical blow. Last time, he had been the one to say those exact words. Now they came from Baizhe's mouth, aimed at him. He stared at her, but she barely spared him a glance—no anger, no sadness, nothing. Then she looked at Qin Jiang, and her face softened into a tenderness that made Chen Qi'er's blood boil with jealousy. His fists clenched white.

Qin Jiang snapped out of his thoughts. Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming held little interest for him right now. His focus was on the woman in white. "Miss, what would you like done with these two?"

The woman in white frowned. By her nature, these two would be flayed alive for daring to ogle her. But she was playing the role of a sheltered young lady. She couldn't be too vicious. "They didn't actually do anything to me..." she said timidly.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. That personality didn't match the figure from his visions at all. Maybe she was only related to that person. Or maybe she just looked similar. Then again, she could be that person in disguise—but why?

After one long, searching look, he turned to Qing Chan. "Chan'er, give them a lesson."

"Gladly." Qing Chan rolled up her sleeves and cracked her knuckles, an eerie grin spreading across her face. Punishing degenerates? She had just the thing.

Enormous power surged from her as she stalked forward. Chen Qi'er's expression darkened—at his current level, he was no match for a True Immortal. As for Chen Wuming, completely useless. Chen Qi'er braced himself, barely withstanding the pressure while Chen Wuming cowered behind him, trembling.

Thirty feet away, Qing Chan stopped. She extended one hand, and an overwhelming force seized both of them, locking their bodies rigid. The pressure was suffocating. Chen Qi'er gasped, eyes bloodshot, on the verge of fighting for his life—

Then the pressure vanished. But before he could react, every ounce of it concentrated on one very specific target.

"AAAAAAGH!"

Agonized screams tore through the air. Blood flowed freely as both men convulsed in agony.

Crushed. She'd crushed them.

Their bodies shuddered, wracked by searing pain and a wave of soul-deep humiliation that nearly dragged them into unconsciousness. From this moment forward, they could hardly be called men.
