"Your turn. Hand over the ring."

Qin Jiang spoke.

Xiao Fan clenched his teeth, his eyes fixed on Ye Ling'er aboard the palace-carriage. His chest heaved as the fury in his heart threatened to drown him.

Xiao An sighed softly.

"Fan'er, just give him the ring."

When he'd learned of Ye Ling'er's identity, a glimmer of hope had risen in his heart. But he never expected the mighty ancient Ye clan to capitulate so easily.

This alone showed how formidable the Qin family truly was.

His Xiao family was merely a vassal. They couldn't resist.

Xiao Fan's heart burned with unwillingness, but his father's voice restored some of his rationality. He looked at the ring, reluctance filling his eyes.

Finally, he closed his eyes and flung it toward Qin Jiang.

Black Dragon stepped forward. With a wave of his hand, he caught the ring. After inspecting it briefly, he handed it to Qin Jiang.

As Qin Jiang examined the ring, the system's voice echoed in his mind.

*[Host has altered a major plot point!*

*Rewards: Villain Points; Hidden Divine Body awakened; Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood; One bottle of Marrow Cleansing Pills*

*System Shop now available. Villain Points can be used to purchase items in the System Shop.]*

Qin Jiang's eyes flashed.

His consciousness entered a space—the system space. It was incredibly vast. Before him floated a golden pearl and a jade bottle.

The Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood and the Marrow Cleansing Pills.

Beyond that...

"Hidden Divine Body? System, I have a hidden Divine Body?"

Qin Jiang asked in surprise.

He already possessed a Divine Body—the innate Immaculate Divine Body. It made his cultivation speed far surpass ordinary people, and he had no bottlenecks whatsoever.

As long as he had enough spiritual energy, he could continue breaking through indefinitely.

Such a Divine Body was extraordinarily powerful.

It was precisely because of this that he'd been named the Qin family's young master from the moment of his birth—the future heir of the Qin family. No one had objected.

Everyone understood how terrifying the Immaculate Divine Body was.

And yet...

He had a hidden Divine Body as well?

*[Do not doubt. The system makes no errors!]*

The system's response was definitive.

Joy welled up in Qin Jiang's heart. The Immaculate Divine Body alone was already immensely powerful. If he had another one on top of that...

Wouldn't he be invincible?

"What is my hidden Divine Body?"

Qin Jiang asked.

However, the system didn't respond again. Qin Jiang didn't press further—he'd find out once it awakened.

His consciousness returned to reality. He looked down below.

After a moment of contemplation, he muttered, "I still feel like my sister got the short end of the stick."

Nearby, Ye Ling'er heard his murmuring. Her small fists clenched slightly as nervousness rose within her. The Xiao family had already lost all face.

If Qin Jiang made another move, the Xiao family might lose more than just their dignity.

She looked pleadingly at Ye Kuan, hoping he would intercede on the Xiao family's behalf.

But Ye Kuan acted as if he hadn't noticed her gaze. He truly didn't dare say anything more. The moment he'd stepped onto the palace-carriage, he'd sensed multiple auras no weaker than his own locking onto him.

If he made any sudden moves, those presences could tear him apart in an instant.

Moreover, he didn't believe there weren't even stronger people hidden in the shadows.

"Forget it, forget it."

Qin Jiang shook his head.

"Black Dragon, throw a slap to vent some frustration. Don't hurt anyone—just demolish the Xiao estate."

With that, he returned to the interior of the palace-carriage.

A quarter hour later.

The Xiao family members stood amidst the rubble, watching the palace-carriage disappear into the distance. Their eyes glistened with tears, their bodies trembling with rage.

"Bastards! Animals!"

"My home... all gone... there was tiger bone wine I was brewing in there..."

"It's all gone... everything's gone..."

Many Xiao family members collapsed to the ground, their hearts aching at the sight of their demolished home.

Xiao An's face was bitter. Who could have imagined that Qin Jiang would order the destruction of the Xiao estate at the very end? At least no one was hurt.

He let out a weary sigh.

"Stop wailing, all of you. Dig out anything useful from the rubble. We need to rebuild."

As patriarch, he still commanded some respect.

The group sighed and began cleaning up the mess.

Xiao Fan kept staring in the direction Qin Jiang had departed. His eyes had lost focus, as if he'd gone mad. A faint ache spread through his heart—he felt as though the most important things in his life were slipping away from him.

---

Inside the palace-carriage.

Qin Lian'er threw herself into Qin Jiang's arms.

"Brother, you're the best!"

Qin Jiang smiled and ruffled her hair affectionately.

"There, there. No more engagement to tie you down. My little Lian'er is free now."

"Hehe!"

Qin Lian'er giggled.

Her pretty face was full of joy. Ever since the engagement had been announced, she hadn't been happy. Now that stupid engagement was finally broken.

The siblings chatted and laughed together.

Before long, they arrived back at the Qin family estate.

Qin Jiang instructed Black Dragon to arrange accommodations for Ye Kuan and Ye Ling'er, then headed toward his own residence. Behind him, Qin Lian'er followed like a little tail.

Before they reached the residence...

Qin Jiang spotted an elderly man sitting boldly at the entrance.

"Brother, it's Grandfather."

Qin Lian'er whispered.

She hid behind Qin Jiang, feeling a bit guilty. They hadn't informed the old man about breaking off the engagement.

But now, he'd clearly received the news.

Qin Jiang took a deep breath and glanced at the nervous Qin Lian'er.

"Don't worry. Your brother's got this!"

With that, he put on a brilliant smile and strode up to the old man.

"Hehe, Grandfather! Enjoying the sun?"

At his words, the old man's beard quivered. He let out an angry snort.

"Enjoying the sun? Hmph! If you don't explain yourself today, I'll make sure you're enjoying the sun for an entire year!"

"Uh..."

Qin Jiang scratched his head, feeling a headache coming on. Sure enough, the old man was here to call him to account.

His eyes darted around, but before he could speak, the old man cut him off.

"Don't even think about trying to fool me. I know everything you did today!"

Seeing his escape route blocked, Qin Jiang spread his hands helplessly. He looked at Qin Lian'er.

"Lian'er, go wait for me inside. I need to have a few rounds with Grandfather."

"Okay."

Qin Lian'er nodded.

She obediently circled around the two of them, making a face at their grandfather's back as she passed.

The old man's eyes narrowed. He watched Qin Jiang, a dangerous glint in his gaze.

Once Qin Lian'er had entered the residence, Qin Jiang straightened his back and faced the old man directly.

"I did nothing wrong!"

"Oh really?"

The old man laughed coldly. He slowly drew his belt.

"You did nothing wrong?"

Qin Jiang's eyelid twitched. He hastily retreated two steps.

"Old man, what are you doing?"

"You little brat, what did you just call me? Getting rebellious now, are we?"

The old man's eyes bulged. He swung his belt at Qin Jiang, the motion creating a whooshing sound as it cut through the air.

Qin Jiang barely dodged. He couldn't help but shout, "Old man, are you trying to murder your own grandson?"

"Today I really am going to beat this unfilial grandson to death!"

"Holy sh—!"

The old man was serious. Qin Jiang's eyelids jumped wildly. Without hesitation, he bolted toward the back mountain.

"Great-grandfather! Great-great-grandfather! Ancestors! Save me!"
