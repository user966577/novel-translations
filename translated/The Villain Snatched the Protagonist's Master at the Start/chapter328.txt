Exactly as Xue Mei predicted, they "rested" for three full days. Only the press of business cut it short — otherwise, who knew how long it would have gone on.

Qin Jiang's expression said unfinished business. The four women converged on him, each offering a kiss to placate him. Only then was he satisfied.

"All right, I need to prepare," Xue Mei said, now fully dressed. She helped Qin Jiang with his clothes, kissed him once more, and continued, "It'll take a few days. You should visit the Snake Race in the meantime — Yu Lan and Yu Ru have been missing you."

He nodded. He genuinely did miss the two sisters. It had been a long time.

"You get ready. We'll head to the Snake Race."

He held Xue Mei close one last time — her body was the softest of all his women, and holding her was genuinely blissful.

She straightened his collar, kissed his lips, and saw them off. "I'll send word when everything's ready."

Xiao Jiu stayed behind — it was her home, after all.

At the Snake Race, An Xihe's breakthrough had sent shockwaves through the Demon Domain. The old Wolf King had fallen, and the region was unsettled. The Snake Race remained relatively calm, though, with its four Human Immortal ancestors showing themselves to deter would-be aggressors.

But they had a problem of their own: Zi Fu, who'd supposedly been in seclusion to attempt the immortal path, had vanished without a trace. Her three teachers were frantic. Zi Fu was the Snake Race's greatest talent — a guaranteed future Human Immortal, possibly even True Immortal material. Their hope for the future, gone.

Yu Lan knew, of course. She'd dispatched search parties, but deep down, she suspected Qin Jiang. She'd mentioned Zi Fu to him before, and knowing his nature, he'd absolutely have been interested. Spiriting her away on his way out wasn't beyond him.

If that was the case, at least Zi Fu was safe. A beauty like that, Qin Jiang would never harm. In all likelihood, she'd already been claimed.

In the great hall, Yu Lan was managing clan affairs — the Demon Domain had been chaotic lately, and the workload had eaten into her cultivation time. The four ancestors entered.

"Clan Chief, any word on Zi Fu?"

They asked this several times a day. Yu Lan shook her head. "Nothing yet. But her soul lamp is intact, so she's in no danger. Perhaps when she returns, she'll already be on the immortal path."

The three teachers weren't reassured. "It's not her safety we're worried about. Zi Fu's always lived within the Snake Race. She's sheltered, naive — she's never seen the world. If she's out there among humans, and they're full of tricks. With her beauty, if some smooth-talking rogue got to her..."

They dreaded the thought of their precious little cabbage being uprooted by some wild boar. And the probability was distressingly high. Yu Lan was hailed as the Demon Domain's greatest beauty, and Zi Fu was every bit her equal — just less known, having never sought the public eye.

Yu Lan pictured Qin Jiang's face. If anyone was going to sweet-talk Zi Fu...

A familiar presence interrupted her thoughts. Her eyes lit up and she was on her feet instantly, looking toward the hall entrance.

There stood Qin Jiang, smiling warmly. Yu Ru clung to his arm — she'd found him first and, after nearly tackling him and kissing him senseless, had dragged him here.

Yu Lan flew across the hall and threw herself into his arms. He caught her, felt her longing, and kissed her deeply. She responded with matching fervor.

The four ancestors stood to one side, forgotten, exchanging bewildered glances.

Eventually Yu Lan pulled away, slightly breathless, and settled against his chest. Qin Jiang looked past her to the four ancestors.

"I overheard your discussion about the former clan chief?"

Yu Lan remembered they weren't alone and flushed. Still leaning against him, she explained, "I mentioned her before — our strongest talent. But she's not actually in seclusion..." She watched his expression carefully.

His eyebrow lifted. "Zi Fu?"

"You've met her?" The three teachers leaped on the question.

Yu Lan didn't need to ask. That look on his face told her everything.

Qin Jiang smiled at the four ancestors. "Met her? We're very close. The kind of close where we share a bed. I know her depths, and she knows my... dimensions."

The four ancestors' faces went rigid.

Disaster.

Their fears had been realized. Their precious little cabbage had been stolen by some smooth-talking pretty boy.
