"Where are the ancestral elders?"

The commander stared at the sky in bewilderment. How had the elders vanished in the blink of an eye?

He couldn't even sense their auras anymore.

Beside him, Ye Qingtian's eyes flickered, and a vicious grin spread across his face.

With a dull thud, he drove his palm straight through the commander's chest.

"Urk..."

The commander stared at Ye Qingtian with wide, disbelieving eyes:

"You..."

"Heh. You didn't actually think I'd destroy the Ye family, did you?"

Ye Qingtian sneered.

The commander's mouth opened and closed, but no more words came. He could only cough up bloody foam as life drained from his body.

Tossing the commander aside, Ye Qingtian took a deep breath and roared:

"The operation has failed!

All forces, withdraw immediately!"

Issuing a retreat order now effectively meant telling everyone to stop resisting.

Ordinary soldiers might have refused.

But these were death soldiers—trained to obey without question. The commander was first in the chain of command; Ye Qingtian was second. With the commander unable to issue orders, Ye Qingtian's word was law.

This was a right he'd specifically negotiated.

Now it served its purpose perfectly.

Every death soldier immediately began retreating. But with Ye City already sealed, there was nowhere to go. Their formation crumbled, and from that point on, effective resistance was impossible.

They could only be hunted down by the Ye family.

"Ye Qingtian!"

Just then, a furious shout heralded Ye Lingtian's appearance before his brother.

Aura surging, he pointed at Ye Qingtian:

"This time, there's nowhere to run!"

Ye Qingtian responded with a faint smile:

"Run?

Why would I run?"

"Ha! After bringing such chaos to the Ye family, you think I'll let you go?"

Ye Lingtian scoffed.

He glared at Ye Qingtian, eyes full of resentment. Years ago, when Ye Qingtian had lost the bid for family head, it was Ye Lingtian himself who'd called off the pursuit.

And that very mercy had fractured the family's unity. Even now, some members still supported Ye Qingtian.

"Don't be absurd. I haven't brought any chaos to the Ye family. Without me, you think you could've killed so many enemy clan members this easily? Ha—thirty-two Supremes. They truly bled for this one."

Ye Qingtian laughed.

These were all enemies of the Ye family—major threats. This time, their core strength had been devastated. Most importantly: thirty-two Supremes!

An absolutely staggering loss.

It would take them thousands of years to recover, at minimum.

Threatening the Ye family would be out of the question.

Hearing this, Ye Lingtian frowned. He knew Qin Jiang had been cooperating with Ye Qingtian, but whether Qin Jiang had duped Ye Qingtian and the other clans, or Qin Jiang and Ye Qingtian had jointly duped the clans—that he wasn't clear on.

"Fine. Where's Qin Jiang? Bring him out. He knows everything."

Ye Qingtian said.

At that moment, Qin Jiang appeared, studying the two brothers with amusement:

"What, you two haven't started fighting yet?"

Ye Qingtian: "..."

Ye Lingtian: "..."

Both stared at Qin Jiang—one with inquiry in his eyes, the other with anticipation.

"Fine, I'll explain."

Qin Jiang raised a hand:

"This whole thing was indeed Ye Qingtian's idea. Though he left the Ye family over the family head position, he still feels a deep loyalty to the clan.

So he orchestrated all of this to take down the Ye family's enemies."

He glanced at Ye Lingtian:

"I have to say—he's better suited to be family head."

Ye Lingtian: "..."

Ye Qingtian looked smug. This time, he was the Ye family's hero!

He turned to Ye Lingtian with a grin:

"Little brother, time to step down."

Ye Lingtian's bearing weakened noticeably, but he still refused to yield.

Watching the brothers fight over a family head position like it was life or death, Qin Jiang found it somewhat baffling.

In the Qin family, the position of family head was practically a hot potato. The moment the next generation matured, the current head practically bolted for the exit.

Not an ounce of attachment.

What they pursued was strength. Being family head meant wasting too much time on administrative affairs.

Take Qin Jiang's own father—he wanted to hand the position to Qin Jiang, but the ancestral elders had flatly refused. Qin Jiang mustn't be family head. At the very least, he shouldn't waste his cultivation time on family business. So even if the title was passed to him, the drudgery would still fall on his father.

So Qin Jiang simply couldn't understand the brothers' obsession.

Of course, he knew it came down to different systems among the ancient clans. In some, a new head was only appointed when the old one died—meaning a single head might serve for ten thousand years.

In the Ye family, the head wielded enormous authority. In certain circumstances, even the ancestral elders had to obey. That was precisely why both brothers craved the position.

Qin Jiang didn't care to get involved.

After all, the Ye family's crisis was completely resolved, and they'd profited handsomely in the process.

'I wonder how much loot the teams will bring back.'

His thoughts had already drifted to the Zhao family and the other enemy clans. They might not match the Qin family in strength, but after ten thousand years of accumulation, their treasuries had to be bursting.

This was a massive haul!

---

By the next morning, Ye City had returned to normal.

Only the air remained slightly oppressive, tinged with the lingering scent of blood.

In the great hall of the Ye family estate, all the ancestral elders were present. Ye Qingtian and Ye Lingtian were still going at it.

The elders' gazes settled on Ye Qingtian:

"This was all your plan?"

"Indeed!"

Ye Qingtian lifted his chin, face radiating pride.

At this, the elders' eyes narrowed:

"Then poisoning us was also part of your plan?"

"N-no... uh..."

Ye Qingtian's expression froze as he sensed something was off. The elders' tone had taken an unfriendly turn.

After a moment's thought, he offered carefully:

"You can't catch the wolf without sacrificing the bait."

The elders' faces darkened. That poison had put them through hell.

Fortunately, the effects were only temporary weakness, and they'd mostly recovered by now.

"Using us as bait—you've got some nerve!"

"Well, to catch a big fish, you need big bait. Otherwise they won't bite."

Ye Qingtian shrugged.

The elders understood the logic, but it still stung.

After a silence, one elder spoke up:

"That Qin Jiang fellow... he said you're better suited to be family head than Lingtian?"

"He did, and I think he makes an excellent point."

Ye Qingtian nodded. He held Qin Jiang in the highest regard—had even come to see him as his only true confidant.

The elders exchanged glances. They clearly took Qin Jiang's words seriously. After all, they'd witnessed the Fourth Ancestor's power—a genuine Great Emperor!

The Qin family was one ally they absolutely needed to keep close!
