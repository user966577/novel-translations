Deep in the Ghost Fog Forest, a pitch-black great hall crouched between the mountain ridges like a slumbering beast.

Fog curled around it, threaded with faint traces of blood qi. Shadowy figures flickered through the mist.

This was Demon Hall headquarters.

Inside, disciples lined the corridors—a motley collection of bizarre figures. A few looked passably normal, though their eyes glinted with malice.

The deepest chambers housed the Demon Hall's true powerhouses. All of them Supreme Realm. To survive under the Divine Dragon Empire's constant purges, they had to be.

Today, those powerhouses had gathered.

An oppressive, graveyard-cold aura hung over the assembly like a spectral domain.

"Our outer disciples have been getting hunted down these past few days," one of them began. "Suggestions?"

They exchanged glances. Someone spoke up: "The ones doing the hunting aren't from the Divine Dragon Empire. Recently, someone crashed through the frontier and raised hell in the Imperial City—humiliated Long Aotian himself. But the imperial family did nothing in response. The reason should be obvious to everyone."

He waved his arm, and a portrait materialized—Qin Jiang's likeness.

"This man is Qin Jiang. Some of you were in seclusion and missed his arrival, so let me fill you in. He's the one who stormed the frontier and wreaked havoc in the capital. He commands as many Great Emperors as the empire itself, which is why Long Aotian doesn't dare touch him. The people hunting our members are his subordinates."

Those already familiar with Qin Jiang showed no reaction, but the ones freshly out of closed cultivation went pale. The Divine Dragon Empire alone had them struggling—now an equally powerful force was targeting them too?

"Why is he coming after us?"

The speaker shook his head. "Unknown. But he has a close relationship with the Third Princess, who's now the empire's heir. Perhaps he wants to eliminate us to consolidate her position."

The theory drew nods of agreement.

Then a detached voice drifted from nearby: "You've guessed wrong."

"Hm?" The speaker frowned. "Then what other reason could there be?"

He turned toward the voice. A white-robed middle-aged man stood there, wearing a warm smile and winking at him.

The Demon Hall powerhouse stared. Who was this? Did the Demon Hall even have anyone who looked this... normal?

"Who are you?"

Every person in the room went on alert.

The middle-aged man was, of course, Fourth Ancestor. He flashed a grin. "You were just discussing him, weren't you?"

He snatched the portrait from the air, examined it closely, and shook his head in dissatisfaction. "What kind of artist drew this? They haven't captured even a fraction of my Young Lord's handsomeness. Lucky he didn't come himself—otherwise, none of you would've survived the insult."

The Demon Hall powerhouses: "..."

The man himself was here? While they'd been plotting against him, their target had been eavesdropping this whole time.

Every face cycled through shades of purple and white. Their glares at Fourth Ancestor burned with fury. This was a humiliation beyond measure.

Just then, space split open in front of Fourth Ancestor, and Black Dragon stepped through. He bared his teeth in a wide grin at the assembled Demon Hall elite.

Fourth Ancestor smacked the back of his head. "What are you smiling about? Get to work!"

"Oh." Black Dragon rubbed his head, wiped the grin, and rearranged his features into something menacing. Fourth Ancestor had told him: in negotiations, you had to look fierce.

"Listen up, demon runts! I'm here to conscript you. Two choices. One: you volunteer to be conscripted. Two: you get beaten by Fourth Ancestor until you... volunteer to be conscripted. Pick!"

"The hell?" Fourth Ancestor's face went black. How had Xiao Jiang entrusted this blockhead with anything important?

The Demon Hall powerhouses gaped at Black Dragon in stupefied silence.

Black Dragon blinked, turned to Fourth Ancestor. "Fourth Ancestor, they don't want to be conscripted. Your turn."

"Get out of the way!" Fourth Ancestor shoved him aside in disgust. He faced the crowd. "Same two choices. Pick."

Emperor aura erupted, crashing down on everyone present. The room shuddered.

"G-Great Emperor!"

Voices trembled. Beneath a Great Emperor, all were ants. The crushing pressure left every Demon Hall powerhouse weak-kneed, on the verge of kneeling.

Fourth Ancestor smiled serenely. "Choose."

They gritted their teeth. Not one spoke. Fourth Ancestor's expression didn't change, but his aura intensified, bending them forward at the waist.

Then a gentle breeze swept through, and his Emperor aura scattered like smoke.

Fourth Ancestor's eyes sharpened. He looked ahead. In the center of the great hall hung a painting. On it, a ghostly figure shimmered with faint light.

The painting stirred. A voice laced with killing intent issued from within:

"Touch the Demon Hall, and die!"

Fourth Ancestor studied the painting and smiled. "I knew it. A mere Demon Hall couldn't possibly stand against the Divine Dragon Empire. So you've been pulling strings from the shadows."

The painting trembled violently. "You court death!"

A terrifying pressure erupted from it. Fourth Ancestor felt his body grow heavy. Even he was impressed.

"Powerful," he muttered.

But he showed no fear. Instead, he snorted with contempt. "You're sealed. Stop posturing."

The oppressive force stuttered and gradually dissipated. The painting floated forward, hovering before Fourth Ancestor.

"How did you know I was sealed?"

Fourth Ancestor's heart jolted. This little Demon Hall harbored an immortal-path powerhouse! Fortunately, she was sealed. Unable to act.

"But how did Xiao Jiang know?" he wondered.

Before coming, Qin Jiang had warned him. Without that heads-up, the pressure just now might have sent him running.

The painting quivered, as if demanding an answer. Fourth Ancestor smiled—the picture of refined composure when he wasn't being a menace.

"Nah, I'm not telling you. Come hit me if you can."

"..."

The painting froze. Every Demon Hall powerhouse's mouth twitched. A Great Emperor, and he was being this childish?
