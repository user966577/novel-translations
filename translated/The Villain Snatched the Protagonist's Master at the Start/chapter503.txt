Just as Wu Tian had expected, days of running back and forth accomplished nothing.

Even the Wu family head himself had shown up in person, and still they couldn't prove that Wu Tian was Wu Tian. They couldn't even verify their own identities.

Outside the Huaxia branch office, the group stood in silence. Finally, the Wu family head looked at Wu Tian.

"Little Tian, these resources..."

"I understand."

Wu Tian laughed bitterly.

From start to finish, the other side had never intended to hand over the resources.

"Forget the resources. I don't want them anymore," Wu Tian sighed.

The Wu family head patted his shoulder without another word.

Wu Tian opened his mouth, wanting to ask if he could continue receiving the Wu family's own resources, but seeing the family head's expression, he couldn't bring himself to ask. In the end, he decided to rescue his sister first and worry about everything else later. He'd already wasted too much time.

After some brief pleasantries, the Wu family head and the other powerhouses departed, leaving Wu Tian alone.

He stared at the Huaxia branch office, fists clenching slightly, a cold glint flashing through his eyes. A mighty Immortal Emperor, toyed with like this for the first time in his existence.

'Rescue Yingtao first. Everything else can wait.'

Wu Tian took a deep breath and murmured to himself before turning to leave.

Not far from the branch office, the airship hung suspended in midair, visible at a glance. Wu Tian knew his sister was aboard. The problem was that aside from the other powerhouses on the ship, there was supposedly an Immortal King. In his current state, he was no match for one.

He needed to be careful.

'If I sneak aboard and take Yingtao, it should work,' Wu Tian told himself.

He was still confident in his abilities. True, his current condition wasn't enough to fight an Immortal King head-on, but if he wanted to stay hidden, even an Immortal King wouldn't be able to detect him.

After steadying himself, Wu Tian concealed his presence and crept toward the airship.

At the same time, aboard the vessel, Qin Jiang's eyebrow twitched slightly, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. He'd received word the moment Wu Tian first visited the Huaxia branch office, and had been monitoring him for days.

Moreover, the Immortal King Killing Formation had long since been deployed around the perimeter. It could kill, certainly, but it could also detect Wu Tian's position with perfect clarity.

The moment Wu Tian drew near, Qin Jiang sensed him.

'Perfect opportunity to test how much strength this Immortal Emperor has left.'

Qin Jiang smiled. Standing on the airship's deck, he tracked Wu Tian's movements through the killing formation. As Wu Tian drew closer, the formation's power coalesced, growing stronger and stronger until it locked onto him completely.

At the same moment, a flash of danger shot through Wu Tian's mind. His expression changed and he snapped his head upward.

"I've been detected?"

Before the words left his mouth, a devastating wave of power crashed down upon him, engulfing him in an instant. The force was enough to slay a True Immortal—and Qin Jiang had held back, worried about killing Wu Tian outright.

The strike landed, and Wu Tian's figure simply scattered. Even the Immortal King Killing Formation lost track of him.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "Blasted him to dust?"

That didn't seem right. No matter how you looked at it, this was a former Immortal Emperor. Surely he had at least one trump card?

Right on cue, the system's voice chimed in with a batch of rewards.

Wu Tian hadn't died—but he'd been severely wounded. In that split second, he'd managed to flee.

'Impressive. Worthy of an Immortal Emperor.'

Seeing the rewards, Qin Jiang nodded with satisfaction. The haul was truly generous. And the Immortal Emperor's methods were formidable indeed. Wu Tian was only a Saint Realm cultivator now, yet a strike powerful enough to slay True Immortals had merely left him severely wounded, and he'd still escaped.

"What happened?"

An Xihe and the others appeared at Qin Jiang's side, concern in their voices.

Qin Jiang smiled casually. "Nothing. A fly tried to sneak aboard. I've dealt with it."

That single strike had given Qin Jiang a solid read on Wu Tian's strength. An attack capable of killing True Immortals could severely wound him—which meant his combat power fell short of An Xihe's, to say nothing of the Immortal King Killing Formation. At full power, that formation could slay Immortal Kings.

With that confirmed, Qin Jiang could relax. He could toy with Wu Tian at his leisure.

Hearing his explanation, the women didn't press further. Problem solved was problem solved. They turned their gazes on Qin Jiang, eyes glimmering. It had been many days since their last group training session, and by now, nearly all of them were back at peak condition. Plus, they had a powerful new addition.

It was about time for another session.

An Xihe sidled up and hooked her arm through Qin Jiang's, her posture alluringly soft. "Qin Jiang, isn't it about time you let us see what little sister Yingtao can do?"

"None of you are tired?"

Qin Jiang swept his gaze around the group. These past few days he really hadn't pushed them much, and it seemed they'd all recovered nicely.

Seeing them nod in unison, a smile spread across Qin Jiang's face. "In that case, it really is time to show you Yingtao's strength. But don't go thinking that just because you have Yingtao, you can beat me."

"Hmph. Don't be so sure," the women snorted.

An Xihe turned to Wu Yingtao with a gentle smile. "Little sister Yingtao, give it everything you've got this time."

"Mm~"

Wu Yingtao's cheeks flushed pink. She nodded, her gaze toward Qin Jiang carrying a trace of shyness. She'd never joined the other sisters for one of these sessions before, but she was genuinely looking forward to it. It was bound to be thrilling.

Qin Jiang stretched out his arms, pulling women close on both sides, and lifted his chin with a grin. "Let's go!"

The group returned inside the airship, and under Qin Jiang's lead, began their training session.

Meanwhile, in a dense forest far away, Wu Tian lay on the ground, his body a bloody mess. If not for the faint rise and fall of his chest, one might have thought him dead.

He lay there for an indeterminate time before his eyelids finally flickered. It took a long while for him to pry his eyes open, and he gasped desperately for air.

Above him, moonlight spilled down from the night sky, flowing steadily into his body. Wu Tian's injuries were actually healing at a rapid pace. By the next day, his wounds had mostly recovered on the surface.

He hauled himself to his feet, swaying slightly. Bracing against a tree trunk, he straightened up, his face frighteningly pale.

Wu Tian looked up. The airship was still visible. He hadn't fled very far, and fortunately, they hadn't pursued him. In his current state, the outcome would have been uncertain at best.

'Was that the Immortal King's power?'

He murmured to himself. That strike had been immensely powerful—a True Immortal would have been annihilated outright. He'd been lucky to escape in that split second. Though the shockwave had still caught him, at least he'd survived.

But still...

'They detected me.'

He frowned, the confidence gone from his eyes. He'd assumed his abilities would keep him hidden even from an Immortal King.

He'd been wrong.
