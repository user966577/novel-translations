Qin Jiang joining the anti-Huaxia alliance meant the women came along. They'd considered disguises, but Yue Weiwei waved the idea off — the alliance's strongest members were only Great Emperors. They couldn't possibly recognize beings this far above their level.

On the road, Qin Jiang walked with women on each arm and still couldn't attend to them all. Nangong Yun trailed alongside, eyes burning with resentment toward Qin Jiang and sympathy for Yue Weiwei. All these women around this man — Senior Sister would surely be mistreated. They'd probably bully her.

His heart ached, but he had no power to change anything. For now, she'd have to endure.

"That abandoned compound up ahead — it's where we agreed to regroup," Nangong Yun said, drawing a steadying breath. He pointed to a derelict courtyard. Before the rescue attempt, he and the two Great Emperors had designated it as their rally point after a clean extraction.

He quickened his pace, reached the gate, and pushed it open.

Then froze.

A beat of stunned silence — then his aura erupted, and he roared: "Who?! Who killed my brothers?!"

He charged in. Two corpses lay inside, long since devoid of life. Nangong Yun dropped to his knees before them, fists hammering the earth, eyes crimson with fury. His aura surged and roiled — and even seemed to be... climbing.

Classic Child of Destiny behavior. Sacrifice friends and family, and power becomes infinite.

Behind him, Yue Weiwei saw the bodies. The two Great Emperors from the alliance. Both dead.

She looked at Qin Jiang. He gave her a small smile and a wink. Of course it was him.

Three Great Emperors in the alliance, counting herself. Now two were gone, leaving only her — and her heart hadn't been in the alliance for some time. She was Huaxia's lord's woman now.

Standing at the gate, she felt nothing for the two fallen Emperors. She simply didn't know them well.

There were only two people in the entire alliance she cared about. One was Nangong Yun, her junior brother. The other was a woman — someone they'd found on the road, fleeing an arranged marriage. She'd been on the verge of being dragged back and forced to wed a man she despised.

Nangong Yun, his sense of justice overflowing, had immediately begged Yue Weiwei to intervene. She'd confronted the pursuers and driven them off. The grateful woman had stayed with them ever since, even remaining when they founded the anti-Huaxia alliance. Just as recklessly brave as Weiwei herself.

Thinking of that woman, Weiwei glanced at Qin Jiang. She'd come to know him well these past few days — the man couldn't walk past a beautiful woman without his legs locking up. And that woman was indeed beautiful.

When they reached the alliance's base, Qin Jiang would almost certainly make a move. The thing was, the woman seemed to have a soft spot for Nangong Yun — probably gratitude for the rescue. Never mind that Yue Weiwei had been the one who actually fought. Nangong Yun had only said a few words, yet somehow received all the credit.

She shook her head. Not her problem anymore. Qin Jiang would sort it out.

Noticing her glance, Qin Jiang smiled, pulled her close by the waist, and murmured into her ear: "Thinking about it again?"

"I am not!" She shot him a look, then stole a glance at the raging Nangong Yun before lowering her voice. "There's another beauty in our alliance, you know. I'm sure you're aware."

"Naturally." His eyebrow quirked, and he nodded with a grin.

She knew that look. He was going to make his move.

"Is that why you wanted to visit the alliance? For her?"

"Partly."

"Want my help?" She jutted her chin toward Nangong Yun and whispered. "This beauty has a thing for my junior brother. Think you can handle it?"

"Weiwei doubts my abilities?"

"No. But she has genuine feelings for him, and she's always asking me about him. She only held back because he was busy chasing me. Now that I'm yours, once she finds out, she'll definitely act. I'm warning you — her personality is bold and impulsive, the fearless type. If you're too slow, she might tie my junior brother to her bed. Then you'd miss your chance."

Yue Weiwei knew that Qin Jiang, for all his appetite, was particular. If the goods weren't pristine, he probably wouldn't want them.

Hearing her assessment, Qin Jiang smiled confidently. "Relax. I've never missed a target I've set my sights on."

The two whispered back and forth while Nangong Yun raged impotently inside the courtyard. He had no idea that yet another woman — one who actually cared about him — had just entered Qin Jiang's crosshairs.

Eventually, Nangong Yun collected the bodies, tucked away his grief, and stormed out of the compound.

"Senior Sister, let's go. I'm taking our brothers home."

Yue Weiwei checked with Qin Jiang — a quick glance, a nod — then spoke. "Alright. Let's head back."

Nangong Yun caught the little exchange and felt the sting. Senior Sister was so careful, so deferential — she must have suffered enormously these past few days.

He took a deep breath and pressed down his emotions. Then he led the group toward the anti-Huaxia alliance's base.

About two hours later, they arrived. Hidden within dense, overgrown forest, a cluster of buildings formed the alliance's headquarters. There were more people than expected, but their strength was laughable. The audacity of forming an anti-Huaxia alliance with these numbers was frankly suicidal.

As they approached, sentries closed in — then relaxed upon recognizing Nangong Yun. Alert became welcome.
