"Qin Jiang!"

Long Yu snapped back to awareness. The moment he saw Qin Jiang, his face drained of color.

He knew about the Dragon Emperor's plan. Having been forcibly wrenched from the demonic path by his father's emperor blood, a measure of rationality had returned. Looking back on everything he'd done while corrupted, he cringed at his own stupidity.

But the Dragon Emperor had told him that Qin Jiang was leaving soon, and Long Xin'er would follow. If Long Yu survived this, he'd still be the Empire's heir.

It was that promise that had kept him conscious through the agonizing process of having the demonic qi stripped from his primordial spirit.

He'd expected that when he next woke, it would be to freedom and a fresh start.

Instead, the first face he saw was Qin Jiang's.

Long Yu's expression darkened, his primordial spirit trembling with a violent premonition. Qin Jiang smiled at him. "Your father really wasn't careful enough. I'm surprised a grand demon like you had a backup plan. If you'd lived, who knows how many more people you'd have terrorized? The Dragon Emperor's reputation would've been ruined. And since he and I are practically family, the least I can do is clean up after him."

Every word oozed casual mockery.

Long Yu: "..."

His face was grim, his mind racing. Even at full strength, he was no match for Qin Jiang—and Qin Jiang had a Great Emperor-level powerhouse at his side. He'd experienced that kind of power firsthand: a single casual blow could snuff him out. The odds of escape were essentially zero.

He took a steadying breath and met Qin Jiang's eyes. "Was all of this your doing?"

Everything he'd been through—every humiliation, every catastrophe—seemed to have been orchestrated by an invisible hand. While drowning in demonic corruption, his thoughts had been too disordered to piece it together. But now, in hindsight, the Demon Hall had clearly been setting him up from the very beginning.

His status and strength simply weren't worth that kind of effort from the Demon Hall. They would've gained far more by genuinely recruiting him. There'd been no reason to target him so deliberately—unless someone of influence had ordered it.

The only person Long Yu could think of with both the motive and the means to manipulate the Demon Hall was Qin Jiang.

Hearing the question, Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "Don't flatter yourself. I didn't have time to babysit you."

And it was true—he hadn't paid Long Yu much personal attention. Most of the work had been delegated to Black Dragon, with periodic progress reports. Qin Jiang himself had been far too busy for that.

He shook his head, done with conversation. His palm rose, and a wave of power enveloped Long Yu, instantly destroying the blood membrane that had shielded the spirit.

"Go keep your grandmother company."

The blow fell.

Long Yu had no ability to resist. His eyes burned with defiance—but his body had nothing left to give. When the devastating force struck his primordial spirit, his consciousness plunged into darkness.

Before Qin Jiang, Long Yu's primordial spirit disintegrated without a trace.

He scanned the area briefly, then muttered, "A Child of Destiny, and not a single decent treasure to his name?"

Previous Children of Destiny had all carried immortal-grade artifacts—every last one except Ye Xuan, whose natal treasure had been somewhat underwhelming. But Long Yu had nothing at all. Pure talent, no lucky encounters.

Of course, it wasn't a total loss. The system had awarded a generous haul of rewards, including Long Yu's fortune, which Qin Jiang absorbed. But the prize that truly caught his eye was a single pill.

"Heavenly Demon Pill!"

The name alone made its intended recipient obvious.

Its properties made Qin Jiang's eyes light up. The Heavenly Demon Pill was exclusively for demonic cultivators—it purified and condensed demonic power. But it had a hidden function: if a drop of someone's blood essence was infused before a demonic cultivator consumed it, the pill would gradually generate a sense of affinity and closeness toward the blood's owner.

"The system really does understand me."

Qin Jiang sighed in appreciation. His most pressing headache, solved by a single pill.

He took a cursory look at the remaining rewards, then turned to Liu Shuwan and the others with a grin. "Let's head back."

---

The Demon Hall.

Nearly every member had gathered. Word had spread that the Hall Master was about to make a major announcement.

Atop a high platform, the Demon Hall's master surveyed his forces—tens of thousands of demonic cultivators, and these weren't even all of them. A force to be proud of.

All eyes were fixed on him. He raised a hand, and the murmuring ceased instantly.

"Today, I've called you all here to announce something monumental. Some of you may have already heard the rumors, so let me make it official: starting today, the Demon Hall is withdrawing from the Divine Dragon Continent!"

He let that sink in.

"That's right—we're entering the Chaos. We will become the great Chaos Marauders! In the Chaos, no one can restrain us. In the Chaos, we are kings! The Chaos is where we belong. Chaos Marauders—that's the identity best suited to us demonic cultivators! Believe me when I say: in the Chaos, we will shine!"

His voice thrummed with persuasive power.

The assembled demonic cultivators erupted in excitement. They'd long since grown sick of cowering in the shadows. On the Divine Dragon Continent, they were hunted criminals, living in constant danger. But in the Chaos, as Chaos Marauders? Maybe they really could become kings.

"To the Chaos! Chaos Marauders!"

"We are kings of the Chaos!"

"Hehehe, my blood is boiling—I can't wait to get started!"

The frenzy built to a fever pitch before the Hall Master waved for silence. "We depart in three days. Prepare yourselves. A new life awaits us! Kings of the Chaos—our new title!"

Another round of passionate howling ensued. Eventually, the crowd calmed and began to disperse, each preparing to enter their new life in peak condition.

As they filed out, the Hall Master's expression turned quietly bitter. Becoming Chaos Marauders was, in reality, just becoming someone else's hired muscle. He'd gone from boss to employee.
