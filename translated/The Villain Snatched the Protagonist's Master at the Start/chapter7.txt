When he returned to his residence, Qin Lian'er was waiting around with nothing to do.

Seeing Qin Jiang return, she immediately ran over to greet him, peeking behind him.

"Everything settled?"

"Of course. How could that old man possibly beat your amazing brother?"

Qin Jiang said smugly.

Qin Lian'er giggled and showered him with praise without hesitation.

"I knew Brother was the best!"

Qin Jiang smiled and pinched her cheek. After chatting for a while, Qin Lian'er left the residence.

Watching her go, Qin Jiang turned his palm over. A jade bottle and a golden pearl appeared—the system's rewards.

"The Marrow Cleansing Pills are useless to me."

He possessed the Immaculate Divine Body. There were no impurities in his system, so the Marrow Cleansing Pills would have no effect on him. Besides, with the Qin family's resources, Marrow Cleansing Pills weren't particularly precious.

At the very least, all core disciples of the Qin family had the opportunity to obtain them.

Shaking his head, he put away the Marrow Cleansing Pills and turned his attention to the golden pearl. This was the Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood. It wasn't very useful to him either, but...

Someone else could use it.

"Young Master."

Just then, a voice came from outside the hall.

Qin Jiang weighed the golden pearl in his hand. "Come in."

A figure entered the hall. It was Black Dragon. The moment he stepped inside, his gaze involuntarily fell upon the Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood in Qin Jiang's hand.

The stirring in his bloodline made him swallow involuntarily.

Still, he immediately averted his eyes and spoke respectfully.

"Young Master, the people from the Ye family have been arranged. What should be done with them next?"

"Leave them be for now. Let them stew for a few days."

"Yes, sir."

Black Dragon acknowledged the order, though his eyes kept drifting toward the Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood in Qin Jiang's hand.

Seeing his behavior, Qin Jiang couldn't help but smile.

"Black Dragon, you've been with me for over a decade now, haven't you?"

"When the Young Master was three years old, Black Dragon was assigned to protect you. It has been fifteen years."

Black Dragon replied.

"Fifteen years."

Qin Jiang sighed with emotion.

"In these fifteen years, your cultivation hasn't improved much."

At those words, Black Dragon immediately dropped to one knee.

"Black Dragon has been negligent. Please punish me, Young Master."

Qin Jiang raised his arm, and a force lifted Black Dragon back to his feet. He rolled his eyes.

"Stop kneeling at every little thing.

"These fifteen years, you have been negligent in your cultivation—but it was to protect me."

With that, he tossed the Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood directly to Black Dragon.

"This is Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood. It's perfect for you. Take it and refine it."

"Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood!"

Black Dragon's eyes went wide.

His true form was of the dragon race. He'd already sensed that this golden pearl would be immensely beneficial to him, but he never imagined it was actually Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood.

"Young Master, this is too precious."

Black Dragon held the Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood, looking flustered.

While dragons could maximize the effectiveness of Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood, it was still an invaluable treasure for humans as well.

"Just take it since I'm giving it to you."

Qin Jiang waved his hand.

"Refine it quickly and improve your strength. Otherwise, you won't even be qualified to stay by my side anymore."

Hearing this, Black Dragon's arm—which had been about to return the treasure—paused slightly.

Qin Jiang's strength was improving rapidly.

As one of Qin Jiang's original guards, his own strength was already struggling to keep up. Just as Qin Jiang said, if he couldn't improve, he'd probably be replaced.

The Qin family had no shortage of powerful experts.

But having protected Qin Jiang for fifteen years, watching him grow from a three-year-old child into a handsome young man, Black Dragon had developed deep feelings for him.

Black Dragon silently withdrew the Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood.

"Black Dragon thanks the Young Master for this gift."

Qin Jiang smiled. With a wave of his arm, Black Dragon withdrew from the hall.

"I should go into seclusion now."

Qin Jiang said to himself.

Besides the Marrow Cleansing Pills and Ancestral Dragon Essence Blood, the system's rewards also included the awakening of his hidden Divine Body.

Qin Jiang was eager to find out what his other Divine Body was.

He stood and walked toward the wall behind his chair. There was a mechanism there. When Qin Jiang pressed it gently, the wall rumbled and revealed a passage.

Inside was a secret chamber.

Whenever he made a breakthrough, Qin Jiang would enter this chamber to cultivate.

Elsewhere.

In a quiet courtyard, Ye Ling'er and Ye Kuan had been arranged to stay here.

At this moment, Ye Kuan wore a bitter expression, watching Ye Ling'er hopefully.

Since arriving at the Qin family, Ye Ling'er hadn't spoken a single word to him. Ye Kuan knew she resented him, but there was nothing he could do. He was thinking of the Ye family's interests.

Besides, in his eyes, Qin Jiang was far superior to Xiao Fan.

He genuinely hoped Ye Ling'er could be with Qin Jiang.

"Young miss, our Ye family cannot afford to offend any ancient clan right now. I hope you can understand my decision."

Ye Kuan explained.

But Ye Ling'er showed no reaction. She stood beneath a tree, her face full of sorrow, her beautiful eyes gazing toward the direction of the Xiao family.

Seeing this, Ye Kuan sighed. He knew that after coming to the Qin family, Ye Ling'er's fate was no longer hers to decide.

Or rather, as the Ye family's princess, her fate had never been hers to control.

Qin Jiang was Ye Ling'er's best choice.

Whether she liked it or not.

Even if the Ye family learned of this, they wouldn't come to rescue her. In fact, they might secretly rejoice at the opportunity to form ties with the Qin family.

So if Ye Ling'er wanted to be with Xiao Fan, Xiao Fan would have to destroy the Qin family and defeat the Ye family. Otherwise, it was absolutely impossible.

But that...

Was still an impossible choice.

"Young miss, I hope you can think this through clearly."

Ye Kuan finished speaking and said no more, retreating to the room arranged for him.

Ye Ling'er remained silent, withdrawing her gaze.

She understood as well. Now that she'd entered the Qin family, nothing was up to her anymore.

Ye Ling'er bit her red lip hard. Her beautiful eyes grew misty as a deep sense of helplessness welled up within her.

"Brother Xiao Fan, Ling'er might...

"Never be able to go back."

In the secret chamber.

Qin Jiang sat cross-legged on a cushion, a ring resting in his palm.

"Before going into seclusion, I need to deal with this first."

Murmuring to himself, Qin Jiang tapped the ring. There was no response.

He smiled and simply dropped it on the ground.

"Stop hiding. I know you're awake. Come out."

A flash of light flickered across the ring, then it immediately returned to its ancient, unassuming appearance.

Seeing this, Qin Jiang casually uttered two words.

"Fire Tribe."

The moment the words left his mouth, the ring trembled violently. Then a figure flashed out from within.

Qin Jiang looked over, a gleam of surprise in his eyes.

Inside the ring wasn't some old grandpa—it was an absolutely stunning beauty.

The woman wore a red dress that accentuated her perfect figure. Her delicate feet were bare, and above them, a glimpse of jade-white calves peeked through, half-hidden.

Her features were exquisite. Her long, fiery-red hair added an air of alluring mystique.

Her phoenix eyes were fierce as she fixed them on Qin Jiang. Her voice was cold.

"How did you learn of my identity?"
