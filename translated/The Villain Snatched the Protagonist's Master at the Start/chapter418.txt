Years passed inside the hall.

An Xihe's defection had broken the coalition within the first few months. After that, the proceedings became purely recreational — and educational, as Qin Jiang spent most of the time helping the Divine Palace women cultivate.

Their power base had been relatively weak, so the bulk of his efforts went there. The results were impressive: every Divine Palace woman had reached Great Emperor at minimum. He'd also spent Villain Points in the system shop, purchasing treasures tailored to each woman's constitution and boosting their innate talent considerably.

Every one of them now met the threshold for entry into the Heavenly Domain. When the time came, he'd leave no one behind.

But the upgrades had burned through his Villain Point reserves. Daily income from Li Yang's suffering trickled in, but it was nowhere near enough to cover expenses. He was running a deficit.

One Child of Destiny could no longer sustain his growing household. He needed more.

He was certain the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands harbored additional Children of Destiny. Huaxia currently controlled only two of the nine Heavens — seven remained unconquered, and among them, there had to be more targets. He just needed to flush them out.

In the hall, Qin Jiang lay with his head in Liu Shuwan's lap. When he was thinking, he liked to have something to occupy his mouth, and she indulged him. She leaned forward, gazing down at him with tender eyes, gently massaging his scalp.

After a while, he sat up, pulled her into his arms, and spoke. "Shuwan, Huaxia is strong enough to take the rest of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands by now, isn't it?"

"More or less." She nodded. "If we sisters deployed, conquering all of them wouldn't be a problem. But governing afterward would be complicated."

An Xihe alone could steamroll every realm. The problem was what came next. Outside of the inner circle, Huaxia lacked individuals powerful enough to govern an entire Heaven on their own — and Qin Jiang certainly wouldn't station his women in faraway territories. Nor would they agree to it.

His expression turned thoughtful, and his hand began roaming on autopilot — an unconscious habit when deep in thought. Liu Shuwan's face colored, but rather than moving his hand, she guided it. Improving his circulation might sharpen his thinking.

It worked. After a moment, his hand tightened decisively — drawing a sharp gasp from her.

"Easy!" She smacked his hand lightly.

He blinked, glanced down, and softened his grip immediately. A faint mark had appeared on her skin. He pulled her close, concern in his voice. "Did that hurt?"

"Mm." She placed his hand back where it had been. "Rub it better."

He obliged, gentle and careful, until the mark faded. She kept hold of his hand, content to let him continue.

"So what were you thinking?" she asked.

"Send advance teams to the other seven Heavens. Let them stir things up — throw the whole region into chaos. Once it's destabilized, we move in."

"Manufactured turmoil?" She considered this, then nodded. "If the other seven Heavens descend into chaos and then we step in to end it, the common people will welcome us. It would make governing much easier."

The real headache with administering vast territories was always the civilian population. Powerful cultivators understood Huaxia's strength and wouldn't cause trouble. But ordinary people — fearless in their ignorance — were a different matter. If Huaxia entered as liberators rather than conquerors, public acceptance would soar.

"There are still 29 years before the Heavenly Domain opens," she continued. "Let the seven realms endure 20 years of turmoil. By then, they'll cherish peace above all else — and Huaxia becomes their savior."

She outlined her reasoning in full, and Qin Jiang nodded throughout.

In truth, he hadn't thought nearly this far. His logic was simpler: chaos bred heroes, and Children of Destiny thrived in turbulent times. Creating unrest would flush them into the open, making them easy to identify. But he wasn't about to admit that his grand strategy had been motivated by farming.

He looked at Liu Shuwan with admiration. Brilliant woman. Though credit where it was due — her sharp thinking surely had something to do with his expert massage technique.

Inspired, he massaged with renewed enthusiasm. Liu Shuwan's brow creased, her hand tightened around his, and a soft breath escaped her lips.

He grinned. "Aren't we discussing business?"

"This IS your business," she said pointedly — then realized her mistake. For Qin Jiang, being with them was the real business. Everything else was a side project. And even at his "real business," he was procrastinating.

She pursed her lips. "If you're going to do this, stop talking about side projects and focus."

"Can't wait?"

"Are you doing this or not?"

"Doing it. Right now."
