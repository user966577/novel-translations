Several days had passed by the time Qin Jiang emerged from An Xihe's room. No time-dilation this round.

He found Wu Yingtao and teased her again—still no follow-through, which left her seething. She'd been waiting for him for days, and he'd delivered nothing but more tantalizing half-measures.

Rather than extinguishing the fire, each visit poured gasoline on it. Even self-help offered no relief. It was like being drugged.

All she could think about was Qin Jiang. Everything else was a blur. Worse, after each teasing session, he'd immediately go off to play with the other women. Wu Yingtao watched from the sidelines, and the sight only intensified her torment.

Days bled together. Beyond his time with the women, Qin Jiang snuck off for a tryst with Murong Qing. Wu Yingtao was left to stew. The other twelve beauties from the factions had been sent to Huaxia Academy. He'd collect the whole batch eventually—no rush.

Then one day, after his usual teasing session, he didn't leave. Instead, he asked, "Yingtao, would you like to visit the Wu family?"

"The Wu family?"

That snapped her out of her haze. Going home meant investigating whether her brother had truly been possessed.

Anxiety fluttered in her chest. If it was confirmed, it meant her real brother was already dead. She wasn't sure she was ready for that.

But she had to face it eventually.

She took a deep breath and nodded. "When do we go?"

"Need to freshen up first?" His gaze traveled over her pointedly.

She flushed and glared. "Whose fault is that?"

Despite the half-measures, her body's reactions had been anything but moderate. The fire was impossible to suppress, and he kept walking away at the worst possible moments. Pure torment.

He pulled her close and kissed her cheek. "When we get back, I'll make it up to you. Promise."

Her heart leaped. She'd been at the breaking point for days. But right now, her brother's situation took priority. She forced down the heat. "Whatever you say."

He pinched her waist playfully. "Get ready. I'll go with you."

She nodded, and he released her—then helpfully tried to assist with her preparations. His "help" was more hindrance than anything.

"I'll do it myself," she snapped. Being near him was... destabilizing.

He shrugged and settled into a chair to watch. Soon she was ready—wearing several layers of undergarments.

"That's a lot of clothes," he observed.

"I sweat easily. If I wear too little, it soaks through."

He raised an eyebrow. Days of teasing plus covert drugging—of course she'd be sweating constantly. A pang of guilt crossed his mind. He'd definitely make it up to her when they returned.

But for now, he needed her thoughts muddled. If she started thinking clearly, she might notice the inconsistencies.

They left the airship and headed for the Wu family estate. It was close—only half a day's travel.

Without alerting anyone, Wu Yingtao led them directly to the small courtyard she shared with Wu Tian. They concealed themselves and waited.

"He should still be home at this hour," she whispered. "But every night, he goes out to cultivate. Something about absorbing moonlight."

"Moonlight is a form of natural energy. Your brother's cultivation method is clearly unusual—not a Wu family technique, right?"

She confirmed it.

"Let's wait. Once night falls, we'll observe his training."

When darkness came, Wu Tian's door opened. He stepped out, scanned his surroundings warily, then vanished with a burst of speed, reappearing on a distant mountain peak.

Qin Jiang and Wu Yingtao had followed the entire way, their presence masked by the killing formation's concealment. Against an Immortal Emperor's remnant soul without actual Immortal Emperor power, detection was virtually impossible.

Wu Tian stood atop the peak and gazed upward—at the swirling Chaos vortex in the sky, the passage to the Heavenly Domain.

"Just wait. This Emperor will return!"

He sat cross-legged and began absorbing moonlight.

Hidden nearby, Wu Yingtao's fists clenched. She hadn't even needed to check his primordial spirit. That single sentence—calling himself "this Emperor" and declaring he would "return"—told her everything.

He wasn't Wu Tian.

Her brother had truly been possessed.

"We don't need to check. He's not my brother." She stared at the imposter, killing intent flickering across her face. He'd taken her brother's body, which meant he'd killed her brother. She would have vengeance.

Qin Jiang took her hand. "We can't be certain yet. Some people just fantasize..."

"No. My brother was gloomy, but he would never talk like that. He'd never call himself 'this Emperor.'"

"Maybe he's gone crazy--"

"Qin Jiang, stop trying to console me. I'm sure. He's not my brother!"
