"Hah... the Celestial Rabbit Tribe. Finally made it."

Outside the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's territory, a ragged figure heaved a long sigh of relief.

It was Tang Yin.

These past few days, for reasons unknown, the good fortune that had always accompanied him seemed to have abandoned him entirely. The journey here had been grueling, every step fraught with peril. But at least he'd arrived.

Tang Yin drew a deep breath and walked toward the tribe, his mood easing at last. He was the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's little princess's savior! Coming here, he'd absolutely receive a warm welcome.

A smile spread across his face, and as he recalled the little princess's delicate features, it deepened further. Last time, things had been too urgent to build any real connection, but now that he was here at the Celestial Rabbit Tribe, he was confident his charm could win her over. He knew full well that Xiao Jiu was the tribe's future hope. Win her, and he'd effectively control half the Celestial Rabbit Tribe—a force far greater than the entire Tang family.

Tang Yin was lost in pleasant daydreams as he neared the tribe's border when an enormous rabbit materialized before him, blocking his path. Its massive crimson eyes locked onto him, radiating hostility.

Tang Yin halted. A Saint Realm celestial rabbit—that meant some authority within the tribe.

"Where'd this beggar come from? Get out of our Celestial Rabbit Tribe's territory!" the great rabbit bellowed.

Tang Yin's expression stiffened. He'd been mistaken for a beggar. A cold light flickered through his eyes, but given his circumstances, he swallowed his pride and addressed the rabbit evenly.

"I'm here to see your Second Elder. Send him out."

"Hah! See our Second Elder? You want his Lordship to come out and meet you? Who the hell do you think you are? Scram, or I'll show you what a Rabbit Kick feels like!"

The great rabbit flexed its hind legs, shot Tang Yin's lower half a leering look with those enormous crimson eyes, and grinned wickedly—clearly itching to try.

Tang Yin's gaze turned even colder. The rabbit's suggestive stare dredged up memories of his encounter with the wild boar herd. His eyelid twitched. He fixed the creature with an icy glare and released a surge of powerful aura.

"Holy sh—!"

The great rabbit's eyes went wide. Then it roared at the top of its lungs: "A Supreme? Brothers, we've got a Supreme picking a fight! Get over here!"

Its voice carried far. The next moment, the ground trembled as white rabbits came bounding in from every direction, surrounding Tang Yin within seconds.

"You dare cause trouble in our Celestial Rabbit Tribe? You're dead!"

A Supreme-level celestial rabbit spotted Tang Yin and immediately launched a kick straight at him, its hind leg crackling with force.

Tang Yin frowned. He'd only intended to intimidate the smaller rabbit into escorting him to the clan chief, not to start a brawl. And the tribe's fighters had responded alarmingly fast.

He couldn't afford to underestimate a Supreme's attack. He moved to block—but the celestial rabbit's cultivation was a tier above his, and after days of hardship, his condition was abysmal. The kick sent him flying.

"That's it?" The great rabbit landed, sneering with contempt.

Tang Yin steadied himself, blood seeping from the corner of his mouth, his expression turning vicious. "Do you have any idea who I am? I'm a distinguished guest of your Celestial Rabbit Tribe! I know your Second Elder, and I know your little princess! Take me to them immediately, or you'll all answer for this!"

He'd played every card in his hand.

The surrounding celestial rabbits paused, exchanging glances. One Supreme-level rabbit studied him carefully. "You're... Tang Yin?"

Tang Yin blinked. They knew his name? Had the little princess already told the tribe about him? The anger in his chest subsided slightly, and he gave a haughty nod. "That's right. I'm Tang Yin. I saved your little princess not long ago."

"It IS him!"

Fury ignited in every rabbit's eyes. They'd all received standing orders to remain vigilant precisely because Tang Yin was expected to show up. And this bastard had ruined the little princess's bloodline!

Unforgivable!

Tang Yin, still oblivious to the severity of the situation, scoffed. "Take me to your little princess. I'm her savior—if you disrespect me, she'll punish every last one of you!"

"Go see my ASS!"

One of the great rabbits exploded with profanity. Its aura flared, and its already massive body swelled further, growing mountain-sized in the blink of an eye. The pressure was suffocating.

"Brothers, all together! Kill him!"

The others were seething. This bastard had destroyed their hope. He had to die!

Several Supreme-level celestial rabbits charged Tang Yin in a frenzy of rage.

Tang Yin's face darkened. "What are you doing? I'm your little princess's savior!"

"I'll show you a savior! Eat this Rabbit Kick!"

BOOM!!!

Tang Yin was stomped straight into the ground.

The commotion drew more tribe members, figures streaking in from every direction. Tang Yin clawed his way out of the earth, took one look at the gathering horde and their murderous fury, and felt a wave of bitter frustration—but he knew better than to linger.

"Celestial Rabbit Tribe—ungrateful wretches! You'll pay for this!"

With a furious roar, he forced open a gap in the encirclement and fled.

High in the void, Qin Jiang watched Tang Yin's retreating figure with a faint smile. At the same time, an invisible force latched onto Tang Yin—a tracker that would let Qin Jiang monitor his movements at all times.

The system notification chimed in his mind. Qin Jiang glanced at the rewards and clicked his tongue. This Tang Yin was pathetically weak. Nearly driven to his death, and the payout was this meager? A casual pluck from Chen Changsheng yielded more than this guy's entire existence.

'Better than nothing, I suppose.'

He murmured to himself, then checked Chen Changsheng's latest plot data—newly purchased with Villain Points, since the old timeline had long since been derailed.

Less than half a month. That big, lush leek would arrive in the Demon Domain, and apparently, he had connections with the Snake Race, one of the three great powers.

'Ten reincarnations really do pay off. The man's got contacts everywhere.'

Qin Jiang chuckled appreciatively. The Snake Race was formidable, but he wasn't worried. Worst case, he could mooch off Hu Xian'er and have the Fox Race intervene. And even without Hu Xian'er, the forces at his side were growing stronger by the day.
