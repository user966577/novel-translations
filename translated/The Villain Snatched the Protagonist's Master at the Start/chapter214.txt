They fled for their lives, and they made it.

Jian Yao and the others moved to pursue, but Qin Jiang stopped them. He opened his palm, and the Myriad Dao Stone settled into it, bearing a freshly extracted Immortal Path Law. Not a bad haul.

He looked in the direction the two surviving Immortals had fled. "Remember their faces. We'll be collecting that debt eventually."

"One of them is a rogue cultivator — a goshawk in his true form," a Fox Race elder said. "The other is the ancestor of the Horse Clan."

The elders regarded Qin Jiang with a touch of newfound wariness. He'd really done it — killed an Immortal right before their eyes. In that moment, they'd felt death brush past them. If Qin Jiang had targeted them instead, the Black Serpent Ancestor's fate would have been theirs.

They glanced at Hu Xian'er. Their clan's lucky charm, indeed. Without her, they'd have been on the wrong side of that equation.

Qin Jiang nodded, committing the two Immortals' identities to memory. He looked down at the ruins of the Black Water Serpent clan. A few terrified survivors huddled in the wreckage. The most conspicuous feature was the Black Serpent Ancestor's massive corpse.

"A snake that big would make incredible stew," Qin Jiang mused aloud.

Two sharp gazes immediately fixed on him. He turned to find Yu Lan and Yu Ru staring daggers. They were snakes too.

He coughed. Truthfully, he preferred these sisters' kind of snake stew — the live variety.

"An Immortal's body is a treasure trove," a Fox Race elder said, diplomatically stepping in. "Those fangs could be forged into weapons — poisonous ones, most likely. The scales would make excellent armor. The flesh can be refined into pills. Turning it into stew would be a terrible waste."

He eyed the massive corpse with undisguised envy. If he could bring that back to the Fox Race, it would be an enormous windfall. But this was Snake Race territory, and the kill belonged to Qin Jiang.

Yu Lan nodded, shooting Qin Jiang a look. "That body could elevate our Purple-Scale Serpent faction's strength significantly."

"Then take it back," Qin Jiang said with a smile.

He waved his arm, storing the Ancestor's corpse, then surveyed the remnant Black Water Serpent survivors cowering in the rubble. Fear filled their eyes, along with a barely concealed thread of hatred.

"All these Black Water Serpent people," Qin Jiang said thoughtfully, "must have lost friends and family today."

Everyone turned to look at him. The instigator was now sympathizing with the victims?

"What do you all say — shouldn't we help them reunite with their loved ones?" He smiled.

The two Fox Race elders felt a chill at the sight of that smile. Jian Yao and the others showed no surprise. This was Qin Jiang's style.

"I'll handle it," Mo Mo volunteered.

Slaughter was her specialty.

When they departed, not a single Black Water Serpent remained to harbor any hatred.

The Fox Race elders muttered to each other as they walked: "Family, we're all family..."

After they left, the four Snake Race Immortals emerged from hiding and surveyed the silent wasteland that had once been the Black Water Serpent territory.

"The Black Serpent is dead," one said quietly.

They'd tacitly allowed this to happen, but none had expected Qin Jiang to actually kill the Black Serpent Ancestor. Much less erase the entire clan.

"From this day forward, we never speak of the Black Water Serpent again."

They'd observed the entire battle from the shadows. The moment Qin Jiang unleashed his Immortal-killing strike, they'd all flinched. The Black Serpent Ancestor hadn't even been able to resist. From that instant, they understood: Qin Jiang was not to be provoked.

The four sighed, watching Qin Jiang's group depart. Building a genuine friendship with him could only benefit the Snake Race.

But Qin Jiang had so many women already, and the Snake Race only had Yu Lan and Yu Ru...

"What do you think about Zi Fu?" one Immortal suddenly asked.

The other three turned to him, eyes narrowing. Zi Fu was the previous Snake Race chieftain — mentored by three of these five Immortals. The one who'd spoken and the now-dead Black Serpent Ancestor were the only two who hadn't been her masters.

"What are you suggesting?" Three pairs of eyes turned hostile.

Zi Fu was their disciple, but they'd raised her like their own daughter. This fool was suggesting they hand her over?

Under their withering stares, the Immortal laughed nervously. "Just thinking out loud."

"Hmph!" Three cold snorts, and they vanished.

The lone remaining Immortal shook his head with a helpless sigh. "I'm only thinking of the Snake Race's future..."

Back at the Purple-Scale Serpent territory, Qin Jiang was put to work processing the Black Serpent Ancestor's remains. After all, he was an Emperor-Grade alchemist.

Manual labor came with wages, naturally. Yu Lan and Yu Ru served as his compensation for the duration, attending to him like a pair of queens doting on their emperor. Qin Jiang was treated to the unique gifts of the serpent race — or rather, the yao race in general. Each species had certain special abilities, and when applied properly, the results were truly remarkable.

Meanwhile, the two Fox Race elders returned to report to Hu Yan.

The Fox Race had four Immortals total, and unlike the Snake Race, theirs were actively involved in clan governance — one chieftain and three elders. Hu Yan was the strongest among them.

He listened to their report, then fixed them with a cold stare. "You two left the tribe without permission and nearly made enemies of Immortals. Are you trying to bring ruin to the Fox Race?"

Leaving the tribe was one thing, but antagonizing Immortals was inexcusable. The elders hung their heads in sheepish silence. Thankfully, they'd pulled back from the brink in time. Had they actually crossed Qin Jiang, they'd have become the Fox Race's greatest sinners.

After a thorough tongue-lashing that the elders endured without protest, Hu Yan grew bored with the lack of pushback. He took a breath and changed tack.

"What do you think of Qin Jiang?"

The elders perked up immediately. This was a topic they had opinions on.

"Dashing, refined, brilliantly talented, peerlessly handsome — truly the Fox Race's number one son-in-law!"

Hu Yan: "..."

"He and our little Xian'er are a perfect match. A couple made in heaven," one elder added.

The chieftain's son-in-law — what else could they say but praise? Besides, they meant every word.
