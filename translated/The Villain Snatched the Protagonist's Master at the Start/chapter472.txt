The baby talk was tabled for now. In Qin Jiang's plans, children were a very distant future.

His immediate objective was to take Mystic Cloud Heaven. The realm had over a dozen True Immortals across its major factions -- he couldn't just kill them all. That would be wasteful. Conquering them wouldn't be simple, either. These old fossils all clung to their power, none willing to step down from their thrones.

But the destruction of the Nangong family had shaken them, and every faction was currently laying low. There was, however, a point of entry: the Zhou family.

The Zhou family had been shrewdly cooperative. Despite having True Immortals, they'd maintained a low profile around Huaxia, even signaling willingness to submit. But it was all surface-level. Their deference was born of fear -- fear from watching the Nangong family burn -- not genuine loyalty. And secondhand fear was easily forgotten.

To make them truly submit, Qin Jiang needed to make them afraid. Not the distant, abstract kind of fear from hearing about someone else's fate. The kind that sank into their bones, experienced firsthand, impossible to forget.

And conveniently, the Zhou family had a marriage alliance with the Blood Tribe. After Xue Yue's escape, they'd even sent people to drag her back. That pretext was more than enough to exterminate one of their branch families.

The key was surgical precision: destroy one branch, terrify the rest, but leave the core intact so resentment wouldn't outweigh fear. Different branches within a clan weren't particularly close -- many were outright rivals. There would be hate, certainly. But it would pale against the terror.

Plan finalized, Qin Jiang and his entourage flew the airship toward the Zhou family estate. About two hours later, they arrived.

The airship hung directly over the Zhou compound -- an unmistakable provocation. But no one dared object. Powerhouses surged skyward, including the Zhou family's True Immortal, and bowed before the airship.

"The Zhou family humbly welcomes the Manor Lord."

Silence from the airship. Cold sweat dripped from every brow. Black Dragon had visited beforehand to announce Qin Jiang's arrival, but without stating the purpose. Now the Zhou family racked their brains for any offense they might have committed. The only thing they could think of was the branch family's marriage alliance with the Blood Tribe -- and the fact that the woman from that marriage, Xue Yue, was now Qin Jiang's.

'But didn't the Manor Lord say we could continue to exist?'

Then a chilling realization struck. He'd said the Zhou family could exist. He'd never said there would be no consequences. One person surviving still counted as the family existing -- just like the Nangong family, reduced to a single Nangong Yun. Were they next?

Terror spread through the crowd. Every spine went rigid, every body drenched in sweat. They kept their heads low, trembling.

Then a soft laugh drifted from the airship. Qin Jiang stepped out with Xue Yue in his arms. "At ease."

They straightened -- and the color drained from their faces when they saw Xue Yue. Their worst fear confirmed.

Black Dragon materialized beside Qin Jiang, carrying a thick stack of papers -- genealogical records for the branch that had arranged the Blood Tribe marriage. Every member documented, down to illegitimate children. He handed it to the Zhou patriarch.

"Elder Zhou. Here you are."

The old man's hands trembled as he took it. He understood immediately: kill everyone on this list.

He scanned the pages and confirmed -- exclusively the Blood Tribe marriage branch. Complete. Not a single name missing. Swallowing hard, he forced a smile. "Manor Lord, what do you mean by this?"

"You don't understand?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, shook his head, then crooked a finger.

A devastating surge of power erupted from the airship and tore through a random cluster of Zhou family powerhouses. Several died instantly -- from some unrelated branch, chosen at random. Just to make a point.

Everyone froze. The patriarch whipped around to see clouds of blood mist where his people had been. He gripped the genealogy so hard it nearly crumbled. 'Outrageous!'

He took a deep breath, turned back to Qin Jiang, and spoke through clenched teeth. "I understand perfectly, Manor Lord. You needn't lift a finger. Every name on this list will be dealt with. None will remain."

"See? Not so hard." Qin Jiang smiled. "Get it done. For every one you miss, a hundred from your other branches will make up the difference. Clear?"

"Yes."

The other branches were already rolling up their sleeves. The branch that had just lost members wasn't angry at Qin Jiang -- they directed their fury at the Blood Tribe branch instead. If not for them, their people would still be alive. Every last one of them had to die, because if even a single one escaped, somebody else would pay the hundred-person penalty. And nobody wanted to be the unlucky replacement.
