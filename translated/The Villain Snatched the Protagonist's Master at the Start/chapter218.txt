Less than fifteen minutes later, the two girls stormed out of the casino in a fury.

"That blind beggar was definitely cheating!" Lian'er seethed.

"Absolutely!" Zi Fu agreed. They hadn't won a single round—the man had to be cheating.

"Though in casino terms, I think it's called 'stacking the deck,'" Zi Fu added helpfully.

Lian'er snorted. "I don't care what it's called. That blind beggar is bad news. When my brother gets back, we'll make him avenge us!"

"Right, your brother's the King of Gamblers!" Zi Fu's eyes brightened. "When is he coming back?"

Lian'er's shoulders slumped. "I don't know. But it should be soon."

She snuck a glance at Zi Fu. This was the gift she'd prepared for her brother, after all. She wondered if he'd like it.

The look in Lian'er's eyes made Zi Fu feel slightly uneasy—something about it was a little off. She waved a hand in front of Lian'er's face. "Come on, stop spacing out. Let's go find something else to do."

"Okay~"

Lian'er perked up and nodded.

They played around the city for the rest of the day. When they finally returned to the Qin estate, Lian'er sensed something was different. The atmosphere felt livelier, more energized.

Her face lit up. She grabbed Zi Fu's hand and exclaimed, "I think my brother's back!"

She dragged Zi Fu straight to the Void Divine Temple, where she had her own room. Inside, Liu Shuwan was busy settling in Xiao Jiu and the White Fox Tribe.

"Shuwan!" Lian'er waved, scampering over. "Where's my brother?"

"Lian'er." Liu Shuwan smiled warmly and ruffled her hair. "He went to find you. You didn't see him?"

"Huh? I just got back!"

Lian'er said a quick word to Liu Shuwan and bolted out the door, dragging Zi Fu behind her.

Liu Shuwan watched them go, a thoughtful gleam in her eyes. 'Another gift for Qin Jiang? Though this woman is quite powerful...'

She murmured to herself, then turned away, putting it out of her mind. An Ancient Emperor was well within Qin Jiang's ability to handle—no need to worry about that.

But Lian'er herself might warrant some concern. The girl's feelings were practically written across her face in bold characters. The other women had all noticed it by now; they'd simply chosen not to say anything.

Liu Shuwan's brow creased slightly, then she shook her head. 'I'll let Qin Jiang deal with it. Lian'er's a good girl, honestly.'

Cultivators—why bother with mortal conventions? When she herself had hesitated because of their age gap, Qin Jiang had told her exactly that. Age wasn't an issue. And by the same token, neither was blood.

She suspected that given how much Qin Jiang spoiled Lian'er, if the girl truly wanted it, he wouldn't refuse. And who knew—maybe Qin Jiang harbored a few thoughts of his own.

---

"Brother!"

Back at her own residence, Lian'er's eyes lit up. There he was—her brother, lounging in the courtyard without a care in the world. She ran to him, face beaming with joy.

Qin Jiang looked up and rose to his feet, opening his arms. He caught her and spun her around twice before setting her down. Even then, her arms stayed looped around his neck, her eyes fixed on his face with scorching intensity. If she'd had just a little less self-control, she would've kissed him right then and there—kissed him until he couldn't breathe.

Qin Jiang chuckled and flicked her nose. "You going to let go? You've got a guest waiting."

Reluctantly, Lian'er peeled herself off him, keeping one hand firmly hooked around his arm. She turned to Zi Fu with a grin. "Brother, let me introduce you—this is Zi Fu, my good friend!"

"Hello." Qin Jiang smiled and nodded.

Zi Fu studied him. Sure enough, everything Lian'er had said was true. He really was ridiculously handsome.

"So, Zi Fu—my brother. Hehe, he didn't disappoint, did he?" Lian'er giggled.

Zi Fu smiled. "Lian'er's mentioned you many times. The bond between you two is quite enviable."

"My brother is the best to me!" Lian'er said, nodding emphatically.

Qin Jiang ruffled her hair with a grin. His little sister was sensible—of course he spoiled her. And look: he'd barely gotten home before receiving a gift. Besides, the system had already alerted him on the way back that the storyline had shifted. That was definitely Lian'er's doing. She'd gone and brought the fortune heroine home all by herself. How could the plot not change?

"My Lian'er is also the world's best little sister," Qin Jiang said warmly.

The praise sent Lian'er over the moon. She hugged his arm tighter, pressing it against herself.

"Oh, and brother—Zi Fu and I got bullied today!" Lian'er looked up at him, her expression shifting to one of aggrieved indignation as she recalled their catastrophic losses at the casino.

Qin Jiang's face darkened instantly. "Who dares bully my Lian'er? Come on—your brother will get revenge!"

And so, radiating murderous intent, Qin Jiang was dragged by Lian'er to the casino. It operated around the clock, never closing.

Night had already fallen, but the casino was still packed and roaring.

Qin Jiang looked at the casino. Then he looked at Lian'er. She avoided his eyes, a touch guilty. "Zi Fu and I lost a lot here today," she said meekly.

Qin Jiang: "..."

He'd been ready to slaughter someone's entire clan, and now she was telling him the battlefield was a gambling table?

"Brother, aren't you the King of Gamblers? Avenge us!" Lian'er said, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.

Beside her, Zi Fu also turned to Qin Jiang, her gaze equally expectant.

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. Here, his reputation didn't precede him, which meant his gambling "techniques" might not work. He should've brought Yan Yun—she'd been the lucky charm at the Rose Casino, and her actual skills at the table weren't bad either.

But they were already here. He couldn't exactly turn back.

"Mo Mo," he called.

Mo Mo appeared before him in an instant, and she gave Lian'er a cheerful little wave.

"Mo Mo!" Lian'er waved back happily.

Zi Fu's gaze sharpened. The pressure radiating from Mo Mo was immense. 'An Immortal,' she noted silently, looking at Qin Jiang with newfound gravity. She hadn't expected him to have an Immortal at his side—and judging by their relationship, it seemed rather... special.

Qin Jiang took Mo Mo's hand. "Come on, we're hitting the casino. Total domination."

"Huh?" Mo Mo blinked. "I don't know how to gamble."

"Doesn't matter if you know how. The point isn't to gamble—it's to dominate."

Qin Jiang grinned. No reputation? Then they'd build one by force. With an Immortal at his side, who'd dare beat him?

Hand in hand with Mo Mo on one side and Lian'er on the other, Qin Jiang strode into the casino with his head held high.
