On the stage.

Chen Ningbing appraised Xiao Fan. She could tell at a glance he was only at the Meridian Condensation Realm.

She shook her head.

"Don't waste your time. You're no match for me."

"Heh, how would you know without trying?"

Xiao Fan smiled faintly.

His eyes brimmed with confidence.

Chen Ningbing frowned, but she rose to her feet and leveled her sword at Xiao Fan.

"If you insist on challenging me, I'll give you the chance."

Sword light surged as she struck, and Xiao Fan's eyes flashed with battle lust.

He clenched his fist—and incredibly, flames coiled around it.

With a low shout, he punched forward, meeting her sharp blade with raw flesh.

A muffled impact rang out. Xiao Fan slid back two steps, and her sword energy shattered beneath his fist.

He exhaled a turbid breath and looked at Chen Ningbing.

"Miss Chen, parlor tricks like that won't beat me."

Chen Ningbing's eyes narrowed. She'd underestimated him. That strike had been strong enough to defeat an ordinary Golden Body Realm cultivator, yet Xiao Fan—a mere Meridian Condensation cultivator—had blocked it with ease.

This was a genuine prodigy.

She grew serious. Her aura sharpened.

"I underestimated you. Now we begin for real."

"Tch, looks like Xiao Fan might actually beat her."

Qin Jiang remarked.

In his arms, Ye Ling'er shuddered slightly. She lowered her head, unwilling to watch the fight.

She knew that with Qin Jiang present, even if Xiao Fan defeated Chen Ningbing, he wouldn't be walking away with the bride. But...

The fact that Xiao Fan had moved on so quickly was genuinely disappointing.

When she thought about it, though, her relationship with Xiao Fan had only ever been that of quasi-siblings. They'd harbored feelings for each other, but neither had spoken them aloud. Xiao Fan pursuing another woman now technically had nothing to do with her.

These thoughts only deepened Ye Ling'er's sense of loss.

More importantly, with Qin Jiang in the picture, there was no longer any possibility between her and Xiao Fan.

Case in point: right now, Xiao Fan was fighting to win another woman's hand, while she nestled in Qin Jiang's embrace. And for reasons she couldn't explain, somewhere deep inside, a strange emotion stirred—something almost like...

Excitement.

Yes, she was actually excited.

The realization filled her with shame—and at the same time, an undeniable thrill. Her cheeks flushed without her permission.

Qin Jiang's expression turned peculiar.

Why was Ye Ling'er blushing?

Early on, when she'd been shy and resistant, holding her close would make her flush. But she'd long since gotten used to that.

This time...

Qin Jiang's gaze suddenly shifted to the stage. Could it be because of Xiao Fan?

He licked his lips, a dark glint surfacing in his eyes. Leaning close to her ear, he whispered:

"When I make my move, you're staying by my side."

"No!"

Ye Ling'er startled awake.

She shook her head frantically. Though she felt that strange excitement, actually facing Xiao Fan while clinging to Qin Jiang was something she couldn't bear to imagine.

But Qin Jiang's expression turned cold. He gripped her chin.

"You don't get to refuse."

"Mm~"

Ye Ling'er's eyes flickered with a plea, her moist red lips trembling.

An utterly pitiful sight.

Qin Jiang lifted her onto the windowsill. He glanced down at Xiao Fan on the stage.

"From this angle, all Xiao Fan has to do is look up."

Qin Jiang leaned forward, the corner of his mouth curving into a wicked smile.

Ye Ling'er trembled. She shot one look at the stage, then quickly turned away, terrified Xiao Fan might see. At the same time, Qin Jiang's heavy breathing made her heart skip.

"You... what are you doing?"

Her voice shook.

Before she could finish, Qin Jiang pressed close against her.

Her face was roughly tilted to face his.

Their breaths mingled.

As his face grew larger in her vision, her pupils contracted.

"No—mm~"

Ye Ling'er went rigid. The tears that had been gathering in her beautiful eyes finally spilled down her cheeks.

An eternity seemed to pass before Qin Jiang finally pulled back.

By then, Ye Ling'er had gone completely limp. Without Qin Jiang holding her, she couldn't have stood. Her breathing was ragged, her face a vivid crimson.

Her eyes were shut tight, lashes trembling.

Qin Jiang looked toward the stage. Chen Ningbing was losing ground. As expected—Xiao Fan possessed the Fire Divine Body, and though he was an entire major realm below her, his Divine Body more than made up for the gap.

He looked down at Ye Ling'er. Whether from the shock of a first kiss or from sheer embarrassment, her consciousness seemed to drift, her eyes stubbornly shut.

Qin Jiang didn't bother asking for her opinion.

He swept her into his arms, vaulted out the window, and in a few flickers of movement, landed on the stage.

One sweep of his arm severed the ongoing fight.

"Xiao Fan. Long time no see."

Qin Jiang looked at Xiao Fan, a faint smile on his lips.

The familiar voice made Xiao Fan go rigid. He looked up, and his eyes contracted sharply.

"Ling'er?!"

Disbelief flooded his face as he stared at Ye Ling'er in Qin Jiang's arms—flushed cheeks, languorous posture...

He could imagine all too well what had transpired.

In an instant, his eyes turned bloodshot. His heart bled. He gnashed his teeth and roared:

"What have you done to Ling'er?!"

The corner of Qin Jiang's mouth lifted. He could feel Ye Ling'er's body tense—she was awake, just refusing to open her eyes, choosing instead to remain curled against his chest.

He looked at Xiao Fan, who seemed ready to devour him alive yet didn't dare make a move. Qin Jiang chuckled lightly and pointed to the restaurant behind him.

"Just now, Ling'er and I were right up at that window, watching you—"

"Shut up!"

Before he could finish, Xiao Fan couldn't bear to hear another word.

Ye Ling'er's face burned hotter. Her body trembled, teeth biting down on her lip. Then, a barely audible sound slipped past, reaching only Qin Jiang's ears.

He blinked, looking down at her. His expression turned distinctly odd.

'No way...'

Ye Ling'er had actually...

He sniffed the air. Sure enough, a faint "fragrance" drifted to his nostrils.

"Qin Jiang, you—"

"Scram!"

Qin Jiang raised his head and bellowed. A shockwave of sound blasted outward, sending Xiao Fan flying.

Right now, he had zero interest in bantering with Xiao Fan.

Ye Ling'er's reaction had left him somewhat speechless. The stimulation had been a bit too effective.

Not pressing the advantage now seemed like a waste.

After a moment's thought, Qin Jiang glanced at Chen Ningbing, then shouted:

"Black Dragon, get over here! Tear down this stage.

"The tournament is over. I'm claiming this woman. Clear everyone out!"
