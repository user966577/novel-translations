"What? Another Immortal?"

Mo Ling's intelligence network was efficient—though this was largely because Qin Jiang wasn't bothering to hide anything. News of Yan Shiya spread quickly.

Mo Ling paced back and forth across his great hall. "Bring me that... what's his name, the human. The yellowish-skinned one."

Previously, he hadn't put much stock in Chen Changsheng's claims. And since Chen Changsheng's looks were decidedly inferior to Qin Jiang's, Mo Ling had decided against sending him over as a gift and simply placed him under house arrest. But now, with yet another Immortal appearing at Qin Jiang's side, he was starting to think Chen Changsheng might have been telling the truth after all.

Chen Changsheng was brought in looking none too happy. His treatment within the Black Water Serpent clan had been far from comfortable.

"You really know that Qin Jiang?" Mo Ling asked.

Chen Changsheng took a steadying breath and nodded. "I do."

He wanted to leverage their strength. A little indignity was a small price to pay, he told himself. At the same time, he sensed that Mo Ling must have learned something new—and that it had earned him a measure of credibility.

He met Mo Ling's eyes squarely. "You should be able to tell—I have a grudge against him. If you want the chieftain's seat, I can help."

"You?" Mo Ling's expression was dismissive. A mere Supreme who fancied himself important?

Rather than argue, Mo Ling produced a portrait—Yan Shiya's likeness—and held it up. "Do you recognize her?"

Chen Changsheng looked and shook his head. "No."

"You don't?" Mo Ling's lip curled. "You claimed there was another Immortal at Qin Jiang's side. Well, this is her."

"What?" Chen Changsheng's eyes widened. "Impossible! I've seen that Immortal—it's definitely not her!"

"She's there right now," Mo Ling said flatly.

It took Chen Changsheng a moment, but realization struck. "Then that means Qin Jiang has four Immortals."

Mo Ling's frown deepened. Four Immortals would make Qin Jiang's force nearly equal to the entire Snake Race. How was he supposed to compete?

One of the Black Water Serpent warriors coughed diplomatically. "Chieftain, whether it's three Immortals or four, it doesn't really change things for us."

Mo Ling glared at him. The man wasn't wrong, but the truth stung.

"Mo Ling," Chen Changsheng pressed, "don't forget—one of Qin Jiang's Immortals is a demonic cultivator. A demon of the highest order. That's the angle you need to exploit."

Most powerhouses at the Immortal level didn't care about demonic cultivation. As long as it didn't affect their interests, they were happy to look the other way. But if their interests were directly threatened, Mo Mo's demonic identity became a lever.

"You're certain?" Mo Ling's eyes sharpened. Against overwhelming strength, this might be the one crack in Qin Jiang's armor.

"I'll swear a Heavenly Dao Oath on it," Chen Changsheng replied.

Convinced at last, Mo Ling drummed his fingers on the table. "A demon..." After a long silence, he rose abruptly and took a deep breath. "Summon the Ancestor."

At the Celestial Rabbit Tribe, Liu Shuwan had successfully fused the Sword Dao Law under Jian Yao's guidance. Though she hadn't fully refined it yet, her strength had vaulted to the Ancient Emperor level. Once the law was completely assimilated, breaking through to the Immortal path would be straightforward.

"Jian Yao, I did it!" Liu Shuwan said, beaming.

Jian Yao nodded, a touch of envy in her eyes. "It took me a thousand years to advance from Great Emperor to Ancient Emperor."

Liu Shuwan had only been a Great Emperor for about two years, and she was already on the cusp of the Immortal path—about to reach the same level as Jian Yao herself.

"It's all thanks to Qin Jiang," Liu Shuwan said softly, smiling. Both women hailed from the Holy Sword Sect, and they'd grown close. Arms linked, Liu Shuwan asked, "Should we go find Qin Jiang?"

"It's only been a few days," Jian Yao teased. "Getting restless already?"

Liu Shuwan's face colored. She had no defense against such wolfish insinuations. "I just... miss him."

"Same thing."

"It's not!"

Jian Yao laughed, then shook her head. "Unfortunately, we can't go just yet. Xue Mei went with Qin Jiang, so there's no strong presence guarding the tribe. If something happens while we're gone..."

"Right," Liu Shuwan conceded, disappointment flickering across her face.

Just then, a vast and domineering aura surged toward the Celestial Rabbit Tribe from outside, its pressure rolling in like a tide.

Jian Yao's expression hardened. "Immortal path!"

She let out a cold snort, and her own piercing aura erupted—a towering phantom blade that cleaved toward the sky. Both women vanished and reappeared high above, where a white-robed figure hovered just beyond the tribe's boundary.

"Who dares cause trouble at the Celestial Rabbit Tribe!" Jian Yao barked.

When she and Qin Jiang had first arrived here, they'd been plenty domineering themselves. But Xue Mei was gentle by nature. Jian Yao was not.

Sword energy churned around her, threatening violence at the slightest provocation. The newcomer was a middle-aged man. His gaze sharpened. "You aren't from the Celestial Rabbit Tribe."

"So what? You have three seconds to leave!"

Jian Yao pointed a finger, and a colossal sword formed from concentrated Sword Intent, its tip aimed squarely at the stranger. The middle-aged man's expression cooled in response.

Just as the two were about to clash—

"Wait, don't fight!" a voice called from below. A figure zipped up and planted herself between them.

It was Hu Xian'er. The silly little fox.

Both cultivators reined in their auras slightly. The middle-aged man relaxed, letting out a quiet breath of relief.

"Xian'er, you know him?" Jian Yao asked.

Hu Xian'er nodded her little head, then turned to the man with a bright smile. "Daddy! What are you doing here?"

Daddy?

Jian Yao blinked. This ditzy little fox was an Immortal's daughter?

The middle-aged man's face hardened. "What do you think? You ran off with some human boy instead of staying with the tribe. Where is he? Bring him out—now!"

He was livid. One moment of inattention, and his precious little girl had been spirited away by some smooth-talking youngster. And the entire White Fox Tribe had nearly gone with her! He'd almost had a stroke.

Hu Xian'er shrank guiltily, stuck her tongue out, and edged closer to Jian Yao for protection.
