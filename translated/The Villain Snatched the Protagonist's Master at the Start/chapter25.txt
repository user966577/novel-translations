Her beautiful eyes flickered. Blood Rose tilted her head, dodging Qin Jiang's hand, and lowered her gaze in a picture of vulnerability.

"This humble woman admires the Young Lord greatly. However, I am but damaged goods—a woman with a past. I dare not entertain such fantasies, lest I sully the Young Lord's hands. Please don't take offense."

"A woman with a past?"

Excitement lit up Qin Jiang's face.

"I love experienced women."

Blood Rose's expression froze. 'That backfired spectacularly.'

But the words were already out. She couldn't take them back—what if she angered him?

Blood Rose could have wept. Her mind raced, searching for an escape from his clutches. Finally, her eyes brightened.

"This humble woman is willing to serve the Young Lord. But should outsiders learn of it, the Young Lord's reputation would surely suffer, and the Qin family name would be tarnished by association.

"Such a terrible sin—this humble woman fears she couldn't bear—"

"Not a problem!"

Before she could finish, Qin Jiang waved his hand grandly.

"Reputation is worthless!

"As long as you give me a baby, you can ruin my reputation all you want."

A baby?!

Blood Rose was on the verge of actual tears. 'I don't want to have a baby!'

Her eyes glistened as genuine fear crept in. What kind of Young Lord acted like a street ruffian?

But she didn't dare resist.

Reason wouldn't work. Fighting wouldn't work. And worst of all...

She'd walked right into this herself.

Blood Rose wanted to kick herself. If she'd known, she never would have shown her face.

"You seem a little reluctant."

Qin Jiang spoke, a chill entering his voice.

Blood Rose snapped to attention and shook her head frantically, forcing a smile.

"Not at all. This humble woman is merely worried..."

Seeing how obviously unwilling she was—her acting had completely fallen apart—Qin Jiang shook his head with a sigh.

"I never use power to force someone's hand.

"How about this—let's make a wager. If I win, you're mine. If I lose, I walk.

"Fair enough?"

Blood Rose's eyes lit up. 'This is my chance!' But she maintained a hesitant expression and asked carefully:

"What does the Young Lord have in mind?"

"Dice. Simple enough.

"But I choose my opponent."

Qin Jiang's gaze drifted to a young man across the room. Ever since Blood Rose had appeared, the young man's eyes hadn't left her. And when Qin Jiang had started flirting, murderous intent had flashed through those eyes.

"You. Step forward."

Qin Jiang pointed at the young man.

Blood Rose followed his gaze and relaxed slightly. She'd been worried Qin Jiang would pick some pushover, but this young man was a different story entirely.

He'd arrived at the casino only days ago, yet he'd already left a deep impression. His gambling skills were otherworldly—even Blood Rose herself had lost to him.

She recalled his name was Xuan Ye.

Sensing her relief, Qin Jiang smiled.

"Think I'm going to lose?"

"Of course not."

"Heh. Let me tell you a secret—they call me the King of Gamblers. I never lose."

The young man stepped forward, his expression cold. Inwardly, though, excitement stirred. 'Isn't this the perfect chance to play the hero?'

His real name was Ye Xuan. He'd infiltrated the casino under a false identity. His original target had been Blood Rose—or rather, the powerful assassin organization behind her.

But the moment he'd laid eyes on her, his priorities had shifted somewhat.

A woman this beautiful—wasn't she more valuable than some assassin guild?

He'd already claimed her as his own in his heart. Now, watching her nestled in Qin Jiang's arms, his killing intent was boiling over.

Blood Rose arranged a table, and the two men took their seats.

Qin Jiang pulled Blood Rose onto his lap.

Ye Xuan looked ready to combust.

Especially when he saw Qin Jiang's hand give her waist a little squeeze.

The jealousy was excruciating.

He steadied himself with a deep breath.

"How does the Young Lord want to play? Winner take all in one round?"

Qin Jiang yawned and shook his head.

"When I've won the entire casino, we'll call it done."

"Heh. Quite the comedian, Young Lord."

Ye Xuan scoffed.

Blood Rose's brow creased. A bad feeling was taking root.

Qin Jiang waved lazily.

"Let's begin. You shake, I call."

Ye Xuan's eyes flashed with hidden glee. 'Is he trying to lose on purpose?'

He picked up a dice cup, showed it briefly to Qin Jiang, then began shaking.

Qin Jiang didn't bother watching. Before the shaking had even stopped, he called out:

"A hundred million spirit stones. Small."

A hundred million?

The crowd erupted with excitement. Opening with stakes that high—the Qin family's wealth was no joke.

Blood Rose's heart trembled. She caught Ye Xuan's eye and gave a subtle signal.

Ye Xuan understood instantly, a cold smirk forming as he set the cup on the table.

"Care to reveal, Young Lord?"

"Go ahead."

Ye Xuan lifted the cup. Four, four, six—big.

"You lose, Young Lord."

"One round proves nothing. Continue."

"But you haven't paid yet."

"What—afraid the Qin family will stiff you?"

"The Qin family wouldn't. But the Young Lord..."

Before he could finish, Blood Rose cut him off sharply.

"Xuan Ye! Do your job and mind your own business."

Her rebuke darkened Ye Xuan's face.

He swallowed his anger, picked up the cup, and began shaking again.

"One billion. Small."

Ye Xuan sneered. No surprise—Qin Jiang lost again.

"Ten billion. Small."

The dice cup opened. Four, five, six—big.

Qin Jiang didn't even glance at the result.

"A hundred billion. Still small."

Blood Rose's fists clenched in her lap, her brow knitted tight. She lifted her gaze to Qin Jiang's serene face, and the realization struck like a bolt of lightning.

At the same moment, Qin Jiang looked down at her, the corner of his mouth lifting.

"Scared?"

A bitter expression crossed Blood Rose's face. If this continued, the Qin family's fortune—vast as it was—could be gambled away entirely. But...

Did she dare collect on the debt?

She did not.

More importantly—what if Qin Jiang wagered the entire Qin family? Did she dare win?

She absolutely did not.

The moment she won a sum like that, the Qin family would come knocking. Having their Young Lord humiliated at a gambling den would be an unforgivable loss of face. Qin Jiang claimed he didn't care about reputation, but who in their right mind would take that at face value?

She couldn't afford to win.

But the stakes were already astronomical. If Qin Jiang somehow turned the tables, what could she put up? The entire casino wasn't worth a fraction of what was on the table.

The truth dawned on her, bitter as wormwood. This wasn't gambling.

This was a contest of who had the bigger backing.

She let out a hollow laugh and looked up at Qin Jiang, unable to stop herself.

"Young Lord, may I call you shameless?"

Qin Jiang smiled.

"I'll take that as a compliment."
