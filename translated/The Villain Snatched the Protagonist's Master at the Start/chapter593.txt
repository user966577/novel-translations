"Faster—"

In the bedroom, the woman whispered the word, eyes half-closed, barely conscious of what she was saying. Qin Jiang leaned down and kissed her lips. Happy to oblige.

As he moved, he stroked her cheek and murmured, "Guess what? Zhao Sheng just arrived at the Yang estate."

"Mm?"

At the name, her body trembled and her dazed eyes cleared slightly. Qin Jiang didn't slow down. He leaned close to her ear and whispered, "Want to go see him together?"

"Mm—no—"

Her voice wavered. She bit her lip and clung to Qin Jiang. A long while later, she finally exhaled and went limp against him.

Qin Jiang held her, smoothing her hair. "Exciting, wasn't it?"

"Pervert." She shot him a look, though her voice carried no force.

He knew she had feelings for Zhao Sheng, so at precisely the right moments, he kept mentioning the name—sending jolts through her that she couldn't control.

"This time I'm not making it up. He's really here." Qin Jiang grinned.

She looked at him skeptically. "He's actually here?"

"Yep." Qin Jiang nodded. "And if I'm not mistaken, he probably came for you."

Silence. A week ago, knowing Zhao Sheng had come for her would have made her heart sing. But now... she glanced at Qin Jiang. Whatever else could be said about him, she was his woman now. And honestly, setting aside his methods, he wasn't bad. Just terrible, in a very specific way.

As for Zhao Sheng—they'd met exactly once. She'd fallen for him at first sight, and everything she knew about him afterward had come secondhand. The emotional depth just wasn't there.

Over the years, she'd kept thinking about him partly from genuine attraction, partly because of the circumstances. The Zhao family's rise had come at the Yang family's expense—and it was her fault. She'd intervened to protect him and paid the price in status and standing. The regret had gnawed at her more than once, but what was done was done. All she could do was double down on her bet and hope it paid off.

But now, with Qin Jiang in the picture, the bet was moot. The table had been flipped.

She didn't know what Qin Jiang was thinking, so she kept her thoughts to herself. 'Married to a chicken, follow the chicken. Married to a dog, follow the dog.' She was this man's woman now. Whatever came, she should stand with him.

"Don't you want to see him?" Qin Jiang asked.

She looked at him and turned the question around. "Do you want me to?"

"Up to you."

"Then no." She shook her head.

As the words left her mouth, a weight lifted. All those years of obsession and resentment—it was time to let them go. The gambling table had been overturned. She could finally walk out of the casino. Zhao Sheng? That chapter was closed.

In that moment, something in her bearing shifted. Qin Jiang noticed instantly. She'd let go? That quickly? He clicked his tongue, then held her close.

"Tired?"

"A little."

"Alright." He pinched her cheek. "Rest up, then I'll take you to meet Zhao Sheng."

"Why would I need to see him?"

"Come on—your old flame. You really don't want one last look?"

"What old flame?" She swatted his chest, annoyed. "We met once. We never even spoke!"

"You don't like him?"

"I—" She clenched her fist, staring at Qin Jiang. "I was young back then..."

"So you don't like him anymore?"

"No!" She shook her head emphatically, a flicker of anxiety in her eyes—as if terrified Qin Jiang would get the wrong idea.

He studied her with a scrutinizing look. She doubled down. "Really!"

"Fine. I'll take your word for it." He nodded.

She exhaled—but Qin Jiang followed up immediately. "Do you like me?"

Her expression froze. They'd barely just met. If she was being honest, the feelings weren't deep. She found him attractive, and his power was impressive. But beyond that, he didn't exactly have a lot of redeeming qualities. He'd forced himself on her, threatened her family. Fear outweighed affection.

Still, what was done was done. Their futures were bound together now.

"I... like you. I think."

She sounded unsure even to herself, blinking in a way that screamed guilty conscience. Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. She was clearly just going through the motions. No matter. Give it time. Eventually, she wouldn't be able to live without him.

"Get some sleep." He shook his head.

He lay down, pulling her against him. She rested on his chest, sneaking peeks at his face. After a moment's hesitation, she whispered, "Really."

"What?"

"I like you."

Color crept into her cheeks—from lying, or from shyness, she couldn't tell.

"Yeah, yeah. I know." Qin Jiang smiled, ruffled her hair, and pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Sleep now."

"Okay." She nodded.

She really was tired. One last look at him, and she closed her eyes. They didn't stay closed long.

"Are you jealous?" she asked.

Qin Jiang blinked, then nodded with absolute seriousness. "Absolutely. Green with envy."

She had the distinct feeling he was performing again. But after a brief hesitation, she leaned in and pressed her lips to his cheek—the first time she'd kissed him of her own volition. Pulling back, cheeks flushed, she murmured, "I really do like you."

"Really?"

"Mm."

Then she saw him tap his own lips with a finger. Without hesitating this time, she leaned in and kissed him there too. A light peck—she started to pull away.

His hand caught the back of her head. His kiss came in hot, consuming, and she went wide-eyed, nearly forgetting to breathe. After a token struggle, she closed her eyes and let him have his way.
