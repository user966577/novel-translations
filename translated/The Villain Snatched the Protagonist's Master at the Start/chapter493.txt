Qin Jiang didn't pressure Wu Yingtao. Instead, he showered her with attention to build closeness gradually.

After all, this time the Child of Destiny was her biological brother. Winning her over emotionally -- surpassing that sibling bond through physical desire alone -- would be difficult. He needed to play the long game.

Of course, while deepening his relationship with Wu Yingtao, he also needed to create cracks in the sibling bond. That meant targeting Wu Tian directly. A reincarnated Immortal Emperor probably wouldn't feel deeply attached to his current-life relationships. And with a little prodding, Wu Yingtao might come to believe that her brother had died long ago -- his body stolen by a monster.

Wu Tian's dramatic personality shift would inevitably raise questions. As long as Wu Yingtao wasn't willfully blind, suspicion was inevitable. Then Qin Jiang could kill Wu Tian and frame it as avenging her brother. That would deepen their bond even further.

As he strategized, Wu Yingtao studied his face from his arms. Seeing his deep-in-thought expression, she assumed he was contemplating how to bring her to the Ancient God Race. Gratitude stirred in her chest.

He'd done so much for her. Shouldn't she give something back? But with her limited means, the only thing she could offer was...

Her face reddened. After a brief internal struggle, she bit her lip, gathered her courage, and tipped her head up to press her lips against his.

Qin Jiang, still deep in thought, felt the warm contact and blinked in surprise. Instinct took over and he kissed her back. But before he could savor it, she jerked away like a startled rabbit and buried her face against his chest.

He blinked again. This girl had just kissed him out of nowhere? Had she been captivated by his good looks?

A grin spread across his face. He tilted her chin up and teased, "Kiss and run? How is that any different from lighting a fire and not putting it out?"

"I didn't--"

"You know, a kiss carries responsibilities," he cut in with a chuckle.

While raw desire alone wouldn't bridge the gap with Wu Yingtao, a bit of flirting mixed with genuine care would speed things along nicely.

Her face was scarlet. "What kind of responsibilities?"

"Well, you tell me. That was my first kiss of the day, and you stole it. Don't you owe me something?"

"???"

First kiss of the day? Was that even a thing?

She looked at his innocent expression and almost bought it. But she caught herself and whispered, "That was my first kiss too."

"Your first kiss of the day too?"

"I--" She shook her head quickly. If this scoundrel counted her actual first kiss as merely today's first kiss, she'd be getting the raw end of the deal. "It was just my first kiss. Not 'today's first kiss.'"

"Oh! Your first kiss."

"Mm-hmm."

"Well, if it was your first kiss, you should really experience it properly -- make it memorable. But just now, the experience wasn't great, was it?"

"It was fine."

"No, it wasn't!"

"I--"

Before she could finish, his lips sealed hers. Her eyes went wide, heart racing.

He held her close, one hand gently patting her back, easing her nerves. Before long, her body relaxed. Her arms looped around his neck, and she began kissing him back, savoring it this time.

After a long while, Qin Jiang lifted his head. Wu Yingtao's eyes were dewy, her body soft, her head resting against his chest. Her lips were parted slightly, still lost in the afterglow.

He kissed her cheek. "Memorable enough now?"

"Mm-hmm." She nodded shyly.

It truly was unforgettable. She wanted to do it again. But she was too embarrassed to ask outright. She glanced at him, then said innocently, "It was a little bit memorable."

"A little bit?"

She nodded, looking at him expectantly.

He saw right through her. The little minx was baiting him. He tightened his hold and smiled. "Well then, I'll just have to deepen the impression."

He kissed her again, harder this time. She responded eagerly. Kissing felt wonderful -- she wished it could go on forever.

He obliged, teasing and toying with her for the better part of an hour. She grew bolder, initiating several kisses herself, and their intimacy escalated rapidly.

When their lips finally parted again, she glanced down and shot him a look. His hands had gotten increasingly adventurous during their makeout session, and her clothes were in disarray.

She started straightening her dress, but he caught her hand. "Don't bother. They're just going to get messed up again."

"..."

She puffed her cheeks and huffed, but stopped fussing. After all, she'd been chosen by him. Her future was decided -- she'd be with him. Today kissing, tomorrow touching, the day after...

Actually, it might not take until the day after. The heat in his eyes suggested he might devour her on the spot.

"Come here. One more kiss."

She nodded and wrapped her arms around his neck, leaning in. The sensation was truly intoxicating.

After quite a while more, she looked down and rolled her eyes. He'd escalated from touching to tugging at her clothes, and now... her clothes were gone. He'd stripped her completely and tossed everything aside.

"Jerk," she whispered.

He held her tight, wearing his most innocent expression. "I noticed you were sweating. I figured you were hot, so I helped you cool off."

"I'm not hot."

"Then why are you sweating?"

"That's not sweat, it's..."

"Hm? Not sweat? Then what is it?"

Her face turned crimson. She opened her mouth but couldn't bring herself to say it. She huffed and turned away. "I'm ignoring you!"

"Come on, don't be mad. Let me wipe the sweat off for you."

"No!"
