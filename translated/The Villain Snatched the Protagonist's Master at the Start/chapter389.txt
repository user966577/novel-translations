Qin Jiang took his seat. Every cultivator bowed, faces tense. The man himself had appeared. Whatever came next would decide their fates.

Under their anxious gazes, Qin Jiang settled into the main seat, swept his eyes across the assembly, and nodded to the Li Family Ancestor.

The old man stepped forward, beaming at the crowd. "Esteemed colleagues — half a month ago, my Li family was honored to receive the Manor Lord's blessing and join Huaxia. I'm sure you're all quite envious."

A brief silence, then the cultivators fell over themselves agreeing. Compliments about Huaxia flowed like water.

The ancestor nodded along, soaking it in. After a while, he raised a hand for quiet. "I know you all share that admiration. So I have wonderful news: I've personally secured admission spots for you! The Manor Lord is right here. Anyone wishing to join Huaxia may register directly. As long as you meet the requirements, the Manor Lord won't make things difficult. Spots are limited — first come, first served!"

The mood soured. They'd guessed Qin Jiang would absorb them into Huaxia, but this? Somehow, it had been reframed as them begging for the privilege.

Silence.

Some of the smaller factions were willing — even eager — but the major powers hadn't moved yet, and no one wanted to paint a target on themselves. After Qin Jiang left, the big factions might make them pay for stepping out of line.

So all eyes turned to the top-tier powers.

Qin Jiang watched with an amused smile, a strange rune dancing on his fingertip.

The True Spirit Slave Seal.

He'd never used it before, but he'd refined quite a stock. Once implanted in a target's Primordial Spirit, it created permanent, inescapable enslavement. Even future breakthroughs couldn't shake it — the seal would simply absorb the host's power and upgrade itself.

He'd prepared several True Immortal-grade seals. Time to see if they worked.

"It seems you're all too stunned by the good news to react," Qin Jiang said pleasantly. "Shall I help wake you up?"

Nervous laughter and hasty nodding.

"Perhaps a little demonstration?" He toyed with a True Immortal-grade seal, eyeing the seven True Immortals with open curiosity.

Their hearts lurched.

Before any could speak, Qin Jiang flicked the seal at one of them. The man's face changed — he was about to resist when An Xihe materialized in front of Qin Jiang, her gaze boring into him. Immortal King pressure descended like a mountain.

"Immortal King!"

He flinched. His resistance crumbled. The seal shot into his brow.

He stood frozen for a moment, then agony twisted his features. One hand clutched his head, body trembling, cold sweat streaming — but he clenched his jaw and made no sound.

A tough one.

Qin Jiang watched the seal burrow into the man's Primordial Spirit, embedding itself layer by layer. Once it fully merged, the target would be permanently under his control. Even reincarnation wouldn't break the bond.

About an hour passed. Everyone watched.

Finally, the True Immortal staggered, and the tension drained from his face. He gasped for air. The seal flickered once at his brow and vanished from sight. He raised his head and met Qin Jiang's eyes with a complicated expression.

The seal had fused completely with his Primordial Spirit. He could feel it — his entire existence was now in Qin Jiang's hands. If Qin Jiang told him to die, he wouldn't hesitate.

With a sigh, he dropped to one knee. "Your subordinate Sun Qian greets his master. From this day forward, Sun Qian and his faction pledge themselves to Huaxia — through fire and flood, without reservation."

"Good."

Qin Jiang smiled and raised him with a wave. "Sun Qian — from now on, you are the Vice Lord of the Huaxia Grey Cloud Heaven Branch."

"Yes, sir."

The Li Family Ancestor sidled over and clapped Sun Qian on the shoulder. "Old Sun, you and I are going to build something great here."

Sun Qian was Vice Lord. The Li Family Ancestor was Lord.

Qin Jiang introduced them properly and instructed the two to cooperate in developing the branch. Both agreed readily.

The remaining six True Immortals exchanged glances. They didn't know exactly what had happened, but one thing was clear: Qin Jiang had methods to deal with them. And the Immortal King was still very much present.

With the Li Family Ancestor and Sun Qian now flanking Qin Jiang, six pairs of True Immortal eyes stared back at the remaining holdouts.

Qin Jiang smiled mildly. "Still processing?"

Another seal coalesced on his fingertip. An Xihe released a fresh pulse of pressure.

The six True Immortals managed strained smiles. There was no escape. And with a branch already established, resistance meant extermination. Living, all things considered, was preferable.

Under Qin Jiang's gaze, they stopped hesitating. One by one, they declared their allegiance.

Qin Jiang nodded pleasantly. "Wonderful. Please register first. After processing, there'll be a brief review. Meet the requirements, and I won't make things difficult."

The crowd seethed internally. 'You forced us to join, and now you want us to fill out applications? And take an exam?'

'The audacity.'

But no one dared voice their thoughts. They lined up before the Li Family Ancestor and began filling out registration forms.

The old man distributed them with a magnanimous grin. "No need to rush — plenty for everyone..."
