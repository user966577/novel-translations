In the mountain retreat, inside one of the rooms, Weiwei fixed Qin Jiang with a stern look.

He sat in a chair, calmly sipping tea.

That lasted until a bare foot landed on his thigh. He looked up. "What's wrong, my little Weiwei?"

"Hmph!" She leaned forward, her face inches from his, and enunciated every word. "You. Groped. My. Master."

"Oh?" He smiled, took hold of the offending foot, and gave it a gentle squeeze. "You saw?"

"What do you think?" She rolled her eyes. "I saw exactly where your hand went — right to her..."

Before she could finish, he recreated the move on her.

"Here?" he asked innocently.

"You—" She went soft, one hand gripping his shoulder for balance, the other clamping down on his wandering hand. "Stop that~"

"Fine, I'll stop." His hand froze in place — right where it was — while his other arm looped around her waist and pulled her into his lap.

She yelped. His hand technically hadn't moved, but her body had — and the result left her melting against him.

After a moment to recover, she exhaled and gave him a halfhearted slap. "You're the worst~"

"Hehe, doesn't Weiwei like it?"

"Hmph." She didn't answer. Instead, she steered the conversation back on track. "Don't change the subject. We were talking about my master. You want to make her yours too, don't you?"

"I've thought about it," he admitted.

She wasn't surprised — she'd expected this before they even came. Her master was a beauty, after all. She just hadn't anticipated how quickly this rascal would make his move — hands roaming within minutes of their first meeting. He'd practically traumatized the poor woman.

He leaned in until their foreheads touched. "Does that bother you, Weiwei?"

"No~" She blushed and kissed his cheek. "Master has taken care of me all these years. I've always wanted to give her a gift."

"A gift?"

"So I brought you."

He stared at her. "I'm the gift?"

He pinched her cheek. "This might be the first time someone's treated me as a gift to be given away."

"Well? Will you be the gift or not?"

"...Deal."

"I knew it — with Master's looks, there's no way you'd pass." She grinned.

He flicked her forehead, then shifted tone. "Isn't it a bit improper for me to go after my own mother-in-law?"

"Mother-in-law?" She puffed her cheeks. "Oh, you did that on purpose! Calling her 'Mother-in-law' to her face while your hands were anything but respectful!"

"You two really are like mother and daughter — so she really is my mother-in-law."

As he spoke, his eyes gleamed with excitement, and Weiwei felt a certain... change press against her. She blushed and tapped his chest. "Pervert."

This man was clearly getting off on the idea. Though honestly, she and her master did share a mother-daughter bond — they were family in every way that mattered. The thought sent an unexpected thrill through her too. She could already picture it: herself and her master, together, with Qin Jiang...

She swallowed and looked at him with heated eyes. "You have a plan, right?"

"Nope."

"No plan?"

"Do I need one? Whenever the mood strikes, I strike."

She blinked. "Then... how about tonight?"

He kissed her cheek. "Someone's eager."

"It's not like that~" She buried her face in his chest. "Master's never been with a man. She must be so lonely. I just want her to be happy sooner."

"Is that so?"

"Of course!"

"Well then, you really are a filial daughter."

"Naturally~" She accepted the compliment without a shred of shame, then wrapped her arms around his neck. "So — tonight?"

"Isn't it a bit fast?"

"Not really. Besides, you already made contact today."

"Ahem. Barely."

She giggled. "Then go make more contact. She'll love it."

She pulled him to his feet, dragged him out the door, and marched him to Mu Yunxiao's room. He glanced at her. Weiwei balled her fists and pumped them encouragingly. "You go in alone," she whispered.

"Shouldn't the gift-giver present the gift in person?"

"You're a gift, and she's a gift. You're my gift to her, and she's my gift to you. Gifts should find each other organically."

"Right now, I'm the only one going anywhere."

"Same difference." She waved him off, knocked on the door, and scurried back to her own room.

He watched her go with a rueful shake of his head. From inside, a voice called out:

"Who is it?"
