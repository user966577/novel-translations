The Fox Race's territory was a paradise — emerald hills, crystal waters, and wisps of celestial mist rising through the canopy.

"Damn, that's gorgeous."

Even the Snake Race, fellow overlords, had rougher territory. This was how a cultivation haven should look.

Hu Xian'er beamed, hands on hips. "Our Fox Race is pretty great, right?"

"Can't argue with that."

An Xihe rolled her eyes at his vocabulary. Such beautiful scenery, and the best he could manage was that. Her man had no culture.

"Should we just go in?" she asked.

"I already told Father. They should be out to greet us any minute."

This time, only three had come — Qin Jiang, An Xihe, and Hu Xian'er. Meeting the in-laws with other women in tow seemed inappropriate. As for An Xihe — inappropriate or not, she was coming.

The words had barely left Hu Xian'er's mouth when streaks of light shot out from the Fox Race's territory. At their head was Hu Yan, the Fox Race chieftain.

"Daddy!" Hu Xian'er waved excitedly, though her other arm remained hooked through Qin Jiang's.

Hu Yan's expression darkened. Before Qin Jiang, his daughter would always take his arm when they met. Now she wouldn't even let go of this boy. He felt a pang.

Qin Jiang, all smiles, greeted him warmly. "Good to see you again, Uncle."

"Mm." Hu Yan grunted a curt acknowledgment, refusing to look at him. His face only softened when he turned to his daughter. "Xian'er, come home with Daddy."

"Okay!" She agreed cheerfully — then towed Qin Jiang along by the arm. "Qin Jiang, Xihe-jiejie, let's go in."

An Xihe studied Hu Yan. This man's attitude toward her man needed correcting. What kind of person had the gall to give her man the cold shoulder?

They entered the Fox Race's grounds. Hu Yan dismissed the other elders and led the three of them to a quiet courtyard — his home. This was family business, not a formal affair.

Inside, a door opened and a beautiful middle-aged woman emerged.

"Mommy!" Hu Xian'er released Qin Jiang and bounced into her mother's arms.

The woman held her daughter close, tweaked her nose, then turned her gaze to Qin Jiang. "You must be Xiao Jiang."

"Hello, Auntie."

She appraised him and nodded approvingly. The looks alone earned him major points. As for the rest — she'd only heard Hu Yan's version, which contained precious few compliments. But the fact that he'd brought Qin Jiang home at all meant he'd accepted the young man, loath as he was to admit it.

Her eyes drifted to An Xihe and she frowned slightly. This woman's presence was overwhelming. Another of Qin Jiang's? Would her daughter be pushed around? Hu Xian'er's personality — sweet, naive, a bit airheaded — was delightful for a man, but in a crowded household, it left her vulnerable.

"Hehe, Mommy, isn't my husband wonderful?" Hu Xian'er chirped.

The adoration in her gaze was unmistakable. Her mother smiled and patted her head. "Any man my daughter chooses must be wonderful."

Hu Xian'er preened, then remembered why they'd come. "Daddy, Qin Jiang has something to discuss with you."

"Oh?" Hu Yan frowned, looking at Qin Jiang.

"I'm establishing a faction," Qin Jiang said. "I'd like all three of the Demon Domain's great powers to join."

Hu Yan's face changed. His wife looked equally startled. The audacity — wanting all three overlords under his banner.

"Did the Snake Race agree?" Hu Yan was sharp enough to figure out Qin Jiang had visited them first.

Qin Jiang nodded.

"And the Wolf Race?"

He blinked, then slapped his forehead theatrically. "Oh, right — I forgot. The Wolf Race doesn't exist anymore."

He turned to An Xihe and pointed toward the Wolf Race's territory. "Xihe, go ahead."

An Xihe nodded. Immortal King pressure erupted from her — and as she glanced casually at Hu Yan, the sheer weight of it buckled his knees. He staggered and collapsed.

A small lesson in manners.

Without another look at him, she gazed toward the Wolf Race — hundreds of miles away — and brought her palm down.

The entire Demon Domain shuddered. A colossal hand, blotting out the sky, descended upon the Wolf Race like divine punishment.

In an instant, the Wolf Race was annihilated.

An Xihe withdrew her aura. Qin Jiang looked at Hu Yan and raised an eyebrow. "Goodness, Uncle, did you trip?"

Hu Yan scrambled to his feet, face burning. He'd caught the message loud and clear — this Immortal King was Qin Jiang's woman, and she did not appreciate his rudeness.

"Daddy, are you okay?" Hu Xian'er asked with concern.

"Fine, fine." He waved it off, forcing a smile. "Been exercising a lot lately. Legs got a bit wobbly."

A Human Immortal, wobbly from exercise. Even the dog wouldn't believe that. But Hu Xian'er did. She nodded earnestly. "You should rest more, Daddy."

He turned to Qin Jiang — no longer cold-faced — and rubbed his hands together with an almost obsequious smile. "So, ah... son-in-law, what were you saying?"

"Establishing a faction—"

"A faction! Does it need the Fox Race's support? We've got some strength, you know."

"..."

"Tell you what — I'll pledge the Fox Race to your faction right now. How's that?"
