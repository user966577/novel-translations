"Revenge?"

Deep in the girl's eyes, a spark of hatred glimmered—but her timid nature smothered it before it could surface.

Qin Jiang smiled gently. "If you want revenge, I can help."

She looked up, wavering. "But the Ninth Prince is the Dragon Emperor's most beloved son..."

"So what?" Qin Jiang's voice dripped with disdain. "Forget a prince—if I wanted to move against the Dragon Emperor himself, he'd have no choice but to sit there and take it."

He pointed skyward at the colossal airship visible from any point in the city.

"Yesterday's commotion—you heard about it?"

She nodded. The entire city knew. It was impossible to miss. But most ordinary citizens hadn't dared raise their heads under the Emperor aura, so few had actually seen Qin Jiang's face.

"The person who stormed the imperial city yesterday? That was me."

The girl's lips parted in shock. It clicked—the Ninth Prince had called this man "Third Brother-in-law." And yesterday's uproar had been caused by the Third Princess's husband.

"You... you'd really help me?"

Hope kindled in her eyes.

Qin Jiang nodded. "But nothing in this world comes free. I can help you, but you'll need to offer something in return."

"Oh?" Her face fell. "But I have nothing left."

"That's not true." Qin Jiang stepped forward until they were nearly touching, then leaned down to murmur in her ear. "Your greatest asset is yourself."

Her face turned scarlet. Her body went rigid.

Qin Jiang was so close she could feel the heat radiating from him, his breath warm against her skin. Her heart hammered. She tilted her head back, taking in his handsome features from inches away, and swallowed involuntarily.

So handsome.

"For now, just stay by my side. Whenever you've made up your mind, come find me."

He stepped back with an easy smile.

The girl nodded, her cheeks still burning, small hands twisting together to manage the butterflies in her stomach.

Then Qin Jiang reached out and took one of those fidgeting hands. She tensed for a heartbeat before relaxing into his grip.

"Come with me?"

"Mm."

Holding his hand, the girl kept her head down as she followed. Then she looked up, volunteering for the first time:

"My name is Xia Qianling. You can call me Qianling."

"Qianling?" Qin Jiang nodded. "Beautiful name."

He'd known it from the spoilers, of course.

The compliment brought a small, pleased smile to her face. "My mother chose it. Father said she was from a good family—well-educated. She passed away not long after I was born."

Her voice dimmed. Now she had no family left in the world at all.

Qin Jiang squeezed her hand. "You're the continuation of their lives. As long as you're alive, as long as you remember them, they haven't truly disappeared. And I'm sure they'd want you to live well."

"I'll remember them forever," Xia Qianling said solemnly.

At that moment, another soft hand claimed Qin Jiang's free one. He turned to find Liu Shuwan gazing at him with eloquent reproach.

He chuckled, squeezed her hand in return, and interlaced their fingers.

One on each side.

Perfect.

Qin Lian'er, meanwhile, was relegated to trailing behind on her own.

They continued exploring the city. Qin Jiang bought Xia Qianling several new outfits—subdued colors, given her recent loss—along with a few accessories, then headed back to the Third Princess's mansion.

"Change into something fresh," he told her.

He set her up in a room and had the servants prepare a tub of hot water.

"Have a bath first, then change."

"Okay."

Xia Qianling nodded softly.
