Deep in the forest, Nangong Yun stood wrapped in leaves, his face a mask of humiliated fury. The Zhou family was toying with him.

He tilted his head back, fighting tears — and spotted the Zhou family's pursuit team overhead. He dropped flat into the underbrush, smothering his aura until he blended seamlessly with the foliage.

But the new pursuers were Ancient Emperors. Even concealed, they detected the anomaly instantly. Every eye turned toward his hiding spot. They couldn't kill him, but humiliation was fair game — just like the Human Immortal before them. And they had recording stones.

The group exchanged glances and grinned.

One of them flicked a finger. Fire bloomed where Nangong Yun hid, spreading rapidly. When the flames reached him, he burst from cover — his leaf covering was all he had. If that burned away, he'd be exposed again.

He looked around. Fire everywhere. Above, the Zhou family operatives watched with amusement. He could hear their laughter.

"Quick, record this!"

"The sole heir of the Nangong family, reduced to this. What a disgrace."

"Let's bring the recordings to the Nangong family ruins. Dedicate them to our old rivals."

Nangong Yun clenched his jaw. Damn them all.

Standing in the inferno, he looked up at his tormentors with murder in his eyes. But he was powerless. He had to endure. They weren't in a rush to kill him — they wanted to humiliate him. That meant he could survive, if he swallowed the degradation. As long as he lived, revenge would come.

He stopped running. He stood in the blaze and let the fire consume every last leaf on his body. Coated in soot and ash, the darkness ironically gave him a kind of armor.

"Can't see anything through all that grime. Give him a wash."

A jet of water slammed into him, stripping away every trace of soot. His fragile shield vanished. His face flushed crimson as their eyes crawled over him, recording stones capturing everything.

They landed in front of him, making no effort to hide their appraisal.

"Nice and pale, at least. But that little thing... Looks like the Nangong line is truly ending."

"My three-year-old son is bigger."

"That tiny, he couldn't even get through the door."

"Forget the door — no one would look at him twice."

They critiqued him openly. Then one reached out and flicked.

"Ow!" Nangong Yun howled, leaping into the air, face burning.

In truth, it hadn't always been this small. It used to be a full centimeter longer — before Xue Yue had crushed it to paste. By the time it regenerated, it had come back smaller. He'd mourned the loss, but with his master, senior sister, and Xue Yue all gone, he'd figured he might never use it anyway.

Now it was being mocked. And flicked.

"Got bigger! Look at that!" one exclaimed.

"That's not bigger — it's swollen. You hit too hard."

"Swollen? Looks a bit better, actually. Hey kid, I made it bigger for you. Shouldn't you thank me?"

Nangong Yun clenched his jaw and said nothing. The man frowned and flicked again.

"Answer when spoken to!"

Nangong Yun screamed and collapsed, eyes bulging, body convulsing. He writhed on the ground, face twisted in agony.

"Is it that painful?" The man crouched and flicked once more.

Nangong Yun let out a strangled shriek, went rigid — and passed out cold.

The others winced. The phantom pain was contagious. Blood seeped from the swollen mess. Someone spoke up nervously. "I think you broke it."

"Probably done for."

"He won't die from that, will he? He's not supposed to die!"

"Well... probably not?"

"He looks kind of dead."

"Then we fix it! Cut it off — no more pain!"

"Right, right — the pain's what's killing him. Just remove the source!"

"I'll do it!"

They scrambled into action. One of them sliced cleanly, removing the damaged parts. Nangong Yun's eyes flew open with an agonized scream — only to find the severed pieces stuffed into his mouth. Along with the two accompanying items.

The realization of what he was tasting hit him. He looked at his tormentors with eyes that could set the world on fire.

That had just healed.

They surrounded him, grinning. "Congratulations — you're a girl now."

Nangong Yun's eyes rolled back, and he collapsed.
