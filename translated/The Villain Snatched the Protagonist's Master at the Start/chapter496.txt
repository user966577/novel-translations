The faction leaders exchanged glances, and one spoke tentatively. "Just become subordinates?"

Truthfully, they'd expected this and had mentally prepared. But they worried about the cost—they'd seen what happened to the Zhou family and the Blood Tribe.

"Not just that, obviously," Qin Jiang said mildly.

Their hearts clenched. Under their anxious gazes, he swept the room and spoke. "As Huaxia subordinates, you'll serve Huaxia. Your mindset needs to shift—from now on, everything revolves around Huaxia. Huaxia will become your foundation."

The tension drained from the room. That was it?

This Manor Lord wasn't as terrifying as the rumors suggested. If they'd known it would be this easy, they'd have submitted immediately instead of spending weeks in dread.

Without further hesitation, they rose in unison and bowed. "We greet the Manor Lord!"

"At ease." He smiled, lifting them with a wave of energy. "Sit down."

With the biggest question settled, relief spread through the room.

"Since you've all joined, we'll need a Huaxia branch office here in Mystic Cloud Heaven," Qin Jiang continued. "Choose a branch lord from among yourselves to manage affairs. Beyond your factions, the entire realm needs to be brought under Huaxia's banner. That's on you. I'll send people to assist later."

"Rest assured, Manor Lord. We'll see it done." They looked at him expectantly. "As for the branch lord, we defer to your judgment."

"Pick someone yourselves." He waved dismissively. "If I choose, some of you might not accept it, and then you'll be fighting among yourselves."

"Manor Lord, whomever you choose, we would gladly support--"

He'd had the same situation in Grey Cloud Heaven, where Li Qingqiu's connection had made the Li Family Ancestor the natural choice. But here in Mystic Cloud Heaven, he'd taken women from nearly every faction. He couldn't play favorites.

"It's decided. You pick. I don't care how—just make sure everyone's on board. Once you've chosen, serve Huaxia well. Otherwise, I'll deal with you personally."

They stiffened and nodded. "Rest assured, Manor Lord. We will serve diligently."

He outlined Huaxia's rules and benefits, gave them a few reminders, and left.

Back aboard the airship, An Xihe appeared before him instantly, glancing outside. "All submitted?"

"Mm-hmm." He walked over and pulled her into his arms. "With you keeping watch, how could they not?"

She'd been monitoring everything from the airship. While she hadn't shown herself, her subtle pressure had been felt by every faction leader below. Of course, the real purpose was protecting Qin Jiang's safety—the women were always vigilant about that.

She hugged him back, allure flickering in her eyes. Her fingers traced his jaw. "Then... shouldn't you show some gratitude?"

"I..." He swallowed, gazing at that bewitching face. "I should."

Her lips curved. She draped her arms around his neck, pressed herself against him, and nipped his earlobe. "Somewhere private. And be thorough."

"Where?"

"My room."

"Done."

They vanished. The next instant, they were in her quarters. With a burst of qi, their clothing disintegrated, and he tackled her onto the bed.

She yelped and swatted him. "What's the rush?"

"Can you blame me?" Even a veteran like him couldn't resist that kind of provocation.

She pushed him back, propped herself on one side, and traced a finger under his chin. "Call me 'big sister.' Otherwise, you don't get any."

"..."

He blinked, then adopted a guileless expression. "Big sister..."

"Good boy." She giggled, cupped his face, kissed him, then patted his head. "Big sister helped you so much today. How is little brother going to repay her?"

He replied with exaggerated innocence. "Whatever big sister wants."

"What do you have?"

"I..." He looked himself over and said bashfully, "Just myself."

"Yourself?"

"My body."

"Oh, please." She pushed him flat and climbed on top. "Then let big sister inspect whether your body is adequate repayment."

"Okay."

He lay back, perfectly cooperative.

After a while, he asked, "Is big sister done inspecting?"

"Mm... give me a minute." Her voice came out muffled, as though something were in the way.

He didn't rush her, just closed his eyes.

Four hours later, An Xihe wiped her mouth and curled up against his chest, looking thoroughly satisfied. "Little brother's body is quite impressive."

"Is big sister pleased?"

"Very."

"Then this counts as adequate repayment?"

"It does. But little brother isn't allowed to slack off." She grinned.
