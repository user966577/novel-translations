She greeted her grandfather first, then turned her attention to Qin Jiang's group. Her gaze swept across them and landed squarely on Qin Jiang.

This guy is so handsome!

Her eyes sparkled. She leapt off the shark, planted one hand on her hip, pointed straight at Qin Jiang, and declared, "Grandpa, I want this one!"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. A real princess, this one—demanding ownership of him without so much as a hello. She'd need some training.

The Third Elder, meanwhile, went pale. He whipped toward Qin Jiang. "Young Master Qin, she's young and doesn't know what she's saying. Please don't take it to heart."

Then he rounded on his granddaughter. "Shanshan, get over here and apologize to Young Master Qin!"

"Grandpa, I—"

The girl's face fell. In the Royal City, very few people matched her status. She'd grown accustomed to getting her way. But she wasn't stupid—the urgency in her grandfather's voice told her this handsome stranger was someone important. Someone even her grandfather couldn't afford to offend.

She looked up at Qin Jiang with misty eyes, the picture of innocent remorse. "I'm sorry, it was rude of me~"

Her soft, pouty voice could melt anyone's anger. But it lit a different kind of fire entirely.

Qin Jiang stepped forward and tilted her chin up. Pretty little thing—delicate features, dewy eyes brimming with unshed tears, utterly endearing.

He nodded in satisfaction. "Your name is Shanshan?"

A flicker of timidity crossed her face. She glanced at her grandfather, who offered no reaction beyond a worried look, and understood—this man's status was even higher than she'd guessed.

She nodded with a tiny hum of acknowledgment.

"You just said you want me?"

Shanshan bit her lip, peering up at him carefully. "I'm sorry, I just... I just thought you were really handsome, so I—"

"Is that so?"

"Mm~"

She relaxed slightly. His tone had gentled—compliments had that effect on people.

"Clever girl."

She blinked but didn't dare say more. Qin Jiang continued, "So—do you still want me?"

"Huh?" She stared, then glanced at his face, suddenly shy. "Can I?"

"For someone like you? Why not."

He studied her appraisingly. The Merfolk really did have exceptional genetics. Not just beautiful, but with a figure that was genuinely impressive—perfect proportions.

Shanshan's cheeks flushed pink. Was that a compliment? No one had ever said anything like that to her.

"Really?"

Her eyes locked onto his, sparkling with anticipation.

Meanwhile, the Immortal Kings exchanged knowing looks, then smoothly ushered the Third Elder out of the garden, leaving Qin Jiang and Shanshan alone.

Shanshan was too focused on Qin Jiang to notice everyone had left. He took her hand and smiled. "I can't give myself to you."

"Oh~" Her face dimmed with disappointment.

In one swift motion, he pulled her into his arms. She gasped as he held her close.

Looking down at her stunned expression, he said, "Give yourself to me instead."

Shanshan's face turned bright red. His embrace was so warm. Her small hands instinctively wrapped around him as she tilted her face up.

"O-okay."

Her heart was hammering, though Qin Jiang couldn't feel it through the generous cushioning between them. What he did notice was how warm her body had become.

After agreeing, she asked tentatively, "Um... how do I give myself to you?"

"Want me to show you?"

"Huh? Here? There are people—"

Halfway through, she realized the Third Elder and everyone else had vanished. Even her shark was gone.

While she was still processing this, Qin Jiang tilted her chin up and leaned down with a mischievous smile.

"Mm~"

Shanshan went rigid, eyes wide, body frozen. It took a long moment before the tension drained from her. Even then, she had no idea what to do—she could only accept Qin Jiang's kiss passively, staring at him the entire time.

He couldn't help but laugh and pulled back, pinching her cheek. "No response at all?"

"I... I don't know how~"

She blushed, then unconsciously licked her lips. That had felt... wonderful.

Her gaze drifted to his mouth. So she was supposed to respond? The same way he'd done it?

After a moment's thought, she asked shyly, "Can we try again?"

"Of course."

He pulled her close and kissed her again. This time, she closed her eyes and tried to mirror his movements, learning as she went.

Time slipped away. Their kiss deepened. Shanshan's arms tightened around him until she was practically hanging off his neck, her entire body pressed against his.

Eventually, Qin Jiang pulled back. Shanshan opened her eyes, confused—she wasn't done yet.

"More?"

She nodded eagerly. "I want to. I like it~"

"Just kissing?"

"What else is there?"

She genuinely had no idea. No one had ever taught her about these things. When she'd said she wanted him, she'd meant it in the most innocent way possible—she wanted him around because he was nice to look at. Nothing beyond that had crossed her mind.
