Nangong Yun fought for his life with everything he had. On the other side, Qin Jiang had also gone all out — in a very different way.

Only now did Mu Yunxiao understand just how terrifying Qin Jiang could be. He was an absolute beast. As a complete novice, she'd been utterly helpless against him. Cradled in his arms now, she gazed up with exhausted, wary eyes.

He leaned close, lips curling. "Trust me now?"

She shrank into herself. If anything, she trusted him less. Nothing about that had resembled "being gentle with beauties." Begging hadn't helped. And yet, thinking back on it, the sensation had been oddly addictive. She'd been tired and sore, but deep down, she hadn't felt any resistance. If anything, there'd been a quiet thrill. She'd wanted more.

She stole a glance at him. Was she a little twisted herself? Surely not.

Seeing her conflicted expression, Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. Still didn't trust him? He tilted her chin up. "Still don't believe me?"

"Huh? No — I believe you, I believe you!" She snapped out of it, answering hurriedly. Her body was craving more, but physically, she wasn't ready. So she retreated from his heated gaze.

But he held her tight. "I feel like you still don't trust me."

"I d-do!" She shook her head frantically, face burning. In her current state, she definitely couldn't take another round.

He sighed. "Fine. Let me help strengthen your fire-attribute origin first."

"Okay!" She exhaled with relief and nodded eagerly.

But instead of handing her the treasure, he pulled her closer, grinning. "I'll help personally."

"Huh? How would you—" The rest was lost in a startled gasp. Her hands clutched him tight as her body trembled. She bit her lip and looked at him reproachfully. "Qin Jiang, that's wasteful..."

He laughed, one arm around her waist, the other hand stroking her hair. "It's fine. Come on, work with me. I'll help you refine it."

"I can do it myself..."

"Be good. It's more effective with my help." He kissed her softly and channeled his energy, guiding her through the process of strengthening her fire-attribute origin. With his assistance, it was far easier than doing it alone.

After several hours, he noticed her fatigue and stopped. "That's enough for today. I'll help you every time from now on."

"Mm." She nodded drowsily, going limp against his chest with her eyes fluttering shut and her head resting over his heart.

He smoothed her hair and wiped the sweat from her forehead. "Get some rest."

"Finally, a chance to rest."

Nangong Yun surfaced from a pond, crept into a hidden cave nearby, and collapsed. Three days of running. Every pursuer was a Great Emperor — a single hit could cripple him. Fortunately, his ability to flee was exceptional. He'd escaped Huaxia's grasp before; the Zhou family was nothing.

He closed his eyes, trying to recover. He wasn't safe yet — he'd need to run again soon. But the moment his eyelids dropped, images of his brothers' slaughter flashed through his mind. His eyes snapped open.

He was truly alone now. Family — massacred. Master, senior sister, Xue Yue — stolen. Brothers — dead. Just him.

Staring at the cave ceiling, he felt a fog of despair settle over him. What was the point of being alive? For one dark moment, he wanted to end it.

Then a rush of wind outside snapped him alert. He scrambled upright. The grief receded, replaced by a desperate will to survive. He couldn't die. There were debts to collect — vengeance for his family and brothers, and people to reclaim.

He crept to the cave mouth and spotted Zhou family scouts. They hadn't found him yet, but it wouldn't be long. He needed to break through to Great Emperor. At Nine Tribulations Supreme with deep foundations, he could do it — three days was all he needed.

But how to buy three days?

Just then, the cave filled with a soft glow. He looked up and saw the rock above shimmer, ripples of spatial energy flickering across its surface. A void space — a pocket dimension.

'Jackpot!'
