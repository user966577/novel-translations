Between all the eating and drinking, cultivation couldn't be neglected. The Heavenly Domain awaited in thirty years, and every moment counted.

Lian'er hadn't had her fill yet, but she graciously let Qin Jiang go. These past days, the other women had been giving her priority, but she couldn't be selfish forever.

They were all hungry too.

Besides, there was plenty of time. No rush.

And so, with Lian'er's magnanimous blessing, the other women finally got their share of attention. Qin Jiang also made time to introduce everyone to the Qin family elders.

Grandpa Qin had finally returned from his inspection tour.

Seeing the parade of granddaughters-in-law, his face was all satisfaction. Worthy of his grandson — every one of these women outshone anything Qin Domain had to offer.

He'd said it before and he'd say it again: the women of this backwater couldn't hold a candle to his grandson's taste. Of course, the original Heavenly Mystery Continent wives were exempt from that assessment.

The old man was thoroughly pleased — until his gaze landed on Lian'er among the granddaughters-in-law, wearing the same bracelet as the rest of them.

Then he watched her rise on tiptoe and kiss Qin Jiang's cheek.

His eyebrows furrowed. Siblings being close was fine, but this was excessive. And before he could recover, Qin Jiang dipped his head and kissed Lian'er full on the lips.

The old man's eyes bulged.

"QIN JIANG! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, Lian'er's hand in his. He shrugged. "What's wrong, Grandpa?"

"What's wrong?!" The old man jabbed a finger at their interlocked hands. "You and Lian'er—"

"Oh, Mom and Dad told me. Lian'er popped out of a rock. She's not my biological sister."

"???"

The old man's voice died in his throat. What? Lian'er popped out of a rock? And Qin Hao and Li Xueyi had said this?

He stared at the couple, hand in hand, looking every bit the young lovers. He drew a deep breath. The gears were already turning.

Grandpa Qin's cultivation talent was mediocre, but he was sharp. In seconds, he'd pieced it together. He fixed Qin Jiang with a stare — this little bastard had clearly been up to no good.

No wonder the kid had insisted on breaking Lian'er's engagement all those years ago. He'd probably had designs on her even then.

The old man's hand twitched toward his belt, but he thought better of it. His standing in the family was... tenuous. Qin Jiang, on the other hand, was everyone's darling. If he raised a hand, the belt would most likely end up on his own backside.

He sighed. "Does the whole family know?"

"The ancestors are all on board. As for the rest of the clan — we were hoping you could handle that, Grandpa."

Qin Jiang grinned. His parents and the ancestors were supportive, but with so many clan members, gossip was inevitable. If it were outsiders, he'd simply silence them. But these were family — he couldn't exactly slaughter the whole clan.

Better to have the old man craft a story and sell it. Whatever it took to ensure Lian'er never heard an unkind word. Even if she didn't care about others' opinions, he did.

"Fine. Leave it to me."

The old man shook his head. Already, his mind was weaving an epic tale — dramatic, convoluted, and ultimately romantic. The rock story was out of the question. Smart people would see through it, and the clan definitely had a few fools who'd take everything literally.

Satisfied that Grandpa had things under control, Qin Jiang said his goodbyes and led the women back to the Void Divine Temple.

"You know, we don't actually need to explain anything to anyone," Lian'er said, hugging his arm.

She was easygoing about this sort of thing. As long as she could be with Qin Jiang, and their parents approved, the rest of the world could think whatever it liked.

"It's no trouble — just a few words from Grandpa, and we never have to deal with gossip again." He kissed her brow. "Why let something that small ruin a perfectly good mood?"

"True."

It was effortless, really. One story from the old man, and all future problems disappeared. Why not?

"Although," Lian'er said, peering up at him with dancing eyes, "won't that make things a little less... exciting?"

"Oh, you want excitement?" Qin Jiang's eyebrow arched. "That's easy. Right now, in fact—"

"No! Stop!"

Lian'er squealed. Nearby, the women looked on with amusement and crowded in.

"Qin Jiang, don't you bully Lian'er!"

"Picking on Lian'er? Come bully me instead~"

"Out of the way, sisters — I've got this!"

"Me, me! Qin Jiang, over here~"

"Hehe, let's all bully Qin Jiang for once! He can't always be the one bullying us!"

"Yeah! Gang up on him!"

"Charge!"

"Qin Jiang, you big demon king, prepare to be conquered! Sisters, attack!"

"Excuse me, I'm the real demon king here. Mwahaha. Qin Jiang, here I come~"

They swarmed him en masse, successfully extracting Lian'er from the line of fire. Then they pressed their advantage.

Unfortunately, Qin Jiang's prowess was far beyond what they could handle. Their brief moment of superiority collapsed quickly, and he turned the tables with devastating efficiency.

Bully him? With their abilities? Not a chance.

Looking at them, Qin Jiang assumed the bearing of a supreme commander — one man, surrounding an entire army.

"You're all surrounded now."

He laughed.

Single-handedly, with peerless dominance, he'd encircled every one of them. There was no escape.

Sensing his overwhelming strength, the women began surrendering one by one, each wearing her most pitiable expression.

But Qin Jiang was merciless in battle. The sword was drawn — there was no sheathing it now.

Only Lian'er, the rescued party, managed to mount a counterattack, buying her sisters a brief reprieve.

But the situation remained dire. Victory was nowhere in sight.
