Days passed one by one.

The spiritual energy around Qin Jiang's residence grew increasingly dense, eventually condensing into a visible mist.

Such an anomaly naturally attracted the Qin family's attention.

Qin Jiang's great-grandfather appeared and, after a brief investigation, realized Qin Jiang was in seclusion. He immediately ordered the residence to be sealed off.

He gazed toward the secret chamber, murmuring to himself.

"This seclusion doesn't seem like a realm breakthrough. Rather...

"It seems like he's awakening a special physique."

Great-grandfather's eyes narrowed slightly. He'd known all along that Qin Jiang possessed a Divine Body. And now, was he about to awaken another special physique?

Could it possibly be another Divine Body?

A dual Divine Body genius—such a thing had never appeared since the beginning of time.

"If he truly awakens another Divine Body, our Qin family will surely flourish!"

Great-grandfather murmured.

Inside the secret chamber.

Qin Jiang wasn't deliberately absorbing spiritual energy, but the energy in the vicinity was being drawn toward him anyway. His body operated on its own, continuously absorbing power.

His cultivation had broken through multiple times over these few days.

Inside the ring, the woman had also sensed Qin Jiang's condition. She wanted to probe further, but the moment her soul power left the ring, it was immediately and forcibly absorbed by Qin Jiang.

If she hadn't withdrawn in time, she might have had her soul scattered.

"How is this possible? In an unconscious state, I still couldn't resist!"

The woman said in disbelief.

Moreover, being near Qin Jiang, she clearly sensed that this was definitely a Divine Body!

An extremely terrifying Divine Body!

Even more terrifying than Xiao Fan's Fire Divine Body.

"Just what kind of monster is this guy..."

The woman muttered.

Before, she'd thought Xiao Fan had a chance of getting revenge on Qin Jiang. But now it seemed that if Xiao Fan insisted on seeking vengeance, he'd most likely be the unlucky one.

Time flowed on. In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

The spiritual energy around Qin Jiang's residence grew ever denser. Then, on this day—

Inside the secret chamber, Qin Jiang, who had been in seclusion for a month, suddenly opened his eyes.

The Divine Body had awakened!

In that instant, a powerful devouring force erupted from within Qin Jiang's body.

All the spiritual energy in the residence was drawn toward the secret chamber like a raging tide.

Great-grandfather, who had been standing guard here, also opened his eyes. He couldn't help but frown. Such an enormous amount of spiritual energy—even a Yin-Yang Realm expert might not be able to withstand it.

Yet Qin Jiang had swallowed it all in one gulp?

"This brat—isn't he afraid of making himself explode?"

Great-grandfather was somewhat worried.

But inside the secret chamber, Qin Jiang had devoured all that spiritual energy, and his aura was climbing steadily.

Such a massive amount of energy flooding into his body caused him no disturbance whatsoever. It was refined instantly, transformed into pure power.

"Break!"

Qin Jiang let out a low shout.

His aura surged. His cultivation had directly reached the early stage of the Divine Ability Realm.

He took a deep breath and slowly suppressed his aura.

"Divine Ability Realm."

Because he possessed the Immaculate Divine Body, there were no bottlenecks between realms. As such, Qin Jiang wasn't particularly obsessed with the speed of his advancement.

Instead, he carefully tempered himself at each realm.

Reaching the absolute limit of each level.

But even so, his cultivation speed was still among the best of the geniuses.

Among the ancient clans, ranking in the top three was absolutely no problem.

But now...

"The Taotie Divine Body. Its primary attribute is devouring—it can devour heaven and earth!"

The Divine Body he'd awakened this time was the Taotie Divine Body!

It could devour all things.

Combined with the Immaculate Divine Body that had no realm bottlenecks, as long as he had sufficient energy, Qin Jiang's cultivation could rise infinitely. Catching up to the various ancestors in a short time wouldn't be a problem at all.

"Isn't this basically invincible?"

Qin Jiang grinned widely.

Dual Divine Bodies, and a perfect match at that!

In the residence, Great-grandfather was waiting for Qin Jiang.

Before long, the secret chamber opened, and Qin Jiang walked out.

Great-grandfather's figure flickered as he appeared before Qin Jiang.

"Divine Ability Realm?"

Great-grandfather asked in surprise.

Qin Jiang nodded. His cultivation couldn't be hidden from Great-grandfather, and there was no need to hide it anyway.

Great-grandfather blinked, looking Qin Jiang up and down.

"I remember you just broke through to the Heavenly Soul Realm a few months ago?"

"That's right.

"It's been three months. Three months to break through a major realm—is there a problem?"

Qin Jiang spread his hands.

Great-grandfather: "..."

Is there a problem?

Great-grandfather's mouth twitched. For ordinary people, an entire lifetime might not be enough to reach the Heavenly Soul Realm.

Even talented individuals who started cultivating from childhood typically entered the martial path at six or seven years old, reaching the Qi-Blood Realm. That realm was the foundation for everything that followed.

Most geniuses would spend years—even decades—tempering themselves at the Qi-Blood Realm.

Take Qin Jiang, for instance. At twelve years old, when his blood qi reached one hundred thousand, he'd finally chosen to break through and enter the next realm: Meridian Condensation.

That had already been a record-breaking breakthrough.

The subsequent Meridian Condensation and Golden Body realms were also tempered to their absolute limits by Qin Jiang.

It had taken considerable time.

Other prodigies from the ancient clans similarly focused on tempering themselves. What they pursued wasn't just their current realm, but their future potential...

Yet now, at the Heavenly Soul Realm, Qin Jiang had only spent three months.

Great-grandfather frowned slightly. Given Qin Jiang's physique, breaking through was too easy. However, without careful tempering, his combat power would be greatly affected.

"Jiang'er, you spent too little time tempering yourself at the Heavenly Soul Realm."

Great-grandfather was worried that breaking through too quickly would affect Qin Jiang's future.

Hearing this, a helpless expression appeared on Qin Jiang's face.

"I had no choice. I really couldn't suppress my realm any longer."

Earlier, he'd devoured enough power to make a Yin-Yang Realm expert explode. It was only through the Taotie Divine Body that Qin Jiang had been able to forcibly refine it all.

Continuously compressing and purifying, in the end, his realm had still risen dramatically.

And it was precisely because of the Taotie Divine Body that advancing too quickly had no negative side effects for Qin Jiang. On the contrary, his power had become even purer.

The Taotie Divine Body was just that domineering.

Especially when combined with Qin Jiang's Immaculate Divine Body—the Taotie Divine Body's effects were maximized. If someone else had only the Taotie Divine Body, they couldn't have broken through this easily.

After all, bottlenecks existed between major realms. It wasn't enough to just accumulate power—comprehension was also needed. But because of the Immaculate Divine Body, Qin Jiang had no bottlenecks at all, so he naturally didn't need to gain any insights.

This was precisely why Qin Jiang had declared himself invincible.

Great-grandfather, hearing Qin Jiang's words, also recalled the enormous amount of spiritual energy Qin Jiang had just devoured—enough to reduce him to a bloody mist by all rights.

Then he remembered his speculation from when Qin Jiang had first entered seclusion.

Great-grandfather's eyes lit up. He stared intently at Qin Jiang, placing a hand on his shoulder. After a brief examination, his expression became excited.

"Jiang'er, have you really...

"Awakened another Divine Body?"
