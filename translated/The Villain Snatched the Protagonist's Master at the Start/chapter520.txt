Wu Yingtao's stamina was formidable. Qin Jiang spent a full half-month in the Space-Time Temple before she was finally satisfied and ready to begin her seclusion in earnest.

Leaving the temple, Qin Jiang found the women scattered about—some playing, some bickering, all of them a beautiful sight. A faint smile hung on his face as he watched them.

In the short term, there wasn't much to do. The three Children of Destiny each had someone keeping tabs on them, generating a steady stream of Villain Points daily. Combined with his reserves, he had more than enough.

Mystic Cloud Heaven was gradually falling under Huaxia's complete control. Across the other Heavens, Huaxia's plans were progressing on schedule. The organization's reputation had deeply taken root. It wouldn't be long before the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands fell under its umbrella.

Qin Jiang looked up. The passage to the Heavenly Domain hung overhead, still some twenty-odd years from opening. Anticipation stirred in his chest—but first, thorough preparations were in order.

Finding a pleasant spot, Qin Jiang lay down and sank his consciousness into the system. Time to spend.

Following each woman's needs, he exchanged Villain Points for an array of treasures. When he opened his eyes, several of his women had already gathered around him, giggling and playing.

Seeing him awake, they immediately crowded close—some practically throwing themselves into his arms. Qin Jiang opened his arms wide, caught two of them, and kissed each on the cheek.

"You didn't do anything naughty while I was asleep, did you?" he asked with a grin.

"Of course not!" They shook their heads, then exchanged glances and laughed. "We only kissed you a little."

"Only a little?"

They all nodded earnestly, though their flushed cheeks and guilty eyes told a different story. Qin Jiang looked down at his loosened clothes and the most telling detail of all...

"Did it rain while I was asleep?" he asked innocently.

There was no rain inside an immortal vessel, yet his clothes were unmistakably damp.

The women nodded solemnly. "Yes! It rained! Very hard, actually. That's why your clothes got wet."

"You all got rained on too?"

"Of course—we were keeping you company!"

They giggled, tugging at his clothes. "Qin Jiang, let us change your clothes."

Without waiting for his answer, they started helping him change. Qin Jiang smiled wryly and played along. And naturally, since they'd also been "caught in the rain," he couldn't let them stay in damp clothes either.

He helped each of them into fresh outfits—ones he'd just exchanged from the system. An assortment of breezy dresses, each paired with different stockings and heels. Once dressed, Qin Jiang's eyes practically glowed.

The women, however, all pouted. Dolled up like this, they hardly looked respectable. If not for their naturally elegant bearing, they might have looked outright scandalous. Only because Qin Jiang liked it did they tolerate such outfits.

They preened and posed around him, eyes sparkling with unspoken suggestion. "Qin Jiang, shall we go to the Space-Time Temple?"

"Heh, let's~"

Though he'd only just left, the sight of them stoked an immediate fire. With a sweep of his hand, he whisked them all into the Space-Time Temple.

What started small grew steadily larger. More and more women trickled in until it escalated into a full-blown group training session. Qin Jiang took the opportunity to distribute the system treasures he'd exchanged, personally assisting each woman with her cultivation.

They spent an entire year inside the temple. One by one, the women entered seclusion.

And Qin Jiang was left with nothing to do.

Well, not entirely nothing. Yan Yun, for one, was a chronic slacker who refused to cultivate unless Qin Jiang was personally assisting her. She'd attached herself to his side, striking an unconvincing pose of diligent study.

Then there was Chen Ningshuang, whose figure had grown increasingly generous. She too clung to Qin Jiang, and despite her years, time dilation in the temple meant her mentality remained that of a child—playful, clingy, allergic to training.

And of course, there was Murong Qing—Qin Jiang's "mother-in-law." She hadn't entered seclusion either. With most of the women in retreat, including Xue Yue, this was her chance to spend more time with Qin Jiang.

He didn't disappoint. Nearly every day, he'd steal away to find Murong Qing, and they'd long since expanded beyond the confines of her bedroom. The larger setting left Murong Qing perpetually on edge, terrified of discovery—yet beneath that nervousness, a thrilling undercurrent of excitement.

One time, Qin Jiang brought her to Xue Yue's room. Murong Qing was especially nervous that day—and especially responsive.

Afterward, Xue Yue's room looked like it had sprung a leak.

From that point on, something shifted in Murong Qing. She began mentioning Xue Yue unprompted during their trysts, even suggesting they visit her daughter's room. Whenever Qin Jiang raised the idea of including Xue Yue, Murong Qing would agree in the heat of the moment—only to take it back afterward.

But progress was progress. Before, she wouldn't have agreed at all.

Time flowed on. Under Qin Jiang's care, the women's cultivation advanced steadily. Even little Shuang'er had broken through to Ancient Emperor. One more step and she'd reach the Immortal Path—and that was while being lazy about it.

The others had all reached Human Immortal at minimum, with many already at True Immortal. Qing Chan, the veteran True Immortal, was in seclusion pushing for Immortal King.

Qin Jiang estimated it wouldn't be long. When she succeeded, the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands would see the birth of their second Immortal King—and on the back of that momentum, they'd seize everything.

As for Qin Jiang himself, he'd reached True Immortal. At this level, the energy required was astronomical. If not for his three Villain Points suppliers, he couldn't even sustain himself, let alone his women. And he didn't have ten or twenty of them—he had hundreds. The resources they consumed would drain the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands dry.

Good thing he had a cheat system.

That was the only reason every last one of them was pampered, well-fed, and radiant.
