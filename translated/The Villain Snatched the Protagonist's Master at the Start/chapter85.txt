"You're that eager for me to upgrade the painting?" Qin Jiang asked, surprised. "Once it's strong enough, it'll have complete control over you."

Right now the Seven Beauties Painting couldn't contain the founder, but once upgraded, controlling a Great Emperor would be trivial.

The founder let out a soft sigh. "What choice do I have? I don't want to spend all day cooped up in a painting. And sure, I'd be under your control—but you're my little husband. Doing what you say isn't exactly a hardship."

She sidled up to him with a grin. "Here—let me give you a preview..."

Qin Jiang sucked in a breath. She certainly delivered on first impressions.

"Well?" She looked at him expectantly.

He inhaled deeply. "Perfect."

"Right?" Her eyes sparkled. "Lucky you, getting your hands on this. I kept myself pure for tens of thousands of years, and now some young sprout gets to reap the rewards. Wait—if I think about it that way, I'm the one getting a good deal."

Her gaze burned with barely concealed hunger, and Qin Jiang felt his knees go weak. This woman had tens of thousands of years of... pent-up energy. Liu Shuwan at six thousand had been formidable enough. The founder would be on another level entirely.

For the rest of their time together, the founder clung to him shamelessly, finding every excuse to cop a feel. A complete rogue in female form. Luckily, Qin Jiang was no saint himself, and the two were a perfect match.

He also learned her name—Jian Yao. Relative to a Great Emperor's lifespan, she wasn't actually that old, but injuries had cut her life short. As for who had wounded her, Jian Yao didn't elaborate. Qin Jiang caught a flash of deep wariness in her eyes. Whatever enemy could make a Sword Heart Great Emperor look that frightened was no ordinary foe—certainly beyond the Qin family's own ancestors.

She didn't want to talk about it, and he didn't press. Once his own strength caught up, it wouldn't matter who the enemy was. Everything would be crushed underfoot.

The two hours flew by. Jian Yao reluctantly peeled her fingers from his abs and gazed up at his face, eyes lingering. "Time to go back. I'll come out again tomorrow."

"Whenever you want. Just step out on your own."

She nodded, then dissolved into a ribbon of light that streaked into the painting.

Inside the Void Divine Temple, everyone swarmed him. After nearly two months apart, they'd missed him dearly and immediately crowded around.

"We'll catch up at home," Qin Jiang declared with a wave.

What followed was a blissful half-month of indulgence.

During that time, the system kept pinging him with reward notifications. He'd been puzzled at first, then remembered—he'd sent people to shadow Lin Chen. Judging by the frequency, the operation was going quite well.

After a full month in the Void Divine Temple, Qin Jiang finally resurfaced.

In the sunlight, his already fair complexion looked rather pale. Perhaps genuinely so. The past month had been... taxing.

"Can't stay cooped up forever," he murmured.

Even an iron man would buckle at this pace. Fortunately, the system's Kidney Treasure Pills not only provided short-term boosts but, with sustained use, offered permanent enhancement. He'd been taking them nonstop for a month.

And he couldn't afford to stop.

Shortly after he emerged, a slender figure followed him out. Qin Jiang glanced back. "Qing'er?"

Huo Qing'er walked up and linked her arm through his. Seeing the pallor on his face, she felt a pang of concern. "Qin Jiang, aren't you tired?"

"Tired?" His spine went ramrod straight. A man never admits fatigue. "Not a chance. I could do this for a year and not break a sweat."

"Really?"

"Absolutely."

She hesitated, then spoke. "In that case... would you come with me to the Fire Tribe?"

"The Fire Tribe? Are we going to settle a score?"

He eyed her. He'd eliminated Xiao Fan before getting that far in the storyline, but going by genre conventions, Huo Qing'er's soul being separated from her body meant someone had ambushed her.

"You don't need to go in person. Just give me a list of names and I'll send people to take care of it."

"It's not that." Huo Qing'er shook her head. "I do have an enemy in the Fire Tribe, but with you behind me, he's nothing. I want to go back because there's... a friend I left behind."

"A friend?"

"Mm. A very pretty friend."

Her eyes twinkled with unmistakable meaning.

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. The way she said it made him sound like some insatiable lecher. All he wanted was to give every beautiful woman in the world a warm home.

"You two must miss each other after so many years apart. Fine, I'll go with you."

Despite knowing his real motives, Huo Qing'er giggled and stood on tiptoe to kiss him. She'd been feeling the pressure among his many women and had thought of her old friend—perhaps, together, they could carve out a stronger position in Qin Jiang's world.

"When do we leave?"

"Give me a couple of days to rest."

"Okay~"

Huo Qing'er grinned, already scheming about how to make her best friend willingly serve Qin Jiang.

Maybe she should just... drug her?

Her friend wouldn't have any defenses up around her, right?
