"Just kill them," Mo Mo suggested, rubbing her hands together.

Her bloodlust ran deep. She usually kept it in check around Qin Jiang, but this was revenge — no need for restraint. She looked to Jian Yao for permission. These were Jian Yao's enemies, after all.

Jian Yao pointed to a few and nodded. Mo Mo's eyes lit up. She slammed her palm down, and several Sword Sect elders burst into crimson mist without so much as a scream.

"A banquet of blood. How beautiful."

She waved her hand, condensing the red clouds into a delicate flower that drifted toward Qin Jiang. She latched onto his arm, grinning. "Qin Jiang, isn't it pretty?"

Before he could answer, Jian Yao swatted the blood flower apart. "Disgusting. Play with blood on your own time — leave him out of it."

"I helped you get revenge, and this is the thanks I get?" Mo Mo glared.

The kneeling elders felt a chill in their souls. She'd turned their comrades' blood into a bouquet for flirting? Did their feelings not matter at all?

"You dare?!" one of the kneeling men shouted, face crimson with rage. "The Sword Sect may have fallen, but we won't be humiliated like this!"

Jian Yao's sword flashed. His head toppled to the floor, blood spraying. His Primordial Spirit was annihilated in the same instant.

The others went rigid. One word out of place and you died.

"So, after just a few tens of thousands of years, no one remembers this Saintess?" Jian Yao's voice was ice.

Saintess? They stiffened. The sect hadn't appointed a Saintess since the one who'd betrayed them all those millennia ago. Could she be—

Recognition hit like ice water. "It's you!!"

Someone shrieked. Jian Yao frowned and cut them down too. "No need to shout."

The survivors clamped their mouths shut, trembling. She had no nostalgia for any of them. They were livestock awaiting slaughter.

"Ah, so we all remember now."

She lifted her sword. The tip traced lazily from one kneeling figure to the next, as if choosing her next cut.

"S-Saintess, what happened back then — we had no choice. You know what the Sword Sect was going through—"

The sword fell before the sentence finished. "No choice?" Jian Yao laughed bitterly. "Using a woman's body to buy a few more years of peace? You squandered every last shred of a sword cultivator's honor!"

Another swing. Two more heads rolled. Blood splashed across the survivors' faces. They'd gone limp, barely able to hold themselves upright. Speech meant death. Silence also meant death.

Several more cuts followed in rapid succession, venting years of buried fury.

"M-mercy... please, Saintess!"

Even those not on the list had dropped to their knees, shaking uncontrollably.

"Mercy?" Her blade rested on one man's throat. "I remember you. You were the loudest voice calling for my marriage. And the most enthusiastic when they sent hunters after me."

The blade slid, taking his arm. Then a flurry of precise cuts reduced him to a limbless torso, blood pooling under the other captives' knees.

"Tch. The crazy woman's got some bite," Mo Mo murmured approvingly.

At that moment, a figure entered the hall — a white-robed elder with a wooden sword, walking with measured calm. The Sword Sect's ancestor. Its only Human Immortal.

"Ancestor! Save us!" the surviving elders cried.

The white-robed elder surveyed the carnage and sighed. He turned to Jian Yao. "We are all Sword Sect disciples. Must we slaughter one another? Jian Yao, enough."

His words had barely faded when Qin Jiang slapped him across the face. "Old bastard, who are you trying to impress?"

The elder's brain short-circuited. One sentence of sage wisdom, and he'd been smacked like a child. The other elders gaped. Their ancestor — struck?

"Yao Yao, is this fossil on your list?"

Jian Yao shook her head. "He was in seclusion when everything happened."

Qin Jiang slapped him again. "You knew how to hide in seclusion back then, and now you decide to show your face? Brain stopped working? Coming out here to die?"

"You—"

"Me what?" Another slap.

Seclusion or not, this old man had tacitly approved the forced marriage. A sect's ancestor didn't get to play innocent.

"As the Sword Sect's ancestor, you couldn't protect your own disciple, and now you walk in here putting on airs? Who gave you that right?"

Slap after slap, punctuated by Mo Mo's invisible suppression. The elder couldn't fight back.

"You think you can tell us to stop? What are you worth? Kneel!"

A kick sent the old man sprawling among his subordinates. Qin Jiang pressed down, and the ancestor's knees hit the floor. His wooden sword had long since shattered.

The other elders lost all hope. Their only pillar of strength knelt beside them.

The ancestor's head was ringing. In all his years, even during the sect's worst days, he'd never been humiliated like this. His body shook. He raised his head and fixed Qin Jiang with a stare brimming with murderous hatred.
