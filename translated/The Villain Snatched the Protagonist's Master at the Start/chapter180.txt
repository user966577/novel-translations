The next day.

Qin Jiang left the White Fox Tribe. Since he wasn't leaving the Demon Domain just yet, there was no need to uproot the tribe now. Hu Xian'er, however, had absolutely insisted on tagging along, and her pitiful expression was more than enough to soften his resolve.

Besides, it would be a good test—whether this little fox really could bring him luck.

The Celestial Rabbit Tribe wasn't far. With Jian Yao and Mo Mo carrying the group, the journey took less than four hours.

The two Immortals made no effort to conceal themselves upon arrival. The Celestial Rabbit Tribe had only a single Immortal—there was no reason to be discreet.

Two titanic auras crashed down over the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's territory. The tribe members trembled in fear, and a heartbeat later, an equally terrifying presence erupted from within. A figure shot out to confront them.

"May I ask what brings you to the Celestial Rabbit Tribe?"

The woman who appeared was strikingly beautiful—and unmistakably mature. A crimson gown hugged a generous figure, all curves and softness in the right proportions.

Her expression was tense. Jian Yao and Mo Mo's combined pressure made it clear these visitors weren't friendly.

Qin Jiang looked at her, and his eyes lit up. That plush, full figure was the perfect pillow—voluptuous without being heavy, slender where it counted, ample everywhere else. The pinnacle of curvaceous beauty.

Flawless skin, soft as jade, from her face all the way down to...

Not a single imperfection.

Her aura blended mature sophistication with something unexpectedly girlish—the maturity came from her looks and build, but the innocence underneath...

She was untouched.

A shame, perhaps. But also a thrill.

Qin Jiang felt the inner Cao Cao stir, but he was a man who appreciated the finer things in life. He took his time.

The woman's brow furrowed as Qin Jiang's gaze roved over her with brazen thoroughness. She didn't dare lash out, though—not with two Immortals flanking him.

"Qin Jiang, stop staring..." Hu Xian'er tugged at his sleeve in a small voice.

A twinge of jealousy pricked at her. Qin Jiang hadn't studied her this intensely when they'd first met. And this woman wasn't even prettier than she was. ...Was she?

Qin Jiang came back to himself, though his eyes stayed exactly where they'd been. The woman took a steadying breath and tried again.

"Young master, what business do you have with the Celestial Rabbit Tribe?"

She'd read the group's formation correctly—Qin Jiang was the one in charge.

He flashed a grin. "I'm here to propose."

"Propose?"

Her mind leapt to the obvious candidate—the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's little princess, the one with the ancestral bloodline reversion. The girl's potential was immense; she might reach the immortal path someday. And Qin Jiang's status was clearly extraordinary.

'It must be about the princess.'

Relief washed through her, and she allowed a polite smile. If a man of Qin Jiang's caliber wanted to form a bond with the tribe, that could only be a good thing.

"Which member of our tribe has caught the young master's eye?"

"You."

Qin Jiang's gaze locked onto her. He licked his lips.

The woman's face went rigid. Then cold.

"Don't joke with me, young master."

She might be outmatched, but she was still an Immortal. And Immortals had their pride.

"Joke?" Qin Jiang shook his head, smiling. "I'm perfectly serious. The one I want is you."

Her aura flared. Frost crept into her eyes.

Jian Yao and Mo Mo each took a step forward, flanking Qin Jiang protectively.

Undaunted, Qin Jiang turned away from her for the first time and surveyed the Celestial Rabbit Tribe behind her. He sighed theatrically.

"Nice place. The Celestial Rabbit Tribe seems to live well. But this world is dangerous—you never know when disaster might strike."

The woman frowned.

He went on, his tone casual and contemplative. "So many little rabbits... Hard to imagine what it would look like if they all died. Rivers of blood, I'd guess."

Her aura churned. Fury sharpened her features.

Then Qin Jiang turned back to her. "So you wouldn't want the entire Celestial Rabbit Tribe drowned in blood, would you?"

His smile was brilliant.

"You..."

She clenched her fists, silver teeth grinding. But with two Immortals standing right there, she was at an inherent disadvantage.

Qin Jiang walked toward her. With each step he took, the woman—an Immortal cultivator—flinched backward. He closed the distance steadily, and she retreated several paces before catching herself and holding her ground, glaring at him with icy defiance.

Jian Yao and Mo Mo kept their eyes locked on her, but neither seemed particularly worried. They both knew Qin Jiang still had cards up his sleeve. He wouldn't take a risk like this without them.

They'd long since figured out how his mind worked.

He stopped less than three feet from her. Drew a slow breath—and caught a faint, intoxicating scent.

"Exquisite."

The woman's hands shook. Her aura rippled as she ground out, "Do you want to die?"

"Do you want your entire tribe wiped out?"

She flinched. Behind her stood the whole of the Celestial Rabbit Tribe.

Seizing the opening, Qin Jiang closed the final step.

"You—"

She jerked back, face flushing—from rage or from the brief, brazen contact of his hand.

Looking at her, Qin Jiang raised his head with a satisfied grin. In that split second... she hadn't even reacted.

"That really does feel wonderful," he murmured.

The woman's face burned scarlet, especially when she saw the motion of his fingers. Shame and fury warred for dominance.

If not for those two Immortals at his back, she would have slapped him dead on the spot.

"I'll ask one more time. I'm proposing to you. Do you accept?"

She inhaled deeply, fighting for composure, and fell silent.

"You wouldn't want the Celestial Rabbit Tribe swimming in blood, would you?"

Qin Jiang's soft, unhurried voice chipped away at her resistance.

Then, without warning, he pulled her into his arms.

She jolted, instinct screaming to retaliate—

"If I get hurt, at least ten thousand little rabbits pay the price."

"Shameless!"

She trembled, teeth clenched. An Immortal cultivator, being manhandled by a young man. The humiliation was suffocating.

But looking down at her in his arms, Qin Jiang's eyes held nothing but conviction.

'A treasure like this? Absolutely cannot let her go. And an Immortal, at that.'

She had to be his.

He lowered his head to meet her gaze and spoke softly. "I've never been one to force a woman. But you... I'm determined to have."
