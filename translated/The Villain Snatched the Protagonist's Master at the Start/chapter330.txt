The Celestial Rabbit Tribe marched forth in full force — hundreds of thousands of rabbits, including a substantial contingent of youngsters.

This spectacle was deliberate. Qin Jiang and Xue Mei wanted the entire Demon Domain watching when Xue Mei struck down the Horse Tribe's ancestor.

As for the young rabbits — they were basically on a field trip.

The vast horde advanced, causing a stir wherever they went. Overhead, a grand flying palace followed in their wake. Qin Jiang and company were all inside.

Yu Lan and Yu Ru had come along — after so long apart, they weren't about to leave his side.

Inside the palace, Xue Mei hovered at a cautious distance, watching Qin Jiang's eager expression warily. "I have people to kill soon. Go bother Yu Lan and the others."

He turned to the other women. They had no combat role today — they were here to spectate.

Before he could say anything, Hu Xian'er pounced with a delighted squeal. "Qin Jiang~ I'm available~"

Yu Lan, Yu Ru, and Xiao Jiu approached as well.

An Xihe, however, radiated big-sister authority. She sat beside Qin Jiang and tapped his forehead. "You need to make an appearance later. Don't exhaust yourself now. Wait until we're done, and then we'll all take care of you together. Deal?"

"Fair point."

He licked his lips but relented. Besides Xue Mei demonstrating her strength, Qin Jiang needed to show his face — establishing his connection to the Celestial Rabbit Tribe would deter the other clans long enough for Xue Mei and Xiao Jiu to grow stronger under his guidance. Once they were powerful enough, the tribe wouldn't need his name to hold the overlord seat.

Hu Xian'er pouted. Yu Lan, Yu Ru, and Xiao Jiu looked mildly disappointed.

Xue Mei drifted over and offered herself as a body pillow — she knew he liked holding her, and light contact was fine as long as things didn't escalate.

"How long until we arrive?" Qin Jiang asked.

Xue Mei gave him a look. "About half a day. Not enough time."

If there were time, she wouldn't have needed him to ask.

He sighed. There were always interruptions keeping him from the important things in life.

"It won't take long," Xue Mei soothed. "Once it's over, I'm all yours."

Yu Lan and Yu Ru nodded, offering him sliced spirit fruit by hand.

Half a day later, every woman was faintly flushed. The teasing, limited as it was, had left them all simmering. If not for the time constraint, they'd have devoured him on the spot.

A voice from outside announced their arrival.

Xue Mei extracted herself from Qin Jiang's arms, drew a steadying breath, and willed the flush from her cheeks. "We're here?"

Qin Jiang stood, took her hand, and looked outward. "Let's go. I'll walk out with you."

"Okay~"

An Xihe dissolved into the void — she'd strike from concealment. The others stayed in the palace.

Outside, about three miles ahead lay the Horse Tribe's territory: verdant plains teeming with horses. As they watched, the entire herd began converging into formation. They knew what was coming.

"Tch. Premium mounts. Be a shame to slaughter them all."

The plan had been total annihilation to send a message, but these were genuinely fine horses. Wasteful to destroy them.

Xue Mei read his thoughts. "I'll have the troops spare the good-looking ones."

He grinned. "Keep the pretty ones. Kill every ugly one — can't have them polluting the bloodlines."

As they spoke, a familiar figure rose from the Horse Tribe's midst. The Horse Tribe ancestor. His expression was grim as he surveyed the Celestial Rabbit army, then turned his gaze to the palace. That young man. He'd come for him after all.

The ancestor appeared before the palace in a flash. Xue Mei stepped forward, shielding Qin Jiang. "The Horse Tribe committed a wrong. It's time to pay."

"What happened before was a misunderstanding. I was deceived by the Black Serpent."

A Human Immortal explaining himself to juniors — in his mind, that was already generous. He still had some confidence. He'd analyzed Qin Jiang's immortal-slaying treasure from before and concluded it required setup time. As long as he stayed alert, he could dodge it. So he figured he had leverage.

What he didn't know was that Qin Jiang's forces had changed beyond recognition. Human Immortals could now be crushed with a wave of the hand.

Qin Jiang rested his chin on Xue Mei's shoulder and kissed her cheek. "Xue Mei, kill him."

"Okay~" She returned the kiss, then surged forward.

The ancestor's face twitched. Flirting right before battle — they truly didn't take him seriously.

"If you insist on war, your Celestial Rabbit Tribe will pay dearly!"

"Threatening me?" Xue Mei scoffed.

She struck without another word. An Xihe reinforced the blow from concealment. To all observers, Xue Mei appeared overwhelming. The ancestor, caught off guard by attacks that seemed deceptively weak then hit devastatingly hard, was pushed back repeatedly.

Meanwhile, the Celestial Rabbit warriors — using a formation An Xihe had designed for them — crashed into the Horse Tribe with startling effectiveness.

Qin Jiang watched approvingly from the palace. An Immortal King's power made everything in Azure Cloud Heaven a mismatch.
