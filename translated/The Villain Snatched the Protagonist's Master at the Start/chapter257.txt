Chen Qi'er walked the paths of the Human Dao Sect, everything achingly familiar. He didn't rush to find his sister. Instead, he returned to the ruined temple—the place he'd called home when he was still a beggar. Back then, it had been just him and his sister. This was their home.

But when he arrived, the temple already had an occupant. A young man, scruffy and unkempt, was watching him warily.

"You a beggar too?"

The young man relaxed. Chen Qi'er's clothes hadn't changed in all these years—still the same tattered rags. He smiled and nodded. "Yeah. I'm a beggar too."

"Sigh. You look pitiful enough. I'll give you half the temple."

Chen Qi'er stepped inside, feeling a wave of nostalgia. His sister had arrived at this very temple the same way—a stranger seeking shelter. He'd taken pity on her and let her stay. They'd become family.

He sat against the wall without minding the filth, gazing out through the temple's open doorway. The only thing missing was the person who used to sit beside him.

"Hey, have you eaten?" the young man asked.

Chen Qi'er shook his head. At his cultivation level, food was entirely unnecessary. The young man hesitated, then pulled a sweet potato from inside his shirt. Carefully, he broke it in two, swallowed hard, and offered the larger half to Chen Qi'er.

"Here."

"You eat it."

Chen Qi'er shook his head with a smile, his eyes full of memories. When he and his sister had been starving, they'd shared their scraps the same way—each insisting the other take more. More than once, their tug-of-war had knocked the food to the ground. Neither of them cared. They'd just pick it up and keep eating.

The young man sat down beside him, insisting until Chen Qi'er accepted the sweet potato. Then he gnawed on his own half, staring out at the night sky just as Chen Qi'er was.

"I like sitting here too. Every night, you can see so many stars."

Chen Qi'er smiled and took two small bites before handing it back. "I'm full. You have the rest."

"Are you sure? Have a little more."

The young man licked his lips. He clearly wasn't full either, but he was still thinking of Chen Qi'er. Eventually, Chen Qi'er pressed the sweet potato back into his hands and nodded.

"Then... I'll eat it?"

"Go ahead."

After the young man finished, Chen Qi'er asked, "You like looking at stars?"

"Yeah. They're all so bright. I want to shine like a star too." His eyes held a stubborn fire, a longing for the future. Many young people had that light in their eyes—a spark of ambition. But as they grew older, reality ground it away, bit by bit. Only the fortunate few kept that spark alive, nurturing it until it grew large enough to illuminate their entire being. Chen Qi'er had been one of them.

"How do you plan to shine?" he asked.

The young man's fist clenched with excitement. "At the Human Dao Sect, all you need is one spirit stone to join the outer sect! Once I'm in, I'll shine!"

"Do you have a spirit stone?"

The young man instantly became guarded, stepping back. "Why are you asking?"

Chen Qi'er smiled but said nothing more. He'd decided to help this young man—consider it helping his former self. But first, a few days of testing.

While Chen Qi'er was testing the young beggar, Chen Baizhe was facing a test of her own.

Qin Jiang strolled up to a small courtyard—the residence of Baizhe Immortal. Compared to the rest of the sect, it was quite pleasant. Quiet and elegant. Few people visited. Strands of guqin music drifted from within. Qin Jiang closed his eyes and listened.

After a long while, the music stopped. A voice came from inside. "You've been listening for quite some time. Any thoughts?"

The courtyard gate swung open, revealing a woman in a white dress seated before an ancient guqin. Her demeanor was serene, with a bone-deep gentleness beneath the calm.

Qin Jiang entered with a smile. "The music mirrors the musician—graceful, refined, and intoxicating. Baizhe Immortal, it's an honor."

"If you're only here to flatter me, you can leave."

"Let me be direct, then." He sat down across from her and studied the guqin, then her. A long moment passed.

"I don't understand music. But I understand you."

"I've heard every line in the book. If you're after me, you should leave."

"This isn't a line." He shook his head. "I really do understand you."

Chen Baizhe regarded him coolly. She'd had no shortage of suitors, but her heart had been closed for ages. No room for anyone. Not even the most handsome man she'd ever seen.

"You lack a sense of security," Qin Jiang said.

Her brow creased. Her fingers on the guqin trembled slightly. She lowered her gaze. "I'm a Human Immortal. My master is the strongest person below True Immortal. I belong to the Human Dao Sect, one of the most powerful forces in all of Azure Cloud Heaven. And you say I lack security?"

"Exactly. Your strength is formidable, your backing even more so. But you're still a rootless duckweed. In the entire Human Dao Sect, no one can be the soil that grounds you."

Chen Baizhe's heart quivered. Since Chen Qi'er had left, she'd had no sense of security. Tens of thousands of years had passed. She'd reached Human Immortal, and yet, exactly as Qin Jiang described, she remained untethered. Rootless. No one could become that handful of earth.

She looked at him. This young man—impossibly young—had seen straight through her.

"You should go. No one in this world can be a home for a rootless duckweed like me."

"No." Qin Jiang leaned closer, placing his hand on the guqin. "I understand you. I can give you something to rely on. I can give you the security you've been missing."
