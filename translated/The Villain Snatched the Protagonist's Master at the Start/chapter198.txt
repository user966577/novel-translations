"Huh?"

Yu Ru's cheeks flushed. Under her sister's searching gaze, she puffed out her cheeks and mumbled, "He's a big jerk. What feelings could I possibly have for him?"

"Ru'er. The truth."

Yu Lan could tell she was deflecting. She sat up and took Yu Ru's hand. "It's just the two of us. Is there really anything you can't tell your own sister?"

Yu Ru faltered. After a moment's hesitation, she admitted with a crimson face, "He's actually... not that bad. I mean, he's handsome, strong, talented, and well-connected. And his intentions aren't some cold political calculation—he just genuinely likes us. Wants to have us both. It's just that the stupid jerk has no idea how to court a woman. Who just goes straight to... that..."

Indignation crept into her voice. In her fantasies, her future husband was supposed to sweep her off her feet in a grand, passionate romance. Qin Jiang had skipped the "romance" entirely and gone straight to the finish line.

Her dream had been shattered before it even began. No courtship, just the destination.

It still annoyed her.

"So you do like him? You don't care that he forced you? Threatened you?"

"I mean, it's... fine, I guess?" Yu Ru nodded. "It's all that little runt's fault. If not for her, Qin Jiang might've actually tried to woo me properly. But honestly, it's worked out okay. I can tell he's genuinely good to me. He can be a bit much sometimes, but he tolerates my temper. Hehe—I even got him back tonight. Bit him all over."

Before coming here, she'd taken out her frustrations on Qin Jiang's body. That counted as payback, right? At least watching him obediently take it had cheered her up.

Yu Lan studied her sister's expression and nodded slowly. It was clear: Yu Ru didn't resent Qin Jiang at all. Quite the opposite.

After all, the two of them had been intimate in every possible way by now.

And Yu Lan was no different. Each time she tried to summon anger toward Qin Jiang, some strange feeling would surface—along with memories of his attentive "treatments."

The resentment always dissolved into nothing.

It seemed that was the shortcut to a woman's heart.

"And you, Sister?" Yu Ru watched her carefully. "You have feelings for him too, don't you?"

Yu Lan's cheeks warmed. Her gaze skittered away before she admitted with a rueful smile, "After everything that's happened between us... how could I feel nothing?"

She sighed. "He lied to me, yes. But the fact that he saved me is real. Without him, the bloodline poison would have destroyed my royal blood. It's his methods that I take issue with."

Like Yu Ru, she had reservations about the way Qin Jiang had conquered her. But the bitterness was mild—a footnote, not the headline.

"He told me he didn't have time to do it properly," Yu Ru said. "That right now was the best window to 'strike while the iron was hot' and claim both of us."

Yu Lan: "..."

A long pause. Then she shook her head with a helpless laugh. "His greatest virtue is his honesty, I suppose. It's just... perhaps a bit too much honesty."

The kind that was almost hard to swallow.

Yu Ru nodded vigorously. Qin Jiang's honesty was something else—he laid out every dark, scheming thought without a shred of shame, stated it matter-of-factly, and somehow made it impossible to argue with.

"Aside from being handsome," Yu Lan redirected, "does Qin Jiang have any other redeeming qualities?"

Yu Ru thought hard, then offered, "Actually, the perversion is kind of a plus."

"Excuse me?"

"When Qin Jiang gets going, it's actually... well, a little thrilling. And from what the other girls say, some men can barely perform even at a young age. But Qin Jiang—well, Sister, you'd know better than anyone. So for us, his 'big perverted lecher' thing is actually an advantage."

With his looks factored in, even "big perverted lecher" became a selling point.

Yu Lan stared at her sister. This girl had filters thicker than city walls. Every flaw became a feature.

"Are there no... normal qualities?"

Yu Ru brightened. "Oh, sure! He's wonderful to his women. Xue Mei told me—he once gave an immortal herb to one of them just because she needed it. Xue Mei also says his ruthlessness is all outward-facing. With his own people, he's incredibly gentle. The occasional roughness is only during... well, you know. You've experienced that, Sister. Also, he's extremely possessive. Apparently he once wiped out an entire continent's worth of suitors over one of his women—and destroyed their family too. Sister, do you think he'd do that for us? We've got no shortage of admirers."

Her eyes sparkled with anticipation.

Somehow, it sounded romantic.

Yu Lan found herself entertaining the thought—then shook it off. Her suitors spanned the entire Demon Domain. If Qin Jiang went on that kind of rampage, the territory would run red with blood. And there were Immortals in the Demon Domain who wouldn't let it happen.

Still... there was an undeniable dark romance to the idea.
