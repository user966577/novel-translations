At Huaxia Academy, fellow Child of Destiny Li Yang was living a far happier life—or so he believed.

Under Ye Xuan's conditioning, Li Yang had been thoroughly reduced to a lovesick fool. He spent every waking moment at Ye Xuan's side, completely lost in his devotion. His every thought revolved around her. Even the three old monsters inside his Immortal King sword had given up trying to save him.

One day, Li Yang collected his cultivation resources at the academy. As a bottom-tier student, the allocation was meager. But ever since arriving at Huaxia Academy, he'd saved every last resource he received. Not a single one had been used.

He was saving them all for Ye Xuan—a surprise gift to help her breakthrough to the Immortal Path.

Looking at his accumulated stash, Li Yang muttered happily to himself, "Xuan'er is pushing for the Immortal Path. These resources should help her along."

He headed straight for Ye Xuan's quarters. As he approached, he could hear laughter and playful banter drifting from the courtyard—Ye Xuan's coy protests among them, stirring and provocative. Mixed in was the voice of a man—his rival, Zhao Juncai.

Li Yang took a deep breath. This wasn't the first time, and he was used to it. Xuan'er was only with Zhao Juncai to protect him, after all. He needed to be understanding. Once he grew strong enough, she wouldn't have to sacrifice herself like this anymore.

He knocked on the courtyard gate, and it swung open immediately. Ye Xuan was lounging on a recliner in minimal clothing while Zhao Juncai massaged her—his hands wandering freely.

The sight sent a pang through Li Yang's heart. For his sake, Xuan'er had sacrificed so much.

"Oh, Li Yang's here?" Zhao Juncai smirked, mockery written all over his face. "What, here to drop off more scrap metal?"

"Don't talk to Li Yang like that," Ye Xuan chided, giving Zhao Juncai's hand a light slap. The gesture looked like a reprimand, but it was really just flirting. To Li Yang, though, it was Ye Xuan standing up for him. Gratitude flickered in his eyes.

Li Yang stepped forward, shot Zhao Juncai a cold look, then produced a storage ring and turned to Ye Xuan, his expression softening instantly. "Xuan'er, I heard you're pushing for the Immortal Path. These cultivation resources should help."

"Cultivation resources?" Ye Xuan took the ring and casually scanned its contents, genuine surprise crossing her face. "This many?"

"Heh, as long as they're useful to you." Li Yang scratched his head sheepishly. Seeing her surprise filled him with a deep sense of accomplishment.

"Tch, Xuan'er, you're exaggerating," Zhao Juncai scoffed. "How much could a bottom-tier student possibly have?"

Ye Xuan tossed the ring to Zhao Juncai for inspection. His expression shifted to genuine astonishment.

That much? He stared at Li Yang in disbelief. Had this kid really saved every last resource since entering the academy?

"A lot, right?" Ye Xuan asked, taking the ring back and pocketing it without a second thought. She never refused Li Yang's gifts. The less she refused, the happier he became—the ultimate enabler.

"It really is a lot," Zhao Juncai admitted grudgingly.

Being acknowledged by his rival filled Li Yang with smug satisfaction.

"Li Yang, thank you~" Ye Xuan's sweet voice pulled him back to reality. He waved dismissively, feigning displeasure. "With our relationship, do you really need to say thanks?"

"Then I won't~ You're so kind, Li Yang~" Ye Xuan beamed.

That smile hit Li Yang like a thunderbolt. He stared, dumbstruck, wearing a goofy grin.

Zhao Juncai's eyes brightened too. After a moment's hesitation, he produced some resources of his own and offered them to Ye Xuan. "Xuan'er, these are from me."

As a top-tier student, his casual contribution easily dwarfed Li Yang's entire savings.

Ye Xuan accepted them, smiled sweetly, and said, "Thank you."

"Heh, so how are you going to thank me?" Zhao Juncai grinned with anticipation.

Ye Xuan shot him a look, then turned to Li Yang, her cheeks pinkening. She nibbled her lower lip and said softly, "Li Yang, could you turn around for a moment?"

Li Yang's expression stiffened. He already knew what was coming—this wasn't the first time. Forcing a laugh, fists clenched at his sides, he said, "Sure. I'll turn around."

He turned, teeth grinding, his body trembling slightly. In his head, he kicked himself—he should have asked for a thank-you as well.

The moment his back was turned, the sound of kissing erupted behind him. It sounded... intense.

Eventually, the sounds stopped, replaced by soft breathing. "Who said you could kiss me that long?" Ye Xuan's voice came, reproachful.

"I couldn't help myself. You're just too irresistible," Zhao Juncai said with a sheepish grin.

"Don't do that again."

"I promise!"

Their exchange reached Li Yang's ears, feeding the suffocating pressure in his chest. Then came the rustle of clothing being adjusted. After a long pause, Ye Xuan finally spoke. "Li Yang, we're done. You can turn around now."

He turned. The two had composed themselves, showing no sign of intimacy. He knew Ye Xuan did this for his sake—to spare him the worst of it.

Then Ye Xuan stood and walked over to him. She slipped her arms around him in a brief embrace, her lips brushing his ear as she whispered, "Next time we're alone together, I'll make it up to you."

"Really?" Li Yang's whole body jolted, his suffocating frustration evaporating in an instant. He stared at her, eyes wide with excitement.

Ye Xuan's cheeks colored as she nodded. "Mm~"

"I—" Li Yang swallowed hard, hands trembling with anticipation, wanting to hold her.

But Ye Xuan pushed his hands away, pouting. "When we're alone, I'll make it up to you properly. Not now."

"Okay." Li Yang rubbed his hands together, grinning from ear to ear like an idiot.
