Bai Susu's senior brother was named Lin Chen.

Originally just an outer sect disciple of the Holy Sword Sect, he'd returned from an excursion one day completely transformed, and had since risen to become the sect's Holy Son.

The reason, naturally, was that the primordial spirit inhabiting Lin Chen's body had been replaced.

From the spoiler, Qin Jiang learned that the soul occupying Lin Chen belonged to a Great Emperor from ten thousand years ago. After his death, his remnant soul had persisted through the ages.

By this point, the remnant soul's power had been nearly exhausted. Just when he'd resigned himself to eventual dissipation, Lin Chen appeared—on the verge of death, no less.

A lamb walking itself to slaughter. The Great Emperor's remnant soul seized the opportunity, taking Lin Chen's place and gaining a second chance at life.

Moreover, the remnant soul had been a sword cultivator in his previous life. After rifling through Lin Chen's memories, he decided to return to the Holy Sword Sect, where he promptly became a sensation.

Qin Jiang studied the remnant soul's appearance in the spoiler, his expression turning peculiar. The man was short, fat, and round—he couldn't help but wonder if Bai Susu would have an absolute meltdown when she saw it.

Noticing the look on Qin Jiang's face, Bai Susu grew uneasy. She was, in truth, somewhat curious about what the soul inside Lin Chen actually looked like.

But she was also afraid she couldn't handle the answer.

After all, she'd harbored deep admiration for Lin Chen.

'No—this is all just Qin Jiang's word. Why should I believe him?'

Suddenly, Bai Susu caught herself.

She'd been led into a trap, unconsciously accepting Qin Jiang's claims. But everything so far had been his word alone—there wasn't a shred of evidence.

Steeling her resolve, she let out a cold snort and met Qin Jiang's gaze.

"Fine. Show me."

Seeing her straighten her spine, Qin Jiang was mildly surprised, but quickly understood her thinking.

He didn't press the point. He'd never expected Bai Susu to believe him outright. Besides, he'd already gotten everything he wanted from her physically.

As for her heart—she could give it to whoever she pleased.

Qin Jiang only cared about tangible things. Thoughts and feelings? Irrelevant.

After all, no matter what she thought, she'd never have the chance to betray him.

He extracted a copy of the Great Emperor remnant soul's appearance from the spoiler and tossed it in front of Bai Susu.

"See for yourself."

With that, Qin Jiang stood and left.

It was his first day back home. Ye Ling'er and the others were all waiting for him at his residence.

Night had fallen—perfect timing.

【Ding! Host has altered a major plotline.

Reward: Time-Space Disc fragment (Immortal-grade treasure);

Reward: Sword Dao upgrade (Sword Intent may be upgraded to Sword Heart);

Reward: Void Divine Temple (contains infinite space; Host may freely remodel its interior—for example, building a really, really, really, really, really, really big bedroom);

Reward: Phoenix Egg (can hatch a divine beast phoenix);

Reward: Villain Points.】

The moment he stepped out, a barrage of system rewards crashed down on him.

The sheer generosity left Qin Jiang momentarily stunned. These rewards were absurdly rich.

By now, he had a decent understanding of how the system worked. The size of the reward depended not only on the importance of the altered plotline, but also on the Child of Destiny's rank.

Take Xiao Fan and Ye Xuan—Xiao Fan's rank was higher, so altering his plotlines yielded better rewards than Ye Xuan's.

And Lin Chen's rank was higher still than Xiao Fan's.

Just stealing Bai Susu had produced this haul.

The Time-Space Disc fragment was an Immortal-grade treasure. He didn't know its full capabilities yet, but an Immortal-grade treasure was bound to be extraordinary. That made two fragments now.

The Sword Dao upgrade was a direct boost to his combat power. Sword Heart—tsk, even the Great Emperor remnant soul possessing Lin Chen apparently hadn't reached the level of Sword Heart.

But what excited Qin Jiang most was the Void Divine Temple.

Reading the system's description, he had a strong suspicion it was trying to hint at something. Not that he didn't already have plans along those lines—he'd been looking for a suitable location. But now...

The Void Divine Temple made that entirely unnecessary.

"Void Divine Temple—what a treasure."

Qin Jiang praised it appreciatively. This was the reward he was most satisfied with.

With the Void Divine Temple, he'd never have to worry about where to house all his women again.

Inside the system space, Qin Jiang examined the Void Divine Temple for a while before turning to the last reward—the Phoenix Egg!

"This reward was meant for Lian'er, wasn't it?"

Nirvana Divine Body, Phoenix Sword, Phoenix Egg—quite the complete set.

After reviewing his rewards, Qin Jiang left the courtyard.

Qin Lian'er was still guarding the door.

"Oh! Brother, you're done?"

Qin Lian'er squeaked.

Qin Jiang's face stiffened. That phrasing...

Something about it sounded a little off.

Before he could respond, Qin Lian'er sidled up to him and whispered:

"Hehe, so how about this sister-in-law? Satisfied?"

"Ahem, she'll do."

Qin Jiang cleared his throat. Seeing that Lian'er was practically bouncing with excitement and about to launch into more questions, he quickly changed the subject.

"Lian'er, do you know Bai Susu's identity?"

"Of course!"

Qin Lian'er nodded.

"Susu told me she's the daughter of the Holy Sword Sect Master. I figured she was just barely good enough for you, so I grabbed her and brought her back."

Qin Jiang was momentarily speechless. Still, he was curious—how had Lian'er managed to capture her? As the Holy Sword Sect Master's daughter, Bai Susu should have had guards.

Under his questioning, Qin Lian'er gave a mischievous laugh.

"Susu did have guards, but since she was in Holy Sword City, the guards around her weren't very strong, and they weren't particularly alert."

"You captured her in Holy Sword City?"

Qin Jiang was stunned.

He'd assumed Bai Susu had wandered into the Qin Domain and been snatched by Lian'er. Instead, Lian'er had traveled all the way to Holy Sword City...

Qin Jiang's brows furrowed.

"Who took you out of the Qin Domain? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is out there?"

Qin Lian'er: "..."

Seeing her brother's displeasure, she shrank her neck. She'd accidentally let slip that she'd snuck out on her own.

"Brother, I brought guards with me!"

She rushed forward, latching onto his arm and shaking it back and forth.

Qin Jiang's head was starting to throb. He really couldn't control this sister of his.

"Guards? Who are these guards that let you run off without reporting it?"

"I threatened them into it."

Qin Lian'er blinked.

"Because I'm young and don't know any better, they actually take my threats seriously. And from our parents' perspective, as long as the guards keep me safe, the worst they'll get is a scolding. So..."

Qin Jiang stared at her, dumbfounded. This girl was actually quite clever.

Using her youth and unpredictability as leverage against her own guards—after all, she was just a child. If she threw a tantrum, there was no telling what she might do. Getting on her bad side could mean getting stabbed.

That would be a terrible deal.

And so her guards didn't dare report anything. They could only follow along cautiously, keeping Qin Lian'er safe. As long as nothing happened to her, a scolding was the worst they'd face.
