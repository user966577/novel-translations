Huo Lie clenched his fists, steeling himself for a last stand. But before he could move, three figures materialized in front of him—one half-Emperor and two Nine Tribulations Supremes. All Qin family ancestors.

Huo Lie's face twitched. Fight? Fight what?

And who knew how many more powerhouses were watching from the shadows.

"Quite the move you've got," he snarled at Huo Qing'er through gritted teeth.

Over the years, he'd considered countless scenarios for Huo Qing'er's return. But never in his wildest dreams had he imagined she'd come back with a man. One man—Qin Jiang—had the entire Fire Tribe too afraid to say a word.

"Looks like you don't want to resist," Qin Jiang said with a faint smile.

Huo Lie's expression darkened. It wasn't that he didn't want to—he didn't dare.

"In that case, hand over the Fire Tribe's Legacy Flame."

Huo Lie's mind raced. "If I hand over the Legacy Flame, will you let me go?"

"You must be dreaming," Qin Jiang said, rolling his eyes. "But I can let you live a while longer."

He was going to be shipped to the Ye family regardless—that was already "living a while longer." His fate would be either getting tormented to death by Ye Xuan or being killed by Qin Jiang's people once the novelty wore off. Either way, his days were numbered.

Huo Lie's eyes flickered. A while longer... that was hardly ideal, but what if something unexpected happened in the interim?

He took a deep breath and nodded. "Fine. I'll hand over the Legacy Flame."

Before he'd even finished speaking, a blazing flame erupted from his body. The temperature in the great hall spiked instantly. This was the Fire Tribe's Legacy Flame—a flame that enhanced both combat and alchemy.

Huo Lie stared at it, anguish and bitterness warring in his eyes. With a heavy sigh, his body convulsed as he forcibly severed his connection to the flame. His aura plummeted. In the span of a few breaths, he dropped from Nine Tribulations Supreme all the way down to First Tribulation Supreme.

Face ashen, he flung the Legacy Flame at Qin Jiang. "There's your Legacy Flame. I trust Young Master Qin will keep his word."

Qin Jiang held the flame in his palm and examined it carefully, his brow furrowing slightly. "The energy is too impure. It'll boost your power quickly in the short term, but it severely limits future growth."

Each generation's wielder had left behind their own energy within the flame before dying. The result was dense but chaotic energy. With Qin Jiang's Taotie Divine Body, that wouldn't be an issue—but for an ordinary person like Huo Lie, Nine Tribulations Supreme was the absolute ceiling. No wonder the Fire Tribe had never been able to grow beyond a certain point. Every generation's greatest talent had been shackled by this very flame.

Of course, on the Heavenly Mystery Continent, Nine Tribulations Supreme was already the pinnacle. The ability to rapidly reach that level was an irresistible temptation for most. But in Qin Jiang's estimation, the cost outweighed the benefit.

He stored the Legacy Flame for now. If he could find a way to purify the energy, he'd give it to Huo Qing'er. If not, he'd simply absorb it himself—though he hardly needed the energy, so it would barely count as an improvement.

"Xiao Jiang, what do we do with this one?" The half-Emperor ancestor pointed at Huo Lie.

Qin Jiang looked at the ashen-faced Huo Lie and smiled. "If you wouldn't mind, Ancestor—cripple his cultivation and send him to the Ye family."

"No!" Huo Lie's eyes went wide with terror. "You can't cripple me! You said you'd let me live!"

"You can live without cultivation," Qin Jiang said reassuringly. "Don't worry. I guarantee that after your cultivation is gone, you'll live a very... colorful life."

"Please, no!"

The half-Emperor ancestor didn't give him another chance to beg. A single palm strike shattered every meridian in Huo Lie's body. The agony knocked him out cold.

Lifting the unconscious man, the half-Emperor ancestor looked slightly disturbed. "Send him to... the Ye family?"

"That's right."

"For that Ye family kid...?"

He trailed off, unable to find the right word for Ye Xuan.

Qin Jiang just smiled and nodded.

The ancestor looked at Huo Lie with pity. This poor bastard's future was going to be "colorful" indeed. Hopefully he could handle it.

With Huo Lie in tow, the ancestor departed for the Ye family.

Qin Jiang swept his gaze across the remaining elders. His voice was calm. "Everyone who was involved back then—step forward."

"Mercy, Young Master Qin!"

"We were forced by Huo Lie!"

"It's true! That scoundrel captured my daughter and forced me to act against the Saintess. Please spare me!"

None of them dared hide their involvement. With Huo Qing'er still alive, there was no escape. Their only hope was to pin everything on Huo Lie and pray that Qin Jiang would be satisfied with punishing the ringleader.

Unfortunately for them—

"Kill them all," Qin Jiang said flatly.

Every one of them froze. The two Nine Tribulations Supreme ancestors acted immediately, eliminating them with contemptuous ease. The guilty elders couldn't even mount a defense.

The remaining, uninvolved elders stood frozen in place, too terrified to make a sound.

It was a complete rout. Not a hint of suspense.

Leaving the two ancestors to clean up, Qin Jiang departed with Huo Qing'er.

Meanwhile, at the Ye family estate, the half-Emperor ancestor's speed was extraordinary. Upon arrival, he went straight to Ye Qingtian and handed over Huo Lie, instructing him to pass the man along to Ye Xuan. He personally wanted nothing to do with Ye Xuan.

"For Xuan'er? This is Qin Jiang's idea?" Ye Qingtian asked.

The ancestor nodded, gesturing at Huo Lie. "This one crossed Xiao Jiang. He wants Ye Xuan to 'discipline' him."

Ye Qingtian's mouth twitched. If Ye Xuan weren't his own flesh and blood, he'd have killed the boy himself. And now Qin Jiang was using his son as... a punishment?

His face contorted. "That's truly depraved."
