Mu Yunxiao had gradually learned to match Qin Jiang's rhythm, playing along with his act at a moment's notice. Her acting had improved considerably.

After another half day in the Space-Time Temple, she lay against him, hands braced on his shoulders, eyes heavy-lidded, voice breathy. "Did you enjoy that thank-you gift, husband?"

"Heh, does Xiaoxiao also like it when I call you mother-in-law?" He grinned. He could feel it—every time he used that title, she clenched tighter. Definitely excited.

She blushed and swatted his chest. "I do not."

"You don't?"

"Nope!" She shook her head firmly.

He blinked, then pushed deeper. She gasped, hands bracing against his shoulders. "You—I wasn't ready yet."

"Mother-in-law?"

"Mm--" She shuddered, shooting him a reproachful look. But deep down, there was an indescribable feeling. A little thrilling.

And at the same time, Qin Jiang felt an extreme tightness. He held her close, smirking. "Still saying you don't like it? That's quite the reaction..."

"Hmph~" She pouted and buried her face in his chest, voice muffled. "I just don't!"

He didn't tease her further. But since they'd already started exploring, there was no stopping halfway. He went all the way.

Two more hours.

He held her in his arms, letting her rest. "Now Xiaoxiao's fire origin definitely won't be weaker than her ice."

"Mm~" She nodded, face red. She hadn't refined the latest sessions—she'd been saving them, savoring them slowly. Her fire origin had long since balanced with the ice. No further refinement needed.

"Rest a bit, then attempt the True Immortal breakthrough?"

She looked up, hands still wrapped around him, and said hopefully, "Can you stay with me a while longer? Time should be plentiful in here..."

A flicker of anxiety crossed her eyes—afraid he'd refuse. This was only their second time alone together. Sensing her hope, Qin Jiang wouldn't disappoint. He kissed her forehead, arms around her waist. "Even if you hadn't asked, I wouldn't want to leave so soon."

His lips traced from her forehead down to hers. A deep kiss. She responded passionately, arms around his neck. When they finally parted, her face glowed and her eyes danced.

Seeing her like this, Qin Jiang smiled. Mu Yunxiao truly wasn't afraid of him anymore. 'Should I scare her a little?' Her timid, teary-eyed look was incredibly enticing. But scaring her once meant ages of coaxing afterward. And he did feel bad about it.

"Husband, how long can you stay?" she asked, hand on his chest.

"That doesn't depend on me. It depends on you."

"On me?"

"Mm. On how long Xiaoxiao can last~" He rubbed his nose against hers, grinning wickedly.

"Ah?" She shrank back, stealing a nervous glance. She knew his stamina all too well—alone, she couldn't endure for long. Unless he held back.

"Could you... maybe take it easy?" she murmured.

He nodded. "Of course. Right now, I'm here to serve Xiaoxiao. Whatever you say goes."

"Whatever I say?" Her eyes lit up. She propped herself up, looking him over. "Then... I get to set the pace?"

"Can you?"

"I can!" She nodded with confidence. She wasn't a rookie anymore—she'd been through large-scale battles. She understood rhythm. More importantly, only at her own tempo could she last longer. At Qin Jiang's pace, she doubted she'd survive a day.

"Alright, Xiaoxiao sets the pace. But if it gets too slow, I'm taking over."

"Hmph~ It won't be slow." A slow pace meant longer endurance but less pleasure. Not too fast, not too slow—finding her own rhythm was key.

She studied him, then said, "Let me rest first?"

"Of course."

He pulled her back into his arms. She found a comfortable position, head pillowed on his chest, and closed her eyes.

Several hours later, she felt ready. She pushed him flat on his back and perched above him, grinning. "I'm starting now~"

"Bring it!"

He spread his arms, surrendering completely. She nodded and began. The first time she'd been asked to take initiative, she'd been terrified and knew nothing. She'd never led before. She was still a bit rusty, needing his cooperation for the preparation. But once that was done, the real exploration began.

'How do I take this in, though?'

She looked down, lips parting slightly. "Mm~" A soft grunt as she eased herself down, brows furrowing. She managed, then glanced at him shyly. "Is this okay?"

"Not bad." He gave a nod of approval. "You can continue."

"Mm~" Lip caught between her teeth, she began moving—at her rhythm, steady and unhurried. Qin Jiang closed his eyes and matched her pace. Not bad at all.
