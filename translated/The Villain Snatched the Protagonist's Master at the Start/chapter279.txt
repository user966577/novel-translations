"Young Master Qin, do you need a wife?"

"???"

"What I mean is—I can help you win over our lady."

Qin Jiang blinked. He looked at the man, not entirely sure he'd heard right. "When you say 'win over'... do you mean what I think you mean?"

"Ahem." The man shifted uncomfortably. He was committing a full-blown backstab here, even if it was... an unusual kind. "It should be what Young Master Qin is imagining, yes."

Qin Jiang's expression turned strange. He distinctly remembered this being the same man who, just yesterday, had screamed that he'd die before letting anyone lay a finger on his lady. And now, barely a day later, he was offering to hand her over?

Qin Jiang's brow creased. He said nothing, watching the man with flat, evaluating eyes. The woman in white was someone to be cautious around. For all he knew, this was a test she'd sent herself.

Reading Qin Jiang's silence as distrust, the man hesitated, then whispered, "Does Young Master Qin know our lady's true identity?"

"True identity?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. He licked his lips. "The Celestial Formation Fairy?"

The man's face drained of color. His mistress's freedom was a secret that not even the True Immortals of Azure Cloud Heaven were aware of, yet Qin Jiang had named her in a heartbeat.

"How... how do you know that?!" he sputtered.

In his eyes, Qin Jiang's background was already mysterious. Now, casually identifying his mistress's true identity made him even more formidable. A man like this had to come from an extraordinary background. Not someone to make an enemy of.

Qin Jiang's eyes sharpened. So it really was her. The Celestial Formation Fairy—the True Immortal sealed beneath the Chaos District. Not long ago, Qing Chan had mentioned that while the seal couldn't truly hold her, she shouldn't be able to leave without detection. But clearly, the woman came and went as she pleased. The seal was worthless.

Still, she should be preparing for her Immortal King breakthrough. What was she doing at the Human Dao Sect, disguised as a sheltered young lady?

He studied the subordinate, rubbing his chin, eyes narrowing. Then he recalled the way she'd looked at him.

'She can't actually be here for me, can she?' he thought. And if so, was this subordinate her doing? Sending him ahead to clear the way because she was too shy to approach directly?

A smile crept across Qin Jiang's face. A powerhouse on the verge of Immortal King, practically throwing herself at him? Not a bad deal at all.

"Tell me, then. How do you plan to help me win over your mistress?"

The man's nerves settled. He looked at Qin Jiang and began his pitch. "The truth is, our mistress came here specifically for you, Young Master Qin. A while back, we showed her your portrait, and she fell for you at first sight. That's why she dropped everything to come to the Human Dao Sect. After meeting you yesterday, her feelings only deepened. But she's shy, so we servants have to step up on her behalf. If I may ask—do you have any interest in our mistress?"

It was a mountain of embellishment, but it aligned perfectly with what Qin Jiang had already guessed. He nodded with a smile. "A girl in love. I understand."

"Then you...?" The man's face lit up. Every word of that nonsense would get him killed if his mistress ever found out. But if the match succeeded, he'd be the biggest hero of all.

Qin Jiang looked at him curiously. "What's her plan?"

"Uh... basically, she wants to gradually get closer to you. Build up to something romantic. Like yesterday, with you appearing out of nowhere to rescue her."

The man then laid out the Celestial Formation Fairy's entire playbook.

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. These schemes were painfully cliché. But if she wanted to use them, he could play along easily enough.

Meanwhile, the Human Dao Sect was growing restless. Chen Qi'er had already been duped several times within its borders, and the woman in white, looking as fragile as she did, naturally attracted unsavory attention. But targeting a True Immortal—an angry True Immortal at that—was a spectacularly bad idea.

All the frustration from not seeing Qin Jiang was unleashed on the fools who tried to swindle her.

When her subordinates returned, they found her surrounded by a murderous aura and wisely kept their heads down.

She glanced at them. "How did it go?"

They exchanged nervous looks. "We, ah... accidentally... let them escape."

The moment the words left their mouths, they dropped to their knees. A crushing wave of pressure made them break into cold sweat. Her temper was getting worse by the day. She really needed a man to take the edge off.

"Don't be angry, my lady! They escaped, but we did obtain critical intelligence!" One of them spoke up—the same man who had struck the deal with Qin Jiang. Under his mistress's icy stare, he pressed on without hesitation. "My lady, we've learned that Qin Jiang will be at the Human Dao River tonight."

The oppressive aura vanished instantly. Her eyes lit up. "Are you sure?"

"Absolutely!"

"Then what are we waiting for? Go prepare at the river!"

Night fell. The Human Dao River was a body of water the Human Dao Sect had cultivated over countless millennia, enriched with untold spiritual treasures. By now, it was practically a river of liquid fortune. Its waters greatly aided cultivation, and occasionally spawned rare treasures within its depths.

For a fee, cultivators could train in the river. Pavilions dotted its surface, and boats packed with people drifted along, all drawing on the river's power through specialized channels. Cultivating here yielded twice the results in half the time.

Of course, many came not to cultivate but to try their luck fishing for treasures. Unfortunately, the odds weren't great—most went home empty-handed.

Qin Jiang had visited before. The river's benefits were modest for someone at his level; the real value was for lower-ranked cultivators. But low-ranked cultivators made up the vast majority, so the place was always bustling.
