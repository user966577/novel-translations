The women fell silent, privately comparing. Ningshuang was already their equal, and if she kept growing, she might genuinely rival Jian Yao.

"But you're still young!" Ningbing protested, subtly puffing out her own chest.

Ningshuang snorted. "What does age matter for cultivators?"

Ningbing's face stiffened. Fair point—extreme old age was irrelevant in cultivation, but extreme youth was another matter. She glared at her sister and rapped her knuckles on her forehead. "I see it now. You seduced Qin Jiang, didn't you."

"Yep!" Ningshuang planted her hands on her hips, chin raised triumphantly. "I totally seduced him~"

"And you're proud of that?"

Ningshuang wasn't truly afraid of her sister, but she put on a frightened act anyway, leaping to Qin Jiang's side and burrowing into his arms. He held her naturally while looking at Ningbing. "Don't scare her. She's still a child."

"And you still know she's a child?" Ningbing glared.

He coughed, glancing down at Ningshuang. "I know you're worried she's too young and might get hurt. But relax—I have self-restraint. I'd never let Shuang'er get hurt."

"Self-restraint?" Ningbing scoffed. She'd never experienced any such thing from this brute. When he was in the mood, they all suffered. But looking at Ningshuang's complexion—rosy, satisfied, not a trace of fatigue—it did seem like he'd held back this time.

Ningshuang nodded firmly. "Big brother had great self-restraint! He was very gentle—just lightly touching bottom each time, never rough at all."

"Regardless, she's too young. You can't do it too often," Ningbing said, eyeing Qin Jiang.

He agreed. It really couldn't be too frequent—not just for his energy but for Ningshuang's too. She was young and burned through stamina quickly. Too much could cause real problems.

Ningshuang pouted. She'd barely started enjoying herself and was already being restricted? But she didn't argue. 'Big brother's willpower is weak. Whenever I want it, I'll just seduce him. Works every time.' She smiled to herself. She had absolute confidence in her powers of persuasion.

With the Ningshuang matter settled, Qin Jiang's gaze turned to Mu Yunxiao. He let go of Ningshuang with a pat on her backside, sending her toward Ningbing. The Mystic Yang Divine Stone materialized in his palm.

"Xiaoxiao, how much more do you need for your fire-attribute origin?"

Mu Yunxiao could feel the dense fire energy radiating from the stone. It could definitely supplement her origin power. "Not much more," she said, cheeks faintly pink. "At the previous pace, maybe a dozen more sessions should balance my ice and fire origins."

She'd received most of Qin Jiang's attention lately, and her fire-attribute origin had strengthened considerably. The balance between ice and fire was nearly there.

"Once they're balanced, your foundation should be strong enough to attempt True Immortal, right?"

Her reserves were deep—the only reason she hadn't attempted the breakthrough was fear that increasing her strength might worsen the imbalance. But with Qin Jiang beside her, that concern was moot. Her fire origin could be replenished at any time. She nodded. "Yes."

"Good. Let me finish balancing your attributes, then you can attempt the breakthrough."

"Right now?"

"Heh, let's go to the Space-Time Temple. Won't take long." He grinned, took her hand, then turned to the other women. "Anyone want to join?"

"You deal with Xiaoxiao first," they said, shaking their heads. They'd barely ended the last battle a few hours ago and hadn't fully recovered. The last thing they wanted was another fight.

He sighed with theatrical disappointment, holding Mu Yunxiao's hand. "Just us two, then."

"Mm~"

He led her into the Space-Time Temple and pulled her into his arms. "Tired, Xiaoxiao?"

"Not really~"

"Then... shall we start?"

"Okay~"

Mu Yunxiao had been yearning for the True Immortal realm for a long time. And Qin Jiang, for her sake, threw himself into the work, relentlessly striking at the Human Immortal threshold. Each of his strikes brought her one step closer to True Immortal.

Five full days inside the Space-Time Temple.

Under his efforts, Mu Yunxiao's ice and fire attributes finally reached equilibrium. Joy bloomed on her face. "They're balanced."

She gazed at him and nestled into his arms, leaning up to kiss him softly. "Thank you, husband~"

"And how will Xiaoxiao show her gratitude?" He raised an eyebrow.

She blushed, arms draping around his neck. Something flickered in her eyes. She licked her lips, rested her head on his shoulder, and whispered into his ear: "What would you like, my darling son-in-law?"

Qin Jiang's eyes went wide. He sucked in a sharp breath, his gaze turning molten. That was too much to resist. He swallowed hard and held her tight. "I think your fire origin is still... just a touch off."

"Mm, it does still need a little more~" She played along seamlessly, nodding with dewy eyes. "What should we do about that?"

"Heh, I have a method, but I'm not sure mother-in-law would be willing..."

"What method?"

"Simple—I have plenty of fire energy. I could give you some~"

"Mm~ You're so bad~ I don't want any."
