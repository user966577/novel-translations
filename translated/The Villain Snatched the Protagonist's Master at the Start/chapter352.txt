The women were all in the Void Divine Temple, but Qin Jiang and Lian'er didn't join them.

With their relationship newly changed, Lian'er was a little nervous. So she pulled Qin Jiang to her old room instead — the one she'd had before they left home. It had been years since anyone lived there, but servants had kept it clean.

Stepping into her childhood bedroom, Lian'er relaxed a fraction. Everything looked the same as she remembered.

Qin Jiang found it endearing. His normally bold little sister had actually gotten shy. He ruffled her hair. "If you're nervous, we can wait a few days—"

"No!"

Lian'er cut him off fiercely, both hands gripping his shirt. Wait a few days? She'd been waiting years. She'd finally gotten what she wanted, and he wanted her to wait more?

Absolutely not.

"I'm not nervous," she said with a stubborn pout. It wasn't nerves, exactly. She just felt a twinge of awkwardness about facing her sisters-in-law afterward. And going back to the Void Divine Temple meant all of them being there — she could hardly shoo them all out to monopolize Qin Jiang.

That would be embarrassing.

Qin Jiang swept her up by the waist. "So you're ready?"

"I've been ready forever!"

"True enough." Qin Jiang nodded, eyebrow raised. "You've been ready since you tried to drug me and hypnotize me, haven't you?"

Lian'er's face flushed. So he'd known all along!

She swatted his chest with a small fist. "You jerk! You knew the whole time and just kept pretending!"

She glared at him. If she'd known he was onto her, she would have dropped the act ages ago. Instead, she'd bottled it up for nothing — who knows how much she'd missed out on.

The thought made her grind her teeth. Everything she'd missed before, she was going to make up for now. Every single day. Until she was stuffed.

Seeing her expression, Qin Jiang laughed nervously. He caught her hand. "Easy with the teeth grinding. Sharp teeth aren't flattering."

"Will they hurt you?" Lian'er asked with a sly look.

Qin Jiang nodded seriously. She had zero experience — one careless moment and there could be genuine injury.

He tapped her forehead. "If you hurt me, your sisters-in-law will come for your head."

"They're not sisters-in-law anymore. They're my sisters now," Lian'er corrected, pursing her lips. Then her gaze drifted downward, locking onto her target. She leaned in and kissed it. "Don't worry, Brother. I'll be careful~"

Qin Jiang drew a sharp breath. He closed his eyes, his hand finding the top of her head.

She had no experience and no technique, but she gave Qin Jiang something different — something none of the others could.

It was like planting a fruit tree with his own hands. Tending it year after year, watering it, nurturing it — and now, at last, it had borne fruit. Ripe, heavy fruit, grown entirely under his care.

And today, Qin Jiang plucked what he'd cultivated with his own hands.

The fruit was lush and full.

As for the taste, he hadn't tried it yet. First, a bit of preparation was in order — a splash of cream to make it more appetizing, and some gentle pressing to draw out the juice. The preparation could be done many ways, and something nurtured so carefully deserved an equally careful touch.

A dollop of cream first, making the fruit glisten invitingly. Then, coaxing out the juice — which proved exquisite, as expected from fruit he'd raised himself.

He savored it and continued working with the fruit — until a trickle of crimson joined the flow.

Qin Jiang paused, looking at Lian'er with tender eyes and a gentle hand on her cheek.

After a while, when she'd relaxed, she looped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He smiled and kissed her back.

The fruit was truly ripe — even more so than he'd imagined. And sweeter.

But he didn't overindulge. Before noon, they emerged from the room.

"Back to the Void Divine Temple?" he asked.

Lian'er nodded, her cheeks still pink. What was done was done.

Time to face the sisters.

She clung to his arm, walking with a slight stiffness — barely noticeable. Qin Jiang had been gentle, prioritizing her comfort for her first experience.

Of course, once Lian'er got used to things, the approach would change. And it wouldn't be measured in mere hours anymore.

They returned to the Void Divine Temple, where the women were gathered, sipping tea and discussing cultivation. The moment Qin Jiang and Lian'er appeared, every pair of eyes snapped to them.

The women lit up — then, almost as one, their gazes zeroed in on Lian'er.

They'd all been through it. They noticed the change instantly. She'd matured overnight. Her cheeks were flushed, her features carried a new softness, and there was an unmistakable allure in her movements.

They knew exactly what had happened.

After a brief pause, every eye shifted to Qin Jiang. No need to ask. This was obviously his doing.

No wonder he'd been gone all night. They'd assumed he was with his parents. Apparently not.

Still, none of them said anything. They'd seen this coming. They just hadn't expected him to pounce the very first night home.

Liu Shuwan stepped forward, glared at Qin Jiang, then took Lian'er's hand.

"Lian'er, are you alright? Did he hurt you?"

"Hm? I'm fine."

Lian'er shook her head. Liu Shuwan studied her, walking her a few steps, assessing her gait.

She nodded. Nothing serious.

"Does it hurt?"

Liu Shuwan pulled her close, her voice soft and concerned.

Lian'er blushed. Her usual boisterousness gave way to genuine shyness. She glanced at Qin Jiang, then nodded. "A little~"

"That's normal. Come with me — I'll apply some medicine. It'll help with the soreness and keep things... healthy. Lian'er, you need to take care of yourself from now on. That man demands attention almost every day, and without proper maintenance, things can deteriorate. But don't worry — we all have experience. We'll teach you everything, and you'll end up looking even better than before..."
