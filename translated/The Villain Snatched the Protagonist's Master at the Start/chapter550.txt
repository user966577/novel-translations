"You're truly the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law?" the city lord asked respectfully.

Part of him believed it. After all, who would dare impersonate the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law?

"Would I lie about that?" Qin Jiang leaned back, crossing one leg over the other. "We've been together for a long time. When we first got together, I was still weak. My father-in-law even gave me a protective treasure."

He produced the Immortal King Seal. Its stored energy was long spent, but its aura remained unchanged.

The city lord's face drained of color. He dropped to his knees and bowed reverently—not to Qin Jiang, but to the seal.

The Grand Sovereign possessed a supreme treasure called the Heaven-Suppressing Divine Seal—the most powerful artifact in all the realms and the Grand Sovereign's very symbol. Any cultivator of sufficient rank knew what it looked like. The Immortal King Seal was a miniature replica. Moreover, possessing it meant one thing: the bearer was under the Grand Sovereign's protection.

In that moment, the city lord became a true believer.

His expression transformed into fawning delight. "My lord! If you're the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law, then we're practically family! Skyreach City is your home—take whatever you want! The other cities' treasures? I'll have them delivered! Also, my wife! You mentioned you like married women? I'll send her right over! She's got stamina, I guarantee it!"

Qin Jiang coughed. "Your wife won't be necessary. But everything else—I'm holding you to it."

"Ah..."

The city lord hesitated, wanting to push his wife a bit harder. Then he noticed the Immortal Emperor beside Qin Jiang glaring at him.

He understood instantly. "Say no more, my lord. I understand completely."

An Immortal Emperor shadowing the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law had to be there for both protection and surveillance. Being the son-in-law meant he probably couldn't openly take other women—he'd have to be discreet.

So naturally, Qin Jiang wanted his wife but couldn't say so outright. He'd need to arrange a private delivery.

The city lord's mind raced. If he could ingratiate himself with this man, offering his wife was nothing—he'd offer his own mother if the lord was interested.

Seeing the city lord's leering expression, Qin Jiang rolled his eyes and pointed at the Dao Covenant scroll. "Sign."

"I still have to sign?"

Qin Jiang scoffed. "Obviously. I don't trust you."

The city lord smiled sheepishly. He took the scroll, infused it with a strand of his Primordial Spirit, and presented it with both hands. He'd essentially handed over his life. But he had to take the gamble—a connection like this was once in a lifetime.

Qin Jiang accepted it with satisfaction. It was blank—signed but unfilled. He could write whatever terms he wanted. If he demanded the city lord's life, the man would have to comply. Otherwise, the Dao itself would enforce the covenant.

"Shall we head to Skyreach City?" the city lord suggested carefully.

"Let's."

Inside, the city lord wanted to arrange a proper reception, but Qin Jiang went straight for the treasury. The wealth was staggering—even more than he'd expected. But from now on, it was all his.

He selected a few of the most valuable items and left the rest. With the city lord under his control, the entire treasury was effectively his personal vault.

"This treasury belongs to me now," Qin Jiang declared.

The city lord nodded vigorously. "Rest assured! I'll guard it with my life. Not a single piece will go missing without your say-so!"

"Just 'not missing'?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow meaningfully. "Skyreach City's traditions shouldn't be abandoned, should they?"

"Heh heh. Traditions will be upheld—you can count on that!"

The city lord chuckled. Most visitors to Skyreach City were lower-realm cultivators—rich, weak, and without backing. Perfect targets. Someone like Qin Jiang came along maybe once in a hundred thousand years.

They shared a conspiratorial grin. Qin Jiang clapped him on the shoulder. "Good man. Keep it up."

"Yes, sir!"

Later, the city lord arranged quarters in the manor. But when he saw the women, his jaw went slack.

This many? And so openly? Wasn't he worried about the Grand Sovereign's daughter finding out? Even the Immortal Emperor was one of them? She'd been turned to his side?

His mind spun with wild theories. Regardless, he was profoundly impressed. Managing this many women alone was worthy of admiration—and Qin Jiang seemed to have them all perfectly in hand. Meanwhile, the city lord couldn't even manage one.

The thought made him sigh. But his resolve to send his wife only grew stronger. A man with this many women was clearly appreciative. Sending a woman was the fastest way to curry favor.

After considerable effort getting everyone settled, the city lord excused himself and went straight to his wife—a voluptuous woman with a nice figure, though her looks were merely pretty.

Seeing him, she rushed over. "Is my brother all right?"

"He's fine," the city lord muttered. He studied his wife, working up the nerve.

She relaxed. "Good."

She was about to say more when the city lord blurted out: "Are you interested?"

She froze. Then she stared at him, astonished. "You can... do it now?"

"Not me."

"???"

She blinked. "What do you mean?"

"I've met someone very powerful." The city lord's expression was deadly serious. "He's quite amorous. So I was thinking you could..."
