Weighing his options between Qin Jiang and Wu Tian, the middle-aged man had to admit that following Qin Jiang seemed far more appealing. For one, he'd buried Wu Tian twice and wasn't sure the man wouldn't hold a grudge. For another, Wu Tian was flat broke—couldn't begin to compare with Qin Jiang's resources.

He also wasn't comfortable leaving Yun Bao alone with Qin Jiang. But he had no choice in the matter.

Under Qin Jiang's gaze, the middle-aged man could only nod. "Please take good care of Yun Bao."

"You have my word."

Qin Jiang turned to Yun Bao with a warm smile. "Huaxia has treasures aplenty. Yun Bao can eat to her heart's content. Before long, your cultivation will surpass your father's."

"Oh... Yun Bao doesn't actually eat that much."

The man gave a nervous laugh and—while Qin Jiang wasn't looking—winked furiously at Yun Bao. A Pixiu's strength grew with what they consumed. He feared Qin Jiang planned to fatten Yun Bao up, then kill her for her bones.

Paranoid? Perhaps. But caution was warranted.

Unfortunately, Yun Bao's eyes were glued to Qin Jiang. She'd completely missed her father's signals—and even if she'd noticed, she probably wouldn't have understood.

"Doesn't eat much?"

Qin Jiang looked surprised. Before the man could interject, Yun Bao nodded. "My cultivation is low, so I really can't eat much."

"I see. That's fine—take it slow. Eat a little more each day and your cultivation will rise in no time."

Hearing this, Yun Bao's heart swelled with emotion. Her gaze on Qin Jiang softened with affection. This was the first man she'd ever met who told her she could eat as much as she wanted. Even her father had always been stingy about it—though she understood why. They were poor, and he needed to grow stronger to protect her.

But still. Eat as much as she wanted!

She couldn't even imagine how wonderful that would be. Just thinking about it made her mouth water.

Qin Jiang noticed her expression and had the distinct feeling this girl was more interested in the food than in him. Oh well. Affection could grow over time. One day, she'd value him more than any treasure.

He didn't belabor the point. Reaching out, he ruffled Yun Bao's hair and smiled. "Yun Bao, go pack your things. We're leaving."

"Already?"

Despite herself, Yun Bao felt a pang of reluctance.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Come with me first. Whenever you want to come back, I'll bring you myself."

"Okay~"

Yun Bao chirped an agreement and scurried off to the cottage. They owned practically nothing—all she grabbed was a small wooden carving: three Pixiu, two large and one small, with the adults resting their paws on the little one's head. A warm family portrait.

Except now, there were only two.

"You don't have to worry about Yun Bao. I won't hurt her," Qin Jiang told the man as his daughter disappeared inside.

"I hope so."

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes, but he understood. The man's paranoia was rooted in tragedy—his wife had been murdered by humans.

After a brief pause, Qin Jiang glanced at Wu Tian and continued. "Do what I've asked, and I'll avenge your wife."

"!!!"

The man's head snapped up, eyes boring into Qin Jiang, every muscle taut. "How... how do you know about that?"

"Nothing in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands escapes Huaxia's notice."

Qin Jiang's tone was breezy.

The man hesitated, then said uncertainly, "My wife... I don't think it happened within the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands."

"..."

Qin Jiang's expression froze. Damn. He'd skimmed the backstory too quickly and missed that detail. He'd only seen that the wife was killed and rendered into a treasure, forcing the man to flee with Yun Bao. But apparently they weren't originally from this realm.

He coughed and rapidly flipped through the plot in his mind. Found the passage. Right—he'd skipped over it.

No matter. Qin Jiang's composure returned instantly. "Huaxia's reach extends beyond the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands."

"???"

The man's heart lurched. He knew Huaxia was powerful, but this powerful? Their influence extended beyond this realm?

Wait. Huaxia had risen seemingly from nowhere. Maybe it wasn't a local power at all. Maybe its main force lay outside, and this was merely a branch operation.

He suddenly recalled the Grand Sovereign's decree from years ago, which had specifically named Qin Jiang. If Qin Jiang were simply from the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, how would the Grand Sovereign even know him?

In the man's eyes, Qin Jiang's identity became infinitely more mysterious. Could he be a young master from one of the great clans—or even the God Race—out gaining worldly experience?

If so, a Pixiu's bone-forging ability would hold little appeal. It was entirely possible that Qin Jiang genuinely fancied Yun Bao for her beauty alone.

The thought loosened some of the knots in the man's chest.

"If you truly avenge my wife, my life is yours!"

"It's not that serious. Just do what I've asked."

"Absolutely!"

The man nodded firmly, then looked at Wu Tian. Torment this guy? That shouldn't be too difficult.

Seeing his expression, Qin Jiang added a warning. "Be careful. This man is anything but simple—you heard what I said about him likely being an Immortal Emperor in a stolen body. And one more thing: don't let him discover your connection to Huaxia. Most importantly, you can push him, but watch your limits. Don't actually kill him."

"Understood."

At that moment, Yun Bao bounced out of the cottage. With nothing worth packing, all she carried was the small carving—three Pixiu, two large, one small. The big ones had their paws on the little one's head.

A family of three. Except now, only two remained.
