"You know me?"

"You know Qin Jiang?"

Qin Jiang and Chen Baizhe spoke almost simultaneously, then exchanged a glance. Chen Baizhe's cheeks flushed faintly.

"You don't remember me?" Chen Qi'er growled through clenched teeth. He'd been hunting for Chen Changsheng, but he'd never forgotten Qin Jiang either. The beating he'd received was still fresh in his memory.

Qin Jiang shrugged. "Sorry. I genuinely don't remember you."

"In the Western Regions. The casino. And your best friend—Chen Changsheng."

Chen Qi'er glared daggers at him. Recognition dawned on Qin Jiang's face. "Oh! It's you!"

Chen Baizhe and Dao Kun both looked startled. The two had already met? Chen Changsheng—she'd heard the name before, something about a disturbance at the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. When had he become Qin Jiang's best friend? Neither of them knew that the "Chen Fan" who'd come to the Human Dao Sect was actually Chen Changsheng.

"You already knew each other?" Chen Baizhe asked.

Qin Jiang nodded and looked at Chen Qi'er. "Well, 'knew' is a strong word. I just beat him up at the casino."

Chen Baizhe: "..."

Dao Kun: "..."

No wonder Chen Qi'er looked ready to murder someone. You beat him up—of course he holds a grudge.

Chen Baizhe felt a twinge of awkwardness. Like it or not, Chen Qi'er was still her brother. And her husband had beaten her brother up?

"Was there some misunderstanding?" she asked softly.

Before Qin Jiang could answer, Chen Qi'er cut in, still glowering. "No misunderstanding! I've never forgotten this grudge!"

Chen Baizhe faltered. Looking at Chen Qi'er's aggressive demeanor—so different from the brother she remembered—she could also sense, even from this brief exchange, that he truly didn't care about her at all. She looked up at Qin Jiang.

He sighed, patted her back, and turned to Chen Qi'er. "At the time, Zi Fu and my little sister were visiting the casino for the first time. They lost badly—to him—so they came to me for backup. And then... I beat him up. My sister was upset, so I didn't care who he was. Even if I'd known then, I wouldn't have held back. But since you're Baizhe's brother, I'm willing to let the matter go."

"???"

Chen Qi'er's face was a wall of question marks. 'You're willing to let it go?' He'd been the one beaten black and blue!

He sneered. "You might be done with it, but I'm far from done with you!"

His aura surged. But Chen Baizhe stepped in front of Qin Jiang.

"I won't let you hurt Qin Jiang."

Chen Qi'er's expression stiffened. Watching her shield Qin Jiang sent his fury spiraling even higher. "Step aside, Baizhe! This grudge must be settled!"

Her disappointment deepened. Qin Jiang would do anything for his little sister without hesitation, but Chen Qi'er couldn't even set aside a petty grievance for her sake—especially when Qin Jiang had already offered to drop it. She knew that if Qin Jiang chose to escalate, even a Human Immortal like Chen Qi'er wouldn't escape unscathed.

She shook her head. She would not let him touch Qin Jiang.

Chen Qi'er's face darkened. "Fine—then I'll restrain you first and deal with him after!"

"Don't you dare." Qin Jiang pulled Chen Baizhe behind him, his voice soft. "Let me handle this. Don't get hurt."

"Heh. At least you've got some backbone," Chen Qi'er sneered.

Qin Jiang smiled and shook his head. "Don't flatter yourself. I'd be insane to fight you." He turned to Dao Kun. "Sect Master Dao Kun, your disciple is being bullied right in front of you, and you're just going to stand there?"

Dao Kun rolled his eyes. "You've got all those powerhouses at your side—why drag me into it?"

"Sect Master Dao Kun is the strongest below True Immortal. None of my people are that formidable. Besides, they're all my darlings—I can't bear to see them get hurt."

Dao Kun glared. So you won't let your women get hurt, but you're fine with me getting hurt? He shook his head but stepped forward anyway, positioning himself between Qin Jiang and Chen Qi'er.

"It was just a minor scuffle. Given your current relationship, there's no need to keep harping on it."

"Minor scuffle?" Chen Qi'er's voice was ice. "He humiliated me. I will never forget it."

"Qin Jiang is Baizhe's husband. You're Baizhe's brother. Is this really worth it?"

In truth, the casino fight was trivial. If not for Baizhe, an apology from Qin Jiang might have settled things. But now that Qin Jiang had stolen Baizhe away, the old grudge was merely a pretext.

Chen Qi'er glared between Qin Jiang and Dao Kun. With the Sect Master in the way, he couldn't do much.

"Fine. Someone's protecting you, so I can't touch you today. But your best friend—I will make him pay."

With one last glance at Baizhe, he turned and left. No one tried to stop him. Only after he'd disappeared from sight did Chen Baizhe turn to Qin Jiang.

"Thank you."

"Hmm?"

"I know you didn't ask Qing Chan to step in because you were worried I'd be upset."

She leaned into his arms. Now she was completely certain—Chen Qi'er truly didn't care about her. But it didn't matter anymore. Someone else did.

"By the way, he went after your best friend. Will that be a problem?"

Qin Jiang chuckled. "Actually, that 'best friend' is my enemy."

"???"

"Diverting disaster. Simple trick."

He spread his hands with a shrug. Chen Baizhe relaxed. Dao Kun clicked his tongue—this kid's heart was truly black. He strongly suspected his own disciple had been swindled into the relationship too.

"But you and him..." Qin Jiang looked at Chen Baizhe, a hint of apology in his eyes.

She shook her head and smiled gently. "It's fine. For tens of thousands of years, I've been on my own. Having him or not—it makes no difference. Besides, I have you now."

This meeting had shattered every last illusion she'd held. And Qin Jiang's every word and gesture had been aimed at looking after her—her body and her heart alike.
