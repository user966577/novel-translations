In a remote gully, Chen Changsheng lay where he'd been dumped, half-dead.

After the inner sect disciples left, a figure appeared—Dao Zhen, the Human Dao Sect's ancestor. He studied Chen Changsheng with furrowed brows, his eyes gleaming with arcane light, his expression one of deep puzzlement.

"How is this possible? His fortune shimmers purple-gold—the mark of heaven's favor. He should be a child of destiny, blessed with smooth sailing and miraculous escapes. And yet that Qin Jiang... his fortune is black as pitch. By all rights, he should struggle to stay alive, and against a heaven-favored individual, his misfortune should compound tenfold. But reality is the exact opposite. Bizarre. Truly bizarre."

Dao Zhen shook his head. After a moment's hesitation, he waved his hand, sending gentle streams of energy into Chen Changsheng to stabilize his injuries. He found a concealed spot, left the unconscious man there, and murmured, "Consider it good karma."

He turned to leave, then paused. Looking back, his gaze landed on Chen Changsheng's storage ring. He plucked it off the man's finger, broke through the soul barrier, and peered inside. His eyes lit up at the contents.

"Call this payment for the rescue."

With a satisfied chuckle, Dao Zhen departed.

Back at the inner sect grounds, he gazed up at the hovering traveling palace and shook his head. He wanted nothing more to do with the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. The Human Dao Sect's signature ability was the Fortune-Reading Art, and at Dao Zhen's level, his mastery was unparalleled. One glance had told him everything: Qin Jiang's fortune was in terminal decline.

He'd never seen fortune so completely, oppressively black. This level of dark fortune wouldn't just doom the man himself—it would drag down everyone around him. Even the Azure Lotus Divine Palace probably couldn't withstand it. Calamity was inevitable. He wanted no part of it.

Right now, his only wish was for Qin Jiang and his entourage to leave the Human Dao Sect as quickly as possible, before they contaminated the place.

While he was brooding, Dao Kun appeared. "Ancestor."

Dao Zhen nodded and looked toward the palace. "Why haven't they left yet?"

"Left?" Dao Kun blinked. "Didn't you invite them here to discuss important matters?"

"What? Who told you I invited them? What important matters?"

Dao Kun's stomach dropped. "You... arrived together with them. And you were on friendly terms with that Qin Jiang..."

Dao Zhen's face darkened. His descendant had gotten the wrong idea entirely. "I sensed their approach and went to have a look. That's all. I didn't invite them."

Dao Kun's expression soured. Qin Jiang had tricked him. No—not tricked, exactly. He'd simply guided Dao Kun's assumptions and let him jump to conclusions. The man hadn't actually said anything false. Damn it. He'd been played.

"Who told you about these 'important matters'?" Dao Zhen pressed.

Dao Kun's face stiffened. Nobody had told him. He'd made the assumption entirely on his own—guided by Qin Jiang's insinuations. He recounted the whole story, ending with: "He took all my tea!"

He glared up at the palace, fists clenching, ready to march up and demand restitution.

Dao Zhen sighed. "That Qin Jiang would actually fit in perfectly at our Human Dao Sect. A shame, though..."

"Fit in?" Dao Kun paused, then thought about the sect's own... operational style. He couldn't help a bitter laugh. An old con artist, bested by a young one. How humiliating. But Qin Jiang's temperament really was a natural match for their sect. At the Human Dao Sect, he'd thrive.

After a moment, Dao Kun ventured: "Ancestor, since I've already given away the tea... perhaps we should make the most of it? A partnership with the Azure Lotus Divine Palace?"

The gifts were already gone. Might as well leverage them. And the Azure Lotus Divine Palace was wealthy—every woman they married off came with an enormous bride price. After all these years, they'd accumulated a fortune they couldn't spend in a lifetime.

Dao Zhen shot him a look and shook his head. "Forget it. Get them out of here."

"What? Why?"

"You call yourself the Human Dao Sect's master, and the Fortune-Reading Art is one of our core techniques. Didn't you notice anything about Qin Jiang?"

Dao Kun fell silent. His own Fortune-Reading Art was formidable, but would he dare use it on someone in the presence of a True Immortal—someone the ancestor himself called brother? If they noticed, the awkwardness alone would be devastating.

He asked cautiously, "Ancestor, what did you see?"

Dao Zhen was quiet for a beat. He raised his eyes to the palace once more and spoke gravely. "Extreme evil. Extreme malice. Extreme resentment. Extreme desire. Every negative force that exists in this world seems to have converged upon him, each pushed to its absolute limit. It's enough to make one tremble just looking."

Dao Kun's eyes widened. "How is that possible? With that much negative energy concentrated in one person, how could anyone still be alive? Even a True Immortal couldn't withstand it!"

Dao Zhen nodded. If such fortune were on him, the entire Human Dao Sect would be dragged to its doom. The fact that Qin Jiang was still breathing was, frankly, a miracle.

"I don't know how he's survived this long," Dao Zhen admitted. "But regardless, our Human Dao Sect must maintain distance. No debts, no grudges—none at all. Stay a bystander."

He paused, suddenly remembering that he'd just helped Chen Changsheng. Whether that thread of karma could be avoided... he wasn't sure. He shook his head with a rueful smile. "Do what we can. If entanglement is unavoidable, at least keep it shallow."

"Understood."

Dao Kun nodded and glanced upward. Qin Jiang hadn't said when he planned to leave. But finding an excuse to speed their departure seemed wise. The walking disaster needed to go.
