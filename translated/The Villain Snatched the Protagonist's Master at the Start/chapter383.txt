Teasing him?

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. This girl's personality was shifting faster than he'd expected.

"Better now?" Li Qingqiu asked, her gaze sliding sideways. She couldn't quite meet his eyes. Licking his wound had been pure instinct — she'd acted before her mind could intervene, some reflexive urge to soothe him. But good heavens, how brazen of her.

"Not quite," he said.

"Hm?"

"How about one more kiss?" He grinned.

She pursed her lips, considered it, then nodded and leaned in. But Qin Jiang shook his head. His gaze dipped below the waterline. "Kiss the other one."

"???"

Li Qingqiu froze. Then she caught his meaning and her cheeks caught fire. "Pervert!"

She looked at his expectant expression, and hesitation flickered in her eyes. It wasn't impossible, really. They'd already kissed plenty. She was just afraid he'd never be satisfied with just one, and then she'd end up...

Under his hopeful gaze, she finally relented. "Fine. But only once."

"Deal."

"Then... you come here."

She closed her eyes, parted her "red lips," and waited. But after a long moment of nothing, she cracked one eye open. "Well? Come on~"

"Ahem. You have to kiss me."

"What?"

She stared blankly. Her kiss him? Down there? How was she supposed to—

She shook her head frantically, face blazing. "No! Either you do it yourself, or—"

"Qingqiu." He cut her off, pointing to the bite mark on his lip. "This wound can't touch water."

"???"

She gave him the flattest look she could muster. Can't touch water? He was a Human Immortal! A mighty Human Immortal cultivator — this scratch barely qualified as an injury. A trickle of spiritual energy would heal it instantly. She'd humored him once, and now he was pushing his luck!

"Come on, Qingqiu. I've kissed you. What's wrong with you kissing me once?"

She shook her head firmly. "No!"

They locked eyes in a standoff, neither willing to back down — until his hands started wandering. Li Qingqiu surrendered.

She caught his roaming hand, gritted her teeth, and said, "Your wound can't touch water, right? If I stand up, it won't reach the water. Then you can kiss me."

"Hmm." Qin Jiang pretended to deliberate, then reluctantly agreed. "Fine."

She shot him a look at his put-upon expression, smacked his mischievous hand away, and hesitated — then slowly rose from the water.

Eyes shut, face crimson enough to bleed, she parted her "red lips" and asked in a small voice, "Like this?"

"Not bad."

"Then hurry up!"

She urged him on. Underwater, the lack of cover hadn't bothered her as much. But standing exposed like this felt entirely different — no sense of security at all.

Qin Jiang smiled. He reached out, brushed a fingertip across her "red lips," then pressed a deep, lingering kiss against them.

A long while later, lips parted.

Li Qingqiu collapsed back into the water. He caught her instantly, licked his own lips, and grinned. "Qingqiu's little mouth tastes wonderful."

"Mm~ Stop saying things like that!"

She buried her face in her hands and burrowed into his chest, thoroughly mortified. They held each other for a while longer before finally leaving the bath.

Outside, An Xihe and the other women were chatting. When the pair emerged, all eyes turned their way. Li Qingqiu's face was still flushed, her steps slightly unsteady, and they knew at once — Qin Jiang had been up to no good. But that was hardly surprising. A man and a woman alone in a bath together, and expecting Qin Jiang to behave? Laughable.

"Qingqiu, did Qin Jiang bully you again?" Qing Chan stepped forward and took Li Qingqiu's hand. The women were always attentive to their newest sister.

Li Qingqiu glanced at Qin Jiang and shook her head. "No."

It hadn't really been bullying. If anything, she'd bitten him. As for the kisses... she'd quite enjoyed those.

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes, walked over, and pinched Qing Chan's cheek. "When have I ever bullied Qingqiu?"

"You're bullying her right now." Qing Chan swatted his hand away and pouted. "It's been days, and you still haven't given Qingqiu the full experience. If that's not bullying, what is?"

Qin Jiang laughed. Li Qingqiu's face went scarlet. "Qing Chan, I don't need—"

"Qingqiu, we're all women here. I understand completely." Qing Chan cut her off without hesitation. "Don't be shy. You'll have to take that step eventually."

She shot Qin Jiang a pointed look. This man spent every day teasing the girl but never followed through. Worse, when he was feasting with the rest of them, he made Li Qingqiu watch from the sidelines. As a woman, Qing Chan knew exactly how torturous that was.

And she'd noticed — during those times, Li Qingqiu was tempted. She just couldn't bring herself to ask. Her cold personality had thawed somewhat, but taking the initiative was still a bridge too far.

So Qing Chan had decided to give her a push.

Hearing Qing Chan's words, Li Qingqiu's gaze drifted to Qin Jiang. He wore a contemplative expression, and her heart leapt. Was he actually considering... going all the way?

The thought of that impressive specimen made her swallow involuntarily. She'd never had the full experience, but she'd certainly seen it every day this past week. It was undeniably enticing. The question was whether he'd actually offer.

No — no, no, no! There she went again, getting greedy. She needed to resist. Must resist!

Just then, Qin Jiang nodded thoughtfully. "Fair point. I have been unfair to Qingqiu."

Her breath caught. Was he really going to—

The resolve she'd mustered half a second ago evaporated. She looked at him, eyes betraying a flicker of anticipation.

"But I already satisfied her cravings," Qin Jiang said, pivoting. He caught her hand and grinned. "Right, Qingqiu? In the bath — I helped you out twice."

Li Qingqiu's face flamed. She glared at him and yanked her hand free.

'In the bath' only counted as an appetizer. It didn't fill you up.

She was vaguely frustrated, and worse, she couldn't even sort out her own feelings anymore. Part of her felt she should resist, but another part desperately wanted more. And this man kept dangling himself just out of reach, keeping her hooked.

Undeterred by her rebuff, Qin Jiang recaptured her hand, leaned close to her ear, and whispered:

"Qingqiu... are you hungry?"
