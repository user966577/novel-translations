They stepped out of the grove and ran directly into Li Yang and Ye Xuan. Qin Jiang smirked — no surprise there. He'd sensed them from inside the grove, and their meeting was no accident.

Li Qingqiu spotted the pair as well and shortened her stride — the last thing she needed right now was a wardrobe malfunction. She clenched tight and was about to pull Qin Jiang away when he pointed at Li Yang with a grin.

"Hey, Qingqiu — isn't that one of your Li family people?"

"Li family?" She looked at Li Yang. The face was vaguely familiar — wait, hadn't Qin Jiang beaten this one up?

"Him?" She was surprised. It wasn't shocking that someone from the Li family had made it into Huaxia Academy — just unexpected that it was the one Qin Jiang had thrashed.

Li Yang stared back at Li Qingqiu, his head spinning. So it really was Cousin Qingqiu. And from the flush on her face, she'd clearly been doing exactly what he'd imagined. In broad daylight. In a grove.

Was this still the Li family's untouchable goddess?

His emotions churned. Li Qingqiu had been his white moonlight — and now she was being toyed with by another man at will. And she seemed to be enjoying it. She had fallen.

Li Yang's heart ached. His goddess had fallen beyond redemption.

Qin Jiang strolled over with Li Qingqiu in tow, stopped in front of them, and raised a casual hand. "Hey, trash. We meet again."

Li Yang's face went rigid. At the Li estate, this man had greeted him the same way. Now, after all his effort to get into Huaxia Academy, the man was still calling him trash. Had all his work been for nothing?

He wanted to rage but didn't dare. The gap between them was too vast. More importantly, Ye Xuan was standing right beside him, and everyone knew the Lord of Huaxia had a well-documented appreciation for beautiful women. In blunt terms — he was a lecher.

Ye Xuan was beautiful. And during the entrance exam, his illusion had shown Qin Jiang assaulting her. That had been just an illusion, thankfully — but now the scene was playing out for real, and the parallels were terrifying.

Li Yang's anxiety spiked.

"I'm talking to you. Are you deaf?" A familiar force slammed into him, sending him sprawling. Qin Jiang had kicked him to the ground and planted a foot on his back.

"Don't step on him. Dirty." Li Qingqiu tugged at Qin Jiang's sleeve.

Li Yang's mind reeled. This scene — it was almost identical to his illusion. Was he trapped again?

If so, then next would come...

He shuddered. He couldn't watch that again. He bit down hard on his tongue. Pain lanced through him, but the scene didn't waver.

Not an illusion.

He exhaled in relief — but then Qin Jiang lifted his foot, slipped an arm around Li Qingqiu's waist, and kissed her lightly on the lips. "Whatever you say, Qingqiu."

Even the dialogue was nearly identical. A chill crept through Li Yang's veins. This was reality, not a dreamscape — and if events kept following the same path, would it happen again?

He turned to Ye Xuan. Just like in the illusion, she was helping him up. "Li Yang, are you all right?" Her eyes shone with concern.

Li Yang's face was ashen — reality and illusion merging. When he saw her gaze drift toward Qin Jiang, he panicked, terrified she might confront the man. "I'm fine, Ye Xuan."

"Ye Xuan?" Qin Jiang's attention seemed to catch on her. "I remember you — the top performer during the entrance exam." His eyes roamed appreciatively. "Though I have to wonder... what's an elite student doing hanging around with a remedial case?"

Li Yang's stomach dropped. Of course Ye Xuan's brilliance had attracted attention. A man like Qin Jiang would never let someone like her pass unnoticed.

He watched Qin Jiang with open wariness, completely missing the way Ye Xuan's gaze had gone molten, practically dripping with longing. It was so blatant that even Qin Jiang felt uncomfortable — he sent her a private message telling her to rein it in, and she snapped back to focus.

But her eyes lingered on him as she replied evenly: "Elite and remedial are the academy's labels. In my heart, Li Yang is far from lacking."

Then, almost as an afterthought, she glanced at Li Yang before her gaze returned to Qin Jiang.

Gratitude flooded through Li Yang. She was standing up for him — staring down the Lord of Huaxia himself. His appreciation surged alongside his anxiety. If she angered Qin Jiang, he wouldn't be able to protect her.

The silence stretched. Qin Jiang said nothing more, seemingly furious. Li Yang's body was wound tight, trembling with tension — so obvious that even Ye Xuan frowned.

Of course, Qin Jiang wasn't angry. This was all his script, and everyone except Li Yang was an actor. He observed the boy. Every thought Li Yang had was fixated on Ye Xuan. His former white moonlight held no pull at all.

Good. That meant this particular cash crop would survive a while longer. Qin Jiang didn't appreciate anyone pining after his women — even a Child of Destiny who generated Villain Points. If Li Yang kept mooning over Li Qingqiu, Qin Jiang would eventually lose patience and kill him.

Ye Xuan's methods were truly impressive. A Child of Destiny, wrapped around her finger so tightly he'd forgotten his white moonlight entirely.

After a measured silence, Qin Jiang let a smile spread across his face. He looked at Ye Xuan with undisguised approval. "You're quite impressive."

The compliment served double duty — genuine appreciation and a jab at Li Yang. It worked beautifully. Alarm bells went off in the boy's head.

Ye Xuan smiled. "Thank you for the kind words, Manor Lord."

"If you ever need anything, feel free to come find me." He held Ye Xuan's gaze, then made sure Li Yang saw him wink at her — slow, deliberate, unmistakably suggestive.

Then he took Li Qingqiu's hand, kicked Li Yang out of the way, and brushed past Ye Xuan without another word.
