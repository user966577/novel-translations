Before Qin Jiang's eyes, the peaks rose like a mountain range — an endless succession of summits heaving and surging toward him, threatening to bury him under their weight.

But against the onslaught, he stood firm. His hands shot out in a blur, catching peak after peak, giving each a firm squeeze before retreating with graceful ease. A chorus of gasps rang out as the women fell back.

In the opening exchange, Qin Jiang had the advantage. A smile crept across his face. This round would require tactics.

In the past, he'd simply overpowered them. Now, their combined might had crossed a threshold — quantity had become quality. On paper, their total strength exceeded his. Fortunately, he had tools and techniques to supplement.

Their strategy was straightforward: a human-wave assault. It was their greatest — and only — advantage. The key was never letting Qin Jiang rest. Given his recovery speed, any downtime would let him achieve a perfect balance between output and regeneration.

Wave after wave, they pressed forward without pause. Qin Jiang remained calm. His recovery was formidable, and his endurance far exceeded any individual opponent's. He wouldn't flag anytime soon.

Their collective was powerful, but each woman alone was vastly outmatched. If he could isolate them, he'd win. No rush, though. The battle was young — might as well enjoy it. He could even let them have their way with him for a while.

Time wore on. His reserves neared their limit. Time to counterattack.

His eyes snapped open. "Heh. My turn."

He surged upright, catching the advancing forces off guard. They braced themselves — everything hinged on weathering his counteroffensive. Exchanging glances, they took heart from their numbers. Surely they could hold.

They shifted to defense, steeling their resolve. Yet underneath the determination, a secret hope stirred — that his counterattack would be even more ferocious. That would make it more... thrilling.

He didn't disappoint.

His first target was An Xihe — the strongest. Take her down, and the rest would follow.

An Xihe's eyes went wide. She tried to rally the others, but every last sister took a step backward, gently pushing her to the front.

The first wave of a counterattack was always the most intense. They all knew they couldn't handle it. Better to wait for the second or third wave — less overwhelming, more pleasurable. The sweet spot.

As for this first wave? Since Qin Jiang had already zeroed in on An Xihe, she could bear the brunt. With her strength, she'd actually enjoy this level of intensity. Pushing her forward was, really, doing her a favor.

"Looks like it's just you and me," Qin Jiang said with a grin.

An Xihe huffed, shot a murderous glare at her retreating sisters, then squared up. "Bring it. I'm not afraid of you!"

"No?" He blurred forward, appearing before her instantly, and pulled her into his arms. One hand tilted her chin; the other produced a Kidney Treasure Pill, which he dangled in front of her nose. The teasing in his eyes was unmistakable.

An Xihe's face blanched. "That's cheating!"

"You outnumber me. Why can't I use a little enhancement?" He shrugged, popped the pill, and swallowed. "Ready, Xihe?"

She could feel his strength surge back. Without the others, she didn't stand a chance.

Her hands braced against his chest. A thought struck — her sisters had abandoned her, and turnabout was fair play. She bit her lip, wrapped her arms around his neck, and whispered in his ear: "Husband... go easy on me?"

"I thought you weren't scared."

He brushed his lips across her cheek. She kissed him back, and when their lips met, they lingered.

"I can help you," she murmured when they broke apart.

"Help me?"

"Mhm." She nodded toward the others. "I'll help you deal with them."

"That's treason."

"They betrayed me first!" She pouted, looking up at him with wounded eyes. "But before we team up... could you maybe give me a little gift first?"

She remembered the pill he'd just taken and quickly added, "Not too much, though. Okay?"

"Isn't this selling out your teammates?"

"They sold me out first!" She huffed, utterly righteous in her indignation.

She turned on the charm, voice going soft and sweet. "Please, husband? I want..."

"Deal."

He pinched her cheek, kissed her, and obliged.
