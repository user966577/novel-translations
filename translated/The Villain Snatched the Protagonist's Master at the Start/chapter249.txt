The village-like headquarters looked plain, but the atmosphere was ceremonial. Inner sect disciples had been mobilized—some maintaining order, some greeting guests, some collecting gifts, and of course recording every tribute meticulously. A festive air filled the grounds.

In a large open area, rows of small wooden stools had been set out. Leaders from various sects sat on them, looking uniformly uncomfortable. Back home, they were figures of reverence. Here, they were perched on kiddie stools. Most were experiencing this particular humiliation for the first time—last year's attendees had sworn never to return.

With nearly everyone present, the Human Dao Sect leadership felt a twinge of regret—the other two great powers had declined again. Their deep pockets would have made for generous tribute.

"Sect Master, it's about time to begin."

The Human Dao Sect Master was a middle-aged man of modest height in a plain gray robe. A thin mustache framed his upper lip, giving him a look that was more "shifty merchant" than "sect leader." But no one dared underestimate him. As head of one of the three great powers and a Human Immortal cultivator, he was reputed to be the strongest below the True Immortal level. His name was Dao Kun, respectfully known as Immortal Kun.

Dao Kun nodded and cleared his throat. The elder beside him caught the signal and glanced to the side. A moment later—the crackle of firecrackers. One string. Just one.

The visiting leaders' expressions twitched. The Human Dao Sect was truly, genuinely cheap.

After the firecrackers, Dao Kun nodded with satisfaction, stepped forward, and projected his voice: "The auspicious hour has arrived. Our Human Dao Sect, in accordance with Heaven and Earth's fortune, now conducts the selection of inner sect disciples. Those with wealth—ahem—talent, ability, and virtue may enter the inner sect. That is all. The selection officially begins."

He stepped back and whispered to the elder beside him: "How much tribute did we collect this year?"

"Heh heh, a bit more than last year. We'll be a little more comfortable."

"Good, good." He nodded. "How many paid the entry fee?"

"Not many—about a dozen. Not many people can produce a million spirit stones."

"Tch, a dozen is still a dozen." Dao Kun clicked his tongue, accepting the figure. He knew full well that some had been coerced and the rest conned. In reality, the elders had already handpicked the inner sect's real recruits ahead of time. This selection was primarily a gift-harvesting ceremony. The exam itself was incidental—but who knows, maybe they'd stumble across a gem or two.

"Do we have a plan for this year's exam?"

The elders exchanged glances. Plan? They never had a plan. They improvised every year.

Dao Kun read the room. Same as always. "Fine. We'll wing it."

Meanwhile, in the crowd, Chen Changsheng surveyed the sea of people and sighed. "So many candidates."

"Of course," the old man said with a toothy grin. "The Human Dao Sect is one of the three great powers, and it has by far the most disciples. Every outer disciple dreams of making inner sect."

"How many slots are there?"

"No set number." The old man shrugged. "Depends. Sometimes a few hundred, sometimes barely a handful." He jerked his chin toward Dao Kun and the elders. "Their mood."

"That arbitrary?"

The old man chuckled, about to elaborate, when something caught his attention. His eyebrows shot up. "Actually... I just remembered I have something to take care of. Good luck with the exam!"

He vanished.

Qin Jiang and company had entered Human Dao Sect territory. He stood at the front of the traveling palace, admiring the nine celestial horses pulling it. Magnificent creatures. Compared to them, his own Void Beast—Little Xu—was a bit of an eyesore. Ugly as sin. Still, loyalty counted for something. Once Little Xu broke through to Great Emperor, he wouldn't swap mounts.

As he was musing, Qing Chan emerged and stood beside him, gazing ahead. "The Human Dao Sect's old ancestor is here."

"Their ancestor?" He turned. She nodded, and a figure appeared outside the palace—an old man with a chicken leg in hand. If Chen Changsheng had been present, he would have recognized him instantly as the geezer who'd been swindling him for weeks.

"Heh heh, Immortal Qing Chan, it's been a while." The old man greeted her cheerfully, then gave Qin Jiang a curious glance. 'How is this young man standing in front of Qing Chan? And from their positioning... she's deferring to him?'

Qing Chan regarded him coolly. "Your sect's invitation made it to our doorstep. Naturally, we came to show our support."

"We're truly honored." The old man smiled, though internally he was suspicious. They'd sent invitations every year and been ignored every year—why show up now? He could sense immortal-path auras inside the palace. Four of them. The Azure Lotus Divine Palace had come in full force? For a glorified talent show? Not a chance. This formation looked more like a war party.

His guard went up. He scanned the surroundings covertly. If the Azure Lotus Divine Palace had mobilized, had the Limitless Holy Land as well?

"Has the inner sect selection begun?" Qin Jiang asked.

The old man turned to him. Young as he was, the man dared not be dismissive—anyone standing ahead of Qing Chan warranted respect. "And you are...?"

Before Qin Jiang could answer, Qing Chan spoke. "Your intelligence network is truly lacking. You don't recognize Qin Jiang?"

"Qin Jiang?" The old man frowned, murmuring the name. "Sounds familiar..." He took a bite of his chicken leg, and his eyes lit up. He snapped his fingers. "Got it! You're the young man who killed a Human Immortal at the Heavenly Pill Palace!"

"'Young man'?" Qing Chan's brow furrowed. She gave a cold snort. "Dao Zhen, show some respect. He is my husband. From now on, address him as Young Master Qin."
