After spending a while longer in the Space-Time Temple, they finally emerged. Everyone except Qin Jiang was positively glowing.

He stretched, rolled his shoulders, and surveyed his satisfied women with a smile. At last, he'd gotten his fill.

"Business concluded. Time for some fun."

Liu Shuwan hugged his arm and smiled. "Before we entered the Space-Time Temple, I already sent word about your plan to establish a faction."

He nodded. By his estimate, the news had barely been out for a day. His goal was hegemony over all of Azure Cloud Heaven — every faction submitting to his authority. Most would adopt a wait-and-see approach at first. They needed a demonstration of force.

He turned to Qing Chan. "Chan'er, have you identified the factions belonging to those five True Immortals and the other Human Immortals from the Chaos District?"

"Of course. The five True Immortals were Azure Cloud Heaven's overlords — they didn't need investigating. As for the Human Immortals, some served those five, others had independent factions. Do you want us to move against them?"

He gazed out across the vast expanse of Azure Cloud Heaven. "Wipe them all out."

"Done." Qing Chan nodded without hesitation. At her level, mercy was a foreign concept. Killing a few people was no different from stepping on ants. "I'll handle it personally. Not one of them will escape."

He nodded, pinched her cheek, and added, "Be careful. And leave the Wolf Race to me — I'll deal with them."

He was heading to the Demon Domain anyway. Yu Lan and Yu Ru were still waiting. And there was a father-in-law to impress — destroying the Wolf Race would make an excellent gift.

Qing Chan swatted his hand away, stepped forward, rose on tiptoe, and kissed him. "Then I'm off."

Besides Qing Chan, Jian Yao, Ning Xue'er, and Chen Baizhe would also be deployed. All Human Immortals, and with Qing Chan leading, destroying a few factions posed no real threat.

As they left, Qin Jiang called after them. "Don't go alone. Look out for each other, and stay safe."

They acknowledged and departed.

An Xihe remained by his side — she was coming to the Demon Domain. So were Xue Mei, Hu Xian'er, and Xiao Jiu, all of whom wanted to visit home. Liu Shuwan stayed behind to oversee logistics and planning. Everyone below Human Immortal stayed in the Void Divine Temple — they couldn't contribute to what came next.

"Heading to the Demon Domain now?" An Xihe asked.

Since taking the Immortal King medicine, her blood essence had fully recovered, and the residual potency had stabilized her freshly achieved cultivation.

Beside her, Xue Mei, Hu Xian'er, and Xiao Jiu looked expectantly at Qin Jiang.

"You still haven't brought my White Fox Tribe back," Hu Xian'er reminded him, pouting.

Early on, she'd handed her entire tribe over to him for safekeeping, but all this time, he still hadn't relocated them. He ruffled her hair. "This trip, I'll bring them back."

"Don't forget! I'll remind you." She huffed.

He nodded and turned to An Xihe and Xue Mei. "Let's go."

Then he pulled Liu Shuwan into his arms, kissed her forehead, and murmured, "I'll be back soon. Hold down the fort."

"Don't worry. With me here, you have nothing to worry about." She caressed his cheek and rose on tiptoe for a kiss.

He released her, waved, and set off with An Xihe and the others toward the Demon Domain. With An Xihe's Immortal King power, even carrying several passengers, they made incredible time. Less than half a day later, they arrived.

Looking out over the vast Demon Domain, Qin Jiang felt a twinge of nostalgia. Last time he'd come here, he'd only had Jian Yao and Mo Mo — two Human Immortals. Now he had an Immortal King at his side. In comparison, the Demon Domain was nothing.

"I remember there were two Human Immortals here who crossed me and ran." He scratched his head, trying to recall. "Can't remember which two."

Hu Xian'er raised her hand. "One was the Eagle Immortal. The other was the Horse Tribe's ancestor."

The little fox had an excellent memory — especially when it came to people who'd tried to kill Qin Jiang. She remembered every single one. Even if he hadn't brought it up, she'd planned to ask her father to deal with them once she returned to the Fox Race. She'd actually mentioned it before, but Hu Yan had declined — two Human Immortals, one a rogue cultivator who could vanish at any time, was a risk the Fox Race couldn't afford.

"Right, right!" Qin Jiang nodded vigorously. "Them! Last time they got away. Let's see if they can pull that off again."

His smile dripped with killing intent.

An Xihe took his hand, her tone imperious. "Relax. No one's getting away."

"Good. Let's visit the Celestial Rabbit Tribe first — drop off Xue Mei and Xiao Jiu."

They headed for the Celestial Rabbit Tribe. Along the way, Qin Jiang explained his plan: elevate the tribe to one of the Demon Domain's three great powers. Xue Mei would personally slay the Horse Tribe's ancestor and the Eagle Immortal, with An Xihe assisting from the shadows. The tribe just needed the reputation. Two Human Immortal kills under Xue Mei's name would shake the entire Demon Domain, and with Qin Jiang publicly backing them, no one would dare touch the tribe.

Xue Mei agreed without hesitation.

They arrived around evening and went straight to Xue Mei's private quarters. "Let's rest for the night. We'll start preparations tomorrow."

Xue Mei hesitated, eyeing the four women present, then looked at Qin Jiang. "You sure it's just one night?"

She knew him well enough. His idea of "resting" was never entirely proper. And with four beauties around, he absolutely would not behave.

One night? Not a chance.
