In the hidden space, Qin Jiang and Murong Qing had been at it for the better part of a day.

Murong Qing lay curled against his chest. She looked up at him, half-pouting, half-glaring, and pinched his side. "You were supposed to be the one getting punished!"

"Heh, my queen, I played your loyal minister. Doesn't that count?"

Murong Qing's lips puckered in displeasure. "You were a treasonous minister!"

"Would Your Majesty prefer a boring, obedient one?"

"Oh, you..." She huffed, then pushed herself upright and looked down at him imperiously. "I don't care. You're still getting punished!"

"Alright, alright. How does Qing'er want to punish me?"

Qin Jiang propped himself up, eyebrows raised in a teasing challenge.

Murong Qing considered her options. She couldn't be too harsh—she'd feel bad. And knowing him, he wouldn't sit still for anything truly unpleasant anyway. She needed something that would satisfy her desire for payback while being something he'd actually accept.

After a moment's thought, her eyes lit up. She knew exactly what his particular fixation was.

She shifted, placed her foot against his chest, and smirked. "Here."

Qin Jiang swallowed. "Really?"

"Mhm~"

She nodded, then leaned back, bracing herself with her arms, a rosy flush spreading across her cheeks. She knew full well that this "punishment" was really more of a reward. But the sensation was one she quite enjoyed, and from her perspective, making him serve her this way counted as punishment enough.

Only... after a while...

"Are you done yet?" she pressed.

This particular punishment's duration was no longer in her hands. That was up to Qin Jiang, and he was clearly in no rush.

"Nope," came his muffled reply.

Murong Qing puffed out her cheeks and shook her head in resignation. She had no choice but to let him continue.

Admittedly, this was getting a bit depraved.

Eventually, Qin Jiang released her with obvious reluctance, pulled her back into his arms, and grinned. "Still hungry. What do I do?"

"No more for you," Murong Qing declared with a coy huff, a crafty gleam in her eyes. Now came the real punishment—making him want what he couldn't have.

"Qing'er~" He nuzzled her cheek, turning on the charm. Qin Jiang in wheedling mode was a force to be reckoned with.

But Murong Qing held firm. "No!"

"Just a little taste~"

"I said no!"

"Wifey~"

The word hit her like a bolt. Her resolve wavered. This scoundrel and his honeyed tongue...

After a brief hesitation, she looked at him and caved. "Fine. Just once."

"Deal~"

His eyes lit up and he dove right in, wasting not a second.

True to his word, he finished quickly this time. Murong Qing blinked in surprise. Since when was he this obedient?

"Had enough?" she asked.

He shook his head, eyes roaming over her with undisguised hunger. "Can't just have one course, can I?"

"You..." Murong Qing's face flushed scarlet. She glared at him, exasperated. "What else do you want?"

"Everything."

Qin Jiang's appetite was not easily sated. Nothing short of a full banquet would suffice. He pulled her close, nuzzling against her. "Wifey~ let me have some more~"

"Oh, honestly... what am I going to do with you?"

What could she do with a husband who loved to wheedle? Spoil him, obviously.

Under his expectant gaze, she nodded. "Fine, fine. Help yourself. All of it."

"Heh, best wife ever~"

He kissed her on the lips, then let his eyes wander, surveying the full spread. Where to begin? Every inch was exquisite—just looking made his mouth water.

Murong Qing, pink-cheeked but willing, presented herself fully. "There. It's all yours. Eat whatever you want."

"Don't mind if I do."

He licked his lips and buried himself in the feast, sampling everything with abandon. First a full pass to try it all, then back for a proper, thorough appreciation.

Murong Qing held his head against her, feeling his enthusiasm. "Slow down."

"Heh, it's too good. I can't help myself," came his muffled reply.

She stroked his hair. "There's no rush. I'm not going anywhere. Take as long as you like."

"Then I'll never have enough."

"Is it really that good?"

"Absolutely."

"Then whenever you want, I'll give you whatever you want. However much, however long. It's all yours."

Her voice softened to silk. In her arms, Qin Jiang nodded—then opened his mouth and took another taste. Murong Qing shivered, holding him tighter.

After a thorough first pass, he wasn't done savoring. He started over, this time unhurried, lingering on each delicacy and offering his assessments. Every review was glowing.

Depraved? Perhaps. But his lavish praise left a warm glow in Murong Qing's chest. His love of the feast was really his love of her.

He was utterly smitten with her, wasn't he?
