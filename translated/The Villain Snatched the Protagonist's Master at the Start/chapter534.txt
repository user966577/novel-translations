An Xihe's aura grew heavier by the day, blanketing the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Word that Huaxia was about to produce an Immortal Emperor spread everywhere.

Countless beings were stunned. Huaxia's loyalists celebrated, exhilarated by their faction's growing might. Resistance fighters, however, sank into despair—any hope of retribution had vanished.

That despair drove some rebels to plunge into the Chaos, hoping to disrupt An Xihe's seclusion. But their strength was laughable. They couldn't get anywhere near her; the outermost defensive perimeter dispatched them effortlessly.

Time flowed on. One year remained before the Heavenly Domain opened.

Then, one day, the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands convulsed. The sky split open. The earth caved in. Mountains displaced, rivers shifted—an apocalyptic tremor that engulfed all creation.

Countless beings cried out in terror. Huaxia's powerhouses emerged in force, straining to stabilize heaven and earth. And even they were shaken. Was this what an Immortal Emperor was? The mere shockwaves of a breakthrough had brought the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands to the brink of annihilation. If she actually attacked in earnest, the devastation would be beyond imagination.

In that moment, every cultivator with lingering ambitions abandoned them entirely. Life under Huaxia's rule was, on reflection, quite pleasant.

As the tremors intensified, even the combined efforts of all those powerhouses couldn't hold the world together. They themselves felt severely threatened. Fortunately, at the critical juncture, Qing Chan and the others stepped forth. The power of seven Immortal Kings proved sufficient to stabilize everything, though most of their attention remained fixed on An Xihe. Steadying the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands was merely an afterthought—it was, after all, their home turf. Letting it crumble would just mean tedious reconstruction.

For a full half year, the near-apocalyptic tremors continued before finally, slowly, subsiding. Despite the Immortal Kings' protection, the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands had been ravaged beyond recognition. From high above, the landscape was a wasteland.

Then, at last, An Xihe's breakthrough was complete.

A phantom figure materialized—vast and regal, radiating the overwhelming majesty of an emperor. She gazed upon the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands with cold, noble eyes. Innumerable beings fell to their knees, unable to resist.

Amidst their reverent cries, the phantom raised one hand and lightly pressed a finger downward. The ruined mountains and rivers began to heal at stunning speed. In just a few hours, the scarred earth was restored to verdant life.

The phantom faded, leaving only countless genuflecting souls behind.

Atop the Immortal Marrow pillar, An Xihe opened her eyes. A vast, surging aura poured forth, declaring to all of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands the birth of an Immortal Emperor.

Nearby, Qin Jiang watched her with a brilliant grin. The Immortal Emperor's pressure parted neatly around him—he felt none of it. He walked toward her, step by step. With each step he took, the imperious aura withdrew further, until he set foot on the pillar and it vanished entirely, leaving only a slender silhouette.

He closed the distance and pulled An Xihe into his arms. "Xihe, well done."

He'd provided enormous support for her breakthrough, true—but her own effort was not to be overlooked. And it wasn't just An Xihe. Every woman at his side had worked desperately hard, all so they could protect him once they entered the Heavenly Domain. At the very least, none of them wanted to be a burden.

An Xihe's motivation had been the purest of all—she'd done it purely to keep Qin Jiang safe. She knew his personality well enough: even in the Heavenly Domain, he'd stir up trouble without hesitation. She needed the strength to let him act as recklessly as he pleased.

An Immortal Emperor might not be able to walk unchallenged through the Heavenly Domain, but it was certainly better than Immortal King.

He lowered his head and kissed her forehead. She reached up and wrapped her arms around his neck. Their eyes met, emotions flowing between them.

And then—

Crack.

A web of fractures raced across the Immortal Marrow pillar. In the next instant, it shattered completely. The surrounding ocean of spirit stones crumbled to dust in the same breath—every last drop of energy had been absorbed by An Xihe.

Floating in the Chaos, Qin Jiang and An Xihe held each other. He glanced down. Their bed was gone.

They exchanged a look and blinked. An Xihe burst out laughing and nestled against his chest. "Let's go back."

"Mm."

They soared into the immortal vessel, still wrapped in each other's arms.

In the distance, the women who'd been guarding An Xihe for years pursed their lips in unison. They'd toiled faithfully for years, and she hadn't spared them so much as a second glance. And that Immortal Emperor pressure hadn't exactly gone easy on them either. Some sisterhood this was!

Nursing their grievances, they filed back into the vessel. After years of self-denial during guard duty, they refused to let An Xihe monopolize him.

Time to fight for their share.

The ravenous women proved far more ferocious than usual. Their combat ability had risen dramatically. Fortunately, Qin Jiang had built up his own reserves; otherwise, he'd have been truly overwhelmed.

Under the influence of the Space-Time Temple, it took a full year to sate them all. Qin Jiang was shaken—that had been close. Much too close. He'd nearly lost.

He needed more Kidney Treasure Pills. Dosage had to go up. Ten a day. If it didn't kill him, he'd keep taking them. He absolutely could not fail.

After all, who knew how many beauties awaited him in the Heavenly Domain? If he was already struggling now, he wouldn't dare take on many more later.

After the great battle, Qin Jiang and the women rested for several days, then began their final preparations for departure. Less than half a year remained before the Heavenly Domain passage opened.

In that remaining time, everything had to be in order.

First and foremost: the last three Children of Destiny—Li Yang, Nangong Yun, and Wu Tian.

These three leeks had been cultivated long enough. It was time to harvest them.

Over the years, they'd provided a steady stream of Villain Points. By Huaxia's standards, they were practically meritorious contributors.

Unfortunately for them, as meritorious contributors, their lives had been absolutely miserable.

Qin Jiang was a compassionate man. He couldn't bear to see them suffer so. It was time to put them out of their misery.
