Grey Cloud Heaven — absorbed into Huaxia without a sword being drawn.

The administrative details fell to the Li Family Ancestor. Sun Qian served as his deputy and, more importantly, as Qin Jiang's insurance policy. With the True Spirit Slave Seal, Sun Qian would never betray him.

On top of that, Qin Jiang ordered a strong cultivator transferred from Huaxia's headquarters in Azure Cloud Heaven to serve as a second Vice Lord. One Lord, two Vice Lords — a clean structure.

The remaining leadership positions didn't require Qin Jiang's personal attention. The Li Family Ancestor and Sun Qian would use those appointments to build alliances and consolidate control.

With the Grey Cloud Heaven branch's framework in place and initial ties to headquarters established, the connections would only deepen over time.

As every faction publicly declared for Huaxia, Qin Jiang rolled out his next initiative: Huaxia Academy expansion. Same model as Azure Cloud Heaven — each faction would contribute instructors, all at least Ancient Emperor level, along with their most talented youths.

No one dared object.

Starting with the Li family, every faction submitted their teacher nominations within three days. The selected cultivators departed for Huaxia Academy's construction site at Qin Jiang's command — much-needed reinforcements, since the academy was still less than half-built. With this influx of manpower, progress would accelerate significantly.

That done, Qin Jiang washed his hands of the remaining minutiae. Everything else was the Li Family Ancestor's and Sun Qian's problem.

As for Qin Jiang himself — soft jade in his arms, music day and night.

During this interlude, the sheltered Li Qingqiu was "sold out" by Qin Jiang several times over, each time losing her composure so thoroughly she couldn't keep count. Her icy facade had become unsalvageable.

By now, she'd mastered the arts of wheedling, begging for mercy, and every shade of coquettish protest.

Case in point — right now, facing Qin Jiang's aggressive advance, Li Qingqiu wore her most pitifully adorable expression. One small hand seized his finger and rocked it gently back and forth.

"Qin Jiang, I'm so tired~"

She leaned into him, arms looping around his waist, wide eyes gazing up, blinking slowly. "Hold me while I sleep? Please~?"

"Sure."

He smiled and pulled her close. Even he had a soft spot for this level of sweetness. She beamed, planted a quick kiss on his cheek, and chirped, "You're the best~"

"Alright, rest up."

He kissed her forehead and stroked her hair. She nodded, burrowed into his chest, and added, "No funny business while I'm sleeping~"

"When have I ever needed you to be asleep for that?"

He pinched her cheek. She pouted, grabbed the offending hand, and held it as she closed her eyes.

He smiled, squeezed back, and dropped another kiss on her brow. "Sleep."

Her transformation delighted him. This softness existed only for him — in front of everyone else, she remained the untouchable ice queen.

On the other side of the compound, An Xihe and the rest were recovering. Qin Jiang had worn them out too. Even an Immortal King had limits, apparently.

He shook his head and left them in peace. Holding Li Qingqiu, he turned his mind to business. They'd been away nearly a month. Time to head home.

Liu Shuwan and the others were probably missing him. But before leaving, there was one loose end: the Li family's Child of Destiny.

Li Yang was still a nobody, but according to the system's plot spoilers, his physique would awaken soon. After that — destiny's chosen. Qin Jiang planned to install him at Huaxia Academy where he could be monitored, occasionally bullied for system rewards, and allowed to grow until he hit Human Immortal. Then — harvest.

Human Immortal-level Children of Destiny paid out handsomely. And he'd killed more than one already.

The key was not letting the crop grow too wild. Li Yang's red line was Human Immortal. The moment he broke through — time to reap.

'Before entering the Heavenly Domain, I need to farm as many rewards as I can.'

The Heavenly Domain — he'd seen it in the system's story spoilers. It was teeming with powerhouses and prodigies. Immortal Kings were far from rare. Immortal Emperors, a realm that didn't even exist in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, weren't even the apex. Something even stronger lurked above.

Qin Jiang's current best trump card could handle Immortal Kings. Against an Immortal Emperor, he was helpless. Against anything above that...

'Thirty years. I need to reach Immortal King at minimum.'

The Heavenly Domain situation created urgency. He wasn't alone in this — his women would come with him, and they'd never agree to be left behind. His strength had to grow.

Breaking through to Immortal King demanded astronomical amounts of energy. An Xihe had consumed Azure Cloud Heaven's entire Origin to reach Immortal King. He'd need similar resources, though draining all of Huaxia to feed one man wasn't an option.

Worst case, he could siphon a fraction from each of the Nine Heavens — spread the load, minimize the damage.

His own breakthrough was manageable. But the women also needed power-ups. Fortunately, his Yin-Yang Law meant that... enthusiastic joint cultivation sessions would boost their progress considerably.
