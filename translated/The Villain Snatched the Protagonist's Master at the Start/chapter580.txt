At his words, the sea surged upward, forming a labyrinth that imprisoned everyone within. The Immortal Emperor's legacy waited at the center. Reach it and claim it—that was all they had to do. Of course, the path was riddled with obstacles.

"Do your best to claim my legacy. I'll be waiting!"

The Heavenly Waters Great Emperor's voice echoed through the maze. Inside it, directions blurred. No one could tell which way led to the center. Were they supposed to rely on pure luck?

Black Dragon and Little Xu had been separated—as had everyone else. Individual cells in a vast water maze. Black Dragon studied the walls of churning seawater and considered punching through. But the water was impossibly fluid and yielding—force passed right through it.

'Should've grabbed the legacy the moment it appeared,' he grumbled.

The Heavenly Waters Great Emperor's current form was likely just a remnant consciousness animating seawater. Its combat power couldn't be that formidable—at best, Immortal King level. And Black Dragon had the Immortal King Killing Formation Plate. A direct assault while the remnant was caught off guard could have destroyed it entirely.

Too late for that now. Trapped in the maze with no idea where the remnant was, deploying the formation blindly would be reckless. If the Great Emperor detected it and prepared, the formation might not finish the job. And once its energy was spent, Black Dragon would be the one destroyed. Too risky.

Little Xu, elsewhere in the maze, was equally frustrated. Worse, his spatial abilities were heavily suppressed.

"This bastard's targeting me on purpose!"

After venting, he picked a random direction and started walking. Almost everyone was stumbling around like headless chickens, hitting dead ends and fighting water puppets, making painfully slow progress.

All except one person, who moved as though he knew exactly where the legacy was.

Zhao Sheng.

He touched his forehead. The streak of light in his consciousness was guiding him, pointing the way like a compass. He followed it, excitement building.

At the same time, someone else was converging on his position—Liu Xing. In the maze's restricted environment, he'd discovered that he could still sense the tracking function of the message stone he'd given Zhao Sheng.

If Zhao Sheng had triggered the anomaly, he might possess the means to locate the legacy. Liu Xing didn't hesitate—he headed straight for the signal, alerting Black Dragon and the others en route. The Huaxia operatives, previously wandering aimlessly, locked onto Liu Xing's position and began converging.

About fifteen minutes later, Liu Xing dispatched a water puppet and spotted Zhao Sheng.

"Hey! Over here!"

"Liu Xing?" Zhao Sheng was surprised but came over.

Liu Xing clapped him on the shoulder, beaming. "What are the odds! I was just blundering around and ran straight into you. Must be fate!"

Zhao Sheng's smile was strained. He'd been certain of finding the legacy on his own—and now he had company. What if Liu Xing tried to compete for it?

"We should split up," Zhao Sheng suggested carefully. "More ground to cover that way. Whoever finds it, we both win."

"Makes sense," Liu Xing agreed. Then he shrugged. "But honestly, I came for the fun of it. This legacy doesn't suit me. I'd rather wander with you than stumble around alone."

Left with no graceful way to refuse—especially after Liu Xing had helped him—Zhao Sheng relented. He tugged Liu Xing in the direction the light was guiding him. "Let's go this way."

"Sure. All the same to me."

Liu Xing's nonchalance reassured Zhao Sheng. The man genuinely seemed indifferent to the legacy. They walked together, Zhao Sheng's guidance proving unerring. The Huaxia operatives followed at a distance—close enough to track, far enough not to arouse suspicion.

About an hour later, Zhao Sheng stopped. Liu Xing stared, genuinely impressed.

"You actually found it!"

Before them lay the pool of the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor's heart's blood. The Great Emperor himself hovered above it—no longer a construct of seawater, but a translucent remnant soul. It was anyone's guess how much power he had left in that state.
