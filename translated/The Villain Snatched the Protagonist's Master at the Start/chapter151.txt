Before the words had even landed, a figure materialized in the sky above.

The enforcers looked up, their expressions turning fervent. Every one of them dropped to one knee and roared in unison: "Greetings, Commander!"

The Enforcement Grand Commander—a Great Emperor-level powerhouse whose reputation preceded him across all of Azure Cloud Heaven.

The instant he appeared, his piercing gaze swept over Qin Jiang's group. He scanned each person in turn and ultimately settled on Liu Shuwan. Everyone else's cultivation was relatively modest. Jian Yao and Mo Mo were unreadable, so in his estimation, the only real threat was Liu Shuwan.

But before he could act, Liu Shuwan let out a cold hum and drew her sword. Ferocious power laced with Sword Heart intent tore through the air. The blade light sheared through the void and hurtled straight at the Grand Commander. His expression darkened.

'She dares act this brazen—in the Heavenly Pill Palace?!'

She clearly didn't take the Palace seriously at all.

With an angry grunt, the Grand Commander unleashed his spiritual energy. Emperor's might rolled outward, making every onlooker tremble. He threw a single punch.

The devastating force intercepted the blade light head-on. A thunderous detonation shook the ground, sending several weaker cultivators collapsing to their knees. The shockwave from the clash left faces pale and the unlucky ones spitting blood.

Only Qin Jiang's group remained untouched.

When the aftershocks subsided, the Grand Commander had been forced several steps back. He tucked his hand behind his back, shaking it discreetly—his arm was trembling. His face was grim. That exchange had cost him more than he cared to admit.

Liu Shuwan was already winding up for another strike, but Qin Jiang stopped her. Between two Great Emperors of equal standing, a real fight could go either way, and Liu Shuwan might come out on the losing end. Better to let Jian Yao or Mo Mo handle this.

A one-sided stomp was always more satisfying.

Noticing Qin Jiang's gesture, the Grand Commander turned his attention to the young man. Only now did he realize that this youth was the one calling the shots—and anyone who had a Great Emperor at their beck and call was no ordinary person. His eyes flickered.

He glanced toward the enforcement squad captain nearby. The captain caught the hint immediately and darted forward, kneeling before his superior. After a quick salute, he delivered a concise briefing—with special emphasis on Qin Jiang's arrogance and overbearing behavior. The Grand Commander's frown deepened with every word.

'All this—over a few stray remarks?'

But facing a Great Emperor backed by unknown forces, this wasn't a situation he could handle carelessly. The Heavenly Pill Palace was a first-rate power in Azure Cloud Heaven, but it wasn't without rivals—or superiors.

Still, Qin Jiang's people had clearly overstepped. If the Palace didn't respond appropriately, they'd lose all credibility. Especially with the Myriad Pill Assembly just days away—this was not the time for the Heavenly Pill Palace to back down.

His mind raced, and he arrived at a decision. He fixed Qin Jiang with a cold stare.

Regardless of this boy's background, he couldn't afford to show weakness. Besides, the Heavenly Pill Palace was hardly defenseless. Their network of connections extended even into the immortal path, giving them leverage against any mortal-realm powerhouse.

"You violated the Heavenly Pill Palace's rules. Regardless of who you are, you will face punishment—not even a Great Emperor is exempt!" His voice rang out sharp and unyielding, aimed squarely at Qin Jiang.

"Not even a Great Emperor?" Qin Jiang blinked and glanced at Jian Yao and Mo Mo beside him. Then he asked with genuine curiosity: "What about someone on the immortal path?"

The Grand Commander's heart lurched. The way Qin Jiang had phrased that—so casually, so confidently—he might actually have an immortal-path powerhouse backing him. But he'd already committed. There was no backing down now.

"Even the immortal path is not above the law! If our rules are broken, the Heavenly Pill Palace will pursue the matter to the very end!"

His words were powerful and resolute, sending a wave of fervor through the Palace's cultivators. The enforcers practically vibrated with pride.

And then—in the very next breath—the man who'd just delivered that stirring declaration violently coughed a mouthful of blood. His aura plummeted like a stone, and he dropped from the sky like a kite with its string cut.

Fortunately, a Great Emperor's body was sturdy enough to survive a fall.

The Heavenly Pill Palace cultivators who'd been riding the wave of fervor froze. Their passionate expressions locked in place like paused paintings. They stared, utterly dumbfounded.

The Grand Commander scrambled to his feet, and for the first time, genuine fear crossed his face. In that single instant, he'd felt the brush of death itself—but whoever had struck him had held back.

"An immortal-path powerhouse!" he said with absolute certainty. That attack had come from someone on the immortal path. His bold declaration must have offended them, though mercifully, they'd only delivered a warning rather than a killing blow. He scanned the surroundings and called out respectfully: "Would the esteemed senior who has graced our Heavenly Pill Palace with their presence please reveal themselves?"

While everyone else was baffled, Qin Jiang's group knew exactly who'd made the move. Seeing the Grand Commander's pathetic state, Qin Jiang couldn't help but grin.

'Wasn't he just talking about pursuing things to the very end? One blink later—instant capitulation.'

"You said you'd pursue it to the end, didn't you?" Mo Mo stepped forward, her petite face dripping with disdain. "This immortal would love to see how you plan to do that!"

The Grand Commander whipped around. When his eyes found Mo Mo, his expression went rigid. He'd noticed her from the start, of course—she'd been glued to Qin Jiang's side the entire time, occasionally teasing the young man. He couldn't read her cultivation, but given her behavior, he'd assumed she was some pretty ornament the boy kept around.

He hadn't imagined for a second that she was an immortal-path powerhouse.

Not a shred of doubt remained. The immortal-path pressure radiating from Mo Mo's tiny frame was buckling his knees. That small body, in this instant, towered above everyone present.

The Grand Commander hunched under the weight, barely staying upright against the immortal might. Terror flooded his heart, mixed with profound confusion. Why would an immortal-path powerhouse act so intimately with some youth? If Qin Jiang were her kept man, that would make some sense—but the dynamic between them clearly showed the young man was the one in charge.

His eyes swam with bewilderment. He was starting to wonder if this was all a nightmare. Nothing else could explain something this absurd.

"Well?! How exactly do you plan to hold this immortal accountable?!" When he didn't answer, Mo Mo pressed harder.

The Grand Commander's body shuddered. Hold her accountable? How?

The Heavenly Pill Palace had some standing in the immortal world, yes—but that was predicated on not offending actual immortal-path powerhouses and on providing them valuable services. Facing the genuine wrath of an immortal cultivator? The Palace had zero leverage.

What he needed to be doing right now was figuring out how to appease this immortal's anger. Otherwise, the Myriad Pill Assembly wouldn't need to be held at all.

Because the Heavenly Pill Palace itself wouldn't exist anymore.
