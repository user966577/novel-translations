Qin Jiang returned to his residence but didn't go to the Void Divine Temple right away. Instead, he went to the Fortune-Sealing Stele. Under the system's guidance, Lin Chen and Ye Xuan's fortune had been absorbed by the stele and was now his to distribute.

He placed his palm on the stele, and his consciousness was instantly pulled inside. White mist swirled around him, churning as if alive.

"So this is fortune," he murmured.

A flash of gold caught his eye. A small golden dragon was tumbling through the white mist.

"A Fortune Golden Dragon?"

When fortune accumulated to a critical threshold, it could take form—a golden dragon that watched over the entire family. Achieving this, however, was extraordinarily difficult.

Qin Jiang watched the little golden dragon with undisguised delight. The Qin family had birthed a Fortune Golden Dragon. When he thought about it, it made sense—the Qin family was already the mightiest ancient clan, with abundant fortune of its own. Add in the fortune from three Children of Destiny—Xiao Fan, Lin Chen, and Ye Xuan—and it was only natural.

The little dragon noticed Qin Jiang and drifted over with apparent curiosity. He held out his palm, and it coiled into his hand, staring up at him with wide, adorable eyes. It nuzzled his finger with its tiny head, radiating affection.

He stroked its head gently. The dragon closed its eyes in contentment, then rolled over to show its belly.

"System, this is a Fortune Golden Dragon, right?"

【Correct. This Fortune Golden Dragon is composed of the Qin family's fortune combined with that of Xiao Fan, Lin Chen, and Ye Xuan. Since the Qin family effectively revolves around the Host, and the three Children of Destiny's fortune now belongs to the Host, the dragon treats the Host as its father.】

Father. Right.

"If I distribute the fortune, will it disappear?"

【No. The Fortune Golden Dragon was born from fortune but is not fortune itself. It governs fortune. The Host can delegate fortune distribution to the dragon, which will be far more precise than manual allocation. The Host can also instruct it to give preferential treatment to specific individuals.】

"And it won't betray me?"

【Impossible. The Fortune Golden Dragon exists because of the Host. Betrayal would mean its own annihilation.】

Satisfied, Qin Jiang poked the little dragon. Having a fortune manager who worked for free wasn't bad at all—especially one that could handle distribution with precision and zero waste.

"Little one, distribute some fortune for me."

The golden dragon righted itself, considered Qin Jiang for a moment, and nodded.

"Give my parents extra attention. Same for me and my sister. The women in the Void Divine Temple get a generous share too. The ancestral elders in seclusion—especially the ones breaking through to Emperor—give them priority. Everyone else gets a fair share."

The dragon nodded, flicked its tail, and the surrounding white mist rippled, thinning slightly. Then it opened its tiny mouth and let out a soft, low rumble.

"Done already?"

The dragon nodded.

Qin Jiang was impressed. A natural-born fortune controller—blazingly fast. If he'd done this himself, it would have taken ages.

After a few words of praise, he withdrew his consciousness from the stele.

"Next up—the Immortal Path Seed."

He flipped his palm, and the glowing point appeared. Lifting the Fortune-Sealing Stele, he revealed the Immortal Marrow beneath. The spiritual energy in the Qin estate had grown noticeably denser since his return—clearly the Immortal Marrow's doing.

He cradled the Immortal Path Seed and moved it toward the Immortal Marrow. As it drew close, the seed's glow intensified. Closer, closer—and then it trembled and shot straight into the marrow on its own.

"That's it?"

He peered at the Immortal Marrow, but the seed had vanished entirely, its light swallowed by the marrow's radiance. According to the system, it would take about a month to mature into an Immortal Path Law.

But who should receive it? The ancestral elders had only just broken through to Great Emperor—immortality was a distant prospect. Even with an Immortal Path Law, they wouldn't ascend anytime soon. But there were no other candidates...

As he pondered, the Seven Beauties Painting at his side trembled. A flash of light, and Jian Yao materialized, immediately draping herself over him.

She glanced around. "Huh. No other women nearby for once."

"Yao Yao!" Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. She was the perfect candidate.

Seeing the gleam in his eyes, Jian Yao leapt off him and backed away warily. "What perverted scheme are you cooking up now?"

His reputation among his women, it seemed, was thoroughly cemented.

He shook his head and looked her over appraisingly—lingering a beat too long on certain generous proportions. Among all his women, Jian Yao was the most... broad-minded.

Noticing his gaze, Jian Yao crossed her arms over her chest, cheeks reddening. Last time, the pervert had used those to—

"Yao Yao, your cultivation isn't just regular Great Emperor level, is it?"

When the topic shifted to cultivation, Jian Yao straightened with pride. "Obviously not. Don't lump me in with your ancestral fossils. All of them together might not beat me."

"That strong?"

"Of course! Great Emperors have tiers. Your ancestors are newly minted Emperors. I'm at the Ancient Emperor level—one step from the immortal path." She thumped her chest, sending waves through the landscape and drawing Qin Jiang's eyes back. "The immortal path grants true immortality—living as long as the heavens. Incomparably more powerful than a Great Emperor."

Coming back to his senses, Qin Jiang wrapped his arms around her. "The immortal path sounds incredible. Do you think you can break through?"

Her expression faltered, and she shook her head with a trace of melancholy. "It's difficult. Ancient Emperor is only one step from immortality, but that single step may be impossible to take in a lifetime."
