They'd been about to move against the Black Water Serpent when, before Qin Jiang could even act, the other four Snake Race Immortals made their appearance and settled the chieftainship on the spot.

Purple-Scale Serpent — Yu Lan.

She was now the true Empress of the entire Snake Race.

One of the Immortals came in person to the Purple-Scale Serpent territory. "You must be Young Master Qin," the Snake Race Immortal said, regarding Qin Jiang with a warm expression before nodding politely to Jian Yao and the other women.

Since the elder was being courteous, Qin Jiang returned the nod. "That's me. Is there something I can help you with, Senior?"

"I'd like to discuss the Black Water Serpent situation."

According to their intelligence, Qin Jiang was no saint — decisive, ruthless. He'd killed an Immortal who could very well have been won over instead. The man repaid every slight. So they expected he wouldn't simply let the Black Water Serpent off, and had come to try smoothing things over.

"The Black Water Serpent?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

The Snake Race Immortal studied him for a moment, then spoke carefully. "The competition for the chieftainship is over. We hope Young Master Qin can let bygones be bygones." He glanced at Yu Lan. "After all, we're all part of the Snake Race."

Qin Jiang turned to Yu Lan with a smile. "Lan Lan, what do you think?"

"Whatever you decide," Yu Lan said, hugging his arm.

During their crisis, none of these Immortals had said a word about "we're all Snake Race." Without Qin Jiang, her bloodline would have been crippled and the entire Purple-Scale Serpent faction would have faded into obscurity. The chieftainship? It wasn't a gift from these Immortals—it was something they'd been pressured into conceding.

Qin Jiang chuckled and spread his hands. "I'm not part of the Snake Race."

The Immortal sighed. He'd expected as much. "In that case, we hope Young Master Qin will exercise appropriate restraint. We won't help the Black Water Serpent—but we won't help you either. For the time being, we'll all be entering closed cultivation."

With that, he departed. And soon after, news spread that all four Snake Race Immortals had suddenly achieved a collective epiphany and entered strict seclusion, not to be disturbed.

Qin Jiang shook his head with a laugh when he heard.

"They're wary of you," Yu Lan explained, "so they won't help the Black Water Serpent. But they can't be seen helping you move against a fellow serpent clan either—they'd lose all credibility within the Snake Race."

Qin Jiang nodded. "We don't need their help anyway."

The only real threat in the Black Water Serpent clan was the Black Serpent Ancestor, and Qin Jiang had four Immortals of his own. A single clan? Easily crushed.

He swept Yu Lan into his arms, tightening his hold with a grin. "And now my Lan Lan is an Empress."

"I was already an Empress," she huffed playfully. She'd been Empress of the Purple-Scale Serpent before; now she was simply Empress of the entire Snake Race.

"Well, this time you've expanded your territory."

"I suppose."

"And as Empress, shouldn't you reward the person most responsible for said expansion?" Qin Jiang's grin turned roguish. "Let's see—there's credit for protecting the sovereign, credit for annihilating enemies, credit for supporting your reign... My, that's quite the list. What kind of reward does my Empress have in mind?"

His eyes roamed with undisguised intent, and his hands grew rather adventurous. There seemed to be an extra finger involved.

Yu Lan's cheeks flushed as she placed her hands on his shoulders and parted her red lips. "And what reward does my great hero desire?"

"Ahem. Ru Ru tells me that the snake tongue of your people is remarkably... dexterous..."

His gaze burned as it fixed on her lips.

The next morning, having received the Empress's full reward, Qin Jiang strode forth like a triumphant general, brimming with vigor.

Time to deal with the Black Water Serpent.

The assault party didn't need to be large. Four Immortal-path cultivators, plus Liu Shuwan, Yu Lan, Yu Ru, and Hu Xian'er. More than enough.

Everyone besides Qin Jiang was at least a Great Emperor. Hu Xian'er was essentially useless in combat, but her father was nearby. If anything went sideways, having her present guaranteed his intervention.

The Black Water Serpent territory wasn't far, and with a group of powerhouses traveling at full speed, they arrived in under half an hour.

"I'll go first," Yu Ru said, stepping forward.

Her Great Emperor aura erupted without restraint, and she slammed a palm strike directly at the Black Water Serpent stronghold. The Black Water Serpent had poisoned her sister—as the younger sibling, Yu Ru had been itching to do this for a long time.

The impact drew an immediate response. Defensive energy surged upward from below, nullifying the blow, but the shockwave still carved through the territory, killing many and collapsing countless buildings.

Cold gazes shot toward them from within, but not a single Black Water Serpent cultivator dared show themselves. Four Immortals!

Mo Ling's expression was grim. The other Black Water Serpent powerhouses wore open fear on their faces. "Chieftain, where's the Ancestor?"

Without the Black Serpent Ancestor, they couldn't withstand even one of these Immortals, let alone four.

Mo Ling took a steadying breath. "The Ancestor is within the clan, but against four Immortals, he needs the right moment to strike. Our job is to give him that opening."

His subordinates paled. They were supposed to be the vanguard? Against four Immortals? What good would they do? Serve themselves up as snake stew?

"Chieftain, we can't—"

"No arguments! We have to buy the Ancestor time, or we're all dead!" Mo Ling snapped.

One of his warriors clenched his teeth. "What about the other Snake Race Immortals?"

"Hmph. Haven't you heard? They've all gone into seclusion!" Mo Ling's face darkened. Seclusion? Obviously just dodging the storm. The Black Water Serpent had been sacrificed—a peace offering to curry favor with Qin Jiang's Immortals.

What made it worse was that the Black Serpent Ancestor had vanished to who knew where. All Mo Ling could do was bluff his clansmen into buying time—either until the Ancestor returned, or...

He made a break for it himself.

Another attack crashed down. Mo Ling held back, directing his warriors forward instead. "All of you—charge!"

They went, trembling, teeth clenched, clinging to their last shred of hope. They had to create an opening for the Ancestor.

The moment they committed, Mo Ling exhaled in relief and began suppressing his aura, slipping quietly toward the back of the compound. These warriors wouldn't last long. The Ancestor's return was uncertain.

Running was the only option. As the one who'd started this whole mess, staying meant certain death.
