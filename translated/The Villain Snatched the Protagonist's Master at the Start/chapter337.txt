The name Huaxia tore across Azure Cloud Heaven like a hurricane, reaching every corner within days.

Qing Chan and Dao Zhen made public appearances — the Azure Lotus Divine Palace and the Human Dao Sect, the two remaining superpowers of Azure Cloud Heaven, jointly declared their allegiance to Huaxia.

Hot on their heels, the three great Demon Domain clans — the Snake Race, Fox Race, and Celestial Rabbit Tribe — made their own announcements.

The Heavenly Pill Palace, Azure Cloud Heaven's alchemy holy land, followed suit.

Every faction in the realm was shaken to its core. This Huaxia was terrifying enough to bring the strongest powers in existence to heel?

The speculation was unanimous: only one person could have accomplished this — Azure Cloud Heaven's newly-minted Immortal King, An Xihe.

As for Qin Jiang, most cultivators knew of him, but the prevailing opinion was that he was a kept man — a pretty boy riding An Xihe's coattails. After all, when he'd slain those True Immortals, he'd used a killing formation, and An Xihe was a renowned formation master. The obvious conclusion? She'd set it up, and he'd just pulled the trigger.

Qin Jiang, borrowing his wife's power.

And honestly? That was exactly the case. He loved riding on his wives' coattails. Shamelessly, proudly, and with impeccable posture.

While the various factions debated what tribute to bring, a wave of formal invitations arrived at every doorstep. On the cover, two characters — HUAXIA — blazed like a dragon taking flight.

Inside: an invitation to Huaxia's founding ceremony.

Signed: Lord of Huaxia — Qin Jiang.

The recipients stared at that line in disbelief. Qin Jiang? Lord of Huaxia? The kept man had eaten his way straight to the top?

A tidal wave of masculine jealousy swept the realm. "Tch, kept man!" more than a few muttered under their breath — even as they seethed with envy. They wanted to be kept men too. But one glance in the mirror crushed those dreams. That Qin Jiang was practically an incubus. They couldn't compete.

"Quit staring! Check the date — three days from now! Get moving!"

The self-pity evaporated instantly. Three days? That soon? Every faction scrambled to prepare their gifts and hurtled toward Qin Family City at breakneck speed.

They didn't dare dawdle. Qing Chan had just finished massacring a whole roster of hegemons. Nobody wanted to be next on the list for arriving fashionably late. So they all traveled like their lives depended on it — which, in fairness, they might.

Within three days, Qin Family City was packed. Every invited faction had arrived, with Fourth Ancestor and the others handling the reception.

In a quiet courtyard, Qin Jiang reviewed the guest list. Every single invitee had made it. He nodded appreciatively.

"See? I told you — human potential is limitless. You just have to push people a little to see how efficient they can be."

Beside him, Liu Shuwan rolled her eyes. She'd originally planned a one-month lead time to let everyone prepare properly, and for Huaxia to organize itself. But Qin Jiang had wanted to test their hustle and slashed the timeline from a month to three days. From all corners of the realm, in just three days — some of these factions must have nearly killed themselves getting here.

As for Huaxia's own preparations? There were none. These factions weren't being invited as guests — they were being recruited. What was there to prepare?

With An Xihe, Qing Chan, and all his wives at his back, he could crush them with a wave of his hand. Anyone who didn't comply would simply be killed.

Deciding the time was right, Qin Jiang rose and found Fourth Ancestor, ordering all the visiting factions assembled.

Moments later, the still-breathless arrivals found themselves herded into a training ground. No chairs, no tables, no refreshments — just an open field.

Everyone was baffled. This was a founding ceremony? Even the Human Dao Sect had provided stools at their event.

They grumbled internally but kept their mouths shut.

Then, a group of figures appeared before them — Qin Jiang, flanked by the leaders of every faction that had already joined Huaxia, with An Xihe at his side. Standing at the center, a faint smile on his face, the Leadership Charisma made the gathered cultivators sit up and take notice.

"This guy's actually got presence," more than a few thought.

The first to recover shouted: "The Spirit Martial Sect presents one immortal herb — congratulations on Huaxia's founding!"

Everyone else cursed silently. Beaten to the punch. Then the floodgates opened, faction after faction presenting their tribute.

These were groups Liu Shuwan had handpicked — every one of them possessed considerable strength and resources. The gifts were suitably impressive. Not that Qin Jiang cared particularly. He was planning to absorb all of them; the "gifts" were already Huaxia's property.

He gave a casual wave, and attendants collected the offerings. Eventually, the tribute-giving sputtered to an end, and the assembled leaders stood around awkwardly. At a normal ceremony, this would be when everyone sat down for a banquet.

But there were no chairs. Let alone a banquet. They could only stand there, glancing at each other, and ultimately turn their gazes toward Qin Jiang.

"Very good." He smiled. "Your enthusiasm is duly noted." Before anyone could respond, he shifted gears. "However, Huaxia has just been established, and we could use everyone's help. Would you all do me the honor?"

Help? The word hung in the air like a warning bell. The guests exchanged uneasy looks. After a hesitant pause, someone spoke up:

"Young Master Qin, how might we possibly assist Huaxia?"

"Heh, it's quite simple. You can definitely help." He swept a satisfied gaze across the crowd. Excellent selections, all of them — every faction had sent at least one Human Immortal, and the numbers far exceeded the Great Emperors and Ancient Emperors present. Prime workhorses.

"Huaxia has just been founded, and what we need most right now is manpower. Your factions have quite a lot of that, don't they?"

Silence.

Every face darkened. Was he seriously asking all of them to join Huaxia? The man's appetite was bottomless!

Nobody spoke. They didn't dare refuse outright, but they certainly weren't going to volunteer. They had perfectly good lives — who wanted to live under someone else's roof?

The silence deepened. Expected. Qin Jiang heaved a theatrical sigh.

"Xihe, they seem to look down on me. They won't even talk to me..."
