Nangong Yun was thrown off the mountain peak. Mu Yunxiao turned to Qin Jiang, puzzled. "Why didn't you just kill him?"

"You want him dead?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. He hadn't expected her to suggest it. The master-disciple bond had snapped fast.

Mu Yunxiao shook her head. "His life means nothing to me."

Her personality was kind, but she was no saint. Taking Nangong Yun as a disciple and hiding him in the mountains had been kindness enough. She'd even warned him to let go of his grudge against Huaxia and live quietly. Deep down, she knew that kind of hatred could never truly be released, but Nangong Yun had agreed.

So she'd entered seclusion with peace of mind, leaving Weiwei to look after him. She'd assumed he'd at least lie low for a while — a mere Supreme who wanted revenge should have spent decades in cultivation before even thinking about acting. Instead, the moment she'd closed her eyes, he'd gone and founded the Anti-Huaxia Alliance. An open provocation against Huaxia. Worse, he'd dragged Weiwei into it. If Qin Jiang hadn't come personally, the consequences for her and Weiwei would have been unthinkable. And frankly, if they'd been even slightly less attractive, the outcome would have been just as grim. The lord of Huaxia was very particular.

The current result was far better than she'd dared hope, but that didn't excuse what Nangong Yun had done. One misstep and both of them would have been dead. She and Weiwei had somehow stumbled onto the only path to survival — and it happened to be a broad, golden road. All it required was for Qin Jiang to visit regularly, and they could live very comfortably. Her body's condition would be resolved, too. He'd even promised to provide his treasure on priority. Anytime she needed it.

She looked up at his profile. "So Nangong Yun's affairs won't implicate Weiwei now?"

Qin Jiang looked down at her, exasperated. He'd really scared her too well. She still didn't believe him, asking the same question over and over.

Weiwei pinched his side discreetly, shot him a look, then turned to Mu Yunxiao. "Master, Nangong Yun is Nangong Yun and we are us. No matter what, his business won't touch us. Qin Jiang isn't completely heartless."

Qin Jiang scratched his head. That felt like an insult somehow.

Mu Yunxiao studied him. Heartless? Noticing her gaze, Qin Jiang offered his warmest smile — the picture of a caring gentleman. She knew it was an act, but she nodded anyway. Aside from when he was scaring her, he did treat them well. Even in bed, he was attentive to her body and soothed her emotions afterward. That tenderness was intoxicating, like a beautiful dream. Even now, the memory curved her lips upward.

Just then, Qin Jiang sighed, wrapped an arm around her waist, and pulled her against his chest. "You still don't trust me."

"I... n-no, I do..." She blushed, pressed against him.

He shook his head. "Seems like I'll have to go all out to convince you." He scooped her up.

Mu Yunxiao didn't resist. She didn't yet understand what "all out" meant for Qin Jiang. In her experience, he was quite gentle in bed — a gentleness she enjoyed. A bit more of that sounded fine.

Weiwei, however, looked worried. "Qin Jiang, take it easy on her."

"Relax. I know my limits."

She pouted and rolled her eyes. "I've never seen you show any limits."

He raised an eyebrow. "How about you come along and help your mother-in-law share the load?"

"Don't call her that!" Mu Yunxiao squirmed in his arms. The term had been embarrassing enough before, but now that they'd actually... she really couldn't handle it.

Weiwei huffed. "Pervert!" But after a moment's hesitation, concern for her master won out. She nodded. "Fine. I'll go with you."

"Me too!" Lian'er chimed in. She'd rested long enough and was feeling peckish again.

Liu Shuwan and the others followed suit. Qin Jiang agreed readily. The more the merrier.

Only Mu Yunxiao looked uneasy as woman after woman filed into her bedroom. So many people — she wasn't used to this. And Qin Jiang was still carrying her. Sensing her tension, he leaned down and kissed her cheek with a mischievous grin. "Don't worry. All the treasure goes to you."

She flushed. It wasn't the treasure she was worried about — it was the audience. She felt exposed. Still, his teasing eased her nerves somewhat. Weiwei stayed at her side, offering comfort. First time in a large group — of course she'd be nervous. As her disciple, the least Weiwei could do was keep her company. Having a familiar face helped.

Mu Yunxiao steadied her breathing as Qin Jiang set her down and pressed close, kissing her forehead. "You first. Is that okay?"

She clenched her small fists, closed her eyes, mustered her courage, and nodded. "Mm."

"You'll enjoy this."

He smiled and lowered his lips to hers. What followed bore no resemblance to his previous gentleness. Mu Yunxiao's brow creased at the intensity. But this feeling — somehow, it was rather nice.
