Just as Huo Lie approached the palanquin to welcome his bride, a deafening roar shattered the festive air. The crowd looked up to find the enormous head of a colossal beast looming over the Fire Tribe compound.

"A beast?"

Cultivators shot skyward, bristling with killing intent. "This is the Fire Tribe's wedding day! Begone—or don't blame us for showing no mercy!"

Their combined pressure bore down on the Void Beast, whose eyes gleamed with predatory fury. Since becoming Qin Jiang's mount, nothing had dared threaten it. Without hesitation, it swatted a massive paw at the Fire Tribe fighters.

The strike provoked an explosion of outrage, but before they could retaliate, Huo Lie's voice cut through. "Stand down!"

He appeared before the Void Beast in a flash, one arm sweep sending his own men flying. Then he turned to the beast and bowed, his face grave. "Might this be Young Master Qin's carriage?"

The Void Beast squeezed its bulk out of the void, its enormous eyes glaring at Huo Lie. It might be weaker than these cultivators, but its backing was second to none. A mere Nine Tribulations Supreme? It would snarl in the face of a half-Emperor.

"Sharp eyes," Qin Jiang remarked, stepping out of the palace. Qin Lian'er trailed behind him; Huo Qing'er stayed out of sight for now.

The moment Huo Lie saw Qin Jiang, his heart sank. Without missing a beat, he spun around, grabbed the Fire Tribe warriors who'd just attacked—and crushed them all with a single palm strike.

"Young Master Qin, they offended you. Their lives are forfeit. I beg you not to hold it against the Fire Tribe."

Huo Lie bowed low, the picture of deference.

The onlookers stared in disbelief. The Fire Domain's hegemon, a man who could trade banter with the leaders of ancient clans as an equal—reduced to groveling before Qin Jiang.

Had the Qin family's influence really grown this immense?

Qin Jiang glanced at the dead cultivators. The man was decisive, he'd give him that. No wonder he'd had the nerve to steal the Legacy Flame all those years ago. A born pragmatist. Too bad his luck was rotten—even without Qin Jiang, a Child of Destiny would have come for him eventually.

Qin Jiang stepped off the palace and appeared before Huo Lie, giving the Void Beast an affectionate pat on the head. "My little Xu got a scare. A few lives won't make up for that."

Huo Lie's eyes darkened, but he bowed lower. "Whatever Young Master Qin desires—if it's within the Fire Tribe's power, we will comply."

"Is that so?" Qin Jiang smiled thinly and looked toward the bride, who had just stepped out of her palanquin. "Since you're so sincere, I won't make things difficult. Just one thing—your bride. I'll be taking her."

There was no request in his tone. Only command.

Huo Lie's head snapped up, his aura erupting for a split second before he caught himself and reined it in. "My apologies—a momentary lapse in control. I meant no offense." He paused, jaw clenching. "As for the bride..."

He bit down hard and stepped aside. "Young Master Qin—please."

Their exchange hadn't exactly been quiet. Most of the guests had heard every word, and the crowd was stunned. The rumors were true—the Qin family's young master really did covet other men's women. And he was stealing this one in broad daylight!

Yet the Fire Tribe's clan leader had agreed.

What magnanimity. What agony.

As the crowd reeled, Qin Jiang leveled a long look at Huo Lie, then headed toward the palanquin. The gathered guests scrambled to clear a path, especially the men who'd brought their wives—they shielded their women from view, terrified of drawing Qin Jiang's attention.

The women, on the other hand, made a point of being seen, throwing flirtatious glances his way. If the young master took a liking to them, they'd be set for life.

The sight left more than a few husbands fuming.

Naturally, Qin Jiang paid no attention to the ordinary ones. Every woman of his, fortune heroine or not, was one in a hundred million.

He stopped beside the bride. The elderly attendant hastily lowered her head, hunching even further.

Qin Jiang reached for the edge of the red veil. Just as he was about to lift it, the bride spoke. "The veil is supposed to be lifted on the wedding night."

"You want to share a wedding night with me?"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. Clearly, this bride hadn't married Huo Lie willingly.

Without another word, she extended her hand and placed it on his arm. The implication was unmistakable.

Qin Jiang smiled, took her hand, and swept his gaze across the crowd. "Ladies and gentlemen, the wedding continues! Eat, drink, and be merry—it's all on the Fire Tribe!"

Everyone's faces twitched. Bad enough to steal the man's bride—now he was using the groom's own venue? And presumably the bridal chamber as well.

Truly, salt in the wound.

He turned to the musicians. "What are you standing around for? Play! Drum! Make it lively! This is a wedding—I want smiles, everyone! Anyone who isn't smiling answers to me!"

The drums and gongs thundered to life. Faces twisted into forced grins, each person trying their best to look delighted.

The atmosphere recovered, after a fashion. But it was all performance.

The festivities resumed, minus every ceremony Qin Jiang couldn't be bothered with. He skipped straight to the finale.

"To the bridal chamber!" the Fire Tribe's master of ceremonies had no choice but to announce.

Qin Jiang led the bride through the crowd, beaming. "So, uh... where's the bridal chamber?"

The master of ceremonies winced, glanced toward the silent clan leader, and asked carefully, "Would Young Master Qin like to use... the chamber the clan leader prepared?"

"Is there another one?"

The man gave a pained laugh and led them to the chamber.

As Qin Jiang disappeared from view, Huo Lie's expression finally darkened, his features twisting with barely suppressed rage.

This was humiliation beyond measure. Stealing his bride was one thing. Using his decorations, his venue, his wedding to do it was another. And now, the bridal chamber he'd built with his own hands...

His fists clenched so hard his knuckles cracked, his face contorting.

Every guest looked at him with pity. If they'd been in his shoes, they might have considered ending it all right there.

And after today, this story would spread across the entire continent. Huo Lie would become the laughingstock of the age.
