One day later.

They finally arrived at the Qin family compound.

Qin Jiang settled Ye Ling'er and the others into his residence, then—hearing that both his parents had emerged from seclusion—went to pay them a visit.

Their residence wasn't far.

He'd barely reached the door when he heard his father's voice:

"Lian'er, you've gone too far! I blame your brother's bad influence!"

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes and pushed open the door:

"Hey, hey, hey—Dad, since when do you badmouth people behind their backs?"

Inside the courtyard, his father and mother were both present. Little Lian'er stood to the side looking pitiful—clearly she'd gotten in trouble and was being scolded.

"Big brother!"

Her face lit up the moment she saw Qin Jiang. She was about to scamper over when her father let out a sharp "hmph," freezing her in place. She looked at Qin Jiang with puppy-dog eyes.

"My big boy's home! Come here, let Mama get a good look at you."

Qin Hao said nothing, but their mother beamed. Qin Jiang grinned and trotted over, bending slightly:

"Mom!"

She pinched his cheek:

"My handsome boy."

"Heh heh..."

"And so muscular. Must have all the girls swooning."

To her, Qin Jiang could do no wrong.

Qin Hao sighed from the side:

"Xueyi, you've spoiled these two rotten."

"Hm?"

Li Xueyi's eyes narrowed, and her gaze turned dangerous.

Qin Jiang's eyes flared:

"Dad, 'the child's failings are the father's fault.' Even if your son messed up, that's on you. How can you blame Mom?

Besides, Lian'er and I are perfect angels. How dare you say we've been spoiled?"

"Exactly!"

Qin Lian'er nodded vigorously.

Qin Hao's face darkened. He pointed at Qin Jiang, incredulous:

"You dare call yourself a perfect angel?"

"Obviously!"

"Ha! The Fourth Ancestor told me everything. While you were away, you've been eating, drinking, gambling, and whoring without an ounce of ambition. And worse...

I hear you've been stealing women left and right!"

By the end, genuine anger had crept into his voice.

Qin Jiang blinked. 'The Fourth Ancestor snitched on me?'

'That petty old man. All I did was bet his head once.'

"And your sister's picked up your bad habits!"

Qin Hao added.

Qin Jiang glanced at Qin Lian'er. She stuck out her tongue:

"Big brother, I snatched a girl for you the other day."

Qin Jiang: "???"

"You two have completely disgraced the Qin family name!"

Qin Hao slammed his palm on the table, genuinely furious.

That's when their silent mother spoke up, shooting him a glare:

"Qin Hao, what a temper!"

"Xueyi, I..."

"Hmph. Are you using the children as an excuse to express your dissatisfaction with me?"

Li Xueyi's gaze turned lethal.

Qin Jiang and Qin Lian'er shared a knowing look and wisely kept quiet. They'd heard the stories about their parents' courtship.

Apparently, Li Xueyi had thought Qin Hao was handsome, knocked him unconscious from behind, and carried him off...

Honestly, Qin Jiang had nothing but respect for his mother.

Her background was nothing special—a minor family, and she'd been born with ordinary talent, a plain mortal body. Yet somehow, she'd forged a reputation as the foremost genius of her generation.

A mortal body, creating her own cultivation method!

According to the records, when she'd created that method, purple qi had stretched thirty thousand miles across the sky, and even the Heavenly Dao itself had celebrated, shocking countless great powers.

Some had even proclaimed that on the day her method reached completion, she would ascend to Great Emperor.

Ancient clan after ancient clan had courted her—all in vain. She'd dismissed every offer, until she met Qin Hao.

Love at first sight.

So she knocked him out and carried him off.

When the Qin family got the news, far from mounting a rescue, they'd immediately begun preparing the wedding gifts.

After all, Li Xueyi was a once-in-an-era prodigy with Great Emperor potential.

That she'd taken a liking to Qin Hao? That was his good fortune.

And so Qin Hao and Li Xueyi had been together ever since.

Though Qin Hao had eventually fallen head-over-heels in love with her, the memory of being knocked unconscious and hauled away remained a wound that never quite healed.

It was simply too humiliating.

Which was precisely why hearing that both his children had inherited his wife's penchant for abducting people had... hit a nerve. It wasn't that he resented Li Xueyi, but the subject definitely touched a sore spot.

Meanwhile, Li Xueyi pressed the issue, and Qin Hao could only pacify her in a gentle voice.

Qin Jiang and Qin Lian'er huddled together, whispering:

"Big brother, Dad's being ridiculous. Mom chose him—that's his good luck. And he still complains."

"Sigh. Some people just don't appreciate what comes easily. Dad's exactly that type."

"Right? I hope Mom gives him a good lesson."

"Agreed. If we don't, he'll be taking a concubine next."

"I've had the same feeling."

Their "whispers" might as well have been shouted, given the cultivation levels in the room.

Li Xueyi's eyes turned icy:

"You want a concubine?"

"I do not! Don't listen to those two troublemakers!"

"Hm? My children are perfect angels. You dare call them troublemakers?"

"I..."

Qin Hao's face was a portrait of wronged misery.

His poor, pitiful household standing!

After considerable chaos, Qin Hao finally managed to calm Li Xueyi—thanks in no small part to Qin Jiang and Qin Lian'er ceasing their whisper campaign.

Otherwise, no amount of smooth-talking would've worked.

Qin Hao eyed the siblings. The topic of woman-snatching was now firmly off-limits.

But there was still...

"Let's set aside the earlier business. However, this matter of eating, drinking, gambling, and whoring..."

He fixed Qin Jiang with a stern, authoritative gaze.

Qin Jiang nodded:

"Yep, that happened."

"And you admit it?"

Qin Hao's eyebrow twitched. He reached for his belt, ready to make a point, but recalling Li Xueyi's protective streak, he stopped.

Qin Jiang stood his ground, righteous indignation blazing:

"What's there not to admit?

I'm the Young Lord of the Qin family. With this great a legacy, isn't enjoying life what I'm supposed to do?

Our ancestors worked so hard to make the Qin family powerful. Wasn't it all so their descendants could live well?

I'm fulfilling our ancestors' dying wishes!

Dad, I've been sacrificing myself for filial piety, and instead of praising me, you scold me? And besides...

I can tell your mind's gone somewhere filthy, tarnishing my noble act of devotion!"
