In the end, Zi Fu didn't follow Qin Jiang into the Space-Time Temple, and he didn't press the matter. He was in sage mode at the moment. Sparing Zi Fu, he rested in the Void Divine Temple for a while before stepping out.

Under the ancestors' stewardship, Qin Family City had grown increasingly prosperous, taking on the bearing of a true powerhouse. The moment Qin Jiang appeared, the ancestors swarmed him, sizing him up.

"Kid, have you been slacking off while you were gone? How are you only at the Fifth Tribulation Supreme?"

The entire ancestral council was displeased with his cultivation level. Sure, his progress was fast compared to normal people—but was Qin Jiang a normal person? Absolutely not. In their minds, Qin Jiang jumping straight to Great Emperor would've been the expected outcome.

"Fifth Tribulation Supreme isn't good enough?" he protested. He'd only been gone a few months, and he'd barely broken through to Supreme when he left. Reaching Fifth Tribulation already took serious effort.

No matter what he said, the ancestors weren't having it. Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. He raised a hand to silence their complaints and swept his gaze across the group, aura fully unleashed.

"How long have you been away from the Qin estate? Years! When we left home, you were all Great Emperors. Now that we're in Azure Cloud Heaven, you're still Great Emperors! Not an ounce of progress. In all this time, have you ever stopped to ask yourselves why? Have you been putting in the work, or have you been slacking off?"

The ancestors stared at each other, mouths open, speechless.

Qin Jiang huffed, dusting off his hands. That's what you get for coming at me. Ancestors or not, I'll leave you with nothing to say.

His face was smug satisfaction, but the ancestors' expressions were growing dangerous. This brat—disrespecting his elders! A young man bullying a bunch of old men!

Facing their sharpening glares, Qin Jiang was utterly unfazed. "I'm going to build you a Space-Time Temple."

"A Space-Time Temple?"

"Accelerated time flow. Estimated effect: one month of training inside equals one day outside." A ratio of thirty to one. At his current ability, achieving that ratio was entirely within reach—though it naturally couldn't compare to the original version inside the Void Divine Temple.

The ancestors' blade-sharp gazes instantly transformed into burning enthusiasm.

"Ha ha ha! Young Jiang truly is the Qin family's prodigy—so capable!"

"Indeed, indeed! With Young Jiang around, our Qin family shall prosper for ten thousand generations! Ahem—so, Young Jiang, when do you plan to build this Space-Time Temple?"

"Jiang'er, just tell us what you need—we'll support you one hundred percent!"

Qin Jiang curled his lip at their shameless about-face. Under his direction, the ancestors rolled up their sleeves and got to work. Unlike inside the Void Divine Temple, where a thought could create a temple, building one outside required manual labor. Great Emperors, however, made excellent construction crews—within a day, a magnificent palace stood on the Qin estate grounds.

Qin Jiang laid down formations around the exterior while the ancestors reinforced the structure's durability. It couldn't be too fragile—one accidental bump might bring the whole thing crashing down. After three days of work, the outer shell was complete. Qin Jiang entered and spent a full two weeks inscribing space-time law imprints deep into the temple's foundations. When he emerged, the knockoff Space-Time Temple was operational. The law imprints would last about three years before needing maintenance, and through gradual reinforcement over time, the temple would eventually become the genuine article.

"All done. Give it a try," he told the ancestors. Despite being a knockoff, the results satisfied him—at only the Supreme Realm, pulling off a project of this scale was no small feat. The ancestors tested it and expressed unanimous approval. With this temple, their cultivation could finally progress faster, and they'd no longer have to endure Qin Jiang's needling.

Back in the Void Divine Temple, things were noticeably quieter than usual. The women were all working hard, spending most of their time training in the Space-Time Temple. They all understood that falling behind meant being unable to keep up with Qin Jiang. Without the usual fluttering crowd, Qin Jiang felt oddly out of place.

"Everyone's so dedicated... that's not exactly ideal either," he muttered. Was he really going to be sleeping alone? That would've been unthinkable before.

Just as he was lamenting his fate, a figure appeared in his line of sight, walking toward him. It was Zi Fu. She hadn't been training—her cultivation was already at the peak of the Ancient Emperor level, and further cultivation without a breakthrough opportunity would take centuries of seclusion. Even inside the Space-Time Temple, that was a long stretch. So she'd been idle, frequently observing Qin Jiang and occasionally quizzing the women about him when they emerged. What had started as curiosity had gradually turned into genuine exploration...

Especially since everything she learned came through the women's eyes. Suddenly, this man didn't seem half bad.

She walked up to him with a smile. "Looks like someone's sleeping alone tonight."

"Sleeping alone?" He chuckled and grabbed her hand, pulling her toward the Space-Time Temple.

"Hey! What are you doing?" she yelped, but she matched his pace step for step. With her cultivation, if she truly didn't want to move, Qin Jiang couldn't have budged her.

Inside the Space-Time Temple, he led her straight to his mansion. He pushed open the door and raised an eyebrow. "See? This is your so-called 'sleeping alone.'"

Zi Fu stared at the scene inside—women lounging, chatting, and playing around—and was struck speechless. What happened to diligent training? They'd all claimed they needed to focus on cultivation and rushed into the Space-Time Temple... but they'd actually rushed to Qin Jiang's house. Zi Fu had genuinely believed they were working hard. Turns out they were just securing their spots early.

She'd been way too naive.

Among the crowd, she even spotted Lian'er—her supposed best friend, who'd also come running over. Though as Qin Jiang's sister, what was she doing adding to the chaos?

The women noticed Qin Jiang's arrival and instantly mobbed him. In the stampede, Zi Fu was shoved aside, left standing there in complete disarray.
