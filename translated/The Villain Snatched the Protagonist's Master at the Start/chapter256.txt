Inside the traveling palace, Qin Jiang spent 20,000 Villain Points to purchase the next year's plotlines for both Chen Changsheng and Chen Qi'er. Seeing that Chen Changsheng had survived, he relaxed. As for Chen Qi'er, the plotline revealed something interesting—the man had a sister right here in the Human Dao Sect. A Human Immortal, no less, and one of the sect's senior leaders. Qin Jiang's interest was piqued.

"But, System, one year of plotline is a bit short. Chen Changsheng's entire year is just closed-door cultivation!"

As the Children of Destiny he tracked grew stronger, a single year became increasingly meaningless at their level—practically a nap. Some would casually go into seclusion for decades. Spending tens of thousands of Villain Points to watch a Child of Destiny sit in meditation was a terrible deal.

【Ding. User need detected. System upgrade available. Cost: one million Villain Points. Future spoilers will cover one hundred years per query at the same price. Upgrade?】

"A hundred years?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. Decent enough. Once he grew stronger, the system would probably offer further upgrades. "Upgrade."

【Ding. Upgrade successful.】

"That fast?" He blinked. No loading time, no dramatic sequence? Just... deducted and done? The million Villain Points had zero fanfare.

【Upgrade complete. Bonus gift package included. Please check your inventory.】

"Gift package?" A smile spread across his face. Now that was more like it.

"Open the gift package."

【Ding. Gift package opened successfully. Congratulations—you have received: Immortal King Killing Formation Plate (permanent, rechargeable, capable of slaying Immortal Kings).】

Qin Jiang's breath caught.

This wasn't a "gift package." This was an earthshaking jackpot! A formation plate that could kill Immortal Kings—permanent and rechargeable! It outclassed even the Immortal King Seal. With this, all of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands were his playground. He didn't even need to conserve the Immortal King Seal anymore. He could blow it on a few Immortals just for fun and extract some laws to impress the ladies.

"System, if you were a woman, I'd kiss you!"

The system maintained a dignified silence. After a long pause, it responded:

【First charge complete. Ready for immediate use. Future activations require manual charging by the user.】

A small formation plate materialized in the system space, no bigger than his palm. Despite its size, the inscriptions etched across its surface contained an Immortal King-level killing formation—power enough to slay an Immortal King.

Qin Jiang retrieved the plate and examined the formation script. His head spun almost immediately. At his current level, studying Immortal King-grade formations was aiming far too high.

"How do I charge this thing?"

【Inject energy. Note: an Immortal King-level killing formation requires enormous energy. The user may employ the Taotie Divine Body to simultaneously absorb and channel energy.】

Even draining himself dry wouldn't fill this thing. He'd have to absorb ambient energy with one hand and funnel it into the plate with the other. Cumbersome, but a weapon that could kill Immortal Kings was worth any inconvenience.

He toyed with it for a while, then tucked it away. Ning Xue'er appeared at his side, threading her arm through his. "When are we heading back to the palace?"

They'd spent a few days wandering the Human Dao Sect grounds. The place was truly destitute—not much to see or do. Qin Jiang considered for a moment. "A few more days."

"You have something else to do?"

He twirled a strand of Ning Xue'er's hair between his fingers. "Do you know Baizhe Immortal?"

"The Human Dao Sect's Baizhe Immortal?" Ning Xue'er looked up. "You're interested in her?"

"Somewhat."

She understood his nature. If he mentioned someone, he was interested. Otherwise, he wouldn't spare them a glance. She wasn't surprised, but shook her head. "It won't be easy."

"Oh?"

"There are very few women in the Human Dao Sect, and someone like Baizhe Immortal is rarer still. Over the years, plenty of people have tried to court her. She's rejected every single one—wouldn't even entertain the idea. The story goes that when she was young, she had a brother who took care of her. His talent was poor, and he's probably long dead by now. But she never let go."

Ning Xue'er met his eyes. "She has her own moonlight. Winning her over would be extremely difficult."

"Definitely not simple," Qin Jiang agreed. The real problem was that the brother in question was still very much alive—Chen Qi'er, who had probably already reached the Human Dao Sect. He needed to make his move before the man showed up. Otherwise, it would come down to brute force.

"But a little challenge makes it more interesting."

Ning Xue'er rolled her eyes and pouted. "So what you're saying is, women like me and Qing Chan who threw ourselves at you are boring?"

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. "Qing Chan threw herself at me? That was home invasion. I didn't say a single word—she just kidnapped me."

His aggrieved tone made Ning Xue'er laugh. She'd heard the story from Jian Yao and the others—the great Qin Jiang, who'd once snatched women left and right, had finally gotten a taste of his own medicine. Abducted by Qing Chan. It was practically his most embarrassing moment.

"Still laughing? Keep it up and I'll have Qing Chan seal you again!"

Ning Xue'er's grin didn't waver. "Go ahead. With Qing Chan around, nothing requires me to lift a finger anyway. All I need to do is pin you down."

"Tempting me?"

She released his arm, rose on her toes, and draped both arms around his neck. "Qin Jiang, I'm a little hungry. Could you cook something for me? Please?"

He took a deep breath, swept her into a bridal carry, and strode away. "Let's go. I'll cook."

"Should we wash the ingredients first?"

"You can help with that."

"Okay~"

In Ning Xue'er's mind, Qin Jiang was a divine chef. She would eat nothing that didn't come from his hands. Anything else gave her indigestion.
