The Ghost Immortal's death forced a postponement of the Grand Refinement.

The fall of an immortal sent shockwaves across all of Azure Cloud Heaven. And for the first time, Qin Jiang's name resounded through the entire realm.

Countless powerhouses flocked to Pill City, ostensibly to watch the Grand Refinement but really to get a look at Qin Jiang. Who knew? Maybe they could form a connection.

Intelligence networks were fast. Within days, every major faction had learned one crucial detail about Qin Jiang: he loved beautiful women.

Consequently, every delegation that arrived brought a retinue of stunning young women. Pill City's scenery improved dramatically overnight.

But Qin Jiang was hardly lacking in that department. Liu Shuwan, the Pill Emperor, Jian Yao, Mo Mo—every woman at his side was a peerless beauty. The offerings from these factions couldn't compare.

The night before the Grand Refinement was set to resume.

Lian'er found Qin Jiang and, with conspiratorial excitement, pulled him into her room. Seeing that spark in her eyes, Qin Jiang had a fair idea of what was coming.

'She's making another move.'

Bold of her—she wasn't even bothering to leave the Palace this time.

"Bro, look into my eyes..."

"Hm?"

Qin Jiang obliged, meeting her gaze with a look of innocent curiosity. The Immortal Fire materialized beside her, rotating slowly and emitting a faint, mesmerizing pulse.

Lian'er's eyes shimmered with an otherworldly, hypnotic light. A bewitching aura descended over Qin Jiang.

He blinked, then smiled. "Lian'er, are you... wearing colored contacts?"

Lian'er: "..."

This was Plan B—hypnosis, a secret technique the Immortal Fire had taught her.

Clearly, it had zero effect on Qin Jiang.

Her face crumpled. She pouted, shoulders slumping in defeat. 'Stupid brother. Why does he have to be so annoyingly powerful?'

Not a single opening. Not one.

Her second attempt had failed spectacularly.

But Qin Lian'er was not a quitter. She clenched her tiny fists and stared at Qin Jiang. Handsome, powerful, perfect—and she was supposed to just let other women have all of him?

No way.

She would succeed. She had to.

The next day.

The Grand Refinement resumed, but with ninety-nine competitors instead of a hundred.

Chen Changsheng had been stripped of his qualification.

During the Ghost Immortal incident, he'd openly sided against the Heavenly Pill Palace by attempting to save the old man's grandson. That was a direct slap in the Palace's face.

After deliberation, the elders revoked his entry.

No one protested. The Palace had just killed an immortal—its prestige had never been higher. Only a fool would speak up for Chen Changsheng now.

As the competition resumed, Qin Jiang and the Pill Emperor took their seats on the platform once more. This time, the Pill Emperor made no effort to hide their closeness, letting Qin Jiang hold her hand for all to see.

She looked like a girl in love.

The elders pretended not to notice. The visiting dignitaries had their attention fixed squarely on Qin Jiang—most of them had gorgeous young women in tow, each faction hoping to catch the young lord's eye.

They took one look at the Pill Emperor beside him, then at their own offerings, and... grimaced.

The gap was rather significant.

Not that it stopped the women from trying. Their gazes devoured Qin Jiang with unconcealed hunger. A handsome young lord with godlike strength and an earth-shattering background? Landing him would be the ultimate rags-to-riches story.
