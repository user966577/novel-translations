In Dream Cloud City, Tianji was still running his fortune-telling stand.

He couldn't leave anyway, and his fiancee had been stolen. On top of that, his life was in danger. So he'd given up—every day above ground was a bonus. If death came, so be it. Such was the natural way of things. Die if you must!

Not that he actually wanted to die, but it wasn't exactly his call.

What really irked him, though, was the complete absence of customers. Ever since Qin Jiang's last visit, not a single person had come for a reading. He sat at his stall day after day, waiting for clients who never arrived. The few disciples from major factions he'd befriended had been released from the city some time ago. Now, no one in Dream Cloud City dared associate with him.

A few days prior, the Immortal Emperor's secret realm had appeared, and Tianji had watched enviously from within the city. Too bad he couldn't get out.

He was sitting there, wallowing in his misfortune, when a figure appeared before him. His face brightened—a customer!—and he looked up eagerly.

Then his expression froze. He stared at Qin Jiang and managed a dry laugh. "Ah, you're back."

"Indeed." Qin Jiang smiled and sat down across from Tianji. "I'm here to read your fortune again."

Tianji was speechless. He was a fortune-teller, yet no one came to him for readings—instead, someone kept insisting on reading his fortune. What kind of cosmic joke was this?

But he had no choice. He sighed and nodded. "Go ahead."

"Good." Qin Jiang smiled, studying Tianji closely. "Today, I'm reading your fate."

Tianji's heart clenched. Last time, Qin Jiang had made him divine his own remaining lifespan. This time, Qin Jiang was doing it himself. Was this the moment of decision—life or death, settled today?

He swallowed hard, took a deep breath, and said, "Please, go ahead."

"My method is quite simple, actually." Qin Jiang smiled faintly and produced a True Spirit Slave Seal—an Immortal King-grade one at that. "Make your choice."

"What do you mean?"

"Accept it, or don't."

Qin Jiang fixed Tianji with his gaze. Looking at the seal, Tianji immediately understood—this was about control. His eyes flickered. "And if I refuse?"

"If you refuse?" Qin Jiang arched an eyebrow and smiled. "Then you die."

This man was too unpredictable for comfort. If Qin Jiang couldn't control him, he'd rather just kill him. Children of Destiny weren't exactly in short supply.

As Qin Jiang's words fell, figures materialized around them—ten Immortal Kings, every last one of the Merfolk tribe's protectors, forming a complete encirclement.

Tianji stared at the assembled might. Was this really necessary? He was just a True Immortal. One Immortal King would have been more than enough. Ten was overkill of the highest order.

His gaze lingered on the True Spirit Slave Seal. He hesitated, warring with himself, and finally let out a resigned sigh. His hand closed around the seal.

In the next instant, the seal flashed and burrowed into his body. Searing pain washed over him. Tianji clenched his jaw, trembling all over, cold sweat streaming down his forehead—but he didn't make a sound. Children of Destiny had their pride, after all.

After a long moment, the seal's power merged with his Primordial Spirit. Tianji exhaled a turbid breath and looked at Qin Jiang, his expression complicated. "Tianji greets his master."

He could feel it—the moment his fate had shifted. What had been a fog-shrouded future was now pitch-black. And it was this man who'd brought the darkness. Black as could be—purple-black, even. No wonder he'd been suppressed so thoroughly. This dragon was a wicked one, evil to the extreme.

"Very good." Qin Jiang nodded, satisfied.

He tested the connection. The True Spirit Slave Seal held perfectly—nothing less from a system-produced item. Simultaneously, the system's rewards arrived. Though Tianji hadn't been killed, complete subjugation counted the same. His fortune had been plundered, effectively stripping him of his Child of Destiny status.

His abilities, however, remained undiminished. Like Ye Xuan, who'd lost her Child of Destiny status after a devastating blow but retained her exceptional talent, Tianji would be the same. Properly cultivated, he'd become an invaluable asset.

Under Qin Jiang's gaze, Tianji hesitated before asking, "Master, may I ask... who are you?"

"Can't you divine it?"

"To be honest, I tried reading you before we met. I was hit with backlash." Tianji smiled bitterly. Surface-level techniques—aura reading, physiognomy, palmistry—worked fine. But anything deeper was completely impenetrable. In the Celestial Secrets tradition, the rule was simple: beings you can't read, you either befriend or avoid. Unfortunately, Tianji hadn't had the luxury of either option.

"Hmph! You dared try to divine the master? Of course you got backlash!" One of the Immortal Kings couldn't resist chiming in. "Our master is the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law—do you have any idea how exalted that is? As if someone like you could casually peer into his secrets!"

Tianji's eyes went wide. "The Grand Sovereign's son-in-law?"

"That's right—our master!"

The Immortal Kings practically preened with pride. Qin Jiang, meanwhile, felt a twinge of guilt—he was afraid the Grand Sovereign might find out. But looking at this group he'd thoroughly hoodwinked, he could only nod along, arranging his features into an expression of casual nonchalance. "Just a minor title. Not worth mentioning."

The Grand Sovereign's son-in-law, and it wasn't worth mentioning?

Tianji didn't doubt it. There'd be no reason to lie at this point, and surely all these Immortal Kings couldn't have been fooled. So that's why his divination had failed and backlashed—it was connected to the Grand Sovereign. Nobody in the myriad realms dared try to divine the Grand Sovereign. That was suicide.

Come to think of it, he was lucky he'd stopped immediately after the backlash instead of pushing further. Otherwise, it might have killed him.

Meanwhile, in the Chaos, within a serene pocket of space, a breathtakingly beautiful woman sat cross-legged atop Immortal Marrow, deep in secluded cultivation.

Suddenly, her brow furrowed. She slowly opened her eyes and murmured to herself, "What's going on? Someone's been thinking about me constantly."

She extended a jade-white hand and began to calculate. At her level of power, she didn't need to practice the Celestial Secrets tradition—sheer strength alone was enough to peer into heaven's secrets.

Moments later, her hand froze. Surprise flickered across her exquisite face as she whispered, "Someone's impersonating my husband?"
