With the woman's cooperation, Qin Jiang channeled the Seven Beauties Painting's power, first drawing in a thread of her energy. The painting flashed briefly.

The woman stared in amazement. In that instant, her steadily dissipating life force had inexplicably stabilized.

"How does it feel?" Qin Jiang asked.

"I think... it's actually working." Excitement danced in her eyes. She genuinely felt like revival was possible.

Qin Jiang gripped the painting, his expression grave. "I'm going to pull you fully inside. Don't resist—only complete absorption counts as true success."

"Alright. Do it."

He unfurled the Seven Beauties Painting and poured power into it. The scroll expanded, wrapping around the woman as a pulling force tugged at her consciousness. She didn't resist, letting the painting draw her in—but resistance surged from within the painting itself, weakening the pull.

Qin Jiang frowned and forced control over the artifact. Slowly, her remnant consciousness began merging with the painting, but the Seven Beauties Painting fought back harder with each passing moment.

"Behave," he snapped. "Forgotten who your master is?"

The painting trembled—almost petulantly—but relented, continuing to absorb the woman, albeit at a reduced pace.

"My consciousness is recovering!" the woman exclaimed. Even before full absorption, the painting's energy was already restoring her.

Qin Jiang exhaled with relief. "It's going to work. But the painting is resisting you—don't let your guard down."

She nodded, and with Qin Jiang's coordination, she pushed harder to merge with the painting. It took a full four hours.

The painting flashed one final time, and the woman's figure vanished completely. Her last words lingered: "See you soon, my little husband."

The Seven Beauties Painting settled back into Qin Jiang's hands, visibly dimmer than before. He unfurled it and confirmed a new figure had appeared—though blurry and indistinct.

"Why is she so fuzzy?"

Yan Shiya's image, by comparison, was almost lifelike. He summoned her out.

"Master, who did you put in there?" Yan Shiya asked the moment she materialized.

Qin Jiang glanced at the blurred figure. "What happened? Is something wrong inside?"

"Very wrong." Yan Shiya's expression was serious. "Most of the painting's energy is being funneled in one direction. I estimate it'll consume about seventy percent of the painting's total power."

"Seventy percent..." Qin Jiang rubbed his chin. Seventy percent of the Seven Beauties Painting's power for a Great Emperor—and a Sword Heart-level Great Emperor at that. Good trade. "That's acceptable."

"Acceptable?!" Yan Shiya pouted. "After this, any future additions to the painting can only be elevated to Nine Tribulations Supreme at best."

"Are you affected?" Qin Jiang asked.

She shook her head. She'd fully merged with the painting by now. Though most of its energy was being redirected, she still received a generous share.

"As long as you're fine." He unfurled the painting again and pointed to the hazy silhouette. "Shiya, look—this one's a Great Emperor. Seventy percent is a bargain."

Yan Shiya peered at the figure. "A Great Emperor? Why is she so blurry?"

Qin Jiang spread his hands and coughed. "Probably because she hasn't fully recovered yet."

Yan Shiya studied him skeptically. "The painting shouldn't consume energy when absorbing a willing Great Emperor—it should actually be replenished. Something about this one is off."

"There's a minor issue," Qin Jiang admitted with a sheepish grin. Yan Shiya knew the painting better than he did, so he came clean. "She's only a wisp of remnant consciousness. But she was a Great Emperor in life—too valuable to let fade. So I thought I'd try."

The silhouette inside the painting seemed marginally clearer now. "Looks like it worked?"

Yan Shiya rolled her eyes. 'You couldn't bear to let a Great Emperor vanish? More like you couldn't bear to let a pretty face vanish.' After all, the painting's most rigid requirement was beauty.

"Master, let me go back in and check," she offered.

Qin Jiang nodded, and she vanished into the painting. About fifteen minutes later, she re-emerged.

"It worked," she confirmed. "Most of the painting's power is going toward her revival, but she still needs time."

Qin Jiang breathed a sigh of relief. His gamble had paid off.

Then Yan Shiya wrapped her arms around him, gazing up at him with those beguiling eyes. He pulled her close by the waist. "What? Jealous?"

"No." She shook her head, a hint of vulnerability showing. "With this new sister... will Master have no use for me anymore? She's so pretty, and her figure is better than mine..."

During her visit, she'd seen the woman—powerful, beautiful, and curvier than herself. Yan Shiya's confidence had taken a hit.

Qin Jiang pinched her cheek affectionately. "Don't overthink it. Each of you is irreplaceable. I'd never let any of you go. And besides—you have an advantage she doesn't."

His grin turned mischievous.

Yan Shiya blinked. "What advantage?"

"You forget—you have a lovely little niece."

Yan Shiya's face erupted in crimson, and she shot him a coquettish glare. "You're terrible!"

Qin Jiang chuckled, a heated gleam entering his eyes as he held her. "Shiya, I'm in need of your services."

"Mm..."
