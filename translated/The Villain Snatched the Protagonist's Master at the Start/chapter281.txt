"Young sir..." she began shyly.

But Qin Jiang didn't look away. He stared openly, his apology carrying not an ounce of sincerity. "Forgive me. When I see someone this beautiful, I can't help but take a second look."

Her lips curled upward. He'd called her beautiful.

"If you want to look," she whispered, "you can look as much as you like."

The moment the words left her mouth, her face burned scarlet. What on earth had possessed her to say that?

Qin Jiang smiled. He took her hand, guided her into a chair, and produced a towel. "Changed clothes but didn't bother drying off."

Water still clung to her pale legs and delicate feet. He crouched down and lifted one of her feet.

Her legs parted slightly, her hands tightening. She watched him, eyes trembling.

'From that angle,' she thought, 'he can definitely see...'

Her face was crimson, but she didn't stop him. If anything, she shifted subtly to give him a better view.

He was thorough—meticulous, even. But when he finished, he found the exercise had been somewhat pointless.

He paused, then stood. Her eyes had never left his face. "Did you like what you saw?"

"Very much," he said with a nod, then added: "Though a beast like that needs a man with a strong constitution. Otherwise, it might devour its husband."

"Then... does Young Master Qin have a strong constitution?"

She gripped the hem of the shirt, her knuckles white with nerves.

He settled into the chair beside her, leaning back as he studied her. "Strong enough that your particular beast poses no threat."

A smile lit up her face. Was he hinting at something?

Of course, she'd forgotten she'd been hinting at him first.

Their eyes met. She looked away first. Qin Jiang chuckled. "You know, you still haven't told me your name."

"My name..." She hesitated. For as long as she could remember, she'd been known only as the Celestial Formation Fairy. Her real name had been forgotten by the world. She'd never wanted to share it with anyone. No one deserved to use it.

But now, looking at Qin Jiang, she opened her lips. "My name is An Xihe."

"An Xihe..." He repeated it, and something complex flickered in her eyes. No one had spoken that name in a very long time.

"Then I'll call you Xihe," he said, smiling.

She nodded gently, her voice warm. "Alright."

They talked for a while in the cabin before leaving the river. At this hour, there weren't many people about. As they walked, Qin Jiang draped a coat over her shoulders. "You're not wearing enough."

"I'm a Saint. I don't feel cold."

"You'll flash someone."

An Xihe stopped mid-step, suddenly remembering she was wearing nothing but his shirt. She blushed and pulled the coat tight. Showing Qin Jiang was one thing, but if anyone else dared look, she'd gouge their eyes out.

They strolled together, chatting idly, until the night grew deep. Qin Jiang stopped and looked at her. "Xihe, I should head back."

"Already? So soon?"

She didn't want the evening to end. She loved being with him.

He smiled. "Someone's waiting for me." He raised the Message Stone in his hand and leaped upward. "If you want to find me, send a message."

In a blink, he was back at the traveling palace.

An Xihe pouted. The good mood she'd built up all evening evaporated. Someone was waiting for him. It had to be Qing Chan and the others. They got to be with him every day, while she could barely steal a few hours.

Should she just come clean? Drop the act?

But her goal was to tame Qin Jiang, and so far... the results were underwhelming. He hadn't seemed the least bit reluctant to leave.

She was still brooding when her subordinates materialized around her. "Congratulations, my lady. Your relationship with Qin Jiang has progressed another step."

She looked at them with a frown. "It doesn't feel like progress. He showed no attachment at all—just got up and left."

Her people exchanged knowing glances. Of course they understood why, but they couldn't say so.

"My lady, these things take time. You can't rush them."

Others quickly agreed. Then one added, "And if you want Young Master Qin to show some... reluctance to leave, you may need to invest a bit more."

"Invest more?"

An Xihe's face reddened. She had invested. She'd let him see... quite a lot. Wasn't that enough?

"I already did," she said with some indignation, "and he still didn't care."

'Already did?' Her subordinates' eyes went wide. They hadn't dared spy during the private moments. Had their mistress actually... gone all in?

Surely not. They hadn't been alone long enough for that.

"Young Master Qin is surrounded by beautiful women. A modest investment may not be enough to move him."

She frowned, thinking of the women around him. They were stunning, every one—and aside from cultivation, not obviously inferior to her. No wonder her efforts hadn't been enough.

She'd need to do more. But what? Let him... touch?

Her face flamed. She shook her head, banishing the thought. That was too much. She'd save that for later.

"A kiss should work," she murmured. She touched her lips. Giving him her first kiss should at least make him feel something, right?

Face still flushed, she picked up her Message Stone: "Can you come out tomorrow?"

She waited, tense. After a while, the stone glowed: "Sure."

Relief washed over her, followed by a bright smile. Her subordinates, watching her expression shift from anxiety to joy, exchanged quiet nods. Their plan was nearly complete. Their mistress was about to be thoroughly tamed.

She looked up. "He said yes. Where should I take him?"

They stared blankly at each other. They didn't know the Human Dao Sect either, and none of them had ever been on a date.

After some deliberation, they offered tentatively: "A restaurant? Get a room?"
