For Chen Ningshuang, Qin Jiang's spot-check was her graduation exam. She began putting everything he'd taught her into practice, and under his guidance, went from clumsy to increasingly skilled in no time. A fast learner.

Still, Qin Jiang didn't let the spot-check go on too long. Ningshuang really was on the small side. He couldn't overdo it. So in less than two hours, she experienced her first taste of Qin Jiang's freshly made porridge. The flavor was exquisite—her whole body trembled involuntarily. Her throat bobbed as she held the porridge in her little mouth, still savoring it.

Seeing the look on her face, Qin Jiang chuckled and rubbed her head. "Shuang'er, did you like it?"

"Mm, I liked it~"

She nodded, licking her red lips, eyes blazing as she stared at him. She wasn't full yet. Her small hands wrapped around him as she whined, "Big brother, I want more~"

"Little glutton." He tapped her nose, then shook his head with a serious expression. "Shuang'er, you're still young. You can't have too much."

"But I'm not full yet~" She pouted pitifully.

That look was genuinely dangerous—a real test of his willpower. Fortunately, while his willpower was admittedly terrible, he'd seen enough in his time to steel himself. Though this little girl was tempting in her own way—still green, still fresh—and for someone as experienced as Qin Jiang, well... the damage wasn't negligible. Innocence and allure, two completely different flavors blended together in Chen Ningshuang. It was quite something.

Qin Jiang took a deep breath, suppressing the tremor in his heart. What he'd already done was beastly enough. Going any further would truly be worse than a beast. He leaned down to her eye level and pinched her cheek. "Be good, Shuang'er. Show a little restraint. When you're a bit bigger, big brother will definitely fill you up. Deal?"

"No deal." She puffed her cheeks and leaned in, pressing her lips to his, biting gently—teasing him. Her small hands looped around his neck as she clung to him. "If you won't give it to me, Shuang'er will take it herself~"

Watching her fumble through a clumsy attempt to cook on her own, Qin Jiang shook his head helplessly. This girl was really something. He wrapped an arm around her waist—he'd just have to help her cook. "Shuang'er, don't squirm around. You'll hurt yourself."

But she didn't stop, still trying to manage on her own.

"Hold still. I'll do the cooking."

Only then did she obediently stop fidgeting. Her eyes sparkled with triumph as she rested her head on his shoulder, nuzzling his cheek. "Big brother is the best~ Love you~"

"Last time," he warned, flicking her forehead lightly. "Next time you get greedy, I'm starving you for a month."

Ningshuang pouted but nodded obediently. Agree now, eat first—deal with consequences later. She didn't believe for a second that Qin Jiang would actually starve her. And even if he tried, she could do exactly what she'd done today: if he wouldn't give, she'd take. Big brother spoiled her rotten. A little pouting was all it ever took to get her way.

With that settled, she urged him on. "Big brother, hurry~ Shuang'er is so hungry~"

"Alright."

He found the burner with practiced ease, inserted the pipe, and lit the fire—all while teaching her along the way. "Shuang'er, you just started practicing, so being clumsy is normal. Learn from me, and before long you'll have it down. When that day comes, I'll let you take the lead, and I'll follow your rhythm."

She hummed drowsily. "I'll study hard~"

"Good girl."

He continued the lesson, but Ningshuang had closed her eyes, teeth gently biting her lip, small hands gripping him tight as she lay against his shoulder. Completely zoned out. Qin Jiang shook his head. She was just a kid—he shouldn't expect too much. Zoning out was fine. He turned his head and kissed her cheek.

That kiss made her open her eyes. She tilted her head up and pressed her lips firmly against his. He kissed her back. When they finally separated, her face was flushed crimson. She let out a soft whimper and buried her face in his chest.

Smiling, Qin Jiang picked up the pace. He wanted to finish as quickly as possible and fill this little glutton up. In less than two hours, the porridge was ready. He personally fed it to her little mouth, letting her eat to her heart's content.

After a while, she finally came back to her senses, eyes slightly dazed, blinking a few times before the sparkle returned. Qin Jiang held her, laughing. "Full this time, Shuang'er?"

"Mm~ Maybe a little too full, actually." She frowned slightly, feeling genuinely stuffed. She'd overdone it.

"You're still young with a small stomach," he said, smoothing her hair and kissing her forehead. "One serving was the right amount, but you insisted on seconds. Of course you're stuffed." He sat down, pulled her into his lap, and gently rubbed her belly. "Let me help. It'll digest faster."

"Mm~" She nestled against his chest, enjoying the attention. Before long, her stomach felt much better. But when she looked down, she frowned and grabbed his hand. "Big brother, you're wasting it~"

"Better wasted than overfed," he said, rolling his eyes.

She huffed. "I'm only a little stuffed..." Looking at the spilled porridge with a pained expression, she gathered it up with her small hands, then ate every last drop and licked her fingers clean. She patted her belly and grinned at the stunned Qin Jiang. "See? No waste~"

He shook his head and flicked her forehead. "That's gone cold. It doesn't taste good. From now on, when Shuang'er wants to eat, eat it fresh. I'll make it for you."

She rubbed her head, tongue running along her lips. "But I thought it was yummy~"

"Fresh is better."

"Then... can I have some now?"
