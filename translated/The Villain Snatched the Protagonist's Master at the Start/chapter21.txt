Several days passed.

Under Qin Jiang's relentless charm offensive, Ye Ling'er had given him her heart completely. As for Chen Ningbing—so long as Qin Jiang's strength warranted it, she would always be at his side. That was simply who she was.

On this particular day, Qin Jiang was cultivating. He was diligent about it, after all. Even with the system at his disposal, he'd never abandoned his training. He practiced for at least a dozen minutes every day.

Ye Ling'er sat nearby, her beautiful eyes fixed on him, chin propped on her hands, a faint smile gracing her lips.

Chen Ningbing was present too. By now, she and Ye Ling'er had long since met. Ye Ling'er's nature was gentle—when she learned Qin Jiang had other women, she didn't say much about it.

Chen Ningbing, for her part, was a realist. She understood perfectly well that Qin Jiang wasn't someone she could keep to herself.

And so the two got along surprisingly well.

After a few minutes of cultivation, Qin Jiang opened his eyes and sighed in satisfaction.

"What a harvest."

Hearing his words, Chen Ningbing rolled her eyes and frowned.

"Qin Jiang, you're practically a professional slacker. How are you still this strong?"

She'd been at his side for days now, and she'd barely seen him do anything productive.

She genuinely couldn't understand how someone with his attitude could possess such overwhelming power.

Qin Jiang's lips curled into a smirk.

"Talent!

"Nothing in this world is fair. Some things you're born with, and some things you'll never have no matter how hard you try.

"Take just now—five minutes of my cultivation equals a full month of your grinding. That's talent. Life was never meant to be fair."

Chen Ningbing opened her mouth, then slumped and shook her head. He was right. It really wasn't fair.

Ye Ling'er blinked her pretty eyes, curious.

"Is five minutes of your cultivation really equal to a month of Sister Bing's?"

Chen Ningbing's mouth twitched. 'Thanks for rubbing salt in the wound.'

Qin Jiang considered it seriously.

"If I truly focused, five minutes would probably match a full year of Bing'er's training. Maybe more..."

Chen Ningbing: "..."

She glared at him and scoffed.

"I don't believe you!"

"You don't?"

Qin Jiang gave her a half-smile, then clenched his fist slightly.

"Watch."

Spiritual qi surged, gathering rapidly around him. His aura unfurled, and Chen Ningbing felt his presence climbing higher and higher.

In just a few breaths...

He reined in his aura, and Chen Ningbing stared at him, jaw on the floor.

"You...

"Did you just break through?"

Qin Jiang nodded, perfectly nonchalant.

"Breaking through—isn't it the simplest thing in the world?"

Chen Ningbing: "..."

Even the gentle Ye Ling'er couldn't help but feel he was showing off a little.

Just then—

Black Dragon's voice came from outside the door. Qin Jiang glanced toward the entrance.

"Come in."

The door opened, revealing not only Black Dragon but Ye Kuan as well.

A flicker of surprise crossed Qin Jiang's eyes. A suspicion formed instantly.

"Something happened to the Ye family?"

Beside him, Ye Ling'er stiffened at the words, worry blossoming on her face. She'd never returned to the Ye family, but her birth parents were still there.

She also knew now that she hadn't been truly abandoned. Her parents had drawn the enemy away to save her life, and the Ye family had been searching for her all these years.

Ye Kuan gave a bitter laugh.

"The Young Lord's intuition is correct. Ye Qingtian has resurfaced, and it appears he has the backing of other ancient clans."

Ye Qingtian was the eldest son of the Ye family. After losing the contest for family head years ago, he'd gone into hiding, secretly building his strength, biding his time to seize the Ye family back.

Previously, Qin Jiang had even threatened to support Ye Qingtian as leverage against Ye Kuan.

Now, someone had actually done it.

Clearly, someone wanted the Ye family brought to heel.

"Any idea who's backing Ye Qingtian?"

Ye Kuan shook his head.

"Every ancient clan has enemies. The ones supporting Ye Qingtian are likely among our longstanding rivals.

"It wouldn't surprise me if several of them had a hand in it."

Qin Jiang nodded.

"So you're here asking for help."

Ye Kuan straightened, his expression turning earnest.

"I hope the Young Lord, for the Young Miss's sake, will lend the Ye family his aid. If we weather this crisis, we will repay the favor generously!"

Qin Jiang curled his lip.

"What could the Ye family possibly have that I'd want?"

Ye Kuan's heart sank. If Qin Jiang refused, the Ye family's foundations would be badly damaged.

"That said—I could never refuse my Ling'er."

Qin Jiang smiled and turned to Black Dragon.

"Black Dragon, head back to the Qin estate. Bring my Void Palace.

"If we're going to help, we're going to make an entrance—something that puts the fear of heaven into every petty schemer out there."

"Yes, Young Lord!"

Black Dragon answered and vanished immediately.

Ye Kuan's face lit up with joy.

"Thank you for your aid, Young Lord."

He understood Qin Jiang's meaning perfectly. Arriving in the Void Palace, parading openly to the Ye estate—that wouldn't represent Qin Jiang alone. It would represent the entire Qin family.

It was a warning to whoever stood behind Ye Qingtian.

There was a fair chance they'd withdraw on their own without a single blow being exchanged.

After all, the Qin family's power ranked among the very top of the ancient clans.

No one wanted to cross the Qin family.

Less than half a day later, Black Dragon returned with the Void Palace, arriving at Azure City Town and drawing countless gawkers.

"What an extravagant palace! Which family's young dandy has come to our little Azure City Town?"

"Shut your mouth—are you trying to get killed? See that colossal beast pulling it? That's a Void Beast. In all of Heavenly Mystery Continent, only one person uses a Void Beast to pull his palace—the Young Lord of our Qin Domain!"

"Good heavens, so this is the legendary Void Palace!"

"The Young Lord of Qin Domain—what's he doing in Azure City Town?"

"I've heard our Young Lord has the bearing of a Great Emperor. I'd love to see what a future Great Emperor looks like."

"Heh, and our Qin Domain's Young Lord is one of the finest in all of Heavenly Mystery Continent. He might actually claim the Great Emperor throne someday."

"I heard the Young Lord is devastatingly handsome. I just want one little look~"

"Me too! Maybe if the Young Lord glances my way, he'll take a liking to me."

"Ugh—get out of here with that! You're making my skin crawl."

Amid the whispered chatter, Qin Jiang rose into the air with Ye Ling'er and Chen Ningbing.

Under countless watchful gazes, he stepped onto the Void Palace and patted the Void Beast.

"Xiao Xu, take us to the Ye Domain."

ROAR!!!

The Void Beast bellowed. It was deeply unhappy with its name—but Qin Jiang refused to change it, and what could the beast do? He was the master, after all.

Once Qin Jiang entered the palace, the Void Beast surged forward, pulling the entire structure into the void. The distance was vast—half a month's flight at least.

Traveling through space was far faster.

Behind them, Azure City Town stood frozen in collective awe.

"Was the Young Lord here to pick someone up?"

"Is it possible... that man was actually our Young Lord of Qin Domain?"

"I saw him—he's the one who snatched our City Lord's daughter!"

"The City Lord's so lucky! Why didn't the Young Lord come snatch my daughter?"

"My daughter... sigh, never mind..."
