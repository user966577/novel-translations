Near the Dream Cloud Sea stood a magnificent city—Dream Cloud City. It served as a hub where the various sea tribes mingled with other races, and was the most prosperous settlement within tens of thousands of miles.

Inside the city, a young man in Daoist robes hurried along, his face pale and his brow deeply furrowed. His fingers twitched ceaselessly, calculating something as he walked.

'This doesn't make sense. Before I came to Dream Cloud City, the hexagram was overwhelmingly auspicious—a sign that this place held a great opportunity, a site where I'd transform from carp to dragon. But it's only been a few days... how has it become a harbinger of catastrophe?'

The young Daoist kept calculating, cold sweat beading on his forehead. His expression grew grimmer by the second.

He'd arrived in Dream Cloud City several days ago, waiting patiently for his opportunity to manifest. But days passed without anything materializing. That was when he'd sensed something was wrong and cast a new hexagram for himself. The result stunned him—the reading had completely reversed. The site of his transformation had become a death trap.

A dragon had appeared, but it wasn't him.

Worse, this dragon harbored intense malice toward him.

No matter how he tried to divine the dragon's identity, the answer eluded him. He'd even suffered a backlash from forcing the divination, sustaining injuries in the process. After that, he didn't dare try again.

Without a moment's hesitation, he packed his belongings and prepared to leave Dream Cloud City. Staying might cost him his life.

But when he reached the city gates, he found a crowd packed tight, shouting and arguing over something. He had no interest in getting involved. Pushing his way to the front, he finally understood.

There was no way out.

At the gates, rows of powerful sea tribe warriors swept the crowd with cold eyes and bellowed: "By the Empress's decree—from this moment, Dream Cloud City admits entry only. No one leaves. Violators will be executed!"

Most people didn't dare protest. The sea tribes' strength was formidable enough to intimidate the majority. Of course, Dream Cloud City also housed disciples from major factions. Faced with such heavy-handed lockdown measures, they were naturally unhappy—especially those who genuinely had urgent business.

"When can we leave?" someone called out. These were disciples of powerful organizations. Though displeased, they had no desire to make enemies of the sea tribes.

The sea tribe warrior replied flatly: "To be determined."

"To be determined?" The speaker's brow furrowed tightly. He let out a cold snort. "What do you mean, 'to be determined'? You people blockade us without so much as a reason. This arrogant—do you really think the sea tribes are the overlords of the Heavenly Domain?"

A chorus of agreement rippled through the crowd.

The sea tribe warrior's expression darkened. He fixed the speaker with an icy glare and unleashed a wave of pressure that crashed down upon him. The man grunted and stumbled back several steps, then shouted: "What do you think you're doing? I'm a disciple of the Imperial Mountain Sect! Touch me, and my sect will hunt you to the ends of the earth!"

The sea tribe warrior's eyes narrowed. The Imperial Mountain Sect had an Immortal Emperor at its helm—a formidable power. While the sect couldn't match the sea tribes' combined strength, picking a fight with such a faction was undesirable. Still, the Empress's decree was absolute. He couldn't defy it.

A tense silence hung in the air. The Imperial Mountain Sect disciple, seeing his hesitation, grew even bolder. "You can maintain your blockade, but we of the Imperial Mountain Sect must be free to come and go!"

Rage flickered through the sea tribe warrior's heart. Granting such a concession would be announcing to everyone that the sea tribes feared the Imperial Mountain Sect. And once that door opened, every other major faction would demand the same treatment. The blockade would be meaningless.

Taking a deep breath, he organized his thoughts and was about to offer some diplomatic words of pacification when a blast of wind shrieked from behind him, streaking past and slamming into the Imperial Mountain Sect disciple. Blood and flesh sprayed in all directions.

The crowd froze in stunned silence, then erupted in terrified screams. The sea tribe warrior's expression shifted as well. He spun around and saw a middle-aged man glaring at him with undisguised displeasure.

"You—"

"'You' what? Your Empress's orders were clear as day—violators will be executed. And here you are hemming and hawing, making a fool of your own Empress!"

He turned to the crowd and released his aura. The pressure of an Immortal King radiated outward, instantly silencing the chaos.

"The city is sealed. Get back inside. Anyone who causes trouble for me will be the next one—"

He tried to point at the Imperial Mountain Sect disciple, but he'd hit a bit too hard. The man had been reduced to paste, splattered everywhere. He wasn't entirely sure where to point. In the end, he gestured vaguely at every spot where there was residue. Unfortunately, several people in the crowd had gotten splattered too, and when he pointed in their direction, their faces went white. They dropped to their knees, wailing: "Mercy, my lord! We won't leave! We'll stay in the city! Please, spare us!"

He found himself somewhat speechless. With an impatient wave, he declared: "Fine. Everyone scram!"

The crowd scattered instantly. Even the disciples of major factions didn't dare utter a word—after all, their lives mattered more than their pride.

After dispersing the crowd, he turned back to the sea tribe warrior with a warning look. "Next time, just strike. Understood?"

"Understood."

This Immortal King was one of the Skyreach City lords—dispatched by Qin Jiang to enforce the blockade and prevent any Children of Destiny from slipping away. Satisfied with the response, the Immortal King leaped up onto the city wall.

Meanwhile, nearby, the young Daoist withdrew his gaze, brow deeply furrowed. He hadn't expected even an Immortal King to be deployed for the lockdown. The other gates probably had Immortal Kings too. The entire city was likely under surveillance.

Taking a deep breath, he glanced down at his robes. Blood had splattered on them. Moments ago, he'd been planning to slip out in the chaos, following the Imperial Mountain Sect disciple through the gates. He hadn't expected the sea tribes to be this ruthless—not only refusing to let anyone leave, but smashing the sect disciple into pulp without a shred of diplomacy.

'Looks like I won't be getting out anytime soon,' the young Daoist murmured.

If there had been no Immortal Kings, his strength would have been enough to sneak out—or even force his way through. But against an Immortal King, he stood no chance.

Brow creased, the young Daoist resumed his calculations, muttering to himself: 'No immediate danger to my life in the short term, but the future... everything's just gray and murky. Not dead, but miserable? What kind of dog-shit luck is this? Who did I offend to get suppressed this hard? Might as well just die and be done with it!'
