The two women caught up for a long while before finally turning to look at Qin Jiang, their cheeks slightly flushed.

Seeing this, Qin Jiang tapped Qin Lian'er on the head. "Go back to your room."

Qin Lian'er's mouth fell open. She pouted and shot him a look, but took the hint and retreated to her quarters.

Inside the traveling palace, Qin Jiang discussed with Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er how to deal with Huo Lie. Death was a certainty—that much was never in question. The real question was how to make him suffer first. After all, Huo Qing'er's ordeal had been nothing short of hellish: the Legacy Flame's backlash had destroyed her physical body, and her primordial spirit had drifted in a daze for three hundred years. Any single one of those torments would have driven an ordinary person mad.

"However you two decide to handle it, I'll support you completely," Qin Jiang said.

The reunion of the two sisters clearly pleased him. He was happy to leave Huo Lie's punishment entirely in their hands.

Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er exchanged a glance, then nodded in unison. "Alright~"

Qin Jiang took Qin Lian'er and left the traveling palace. Walking through the streets, he'd already learned how she'd come into contact with the Child of Destiny. He could only say one thing: well played.

"Brother, are you interested in that guy?" Qin Lian'er asked.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. "I'm bored. Figured I'd find someone to play with."

He led her to an underground fighting arena. The moment they stepped inside, the deafening roar of the crowd made him frown slightly. This was the arena's signature atmosphere—a place where people could unleash themselves without restraint. Excitement, blood, adrenaline pumping nonstop.

Qin Jiang surveyed the scene. Dozens of massive cages filled the underground arena, each containing fighters—some human, some beast—locked in savage combat. The spectators in the stands were just as frenzied, eyes glued to their chosen combatants, screaming with everything they had—sometimes elated, sometimes furious. Excited howls, anguished wails, and cathartic roars filled every corner of the arena.

His gaze swept the crowd until it settled on a figure in the corner, cloaked entirely in a black robe. Compared to everyone else, this person seemed distinctly out of place—outwardly calm, yet inwardly tense.

Beyond the fighting itself, the arena also ran a gambling operation. Spectators bet on the fighters and beasts in the cages. Nearly everyone placed wagers. The odds were simple: at minimum a fifty-fifty shot, and if you knew the fighters well, your chances could be even better. After the arena took its cut, the remaining pool was split among the winners—the more you bet, the more you stood to gain. This was precisely why many gamblers would stake everything they had, even if it meant ruin.

The black-robed figure was one such gambler.

"Brother, it's so loud in here," Qin Lian'er complained, scrunching up her face at the overwhelming noise.

Qin Jiang smiled and ruffled her hair. "I'll make them quiet down. Black Dragon!"

Black Dragon, who'd been trailing behind them, launched into the air. His massive draconic form materialized, and he let out a thunderous roar: "Everyone shut the hell up! Disturb the Young Lord or the Young Miss, and I'll tear you apart!"

The roar echoed through the arena. Qin Jiang covered Qin Lian'er's ears, frowning slightly—this idiot was louder than everyone else combined.

A brief silence fell. Then every eye in the arena turned to glare at Black Dragon, and a storm of curses erupted from all directions.

Black Dragon snorted coldly and slammed his power into the spectator stands. No one had expected he'd actually attack. This arena had serious backers—no one had ever dared cause trouble here. Screams rang out as bodies went flying. A few unlucky souls were killed outright.

At the same time, a swarm of arena guards shot into the air, surrounding Black Dragon. Unlike the Void Beast, Black Dragon had no real reputation—he spent most of his time handling Qin Jiang's dirty work behind the scenes, and virtually no one knew he was Qin Jiang's guard. So naturally, they showed him no deference.

The arena's people were decisive and ruthless. They didn't bother asking questions—they attacked immediately. But their strikes disintegrated before they even reached Black Dragon. An invisible force annihilated every attacker in an instant.

Black Dragon ignored the casualties entirely and kept smashing into the spectator stands, bellowing all the while: "Quiet! I said quiet!"

Qin Jiang's expression darkened. He finally called Black Dragon off—this wasn't the right approach for this particular task.

Reverting to human form amid the groaning and wailing, Black Dragon scratched his head sheepishly. "Young Lord, they won't quiet down."

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes, swept his arm outward, and released a wave of supreme pressure that blanketed the entire arena. Instant silence.

Black Dragon stared, incredulous. He'd expended all that effort for nothing, and a single pulse of aura had accomplished what he couldn't?

"Ahh, I'm still not strong enough," he muttered.

Only overwhelming power made pressure effective, and his clearly wasn't sufficient. He sighed, then surveyed the wrecked spectator stands. His eyes lit up.

"Young Lord, give me a moment—I'll clear a nice area for you."

At least Black Dragon knew how to read the room.
