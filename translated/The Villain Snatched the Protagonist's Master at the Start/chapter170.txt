On the platform.

Qin Jiang gave the Pill Emperor's hand a squeeze and smiled. "Time for your speech."

A speech wasn't strictly necessary, but as Palace Master, she needed to officially open the Grand Refinement. The Pill Emperor kept it brief—a few sentences, and the competition was underway.

The alchemists set to work. Qin Jiang and the Pill Emperor sat side by side, close enough to share warmth. He'd tease her with a whispered word here and there, drawing faint blushes and mock-annoyed glances.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

The Grand Refinement concluded without further incident. With Chen Changsheng disqualified, the championship went to a veteran alchemist who'd been honing his craft in seclusion for centuries. He claimed the title of Pill King and earned the coveted Pill Fire Tempering.

Following the results, the Pill Emperor conducted the customary recruitment of the top hundred. Other factions swarmed in to compete for talent as well, but the Heavenly Pill Palace's momentum was unstoppable—more than half the finalists chose to join the Palace.

The Pill King was among them.

The Palace's strength grew considerably.

And with that, the Myriad Pill Assembly officially came to a close.

---

Outside Pill City.

Chen Changsheng stood at the gates, his face a thundercloud.

After being stripped of his qualification, he'd tried multiple times to reach the Pill Emperor and reveal his identity. But his current status was too low to secure an audience, and with Qin Jiang monopolizing her attention, the Pill Emperor had barely left her chambers.

When she did emerge, it was for the Grand Refinement—where she spent every waking moment glued to Qin Jiang's side.

He never got a single chance to speak with her alone.

His attempts to enter the Palace were rebuffed. After his stunt with the Ghost Immortal, every member of the Heavenly Pill Palace despised him. He was chased away before he could get within a hundred paces of the gates.

In ten lifetimes, he'd never been treated like this.

Later, he'd snuck into the spectator stands during the Grand Refinement, hoping to find an opening. But over three days, the Pill Emperor and Qin Jiang were inseparable—holding hands, kissing, flirting openly.

Chen Changsheng's mental state was in ruins.

Now, with the Assembly over, he'd made one last attempt. His luck held just enough that he spotted the Pill Emperor outside the Palace. But before he could utter a word, she took one look at his face, twisted her features in disgust, and ordered her guards to expel him from Pill City.

Chen Changsheng's fists clenched so hard his knuckles went white. He stared at the city walls, teeth grinding.

"Dan Linglong! I taught you everything you know. I made you an Emperor. And this is how you repay me—you ungrateful wretch!"

His voice was a low, venomous hiss.

Every time he pictured Qin Jiang and the Pill Emperor together, his face twitched involuntarily. In his previous life, the Pill Emperor had still been young when he'd died and reincarnated—modest in both age and cultivation. He'd harbored no particular thoughts about her then.

But this life was different. He'd seen her portrait in Pill City, and the impact had been immediate. The awkward girl he remembered had blossomed into an absolutely breathtaking woman. Combined with his new body's youthful vigor, certain... ideas had taken root.

In his mind, she owed him. He'd been her benefactor. This life, she should repay that debt—with her body, if necessary.

So before even arriving at the Heavenly Pill Palace, he'd already claimed the Pill Emperor as his.

He just hadn't expected that the very first time he laid eyes on her, there'd be a young man at her side. Taller, more handsome, more powerful—and clearly intimate with her.

His composure had shattered on the spot.

His "property" had been taken.

And the man who'd taken it surpassed him in every measurable way—looks, youth, talent.

Jealousy consumed him. Rage devoured him.

At first he'd told himself they were just friends. But then came the hand-holding. The public kiss.

Chen Changsheng drew a deep, shuddering breath. His face contorted briefly before smoothing into cold composure. But beneath the surface, hatred seethed—for Qin Jiang, for the Pill Emperor.

His fists tightened. His eyes were glacial.

"Just you wait. Ten lifetimes of reincarnation—you're not the only ally I've cultivated, Dan Linglong. I will make you regret this."
