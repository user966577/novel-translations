Three months flew by in a blink.

The Heavenly Mystery Continent—now the Qin Domain—had undergone a transformation so complete it was barely recognizable. And Qin Jiang had announced that he wanted to visit other continents.

The Qin family raised no objections. They immediately began assembling a personal guard for him. Of the thirteen Great Emperor ancestors, they volunteered to send ten. Qin Jiang talked them down to six—the family still needed Emperors at home, and with Liu Shuwan and Jian Yao (still in seclusion) at his side, six ancestral Emperors was more than enough.

"Where are you planning to go, Xiao Jiang?" First Ancestor asked.

Qin Jiang thought for a moment, then shrugged. "No idea. I'll just drift through the Chaos and see where I end up."

First Ancestor had no response to that.

In truth, Qin Jiang did have a destination in mind. Yan Yun and Yan Shiya's homeland was one of the Nine Heavens, and their enemies still lived there. But the Nine Heavens were far too powerful for the Qin family to challenge right now. He'd wait until Jian Yao broke through to the immortal path before making that trip. In the meantime, he'd tour the Ten Lands—or even the territories below them.

"Wherever you go, stay safe," First Ancestor said.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. With the life he had now, he had no intention of dying.

He left thirty half-Emperor airships with the family and departed from the Qin estate's rear mountains with a single Emperor-grade airship. The vessel was colossal—more like a flying castle than a ship, larger even than the entire Qin family compound. His plan was to mount the Void Divine Temple on board and bring all the women along for a grand Chaos road trip.

But before that, there was one loose end to tie up.

Chu Yuan.

Leaving the continent with a Child of Destiny still alive was too risky. Better to finish him off now.

Chu Yuan's movements were under complete surveillance. Qin Jiang found him quickly. In three months, the boy's strength had grown considerably. Left unchecked, he really could become a threat.

"Qin Jiang—you're here to beat me up again?" Chu Yuan eyed him warily. Even though Qin Jiang hadn't visited personally, he'd occasionally remembered Chu Yuan's existence and sent people to give him a thrashing. The boy was thoroughly traumatized.

Qin Jiang shook his head with a smile. "No more beatings after today."

"Huh?"

"Yan'er has given up on you. So there's no reason for you to keep living."

He waved his arm. His guards surged forward, their attacks holding nothing back. Chu Yuan was engulfed in an instant.

Dust billowed. Qin Jiang swept it away with a casual wave. Where Chu Yuan had stood, only his spirit remained, floating in a daze.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow—the boy's primordial spirit had actually survived. He reached out and yanked it toward him with a clench of his fist.

"Tsk. Two lifetimes and your spirit is still this feeble? You really wasted both of them."

Chu Yuan snapped back to awareness, but before anger could surface, Qin Jiang's words registered and his face flooded with horror. "You... how do you know about that?"

Qin Jiang didn't answer. Instead, he studied Chu Yuan's spirit closely, then squeezed.

Chu Yuan screamed. The crushing force nearly obliterated him, but a white glow flickered from deep within his spirit, shielding it. Qin Jiang kept pressing. The glow pulsed and wavered. The agony turned Chu Yuan's spirit increasingly transparent.

Finally, an object emerged from the depths of Chu Yuan's primordial spirit—a compass. Qin Jiang snatched it.

The compass trembled violently. Qin Jiang channeled his full power to suppress it, but the artifact refused to submit.

"Stubborn little thing."

His eyes flashed. A Time-Space Disc fragment materialized before him and slammed down onto the compass. The compass shuddered once, hard—then went docile, sitting obediently in his palm.

Qin Jiang nodded in satisfaction. The Time-Space Disc fragment still had its uses. He put the fragment away, and the compass quivered gently, as if demonstrating its submission.

He drove a strand of spirit power into the compass, forcibly scouring away every trace of Chu Yuan's aura and claiming it as his own.

As he did, the compass's purpose became clear. It was an immortal-grade divination artifact. Chu Yuan had stumbled upon it, and it had divined ten years of his future, embedding those visions directly into his mind.

In other words, Chu Yuan had never been reborn at all. The compass's divinations had simply created that illusion. Even now, Chu Yuan had no idea the compass had been hiding inside his primordial spirit—it had vanished mysteriously after he'd first obtained it, and he'd eventually forgotten about it.

"This compass..." Chu Yuan stared at it, stunned.

Qin Jiang's gaze shifted from the compass to Chu Yuan, his expression almost pitying. "You're actually quite unlucky. This thing manufactured a fake rebirth to trick you. In reality, it was just using you."

The compass's origin had been damaged. To restore itself, it had latched onto Chu Yuan, divining the future to guide him toward opportunities that would repair its core. But it had the misfortune of running into Qin Jiang. Not only had it failed to recover—the energy it spent on divination was wasted, and now it belonged to someone else entirely.

A catastrophic investment.

Chu Yuan's expression went blank.

Qin Jiang chuckled softly. "At least you can die knowing the truth."

He gave Chu Yuan no further chances. A surge of brutal power obliterated his primordial spirit.

As for the compass, it wasn't particularly useful to Qin Jiang. His system's primary function was spoilers, and it was far more reliable than any divination artifact. At the very least, the compass had failed to predict the system's existence.

"Kind of useless," he muttered.

The compass seemed to sense his disdain and began vibrating frantically, nuzzling against his palm like a pet begging for approval.

He tucked it away with a shrug. Maybe it'd come in handy someday.

The moment he stored the compass, the system chimed in. A cascade of rewards poured in—generous ones. The most interesting was a map marking every fortune site across the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent. Handed over to the Qin family, it would let them consolidate total control in record time.

Beyond that, the other rewards were solid as well.

But the most important change was this: with Chu Yuan's death, all of his fortune had been seized by Qin Jiang and transferred to the Qin family. The family now possessed nearly the entire continent's fortune—a dynasty blessed by heaven itself.
