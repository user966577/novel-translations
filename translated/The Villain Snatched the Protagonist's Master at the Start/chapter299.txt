For several days, Qin Jiang left Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng entirely alone.

He spent the time with his women near the seal. Inside, behind the shimmering barrier, An Xihe's silhouette sat motionless in seclusion — half a month now. Her aura had grown so faint it was nearly imperceptible, a sign that the true push toward Immortal King had begun.

Qin Jiang stepped away from the seal and turned his attention outward, toward the edges of the Chaos District where the other True Immortals were positioned. For two weeks straight, they'd been hammering at the trapping formation. They were close to breaking free.

"Time to deal with Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng."

He needed to finish them before those True Immortals escaped — any loose ends could complicate things. But first, one final round of torment. The plan was already in place, and besides, messing with them would earn a small system reward.

With his women all deep in cultivation, Qin Jiang set out, once again dragging Dao Zhen along as his enforcer. What was about to happen wasn't something his precious darlings needed to see.

"Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming haven't made any moves these past few days," Dao Zhen reported. He'd been keeping watch the entire time, terrified that Qin Jiang would lose control of the game. These were people blessed with immense fortune, after all — and that little follower at Chen Qi'er's side, Chen Wuming, also carried considerable luck of his own. Three heavily-fortuned individuals, all antagonized by Qin Jiang, all kept alive just so he could toy with them. Dao Zhen was genuinely afraid. If things went sideways, he'd be dragged down too.

"How's Chen Changsheng doing?" Qin Jiang asked. He didn't particularly care about Chen Qi'er — just kill him and collect the drops. But Chen Changsheng was still nurturing his Reincarnation Law. That one warranted attention.

"He's been in seclusion. I checked on him discreetly — his power is growing at a frightening rate." Dao Zhen's voice carried genuine shock. In just a few days, Chen Changsheng had gone from an unstable Great Emperor to Ancient Emperor, and appeared poised to push toward the immortal path. This was the power of great fortune — others spent tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years struggling, and these blessed souls surpassed them all in mere months. The thought made Dao Zhen increasingly anxious. One lapse in attention, and their cultivation could leap above his own.

"Is that so?" Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. His Reincarnation Law was maturing nicely, then.

After a moment's thought, he turned to Dao Zhen with a grin. "Brother Dao Zhen, be a pal and bring Chen Qi'er to Chen Changsheng's place."

"What are you planning?"

"Those pills from the other day — can't let them go to waste."

Dao Zhen nodded. He was curious, honestly. He'd been wondering what Qin Jiang had given Chen Changsheng. It had been days — could it still be active?

Dao Zhen left to collect Chen Qi'er while Qin Jiang headed straight for Chen Changsheng's hideout. He strolled into the small courtyard without a care in the world, his attention fixed on the room where Chen Changsheng was cultivating. Without the slightest hesitation, he openly probed for his Reincarnation Law's growth status.

Chen Changsheng's eyes snapped open, alarm flashing across his face. "Qin Jiang?"

His cultivation had reached Ancient Emperor, but the psychological shadow hadn't diminished one bit. The instant he sensed Qin Jiang's aura, panic surged instinctively. He forced it down, clenched his fists, rose to his feet, and opened the door. Qin Jiang was standing right there.

Chen Changsheng locked eyes with him, every nerve on edge. His gaze swept the surroundings while his Primordial Spirit extended outward — and to his astonishment, Qin Jiang was completely alone. Joy exploded across his features. Qin Jiang was only at Nine Tribulations Supreme — wasn't this his chance?

"Ha ha ha..." He couldn't help laughing, his aura surging outward in a wave of pressure. "Qin Jiang! Without your women to protect you, you actually dare show your face before me?"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. This guy thought he was tough again?

Indeed he did. Chen Changsheng's confidence was swelling by the second, his momentum building, killing intent gleaming in his eyes. Ten lifetimes of reincarnation, and his greatest humiliation had all come from this one man. The hatred and frustration he'd bottled up erupted at once, his expression twisting between ferocity and dark satisfaction — as though he could already see Qin Jiang broken at his feet.

But —

At the very peak of Chen Changsheng's momentum, Qin Jiang flicked his wrist. A bolt of blood-red lightning crashed down from the heavens, slamming squarely into the top of Chen Changsheng's skull. The overwhelming force left him dazed, his surging aura collapsing in an instant.

Qin Jiang regarded him with cool disdain. "Did you really think I survive on my women alone?"

Dead wrong. He also survived on the system.

The entire Chaos District was already enveloped by the Immortal King Killing Formation. Short of an Immortal King, nothing here could touch him. That single strike just now hadn't even used one percent of its power.

Chen Changsheng came to his senses, shaken. For that split second, he'd felt the brush of death itself. He stared at Qin Jiang, understanding that the bolt had been a warning. Had he actually attacked, something far worse would have followed. His face darkened.

At that moment, a streak of light shot toward them and split into three. Two figures slammed into the ground at Chen Changsheng's feet.

He blinked. Two familiar faces — wasn't that Qin Jiang's brother-in-law? What was he doing here? And he looked badly hurt.

Before he could process it, Dao Zhen appeared in the courtyard. Chen Changsheng brightened at the sight and was about to call out — then saw Dao Zhen walk to Qin Jiang's side.

"You alright?" Dao Zhen asked Qin Jiang.

Chen Changsheng's expression froze. He stared in disbelief, a cold unease creeping through his chest. Senior Dao Zhen... wasn't quite what he'd seemed.

"I'm fine." Qin Jiang shook his head, then looked at the shell-shocked Chen Changsheng and grinned. "But your dear old friend here — looks like he's been wearing a red nose this whole time."

Dao Zhen blinked. "A red nose? What's that supposed to mean?"

By now, if Chen Changsheng still couldn't see the truth, he'd be an utter fool. The man he'd trusted, the senior he'd respected — had been Qin Jiang's man all along. All this time, he'd been living under Qin Jiang's control without knowing it. Shame and fury flooded through him. His entire body shook.

'Killing a man is one thing — but this is killing the soul. He's not just defeating me; he's dismantling me.'

In that moment, he felt like the biggest clown of all.

Not far away, Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming were picking themselves off the ground, glancing between Qin Jiang and Chen Changsheng in utter confusion. They'd both been deep in cultivation when Dao Zhen snatched them up, hammered them on the head, and dumped them here before they could even react.

So what exactly was going on?
