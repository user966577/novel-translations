Hundreds of miles away, Black Dragon and the Void Beast burst out of folded space.

"Holy crap, that scared the life out of me!"

The Void Beast cursed up a storm. Black Dragon had already shifted to human form and was wiping cold sweat from his forehead, his expression grave. "That guy just now... he gave me a genuine sense of mortal danger."

"Me too."

The Void Beast's voice was still shaky.

Before either could say more, a thunderous explosion echoed from the direction they'd fled. They looked over to see a colossal wave of energy detonate across the horizon, shattering the very fabric of space.

The two exchanged a glance and muttered in unison, "That wasn't aimed at us, was it?"

"Good thing we ran fast. A blast that powerful would've killed us outright, or at least left us half-dead."

"This guy is seriously no joke."

"Should we go back and check?"

"Give it a minute."

Meanwhile, Wu Tian spat blood, his body threatening to topple over. Fortunately, the yao beasts had fled in terror the moment Black Dragon and the Void Beast departed. Within moments, the clearing held nothing but corpses.

Wu Tian slumped to the ground and bit down hard. That last attack had cost him dearly—burning his potential reserves—and all for a fireworks show. Those two had looked so cocky, yet they were nothing but cowards. The moment he so much as twitched, they'd already vanished.

The fury of it!

He slammed his fist into the earth, venting some of his rage, then forced himself upright. Black Dragon and the Void Beast might come back, and they could well be Huaxia's people. In his current state, he absolutely could not afford to provoke Huaxia.

Gritting his teeth, Wu Tian pushed his remaining spiritual energy to the limit and fled the area.

About fifteen minutes later, Black Dragon and the Void Beast returned to find the clearing empty.

Black Dragon frowned. "He's not dead, is he?"

"Probably not."

"The young master specifically said we can torment him all we want, but we absolutely cannot kill him."

"Better look around."

They searched carefully for Wu Tian's aura, but he'd scrubbed his trail clean before departing. They couldn't find the faintest trace.

"If he cleaned up this thoroughly, he's almost certainly alive," the Void Beast reasoned.

Black Dragon could only nod in resignation. The trail had gone completely cold. He sighed and turned to the Void Beast. "Let's head back."

"Let's go."

Hundreds of miles in another direction, Wu Tian finally reached his limit. He blacked out mid-flight, plummeting from the sky and slamming into the earth with enough force to kick up a cloud of dust.

Not far from where he crashed stood a small courtyard, idyllic as a hidden paradise.

"Which sorry bastard just wrecked my vegetable garden?"

A stream of profanity emerged from the courtyard, followed by a middle-aged man stomping out to investigate. Wu Tian had cratered right into a patch of cultivated vegetables.

The man cursed his way over and stopped dead when he saw the body in his garden.

"A person? Oh lord, did someone dump a corpse here?"

Wu Tian certainly looked the part. His breathing was so shallow it was nearly undetectable.

"Daddy, what's wrong?"

A melodious voice rang out from the courtyard, and a slender young woman bounced into view. Reaching the middle-aged man's side, she spotted Wu Tian in the garden and gasped, eyes wide. "Eek! Daddy, did you kill someone?"

"???"

The middle-aged man's face darkened. He marched over, grabbed Wu Tian by the leg, and made to fling him out. A dumped body meant trouble, and he wanted nothing to do with it.

But just as he was about to throw him, the young woman pointed at Wu Tian in surprise. "He's not dead!"

"Hm?"

The man looked down at Wu Tian, dragged him outside the garden, and examined him more carefully. Sure enough—still alive. Barely. The injuries were catastrophic.

He shook his head. "He might still be breathing, but with wounds like these, he's not long for this world."

"So what do we do?"

The girl blinked her pretty eyes, leaned in for a closer look, wrinkled her nose, and stepped back again. "He's so dirty."

She was clearly repulsed.

The middle-aged man hesitated, then spoke. "Hurt this badly, he's probably running from enemies. How about we... just bury him? Saves us the trouble."

"We can bury him in the garden. He'll make good fertilizer."

The girl nodded in agreement.

No sooner said than done. The man dug a hole and deposited Wu Tian inside, then filled it in. With wounds this severe and now buried underground, the poor man's chances had dropped to zero.

The girl dusted off her little hands with a giggle. "With this fertilizer, this year's vegetables should grow beautifully."

"Mm, the crops will definitely thrive. But if anyone comes looking, we never saw this person."

The man gave his daughter a pointed look.

The father-daughter pair tidied up the garden and returned to their cottage. It wasn't until nightfall that Wu Tian's consciousness finally stirred beneath the soil.

The crushing pressure around him was immediately uncomfortable. His entire body felt bound and constricted. Alarm flashed through his mind—had he been discovered? Was he trapped?

He strained slightly and felt the resistance weaken. Wait. This didn't feel like imprisonment.

After several more struggles, his mind fully cleared. Extending his senses, he finally realized the truth.

He'd been buried alive.

Holding his breath, Wu Tian forced his remaining spiritual energy outward, blasting apart the surrounding earth. After catching his breath and starting to rise, he heard approaching footsteps.

The middle-aged man and his daughter stood at the edge of the pit, staring down at him in wide-eyed disbelief.

"You're still alive?"

The man could hardly believe it. The injuries had been horrific, and he'd personally buried the man. Yet here he was, alive and clawing his way out.

Wu Tian gasped heavily. Hearing the man's words, understanding dawned—they'd assumed he was dead and simply interred him.

He pushed himself up, wobbled out of the hole on unsteady legs, and promptly stumbled, falling flat on his face again. The father and daughter both took two steps back.

'Don't try to pin this on us.'

Wu Tian steadied himself, looked at the pair, swallowed hard, and croaked, "How long was I unconscious?"

"Um... about half a day?"

"Did anyone come looking?"

"No."

The middle-aged man shook his head, then hesitated before continuing. "Since you're not dead, how about... you leave?"
