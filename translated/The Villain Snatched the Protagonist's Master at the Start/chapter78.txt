Outside Sword Valley.

Sun Yang and Wang Chao had emerged some time ago to inform Bai Jingyun and the others that Qin Jiang wouldn't be coming out anytime soon. Most of the group had long since departed, leaving only a handful behind.

Qin Lian'er and Bai Susu waited outside Sword Valley, idly teasing Little Red to pass the time.

"Sis, what do you think my brother's doing in there?" Qin Lian'er gazed toward the valley, her tone casual.

Bai Susu followed her gaze with a sigh. "No idea. He's probably trying to reach the bottom of Sword Valley. It can't be easy—he's likely still working at it."

Qin Lian'er shook her head. She had absolute faith in Qin Jiang. A mere valley was nothing her brother couldn't conquer. However...

A glint flickered in her eyes. She sidled up to Bai Susu and lowered her voice. "Sis, I did some digging. All of the Holy Sword Sect's past ancestors are secluded in Sword Valley, and among them, there's one very special person."

"Special how?"

"Your Holy Sword Sect has an ancestor who's really beautiful!"

Bai Susu blinked, then immediately grasped what Qin Lian'er was getting at. Her expression turned peculiar. "Qin Jiang wouldn't..."

"Sis, you don't know my brother like I do. He can't walk straight when he sees a beautiful woman. If he laid eyes on that ancestor, he absolutely won't come out until he's won her over!" Qin Lian'er produced a scroll and unfurled it. "Look—isn't she gorgeous?"

The scroll bore a portrait of Liu Shuwan. Beautiful indeed, though it didn't quite do the real woman justice. Bai Susu took the painting, her brows furrowing slightly.

Qin Lian'er continued, "The ones who came out to deliver the message were two of your sect's ancestors, which means my brother definitely made contact with the sect's elders. And if he did, he probably met her too. Hehe, looks like I'm about to get another sister-in-law."

But Bai Susu shook her head. "I've heard of this ancestor. Among the sect's secluded powerhouses, her strength ranks in the top three—maybe even first. She was our sect's Saintess six thousand years ago, an extraordinary genius. They say the number of suitors she had back then was countless, but she only had eyes for the sword. She's the ultimate sword cultivator. If Qin Jiang really set his sights on her, I'm afraid he'll hit a wall."

Qin Lian'er was taken aback.

Bai Susu went on, "I recall this ancestor once declared that until she reached Sword Heart, she wouldn't consider personal feelings."

At that, Qin Lian'er's eyes lit up. "Sis, is it possible my brother could help her break through to Sword Heart?"

Bai Susu was about to shake her head when she remembered—at the bottom of Sword Valley, the sect's founder had left behind a treasure. Perhaps it really could help the ancestor reach Sword Heart.

"But the age gap between them is enormous," Bai Susu said hesitantly.

Qin Lian'er was brimming with confidence. "I believe in my brother!"

Privately, Bai Susu also felt that if Qin Jiang managed to help the ancestor break through to Sword Heart, he genuinely might win her over. But if that happened, then the ancestor and herself would become... sisters?

The relationships were getting a bit tangled.

While she was mulling this over, Qin Lian'er let out a sudden cry. "Sis—my brother! Look, he's back! And that's your ancestor right beside him! Ahahaha, I knew it! I knew my brother would win her over!"

Qin Lian'er took off toward Qin Jiang at a jog, laughing the whole way.

Bai Susu stared in astonishment. Sure enough, there was the ancestor at Qin Jiang's side. She'd really been won over?

"Brother, I'm over here!" Qin Lian'er shouted, bouncing on her toes and waving.

On the other side, Qin Jiang was holding Liu Shuwan's hand. He spotted his bouncing sister, waved back, then turned to Liu Shuwan. "Wan'er, this is my little sister, Qin Lian'er. Just call her Little Lian'er."

By the time he finished the introduction, Qin Lian'er had already rushed up. Her big eyes locked onto Liu Shuwan. "Wow, Sis, you're even prettier than your portrait!"

Qin Lian'er was a natural—calling her "Sis" right off the bat.

The familiarity flustered Liu Shuwan slightly. Qin Jiang gave her hand a gentle squeeze, and she relaxed enough to smile. "So you're Little Lian'er. Your brother mentioned you. You're adorable."

"Hehe, Sis talks so sweetly."

By then, Bai Susu had walked over. She looked at Liu Shuwan, momentarily at a loss for what to call her.

"Wan'er, this is Susu. I've told you about her," Qin Jiang said.

Liu Shuwan's gaze turned to Bai Susu, making her a touch nervous.

"Ance—" Bai Susu began.

Liu Shuwan cut her off immediately, taking Bai Susu's hand and speaking gently. "Little Sister Susu is lovely indeed. No wonder a certain someone can't stop thinking about you."

Qin Jiang gave an awkward chuckle and rubbed his nose.

Liu Shuwan continued, "Susu, just call me 'Sister' from now on. Let's drop the other titles—after all, when a woman marries, she follows her husband's house. Our seniority should go by Qin Jiang's side."

She certainly didn't want Bai Susu's first word to be "Ancestor." That made her sound ancient. Being sisters was much better—and she got to be the older one. Liu Shuwan was quietly pleased with herself.

Bai Susu relaxed too, nodding with a smile. "Sister."

Hearing the address, Liu Shuwan's smile deepened.

While they chatted, Bai Jingyun and the sect's elders received word and hurried over. They spotted Qin Jiang from a distance.

"The Holy Son is finally out. I wonder if he brought back any of Sword Valley's treasures."

"He was down there so long—he must have."

"Uh, does anyone else think the woman beside him looks familiar?"

"Hm? She does look familiar..."

"Holy—that's the ancestor! Our Holy Sword Sect's Saintess from six thousand years ago, the half-Emperor powerhouse!"

"Why is the ancestor out?"

They hurried forward and immediately bowed to Liu Shuwan. "Junior greets the Ancestor!"

Liu Shuwan's expression froze. She despised that title. Turning to face Bai Jingyun and the others, her face went cold, and a fierce pressure bore down on them until they could barely breathe.

Qin Jiang shook his head helplessly and took Liu Shuwan's hand. To be fair, Bai Jingyun and the others could only address her as "Ancestor"—they could hardly call her "Sister" like Bai Susu. Even setting Liu Shuwan's feelings aside, Qin Jiang wouldn't have agreed to that.

Still, they could have called her "Saintess." Too bad these old fossils didn't understand women.

"Easy, Wan'er. Don't be upset—we'll have them change the way they address you," Qin Jiang said softly.
