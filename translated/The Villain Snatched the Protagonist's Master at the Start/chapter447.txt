Back in the courtyard, Qin Jiang helped the women thoroughly clean their rooms, finishing with a good rinse of water. He inspected his work and nodded with satisfaction. "All clean."

He helped them close the doors, giving each one a playful pat as he did. The women batted his mischievous hands away and rose to their feet, momentarily unsteady — everything felt oddly... empty.

Still, they were heading out on a trip, so it was better to tidy up properly beforehand.

Weiwei looked at Qin Jiang, cheeks still flushed. "When are we going to see Master?"

"Tomorrow?"

"Okay~" She nodded, then added shyly, "So tonight..."

"Hehe, gotta unwind before a long trip."

He took Weiwei and Xue Yue by the hand and headed for the room where Liu Shuwan, Lian'er, Jian Yao, and Mo Mo were resting, sweeping all of them inside.

They spent the entire day in that room. When they finally emerged the next morning — well past midday — Qin Jiang looked refreshed and satisfied, while the women trailed behind him with sore legs and slightly crooked gaits.

"Man, that felt amazing!" He stretched luxuriously.

The women pouted. They were all exhausted, and here he was gloating about how great he felt. Insufferable!

They exchanged glances, then simultaneously raised their bare feet and planted them all over him — thighs, waist, chest, face. Little feet everywhere.

Qin Jiang blinked, momentarily stunned. Then he inhaled deeply. 'Heavenly.'

He licked his lips, eyes sparkling.

"Eep!" Lian'er yelped and yanked her foot back. Hers had landed on his face — and judging by his expression, he was treating it as a reward. Her little feet were like ice cream bars — sweet and fragrant.

She retreated, blushing, while the other women hastily withdrew their own feet and put their shoes back on when they saw the gleam in his eyes. Otherwise, they'd end up paying for it.

Qin Jiang laughed. "I thought you ladies hadn't had enough yesterday and wanted a round two."

"Absolutely not!" They shook their heads vigorously.

They grabbed Weiwei and changed the subject. "We need to take Weiwei to see her master!" And with that, they whisked her toward the gate, moving as fast as their legs would carry them.

Qin Jiang shook his head with a smile and followed, opening his arms to wrap one around each woman he could reach.

Outside the gate, they found a barrel of spirit liquid sitting by the entrance. "What's this?"

Qin Jiang glanced at it dismissively. He knew Nangong Yun had left it, though he couldn't fathom why. "Just some trash." He kicked it over, sending the liquid splashing across the ground, and turned to Weiwei. "Let's go."

She led the way. Their destination wasn't far — in less than half a day, they arrived at a mountain range. After winding through hills and switchbacks, they came to a peak.

Weiwei's face glowed with excitement. She hugged Qin Jiang's arm and pointed. "This is it. I grew up here. Hardly ever left."

Her master was something of a recluse — she'd spent most of her life cultivating in these mountains. One day, she'd found an abandoned infant, and from then on, it had been just the two of them. Until her master took in another stray — Nangong Yun — and the peaceful days ended. Her master went into seclusion, Nangong Yun wanted revenge, and Weiwei was tasked with protecting him, which led to the founding of the Anti-Huaxia Alliance.

And that was how she'd crossed paths with Qin Jiang.

She looked up at him, eyes full of tenderness. It was all fate — her fate with Qin Jiang. If not for Nangong Yun, she'd never have left the mountain, and she'd never have met this man.

"Master should be up there," she said.

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile. "I can feel it. There's a Human Immortal aura — that should be your master. Let's go."

They soared up the mountainside. Halfway up, they spotted a simple courtyard, and within it, a woman in white.

"That's my master!" Weiwei said excitedly, darting forward before anyone else. "Master!"

She flew into the courtyard and threw herself into the white-robed woman's arms. Qin Jiang and the others hung back to give the pair a moment to catch up.

Liu Shuwan and the others, however, took one look at the woman in white and shot Qin Jiang knowing glances. 'No wonder he agreed so fast — yesterday's news, today's visit. Weiwei's master is another beauty.'

Qin Jiang was already sizing up the white-robed woman, eyes practically glowing with interest. Clearly, his enthusiasm had nothing to do with filial obligation.

They resisted the urge to kick him. Though if they did, it'd have to be barefoot — shoes on would be an insult. Bare feet was a different matter entirely — that was just flirting.

Inside the courtyard, master and disciple chatted briefly before Weiwei, blushing, beckoned the group over.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Let's go."

They appeared in the courtyard in a flash. The white-robed woman's gaze immediately locked onto them, and Weiwei took Qin Jiang's arm.

"Master, this is my man."

The woman's eyes fixed on Qin Jiang, appraising him. He simply grinned and said, "Mother-in-law, hello~"

She blinked. Mother-in-law? The title felt... strange.

Undeterred, Qin Jiang stepped forward and grasped her hand. "I know you and Weiwei are master and disciple in name but mother and daughter in spirit. So calling you my mother-in-law is perfectly appropriate, wouldn't you say?"

"I... suppose so." Her face stiffened as she tried to pull her hand free, but his grip was firm.

He shook it warmly, talking all the while. "Mother-in-law, I'm truly grateful to you for raising Weiwei into such a wonderful woman."

All she could do was nod along. But she was increasingly certain that the man before her was subtly kneading her palm. Was she imagining things? He looked so earnest that she couldn't bring herself to say anything — he was Weiwei's husband, after all.

But she was reaching her limit. She'd never been this close to a man in her life, and having her hand held — and apparently massaged — for this long was making her face flush.

Something felt... off.
