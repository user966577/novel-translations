Others continued entering the Myriad Realms Tower. Apart from Long Yu, not a single Divine Dragon Empire disciple cracked the top ten thousand.

Meanwhile, the women gradually emerged. Long Xin'er was first out, with a modest showing—somewhere past 5,000th. The rest of the women, even Xia Qianling with only a few days of cultivation under her belt, reached the 3,000s. The tower matched opponents by realm, after all.

Xia Qianling's only shortcoming was combat experience. With her talent, the top thousand would've been well within reach—top hundred wasn't out of the question if she had more time to train.

Before long, Ye Ling'er and the others all filed out, each with substantial gains and respectable rankings. The highest among them was Chu Hanyan, who'd reached the 200s.

The bounty left every woman buzzing with excitement, chattering animatedly.

Qin Jiang turned to Liu Shuwan with a grin. "Shall we give it a try?"

"Sure."

Liu Shuwan nodded. As a Great Emperor, she could still challenge the tower—no restrictions at all. Perhaps that meant Great Emperors weren't particularly rare across the myriad realms.

The two entered simultaneously and were sent to separate spaces. Qin Jiang found himself on an empty arena. Across from him, a sphere of light flickered, composed entirely of energy, slowly taking human form.

Qin Jiang blinked, then darted forward. The sphere hadn't finished materializing. He grabbed it directly.

"Devour!"

Savage devouring force engulfed the sphere. In less than a breath, it was gone—every drop of energy consumed.

Qin Jiang withdrew his hand and let out an appreciative hum. "Beautifully pure energy. But there should be additional rewards too."

He looked up. A wisp of light streaked toward him and hovered—another strand of pure energy. Qin Jiang devoured it on the spot. The reward energy was identical to the sphere's.

"There seems to be a trace of Primordial Purple Qi mixed in, though it's very faint. Don't tell me someone diluted Primordial Purple Qi and distributed it through the tower as rewards?"

He murmured to himself as he advanced to the second stage. Another identical sphere—Qin Jiang devoured it without preamble.

Within minutes, he'd broken into the top ten thousand.

"The spheres are getting denser," he noted. He debated whether to skip ranks or fight his way through one by one. "Forget it, I'll skip. Not worth wasting time over a little energy."

From there, every challenge ended before the sphere could even form. No battles, just consumption.

Fifteen minutes later, he'd reached the top hundred.

Outside, the spectators were stupefied. Thanks to the tower's time differential, from their perspective, Qin Jiang had entered and virtually the next instant was already in the top hundred. Absurd.

Qin Lian'er and the others gaped, mouths hanging open.

"Monster!" Qin Lian'er whispered.

She'd thought that after all her brother's enhancements, her talent—while maybe not quite his equal—should at least be close. But now...

She'd been naive.

Inside the tower, past the hundredth rank, Qin Jiang slowed down. He stopped skipping and devoured his way through each opponent one by one.

At rank 69, he didn't immediately devour. He watched the sphere take shape—into Little Red's form, at Unity Realm power.

"Still can't take human form?" He eyed the bird-shaped Little Red with mild disappointment.

Then "Little Red" let out a piercing cry, flames dancing across her body as she grew larger and larger. Before his eyes, she transformed into a stunning woman in a crimson gown.

"Damn, Little Red's human form is a bombshell?"

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up.

The tower's "Little Red" had no intelligence—she was pure energy. After transforming, she immediately attacked. They tangled for a bit before Qin Jiang shook his head. "No real sensation at all."

He stopped holding back, activated the Taotie Divine Body, and devoured her.

From there, it was a steamroll. Until he reached "Qin Lian'er." Remembering how his little sister would occasionally act up, and since he couldn't bring himself to actually hit the real one, this energy construct made the perfect punching bag.

He gave "Qin Lian'er" a thorough beating, felt much better for it, and then devoured her too.

Outside the tower, Qin Lian'er and the others were riveted to his name. Nearly every heartbeat, he passed another rank. He'd only lingered slightly longer at Little Red and Qin Lian'er's positions.

"Big bro spent a really long time at my spot—did I actually give him trouble?" Qin Lian'er blinked. Her little heart swelled with pride. So she really was that strong!

The other women nodded in agreement.

But then Qin Jiang's pace returned to normal, and Qin Lian'er began to doubt herself. Had she really slowed him down?

"He probably just couldn't bear to hit me, so he wasted some time."

She settled on that explanation.

Inside the tower, Qin Jiang had reached rank 11. The top ten awaited.

Simultaneously, in a mysterious space somewhere, a figure who'd sat motionless as a statue suddenly opened his eyes, a flicker of interest crossing his face.

"The Myriad Realms Tower? How many years has it been since someone pushed for the top ten?"

He chuckled. "I wonder if this one can knock me out."

He seemed to be the tower's tenth-ranked occupant. His gaze pierced through endless time and space to observe the interior of the tower.

"Maybe I should go see for myself..."

But before he could finish the thought, his expression froze.

"What the hell?"

He swore aloud, face full of disbelief. He'd been knocked out. And from the start of the challenge to the finish? A few breaths. Not even the current number one could do that.

"Did the damn tower glitch?"

He couldn't believe it. In the myriad realms, he was a titan. Fewer than a few dozen could match him. His tower projection was a genuine reflection of his talent—and it had been instantly obliterated?

Impossible.

But the existential crisis wasn't his alone. Every other top-ten powerhouse—all pinnacle figures of the myriad realms—watched their tower projections get demolished in mere breaths. The shockwave rippled across countless realms.

Meanwhile, atop a mountain peak, an endless barrier stretched across the horizon. A white-robed man sat cross-legged, a Record Stone beside him displaying the Myriad Realms Tower rankings.

He looked at the name now occupying the summit—two characters radiating an authority that could suppress the entire myriad realms:

Qin Jiang.
