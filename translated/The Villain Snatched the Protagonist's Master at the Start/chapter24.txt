Figures appeared around the training grounds from every direction.

They stared at the devastation in shock. The rampaging energy kept them at a safe distance—they could only make out a single silhouette standing within the storm, like a god presiding over creation and destruction.

"Not bad at all."

Qin Jiang murmured.

This was his first time using Firmament Quake. It lived up to its billing as a Great Emperor technique—even at the entry level, the power was staggering. With it, he could cross realms to kill a Unity Realm cultivator without breaking a sweat.

He glanced down at the training grounds and smiled. He'd sensed Ye Lingtian's hostility from the moment he arrived at the Ye estate. Better to set the record straight now.

With a sweep of his arm, the raging energy dispersed.

The training grounds were completely demolished. Only the spot where Ye Lingtian stood remained intact—a small island of untouched stone amid total ruin. Ye Lingtian's body was rigid, not daring to move a muscle.

In the storm, he'd felt annihilating force brushing past him by inches, tearing everything apart. One wrong twitch and he'd have been caught in it.

"You alright there, Uncle Ye?"

Qin Jiang called down cheerfully.

Ye Lingtian looked up. The rigidity drained from his body as he slowly relaxed.

He stared at Qin Jiang, his face cycling between green and white.

Whatever else was true, he was Qin Jiang's future father-in-law. And he'd just been thoroughly trounced by his son-in-law.

"Ye Lingtian, what have you done?!"

A sharp voice cut through the silence.

Qin Jiang turned to see Ye Ling'er's mother and Ye Ling'er hurrying over, surveying the destruction with wide eyes before fixing accusing gazes squarely on Ye Lingtian.

Qin Jiang flickered to Ye Ling'er's side in an instant, the picture of injured innocence.

"Er...

"I was just having a little spar with Xiao Jiang."

Ye Lingtian managed a dry laugh.

"A spar?"

Ye Ling'er's mother glared daggers at him.

"You call this a little spar?! Look at this place! You're the elder here—have you no shame?!"

Ye Lingtian: "..."

"Xiao Jiang, are you hurt?"

Having dressed down her husband, she turned to Qin Jiang, her expression instantly softening.

She was quite fond of this young man.

Ye Ling'er grabbed Qin Jiang's hands and examined him carefully. Only when she confirmed he was uninjured did she relax.

Qin Jiang shook his head.

"I'm fine, Auntie. Uncle Ye's strength... isn't quite enough to hurt me."

"Good."

Ye Ling'er's mother smiled, then shot Ye Lingtian another withering look.

"If this old fool ever bullies you again, come tell Auntie. I'll deal with him."

"Will do~"

Qin Jiang nodded, then tossed Ye Lingtian a sly wink.

And just like that, a world where only Ye Lingtian suffered was complete.

He was brimming with grievances and had absolutely no one to tell.

They didn't linger at the training grounds. Qin Jiang fell in step with the two women, leaving as a trio. Ye Lingtian arranged for repairs, then trailed after them.

Among the four of them, he somehow felt like the outsider.

---

Several days passed.

Word of Qin Jiang's presence in Ye City spread rapidly. Ye Qingtian, who had been making moves, vanished back into the shadows. The tension hanging over Ye City eased considerably.

But Qin Jiang couldn't stay at the Ye estate forever.

The threat had to be eliminated proactively—rooted out and destroyed.

The Ye family understood this. They sent out operatives to track Ye Qingtian's whereabouts while simultaneously investigating which ancient clans were working against them.

Unfortunately, progress was slow.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang explored Ye City at his leisure. One day, he found himself standing before a casino.

"Rose Casino."

He read the sign, then strolled inside.

The place was alive with noise—crowds of every description shouting and hollering, the air thick with chaos.

But also with a primal energy that got the blood pumping.

Qin Jiang had never been to a place like this before.

"Young Lord, a casino is no place for someone of your stature. Don't let it become a distraction.

"Besides, this establishment is a den of snakes. Everyone here is a scoundrel. If the Young Lord wishes to play a few hands, please exercise caution."

Behind him, Black Dragon offered his quiet warning.

Qin Jiang waved him off.

"Relax.

"They call me the King of Gamblers—undefeated in every wager. I shall conquer this casino and lay waste to all challengers!"

Black Dragon's face twitched.

He knew Qin Jiang better than anyone. He'd been at the Young Lord's side since childhood, and he'd never once seen Qin Jiang gamble.

After watching for a while, Qin Jiang got the gist of the rules. Many of the games were similar to those back on Blue Star—just more sophisticated, since cultivators had sharper senses and reflexes.

Spiritual qi wasn't allowed at the tables, but plenty of clever techniques were still employed.

Qin Jiang was about to sit down when a commotion erupted.

He looked toward the source and narrowed his eyes.

On the staircase leading to the second floor, a bewitching figure was descending. Nearly every gambler in the room stopped to stare, panting like dogs.

The woman wore a loose scarlet gown that draped elegantly over her slender frame. Her neck was a perfect column of alabaster—the kind that made people forget how to swallow. But what truly captivated was the pair of dainty, bare feet peeking from beneath the hem, white as fine jade.

With each step, the gown swayed, revealing a flash of flawless calf that drew the eye like gravity.

She reached the bottom of the stairs, a bewitching smile painted on exquisite features. Her long hair hung loose, slightly damp as though she'd just bathed, clinging to her back and rendering the fabric of her gown faintly translucent.

She ignored the fevered stares entirely. Her beautiful eyes found Qin Jiang, and she curtsied gracefully.

"The great Young Lord Qin graces my humble establishment with his presence. This lowly woman failed to greet you at the door—please forgive the slight."

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

"Blood Rose, indeed. I only just walked in, and you've already identified me. Not bad at all."

At his words, Blood Rose froze, her pupils contracting sharply. She'd recognized Qin Jiang because he was famous—every faction in the region had been warned about his arrival, with strict orders not to provoke him.

But for Qin Jiang to recognize her...

That meant he'd specifically investigated her.

Why? What did he want? Or was it the forces behind her that interested him...

Any of those possibilities sent a chill down her spine.

She rallied her composure, put on a coquettish smile, and stepped closer—close enough to nearly press against him.

"The Young Lord flatters me. This humble woman is merely an admirer who instructed her people to watch for your arrival. I possess no particular talents."

"That so?"

Qin Jiang's lips curved. 'A dish served on a silver platter—why refuse?'

He slipped an arm around her waist. He felt her body tense, then quickly go pliant.

"Since you're such an admirer, shouldn't you show me some appreciation?"

He teased, one arm encircling her waist while his other hand tilted her chin upward. The intensity in his gaze made her eyelashes flutter.
