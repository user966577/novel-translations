Qin Jiang kept his word. Both hands, sealed.

His eyes, however, remained wide open and thoroughly appreciative.

Li Qingqiu's expression was neutral. Qin Jiang was already in the water. She hesitated, glanced at him, then undressed and stepped in.

The moment she entered, she submerged to her chin, only her face breaking the surface. Dark hair fanned across the water. She glided toward him, stopping at arm's length, and rose just enough to bare her shoulders. The modesty was somewhat undermined by the crystal clarity of the water, which concealed nothing. If anything, the rippling surface made the view more alluring.

"So pale," Qin Jiang murmured approvingly.

She'd grown used to his staring. It barely registered anymore. She floated in comfortable silence, occasionally trailing her fingers through the water. Her original plan had been revenge — return everything he'd done to her — but on reflection, doing so would only reward him. Better to simply enjoy the bath.

His hands were sealed. He couldn't cause trouble. Li Qingqiu closed her eyes, serene and relaxed.

Then Qin Jiang pressed against her side. She gave him a flat look but didn't bother moving. Fine. He could lean. As long as his hands stayed sealed.

He leaned his head, and his lips brushed her cheek. She didn't resist — they'd kissed so many times by now, it hardly mattered. And it felt nice, actually.

He nuzzled lower. His head dipped beneath the surface.

Li Qingqiu yelped, hands darting to catch him. "Don't—"

Too late. She tried to haul him back up — no luck. He had no intention of surfacing. The view was better down here. And there were certain delicacies to be sampled.

Before long, Li Qingqiu was pressed against the pool's edge, face flushed, body taut. One hand covered her mouth, suppressing every sound. When he finally surfaced, she looked at him through half-lidded eyes and exhaled a long, shuddering breath.

He unsealed his hands, pulled her into his arms, and smiled. "How was that?"

She shook her head softly and nestled into his chest. No words — just the quiet aftermath. Inside, she was still savoring the sensation. Addictive was the word.

But something felt incomplete. She glanced down. Perhaps what was missing was the real thing.

She caught herself. *No.* What was she thinking? She was supposed to be resisting. How had she started looking *forward* to it?

Absolutely not. She couldn't fall. Not like this — not when he still treated her like a plaything.

Her resolve lasted exactly as long as it took for his newly freed hands to find their marks. Several days of practice had perfected his map of her, and his aim was devastating.

She bit her lip. The previous sensation hadn't fully faded, and now fresh waves layered on top. Her body melted against his chest. She gazed up at him, lips parted, eyes hazy.

He kissed her. She kissed back without thinking, arms winding around his neck, pressing herself flush against him.

Then a spike of intensity — her teeth clamped down on his lip.

She blinked, mortified, and jerked away. Her cheeks blazed. His blood glistened on her mouth.

"Ow—" Qin Jiang winced, touching his lip. He looked at her with exaggerated hurt. "That was vicious. Look at this bite mark — I'm bleeding everywhere."

"I..." She stared at the clear tooth-print. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to — it was just—"

Too intense. Her body had reacted before her mind could intervene.

He drew her close, scooping her up effortlessly. "You bit me that hard. I think some concrete compensation is in order."

"What do you want?"

She inspected the wound. It really was deep — the more intense the moment, the harder she'd bitten.

Qin Jiang cradled her with one arm and tapped his injured lip with the other, pouting theatrically. Li Qingqiu blinked. "What?"

"Kiss me." He pinched her cheek.

She hesitated. Just a kiss? That was the compensation? He was surprisingly easy to appease.

Cheeks still warm, she cupped his face and leaned in. He pulled back slightly. "No biting this time."

"Hold still!" She rolled her eyes. It wasn't on purpose — and it was entirely *his* fault for overstimulating her.

She pressed her lips to his. When she drew back, her tongue darted out and traced gently across his wound.
