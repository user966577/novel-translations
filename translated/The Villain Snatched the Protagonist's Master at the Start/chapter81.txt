"I understand." Qin Jiang nodded solemnly. "I'll take some of the love I have for you and redistribute it."

"Don't you dare!" Liu Shuwan's brows shot up, her eyes blazing.

Even angry, she was beautiful. Qin Jiang couldn't resist teasing her. "Relax. I'll do it subtly—you won't even notice."

"You—! You jerk! No! You're not allowed to share!"

Liu Shuwan puffed out her cheeks, which was oddly adorable.

Qin Jiang spread his hands innocently. "If I don't share, what am I supposed to do? I feel terrible shortchanging the other girls."

"I don't care! You can't take from my share! Otherwise I'll... I'll bite you to death!"

She bared her teeth at him threateningly.

Qin Jiang was about to continue the teasing when he noticed tears welling in her eyes, glistening with hurt.

"You can't take from mine!" she repeated.

He'd gone too far. Cursing himself silently, he pulled her into a tight embrace. "Wan'er, I was joking. Don't cry..."

"Hmph!" She sniffled loudly, and he gently wiped the tears from her cheeks.

It took quite a while to coax her back to calm. His own fault entirely.

"You promised—no sharing! Or I'll bite you to death!" she warned again.

"Even if I wanted to, I couldn't control my own heart. It's too biased toward you. Won't even listen to me," he said with a grin.

"Good."

Liu Shuwan placed her small hand over his chest, resting her head against it, feeling his heartbeat. A contented, relieved smile spread across her face.

After soothing Liu Shuwan and waiting for Bai Susu to wake up for another round of affection, Qin Jiang finally left the residence.

"I wonder how my buddy Lin Chen's been doing lately," he muttered.

Asking around, he found his way to Lin Chen's quarters—only to find Bai Jingyun there instead.

"Uncle Bai, what are you doing here?"

Bai Jingyun's face twitched. The sight of Qin Jiang now made him uneasy. He took a deep breath to steady himself. "Nephew, what brings you—"

"Oh, I'm looking for Lin Chen. Thought we'd catch up."

Bai Jingyun's mouth twitched. 'Catch up?' As if. He wasn't about to call Qin Jiang out, but he wasn't fooled either. Hadn't he already beaten Lin Chen half to death? And he still wasn't done?

Fortunately...

"Ahem, nephew, Lin Chen left the Holy Sword Sect last night. He went out for field training."

Bai Jingyun was secretly pleased with himself. He'd anticipated that Qin Jiang wouldn't leave Lin Chen alone, so the previous night, he'd sent Lin Chen away on a training mission.

"Left?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. His suspicious gaze swept over Bai Jingyun. The old father-in-law's attitude had certainly shifted—first begging him to come, now desperate to see him go.

"He really left. Want to check his room?" Bai Jingyun gestured toward the quarters.

Qin Jiang clicked his tongue. "Forget it. Since Lin Chen's not here, I suppose I'll get going too."

"Really?" Bai Jingyun was overjoyed.

Qin Jiang's expression darkened. Bai Jingyun caught himself and quickly rearranged his face into one of deep sorrow. "Nephew, you've barely spent any time at our sect. Why not stay a bit longer?"

"All right."

"Uh..."

Bai Jingyun's face spasmed. He wanted to slap himself. Qin Jiang was about to leave on his own—why did he have to play the gracious host? He'd brought this on himself.

With Lin Chen gone, there was no point lingering. Better to go home and enjoy time with his wives.

On the way back, Qin Jiang called out, "Black Dragon!"

A figure materialized before him instantly—Black Dragon. Since refining the Ancestral Dragon Blood Essence, his cultivation had advanced at a meteoric pace. He'd already reached the peak of Unity Realm.

"Young Master," Black Dragon said respectfully.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Track down Lin Chen's whereabouts, then send word to the Qin family. Have a Supreme Realm cultivator tail him. Whatever he buys, seize it. Whatever lucky encounter he stumbles into, take it. Everything of his goes to the Qin family. Understood?"

"Yes."

Black Dragon was about to leave when Qin Jiang called him back. "Actually, send two Supremes. One man, one woman. If Lin Chen takes a liking to any beauty, snatch her for me too."

Black Dragon's lips moved. He wanted to advise Qin Jiang to practice some restraint—his health mattered, after all. But in the end, he simply nodded.

Don't ask. Don't look. Don't advise. Those were his principles, and the reason he'd lasted this long at Qin Jiang's side. Anyone else would have been replaced ages ago.

With arrangements made, Qin Jiang returned to his residence to enjoy life to the fullest.

Meanwhile, the Holy Sword Sect rapidly spread word of Liu Shuwan's Sword Heart breakthrough and dispatched agents to guide public opinion, aiming to establish the sect as a swordsmanship holy land. If successful, their strength would surge.

What no one knew, however, was that the Holy Sword Sect—seemingly at the height of its glory—was quietly suffering. Everyone could feel Sword Valley's power fading. Before long, it would vanish entirely, and with it, a massive chunk of the sect's foundation.

The leadership was hurting.

Their only hope of recovering the losses was to successfully brand themselves as a swordsmanship holy land, but that was proving far more difficult than anticipated. At the current pace, it would take years.

And there was another issue. Important, yet not critically so.

After word of Liu Shuwan's Sword Heart breakthrough spread, many prodigies from six thousand years ago received the news. Quite a few had once pursued her. Back then, Liu Shuwan had declared she wouldn't consider romance until she achieved Sword Heart. Now that she had, these ancient powerhouses emerged from seclusion one after another, hoping to resume their courtship.

Her allure was undeniable—millennia later, and they still hadn't forgotten her.

Qin Jiang himself had been captivated by that same magnetism. A woman like that—if he didn't make her his, he'd regret it for the rest of his life.

Fortunately, Qin Jiang had succeeded. As for the others, if they were smart, they'd merely nurse their disappointment and move on. But if they were foolish enough to press the matter... then this lifetime was all they had left.

Qin Jiang's tolerance for such things was razor-thin. He had the means to eliminate every last irritant, and he wouldn't hesitate.
