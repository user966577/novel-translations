Qin Jiang smiled faintly, and a subtle aura emanated from within him. Unlike when he'd dealt with Sun Yang and Wang Chao, this time his energy was calm and gentle—though the pressure still made Liu Shuwan's body tremble slightly.

With a beautiful woman, one should be gentle. Roughness was reserved for nighttime.

Seeing Liu Shuwan's paling complexion, Qin Jiang hesitated briefly, then took her hand. She flinched, about to pull away. "Don't move!" he said firmly.

Under his precise control, sword energy flowed into Liu Shuwan's body. Qin Jiang frowned—she had accumulated considerable internal damage from her attempts to force her way into the deepest reaches of Sword Valley. Left unchecked, these injuries would become serious. His gentle sword energy coursed through her, purging the residual power Sword Valley had left behind—power that Liu Shuwan's own comprehension couldn't hope to clear. Only Sword Heart-level energy could do this.

Liu Shuwan's body went rigid the moment Qin Jiang took her hand. Her other fist clenched tight, a blush creeping across her cheeks. She was just about to yank her hand free when she noticed what he was doing—clearing the lingering sword energy from her body. That energy had tormented her for ages, and now, under Qin Jiang's power, it was steadily receding.

About half an hour later, Qin Jiang released her hand and took a deep breath. "There's too much residual energy from Sword Valley in your body. I can't fully remove it in one session."

"Oh..." Liu Shuwan murmured, looking away.

"But don't worry—I won't leave until it's all cleared."

Liu Shuwan nodded again, though her brows furrowed and her body tensed even more. After a long silence, she finally spoke. "Could you... let go of my hand now?"

"Huh?" Qin Jiang gave her hand a couple of squeezes before reluctantly releasing it.

Liu Shuwan immediately pulled her hand back, shooting him an annoyed glare. He'd held her hand—fine—but did he have to keep rubbing it? 'Little hooligan!' she cursed internally.

Qin Jiang acted as if nothing had happened, casually surveying the room. "Your internal injuries need at least two weeks to fully heal. I'll be staying here during that time."

"What?" Liu Shuwan glanced around the room—particularly at the stone bed she occasionally slept in—and shook her head vigorously. "No, absolutely not."

A man and woman alone together, in this cramped space? And she was quite certain Qin Jiang was a shameless rogue. If she let him stay, he'd definitely take liberties.

Her refusal, of course, meant nothing to Qin Jiang. He stood, walked over to the stone bed, and announced, "I'm a bit tired. Let me rest first." Before Liu Shuwan could react, he flopped onto the bed, grabbed her pink silk blanket, and pulled it over himself. He made himself right at home.

Liu Shuwan stood frozen. This guy wasn't just a hooligan—he was completely shameless! She strode over on her long legs and seized her blanket. "Get up! Stop using my blanket!"

"Hehe, it smells nice." Qin Jiang grinned, and Liu Shuwan's face turned scarlet.

He clutched the blanket while she tugged at a corner, the two of them locked in a staring contest. In the end, Liu Shuwan caved. She bit down on her silver teeth. "Fine—you can stay here, but give me back my blanket!"

"No!"

"You..."

"I'll give it back on one condition..."

"What?"

Qin Jiang's appraising gaze swept over her, and he broke into a mischievous grin. Liu Shuwan immediately dropped the blanket, backed away, and eyed him warily. In Sword Valley, against someone with Sword Heart, she might not be able to escape.

Seeing her vigilance, Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. "I won't hold the blanket—but I want to hold you instead."

"You... hooligan!" Liu Shuwan's face burned crimson.

But faced with his brazenness, she was helpless. With a cold huff, she stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind her.

Qin Jiang blinked. "Abandoned her own home?"

Outside, Liu Shuwan grew angrier the more she thought about it. This was her room—why had she been the one to leave? She should have thrown Qin Jiang out! With that thought, she marched back inside. She'd planned to kick him out, but seeing him lounging there, her resolve faltered. She found herself saying, somewhat pitifully, "You can have the blanket, but you're not allowed to harass me."

"Deal." Qin Jiang agreed instantly—not that his word meant anything. What he promised one second, he could break the next. Zero guilt.

Liu Shuwan, however, breathed a sigh of relief. Surely a Sword Emperor would keep his word? She settled onto her meditation cushion, closed her eyes, and began cultivating.

Qin Jiang wasn't in any hurry to sleep either. He lay on his side watching her, tossing out the occasional comment, which made Liu Shuwan feel like she had needles in her back. She couldn't focus at all.

"Would you stop staring at me?" She opened her eyes, exasperation and a hint of irritation written across her face.

Qin Jiang nodded and looked away. He was genuinely tired—purging her internal injuries had drained considerable energy. Before long, his breathing steadied.

Liu Shuwan finally relaxed and resumed her cultivation.

The next day, Liu Shuwan opened her eyes to find an enormous face mere inches from her own.

"Ahh!" she shrieked, instinctively swinging a palm at him.

Qin Jiang flinched and caught her hand. Only then did she register who it was.

"Qin Jiang, why are you so close to me?!" she demanded, flushed with embarrassment. She was absolutely certain that if she hadn't woken up in time, this little hooligan would have kissed her. And then she noticed Qin Jiang licking his lips, as if savoring something.

Liu Shuwan's face went rigid. She touched her own lips instinctively. "You..."

She stared at him in disbelief. It wasn't that he'd been about to kiss her—he already had.

"Qin Jiang, you rotten hooligan!!!"

A piercing scream echoed through the room. In her fury, Liu Shuwan snatched up her meditation cushion and hurled it at him. To her dismay, Qin Jiang's eyes lit up as he caught it and tucked it away.

"A reward? I'll gladly accept."

A reward? Liu Shuwan's body trembled, her face burning. Her voice shook. "Hooligan... pervert!"

She wanted to pounce on him and beat him senseless, but she was afraid he'd count that as another reward. She could only fume helplessly, repeating those two words over and over—without an ounce of real threat behind them.
