Fifteen years remained until the Heavenly Domain opened.

Qing Chan successfully broke through to Immortal King. Her pressure blanketed all of Mystic Cloud Heaven for a full six months. Huaxia's second Immortal King was born!

The news swept across the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands in no time. Every major faction fell silent. One Immortal King was already enough to steamroll the entire world. Two meant any thought of resistance was pure fantasy.

What shocked them even more was the parade of experts who emerged to offer congratulations—Huaxia had over fifty True Immortals, and Human Immortals beyond counting. Most of them, critically, had only achieved their breakthroughs after joining Huaxia.

That detail set minds racing. Who didn't want to grow stronger? If Huaxia truly had the ability to nurture powerhouses, then perhaps joining wasn't such a bad idea. The only question was whether it was too late.

Their worries were unnecessary.

After the celebrations, Huaxia's forces didn't disperse—they turned their gaze outward. And then, like a wave, they surged toward every Heaven not yet under Huaxia's banner.

Qing Chan's breakthrough was the signal.

It was time to unify the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

The still-independent Heavens suddenly found Huaxia powerhouses descending upon them—brazen, arrogant, irresistible. Every one of them carried True Spirit Slave Seals bestowed by Qin Jiang. This was a forced takeover, pure and simple. The latecomers naturally wouldn't enjoy the same terms as the founding members.

The major factions resisted at first, but the combined deterrent of two Immortal Kings left them no choice. They submitted to the True Spirit Slave Seal.

Those who resisted were killed on the spot, their clans exterminated to the last. Not even True Immortals were spared.

In just one year, the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands were virtually unified. Every significant power had pledged allegiance to Huaxia. Only scattered remnants—survivors of clans Huaxia had destroyed—still lurked in the shadows, dreaming of toppling the new order.

Their efforts were like mayflies trying to shake a tree—utterly futile.

What did surprise Qin Jiang was that some of these fugitives turned out to be Children of Destiny. But based on the Villain Points they generated, their fortune was a far cry from Li Yang, Nangong Yun, and Wu Tian.

He couldn't be bothered to deal with them personally. Black Dragon and Little Xu were dispatched to handle things—those two were reliable.

As for Qin Jiang himself, he had more pressing matters. With the unification came mountains of administrative work for the women, so it fell to him to help them unwind.

They were working hard, after all. It was only right.

He shuttled between them—massaging one's shoulders, kneading another's feet, serving water, hand-feeding spiritual fruit. And of course, most evenings were spoken for.

From dawn to dusk, there wasn't a moment's rest. They summoned him left and right like a well-trained attendant.

"Little Jiang, my hand hurts~"

"Coming~"

"Little Jiang, my feet are sore. Come rub them~"

"On it~"

"Little Jiang, come keep me company tonight~"

"Heh, coming, coming~"

This went on for another half-year before Huaxia finally stabilized and the workload eased. Most of the day-to-day had been delegated, leaving only major decisions requiring Qin Jiang's input.

That day, after attending to Liu Shuwan, Qin Jiang lay in bed with her draped across his chest. She looked up at him.

"The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands are unified now, but the sense of belonging is still weak. If any crisis hits, the whole thing could fall apart."

"True," Qin Jiang agreed, meeting her gaze. "What do you suggest, Wan'er?"

"Huaxia Academy needs to expand enrollment."

Qin Jiang smiled, kissed her lightly, and said, "Smart girl. The old-timers are hard to win over emotionally—but they can be controlled by force, so loyalty isn't strictly necessary. The real key is the younger generation. Huaxia Academy's entire purpose is cultivating them. If we recruit the top young talents from every region and train them here, they'll grow up grateful to Huaxia. Their loyalty will run deep. Once they mature and replace the old guard, that's when Huaxia will be at its zenith."

"You planned this all along, didn't you?"

"Heh, that was the whole point of building the academy."

Originally it was meant to consolidate Azure Cloud Heaven. Now the scope had simply... expanded.

"Before, the admission standards were quite strict," Liu Shuwan noted. "Should we relax them?"

Qin Jiang nodded. "Definitely. The academy has been expanded enough to accommodate a hundred thousand students. As much as possible, every faction under Huaxia should have representation."

The first round's strict criteria had served two purposes: finding Children of Destiny and selecting Heavenly Domain candidates. But now, that first cohort had grown. Years of training and ideological conditioning had forged unwavering loyalty. Those students alone were enough for the vanguard.

Besides, after the Heavenly Domain opened, they wouldn't be the only ones entering. Veteran powerhouses had their own geniuses to bring. And naturally, some of Huaxia's strength had to remain behind—couldn't risk getting their home base raided.

Liu Shuwan nodded. "Shall I start making arrangements?"

"No rush," Qin Jiang said, pulling her close, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. "Let me reward Wan'er properly first."

"Oh, stop it~"

"Wan'er~" His tone turned almost wheedling, and Liu Shuwan's heart softened.

She shot him a look, then wrapped her arms around his neck. "Fine, fine. I can never say no to you."

"Heh, a proper reward will give Wan'er the motivation she needs."

"I don't need motivation."

"I know Wan'er's just being stubborn."

Qin Jiang tapped her lips with a finger, then leaned down to kiss her.

After a long while, he pulled back and gazed at her with an expression of utter tenderness. If he was being honest with himself, Liu Shuwan was the first woman to truly capture his heart—and to this day, the one he loved most.

She'd done so much for him, quietly and without complaint. She managed both Huaxia and his personal affairs, shouldering everything without a word of grievance. She'd get a little jealous now and then, throw the occasional small tantrum—but a single hug, a single kiss from him, and she'd melt every time.
