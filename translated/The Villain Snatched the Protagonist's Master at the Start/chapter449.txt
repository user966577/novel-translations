Qin Jiang hurried forward to steady Mu Yunxiao, his voice laced with concern. "Is Mother-in-law tired? Shall I help you back to your room to rest?"

"N-No, that's alright." She waved him off hastily.

She studied his face, uncertain of his intentions, and didn't dare say the wrong thing. But being held by him made her deeply uncomfortable. She had the distinct impression that his hands were creeping — testing her boundaries, inch by inch.

Her face reddened. She shifted her weight, and finally spoke up. "I'm fine now. You don't need to hold me."

If this went on much longer, she was fairly certain his hands would reach her actual "bottom line."

Weiwei was still worried. "Master, are you really okay?"

"Mm~" Mu Yunxiao nodded, though her voice came out strangely breathy, her cheeks rosier than before.

She couldn't wait any longer. Identity or no identity, she wrenched free of Qin Jiang's supporting arm. He raised an eyebrow but didn't pursue. His fingers rubbed together as he watched her retreat, then he smiled.

"Don't worry — Mother-in-law is perfectly fine."

Not just fine — positively vigorous, in fact. He'd figured that out the moment his hands made contact.

Weiwei relaxed and turned to him. "Husband, do you have many fire-attribute spirit medicines?"

"Plenty. Should be more than enough for Mother-in-law. And if I run short, I can have more delivered instantly."

He addressed Mu Yunxiao directly. "Do you need them urgently?"

"Not... not really," she said quietly.

She didn't want to accept anything from Qin Jiang. Nothing in this world came free — everything had a price. And judging by the way he'd been looking at her, she knew exactly what he wanted. If she took his medicine, the next payment he demanded might be herself.

As for Weiwei, she still couldn't tell whether her disciple knew Qin Jiang's true identity. She didn't dare ask openly — better to tread carefully. Especially with the Anti-Huaxia Alliance in the picture. Who knew how Qin Jiang felt about it?

Beyond his reputation as a lech, Qin Jiang was known across the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands for his ruthless brutality. If he were in a bad mood, he might... deal with their whole group in the worst possible order.

The thought made her shiver. 'Scary...'

That was another reason she lived as a hermit — she was simply timid by nature. Though for someone so timid, taking in a fugitive on Huaxia's kill list showed a peculiar kind of courage. Perhaps she too had been affected by the protagonist halo's intelligence debuff.

"Not urgent, then." Qin Jiang rubbed his chin. "In that case, I have a method that might permanently fix your body's condition. I'll just need some time to prepare."

"Really?" Weiwei's eyes lit up. She threw herself at Qin Jiang, arms around his neck, and kissed him. "Husband, you're amazing!"

"Naturally!"

Nearby, Mu Yunxiao watched with faint surprise. For her reserved disciple to show such affection so publicly — Qin Jiang must treat her well.

He kissed Weiwei's forehead, then turned to her master. "Would you like to try my method?"

"Could you... tell me what it is?"

Her body's condition had plagued her for years. If there was truly a permanent cure, she was willing to make sacrifices.

"I can't say just yet." He shook his head. "But once I'm ready, you'll understand. Whether to go through with it will be entirely your choice."

"...Alright."

He produced a pile of fire-attribute spirit medicines and set them before her. "These should stabilize your spiritual energy for now."

Mu Yunxiao hesitated, wrestling with herself. She was in rough shape — while she could manage without them, the medicines would bring real relief. But she feared what Qin Jiang might demand in return.

Then again, even if she refused, she had no real power to resist him. And he'd already promised to fix her permanently — compared to that, a few medicines were trivial.

"Thank you~" she said softly, persuading herself.

She gathered the medicines, made her excuses, and retreated to her room to rebalance her ice and fire attributes. Qin Jiang and the others settled in, with Weiwei arranging accommodations.

Meanwhile, back at the Anti-Huaxia Alliance, Nangong Yun arrived at Weiwei's courtyard. He saw the overturned barrel of spirit liquid and scowled — his hard-won gift, wasted.

He suppressed his anger and waited at the gate. Today they were supposed to return to see their master together.

He waited from morning until night. The gate never opened.

Just as he was about to give up, an alliance disciple passed by. "Alliance Leader, are you looking for the Vice Leader?"

"Yes."

"I saw her leave this morning with that gentleman and his group."

Nangong Yun went rigid. "You're saying... she left? This morning?"

"That's right."

He stared at nothing. Slowly, he tilted his head back, fighting to keep the tears from falling. He'd been waiting here all day, and she'd left without him.

'How heartbreaking.' (╥_╥)
