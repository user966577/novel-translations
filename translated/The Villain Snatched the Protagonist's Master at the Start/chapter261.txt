Through the haze, Chen Baizhe felt something heavy pressing against her. She frowned, lifted a hand, and rubbed her throbbing forehead. She'd drunk far too much—even now, her head ached and her throat was parched. Her body felt leaden, and certain places she couldn't quite identify were... sore.

Beyond the soreness, there was another sensation. Something unfamiliar.

She shifted slightly and froze. The heaviness wasn't her own body. It was—

Her eyes flew open. A familiar, devastatingly handsome face hovered inches from hers. His eyes were gently closed, his breathing even. He was asleep.

"Qin Jiang..."

She whispered his name, her body trembling. Instantly, she unsealed her cultivation and purged the alcohol from her system. Her senses sharpened to razor clarity.

Her face went scarlet. Her body shook as fragmented memories surged forward—but everything past a certain point in the evening was a blank. She had no recollection of what had happened after she blacked out.

Not that she needed one. The alcohol was gone from her system, but she'd discovered that it wasn't the only thing Qin Jiang had left behind.

As she trembled, the man atop her seemed to stir.

"Qin Jiang!" she cried.

She wanted to fling him across the room, but looking at his face, something in her softened. She couldn't bring herself to hurt him. Gritting her teeth, she settled for slapping his chest. "Wake up!"

"Stop it..." He caught her hand without opening his eyes, pulled her close with his other arm, and buried his face in her hair.

Chen Baizhe went rigid. She could feel that he was wide awake—or at least, parts of him were. His body had begun moving of its own accord, and she found herself unable to move, pinned in his embrace. Her face burned.

How long it went on, she couldn't say. Her lips parted, her body shuddering, her fingers digging into Qin Jiang's back.

He opened his eyes at last, meeting hers.

"Baizhe?"

He blinked, feigning surprise. Her face was impossibly red. She looked away and, with a small swat, managed: "Are you going to get off me or not?"

"I—"

He looked down, then exploded in theatrical outrage. "Baizhe Immortal! I never imagined you were this kind of person!"

"???"

She stared, completely blindsided.

He wasn't finished. "I was being kind! You seemed upset, so I came to drink with you out of the goodness of my heart. But you—you took advantage of me while I was drunk! You did this to me! Chen Baizhe, I misjudged you!"

His voice trembled with indignation. Chen Baizhe, the supposed perpetrator, had gone entirely blank. Her mind buzzed. Her eyes were dazed. She'd even forgotten to feel ashamed or aggrieved.

"Qin Jiang, I didn't—"

"You're going to deny it?" His eyes blazed. "I see it all clearly now! Yesterday, I kept telling you to stop drinking. You wouldn't listen. You insisted I keep you company. You weren't drunk at all, were you? The whole thing was a ploy to get me intoxicated so you could have your way with me! Chen Baizhe, you... you're far more cunning than I gave you credit for. I, Qin Jiang, sharp as a blade my whole life, made one foolish mistake—and it was trusting you! How could you do this? After everything I've done for you? After the feelings I've shown you? You've truly disappointed me."

Chen Baizhe's eyes swam with bewilderment. What exactly had happened? What had she done to him? Had she really... taken advantage of Qin Jiang? But he had how many women? Was this level of outrage really warranted? She was the one having her first time here!

She was the victim!

"Sigh. Judging by your face, I know you're going to make excuses." Qin Jiang struck preemptively, cutting off her protest before it could form. "Qing Chan, Xue'er, Yao Yao, Mo Mo... my darlings, I'm so sorry. I've always upheld my principle—no love, no crossing the line. But this time... this time, I failed."

He fixed Chen Baizhe with his most wounded expression. "It was this woman. She got me drunk and stole my innocence. I've failed all of you. I'm... I'm not pure anymore."

He tried to squeeze out a tear—and failed entirely. But the anguished words did their work. Chen Baizhe was second-guessing herself now.

'No love, no crossing the line'—was that really his creed? If so, then she...

She looked at his aggrieved face and felt a stab of guilt. What a beautiful principle. And she'd shattered it.

In a way, she'd stolen Qin Jiang's innocence.

"I—"

Before she could finish, Qin Jiang interrupted with all the dignity of a wronged maiden. "Don't say anything. Let's pretend today never happened. I'll make it up to Qing Chan and the others."

He stood—and the sound that accompanied his departure made Chen Baizhe's face burn even deeper. He dressed with an air of wounded nobility, then turned to leave.

"Wait."

He rubbed his eyes—from behind, it looked like he was wiping away tears. Seeing this, her guilt intensified.

He turned back, expression pained. "What more do you want? If you're thinking of forcing yourself on me again, I'll die first!"

"Don't! I—last night, I was drunk too. I don't know how things..." She trailed off, face crimson. Part of her felt wronged as well—her own purity was gone. But no one was comforting her. Instead, she was the one consoling Qin Jiang.

She had to be strong.

He was talking about ending his life. His emotions were on the verge of collapse. She couldn't add to the chaos.

Taking a deep breath, she tried to stand. Her brows knit instantly, and she sucked in a sharp breath through her teeth. She nearly crumpled. Qin Jiang caught her reflexively but kept his expression frosty.

She laughed bitterly. In hindsight, she should never have touched the wine. The stuff was genuinely dangerous.

He tilted his head, retrieved a garment from the bed, and draped it around her shoulders before turning back to face her with cold formality. "It was your first time. Even as a Human Immortal, you should rest."

Her gaze softened. After everything, he was still concerned about her. Perhaps even more attentive than her brother would have been.
