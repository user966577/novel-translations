Outside the room, Qin Jiang and Xue Yue stopped a short distance down the corridor.

"Ahem. Yue-yue, what were you doing in there?"

Qin Jiang cleared his throat.

Xue Yue gave him a withering look and huffed. "She's my mother. Is there a problem with me visiting?"

"..."

Xue Yue being there was perfectly natural. It was Qin Jiang's presence that was questionable.

Of course, Xue Yue had known about them for a while. This wasn't really a question.

"Is my mother still refusing to come clean?"

Qin Jiang shrugged. "Given your relationship, you think she'd accept it easily? Let's just let it be for now."

"Is it because she can't accept it, or because sneaking around feeds your twisted little kink?"

Xue Yue eyed him with deep suspicion. She had a strong feeling this man was using Murong Qing's reluctance as a convenient excuse for his own perversions.

"Am I really that twisted?"

"Yes."

"..."

Qin Jiang paused. Fine, maybe he did enjoy the thrill of it a little. But Murong Qing genuinely wasn't ready. If she were, the idea of mother and daughter together held considerable appeal.

"Whatever. Do what you want. Just don't hurt my mother."

Xue Yue waved her hand dismissively.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. "Of course. I'd never hurt any of my beauties."

"Pervert."

Xue Yue pouted, then glanced back toward her mother's room. "Are you going back?"

"Shall I?"

Qin Jiang's eyebrow arched. He pulled Xue Yue against him with a roguish grin. "If you'd rather, we could go to your room."

"No way~"

Xue Yue's cheeks pinked. "I haven't recovered yet," she said quietly. "Go see my mother. She's probably been missing you."

She rose on tiptoe to kiss him lightly, then patted his chest. "Go on. But take it easy on her, all right?"

"I know."

Qin Jiang smiled. Looking at Xue Yue's face, he stole another kiss before releasing her. He pinched her cheek. "I'll head over, then. Get some rest."

"Mm~"

Watching Xue Yue head off, Qin Jiang waited until she was out of sight. If Murong Qing saw them together, she'd likely guess that Xue Yue knew everything.

He cleared his throat and knocked.

"Mother-in-law~"

This time, the door opened almost immediately. Murong Qing had changed into something new—something light and diaphanous, nearly transparent. She'd clearly been expecting him.

Standing in the doorway, Qin Jiang was momentarily transfixed.

Cheeks flushed, Murong Qing grabbed his hand and pulled him inside, shutting the door behind them.

Her eyes were heavy with desire. Slender arms encircled his neck, and she pressed a searing kiss to his lips.

Qin Jiang was only too happy to oblige. He wrapped his arms around her waist, dipping his head to match her fervor.

When their lips finally parted, Murong Qing remained pressed against him.

"Hehe, did Qing'er miss me that much?"

Murong Qing shot him a reproachful look. "How many days has it been?"

"I've been busy."

"Hmph. Busy with 'training.'"

"Ahem..."

Qin Jiang laughed sheepishly, settled into a chair, and pulled her onto his lap. "How about... you join in next time?"

"No~"

Murong Qing shook her head. Without Xue Yue in the picture, she might consider it. But the thought of facing her daughter...

She still couldn't bring herself to cross that line.

Qin Jiang sighed, kissed her cheek, and said, "If you don't join the sessions, our time together will get even shorter."

Conflict flickered in Murong Qing's eyes. After a brief silence, she said, "Let me think about it."

"Take your time."

Qin Jiang cupped her face gently. "No matter what, I'll never neglect you."

"Mm~"

Murong Qing lifted her gaze. The tip of her tongue traced her lips, her eyes swimming with longing. These past days with Qin Jiang, he was all she'd thought about. She'd nearly gone to find him herself, but he'd always been occupied.

Now, finally, he was here.

"Yue-yue went back?"

"Don't worry." Qin Jiang smiled. "Training wore her out—she still hasn't fully recovered. She won't be coming by anytime soon."

"You brute. Can't you be gentler with her? Even I could see how exhausted she was."

"That's hardly my fault." Qin Jiang spread his hands innocently. "During training, Yue-yue was the one taking the initiative. I was just going along with it."

"Really?"

"Of course. Want me to... demonstrate what it was like?"

Qin Jiang winked.

Murong Qing reddened. She braced her hands against his shoulders. "Then demonstrate."

"Gladly."

Qin Jiang grinned, scooped her up, and carried her to the bed.

"Ready?"

"Mm~"

Murong Qing nodded. They settled in together, and she asked, "How was Yue-yue taking the initiative?"

Qin Jiang chuckled, lay back, and gave her a meaningful look.

Understanding dawned. Murong Qing leaned forward, her sultry gaze trailing downward.

"Like this?"

"Spot on."

Qin Jiang praised. Murong Qing rolled her eyes, then swept her hair aside.

"Shall I begin?"

"Please."

She started her reenactment. It wasn't truly a reenactment—but the enthusiasm was identical. Qin Jiang stroked her hair, closed his eyes, and simply enjoyed.

Some time later, Murong Qing lifted her head and collapsed against his chest. He opened his eyes and held her.

Face scarlet, cheek pressed to his chest, she parted her lips. "Darling... let's start."

That had been merely the appetizer. The main course awaited.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded, drawing her close.

"Your wish is my command."
