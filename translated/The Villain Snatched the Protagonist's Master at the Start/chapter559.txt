The Level One Domain captives watched these bandit-like antics with twitching faces. Thinking about their own reckless attack made them want to crawl into a hole.

What had they been thinking, picking a fight with these people? They should have been grateful not to be targeted.

But regret wouldn't turn back time. All they could do was guide the fleet obediently and hope to survive—maybe even profit from the secret realm.

By now, they'd traveled deep into the Heavenly Domain proper. The route passed numerous cities and sects, and cultivators were a common sight. The three immortal ships drew considerable attention, but Qin Jiang couldn't be bothered with subtlety.

The Heavenly Domain was full of powerhouses, true, but Immortal Kings were still major figures. Immortal Emperors stood at the apex. The beings above Immortal Emperor level had long withdrawn from worldly affairs. With his current retinue, Qin Jiang had more than enough muscle to swagger as he pleased.

Led by the Skyreach City Immortal Kings radiating their full auras, no one dared provoke them.

After a full three months following the Level One Domain group's directions, they arrived at a vast ocean.

The ships halted. Qin Jiang moved to the lead vessel, where his guides stood respectfully behind him. "My lord, the secret realm is beneath the sea."

"The sea?" He peered downward.

One of the Skyreach City Immortal Kings spoke up. "Master, this is Dream Cloud Sea. Numerous races live beneath its waters. The strongest is a Merfolk tribe—they have an Immortal Emperor."

"Merfolk?"

"Yes." The Immortal Kings nodded, then—recalling their master's tastes—helpfully added, "And Merfolk women are renowned for their beauty."

Qin Jiang's eyes lit up. That raised the odds of finding a fortune heroine considerably.

Noticing his expression, the Immortal Kings exchanged glances, seizing their chance to curry favor.

"Master, shall we pay the Merfolk a visit?"

"Even though they have an Immortal Emperor, we carry the weight of Skyreach City. If you're interested, the Merfolk will cooperate."

"I have some connections within the Merfolk tribe."

They fell over each other to be helpful. Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. "Don't forget—we have business to attend to."

They fell silent.

"Let's go. Take me to the Merfolk first."

They blinked. That was a fast reversal.

"What are you standing around for? Move."

"Yes!"

The Immortal Kings led the way, diving off the ships and plunging into the ocean. At their cultivation level, even underwater movement was effortless.

Beneath the surface, Qin Jiang discovered an entirely different world. Underwater cities dotted the seabed, each one breathtakingly beautiful. Within them, all manner of sea creatures carried on like humans—strolling, playing, trading.

He'd never seen anything like it.

"Master, these are just small settlements. The Merfolk's territory is at the center of Dream Cloud Sea."

Qin Jiang nodded and had them continue. After roughly two hours of travel through the ocean, they finally reached a colossal city. Most of the Merfolk lived here.

At the city gates, two guards stood watch—a great shrimp and a great crab. The classic shrimp soldier and crab general, brought to life. They raised their pincers to block the group, beady eyes scanning them.

"Humans?"

One of the Immortal Kings stepped forward, flashing a medallion. "Hmph! Skyreach City Third-Class Elder. Stand aside."

The shrimp and crab startled. They hastily lowered their pincers and prostrated themselves. "Forgive us, Elder! We meant no offense."

They cleared the way. "Please, honored guests."

The name Skyreach City carried weight everywhere in the Heavenly Domain. A Third-Class Elder was at minimum an Immortal King—and the city lords with Qin Jiang all held that rank. Above them existed Second-Class Elders, First-Class Elders, and Senior Elders, a testament to Skyreach City's staggering strength.

With the guards cleared, the Immortal King who'd shown his medallion snorted at them before turning back to Qin Jiang, instantly switching to a fawning bow. "After you, Master."

Qin Jiang grunted and entered the city with his entourage of Immortal Kings trailing behind him like loyal dogs.

Watching them go, the two guards exchanged bewildered looks.

"What's that human's identity? Skyreach City Elders are calling him master?"

"Looks like our Merfolk City has a very important visitor."

"Should we report this?"

"What do you think?"

"I'll go report. You hold the gate."

The shrimp darted off into the city while the crab remained at its post, big pincers crossed impressively.

Inside, Qin Jiang was in no hurry. He strolled through the streets with his retinue, taking in the sights. Humans were rare down here, so his group naturally drew attention—the sea creatures stared with undisguised curiosity, and Qin Jiang returned the favor.

He'd never seen so many varieties of seafood in one place. Steamed, stir-fried, braised in sauce... they'd all be delicious.

Of course, beyond the seafood, the Merfolk were the most numerous. Human torsos atop fish tails, swimming with a sinuous sway. The women in particular had waists that moved in ways that were frankly hypnotic.

Though as he watched, Qin Jiang grimaced. The anatomy didn't quite match up. Gorgeous as they were, there was a compatibility issue.

He shook his head internally. Looks like this trip was a waste.

"Master, you needn't worry. When they leave the water, they automatically shift into fully human form."

One of the Immortal Kings leaned in helpfully.

Qin Jiang's eyebrow shot up. Interest renewed, he went back to appreciating those swaying waists. In human form, the way they moved could kill a man. They might outdo even the Snake Race.

And there was a decent chance the tribe harbored a fortune heroine. Someone of that status in the Merfolk would almost certainly be nobility.
