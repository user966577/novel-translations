Hearing Qin Lian'er's words, Chu Hanyan froze. She instinctively looked at Qin Jiang. These two were here for her?

Her guard went up immediately, though she maintained her fragile facade on the surface.

Qin Jiang studied Chu Hanyan with a faint smile. "A stunning beauty raising a good-for-nothing brother, surviving in this world without a scratch." He turned to Qin Lian'er. "Lian'er, do you really think a woman like that would be so fragile?"

Qin Lian'er looked at Chu Hanyan in astonishment. Clever as she was, she immediately grasped her brother's meaning. This Chu Hanyan was more than she appeared.

And she was right. As Qin Jiang had pointed out, Chu Hanyan's parents had died when she was eight or nine, leaving only the two siblings. As she grew older, even deliberate attempts to make herself plain couldn't hide her beauty, and she'd attracted plenty of lecherous attention. Danger was a constant companion. Yet she'd not only survived—she'd raised her younger brother as well. Chu Hanyan was nothing like the delicate flower she pretended to be.

"Am I wrong, Miss Chu?" Qin Jiang asked with a smile.

She glanced at him and quickly looked away, keeping her soft tone. "I... I don't understand what you mean. I'm just an ordinary person, and you're clearly from a prestigious family. I hope you won't make things difficult for a simple girl like me."

"Ordinary?" Qin Jiang laughed softly and strolled to the peach tree in the courtyard. "Quite lush. I wonder what kind of fertilizer you've been using." He glanced at the soil beneath it, then added in a low voice: "Buried quite a few people under there, haven't you?"

Chu Hanyan's pupils contracted sharply. Her hands clenched, and a flash of cold steel passed through her eyes.

"I don't enjoy killing," she said, the fragility melting from her face. "If you leave now, I won't hold any of this against you."

Watching the transformation, Qin Lian'er's mouth fell open. This woman really wasn't simple! But that was a good thing—only an extraordinary woman was worthy of being her brother's woman.

A grin spread across Qin Lian'er's face. "Brother, now she's qualified to be my sister-in-law."

Chu Hanyan frowned. The girl seemed even more excited than before, as if she'd spotted better prey. And that prey was her.

Taking a deep breath, Chu Hanyan prepared to strike, but Qin Lian'er spoke first: "Sister-in-law, come with my brother. The Qin family will never treat you poorly."

Sister-in-law already? Chu Hanyan's heart skipped. More importantly—the Qin family? They were from the Qin family?

It hit her like a bolt of lightning. The Qin family's young lord was supposed to be in the Fire Domain right now, and he'd just stolen the Fire Tribe clan leader's bride. Could this be—

"You're the Qin family's young lord?" Chu Hanyan stared at Qin Jiang in shock.

Qin Jiang gave a casual smile. "Why? If I'm the Qin family's young lord, you'll let me go?"

Chu Hanyan's face fell. If he really was the Qin family's young lord, it wasn't a matter of her letting him do anything. She was certain that the courtyard was already surrounded by Qin family powerhouses. If she made a move, she'd be subdued—or more likely killed—in an instant.

She abandoned all thought of fighting. The Qin family's strength was simply too overwhelming.

"I was rash just now. I beg Young Master Qin's forgiveness," she said, lowering her head in a slight bow. "I've never offended you. I only ask that you let me go."

Growing up looking after a younger brother, she knew when to yield.

Qin Jiang walked over and tilted her chin up with his finger. "You haven't offended me, true. But that brother of yours has been quite a handful."

"Yuan'er..." Chu Hanyan's heart clenched. Had Chu Yuan's injuries from the other day been because he'd crossed the Qin family's young lord?

Her mind raced. "If Yuan'er offended you, then as his sister, I'm willing to... to make amends on his behalf."

At that moment, a figure came rushing in—Chu Yuan, who'd been hiding in the shadows. Seeing Qin Jiang's hands on his sister, he'd finally snapped.

"Let go of my sister!" Chu Yuan shouted.

Qin Jiang turned his head, gave Chu Hanyan's chin a squeeze, and said lightly, "You're willing, but it seems someone else isn't."

"Yuan'er, mind your manners!" Chu Hanyan snapped immediately.

Chu Yuan froze, but seeing his sister's chin being held—such a humiliating posture—his eyes turned cold. Still, the Qin family was too powerful. He couldn't fight them head-on. Swallowing his rage, he looked at Qin Jiang. "Young Master Qin, may we speak privately?"

"You don't have that privilege," Qin Jiang said flatly.

Chu Yuan fell silent. For his sister's sake, he could only endure. After a moment's hesitation, he spoke in a low voice: "I have information that concerns your Qin family. It may be a matter of life and death."

"Oh?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

This Chu Yuan had been reborn from ten years in the future—meaning he could foresee the next decade's events. The only catch was that his predictions seemed to be based on the original timeline, before any changes had occurred.

"Go on."

Chu Yuan let out a breath. As long as there was a dialogue, he was confident he could persuade Qin Jiang.

"If what I tell you is useful to the Qin family, then the misunderstanding from a few days ago is forgotten, and you can't take my sister either."

But Qin Jiang shook his head. He released Chu Hanyan's chin—only to wrap his arm around her waist and pull her against him. "Your sister, I'm taking. That's non-negotiable."

"You—"

"You don't get to bargain."

Chu Yuan glared at Qin Jiang, his chest heaving with barely contained fury.

"Fine! I'll tell you," he spat. What he needed to do now was demonstrate his value. He was certain that once Qin Jiang recognized his worth, a single woman wouldn't be worth the cost of antagonizing him.

Chu Yuan turned to Qin Lian'er. "If I'm not mistaken, this young lady is the Qin family's little princess, Qin Lian'er?"

"Skip the preamble. Get to the point."

"I know that Miss Qin once had a fiancé. The engagement was broken off, but a three-year pact was made. And that three-year pact will mark the beginning of your Qin family's decline!" Chu Yuan sneered. "Miss Qin's former fiancé is no ordinary person."

Having been reborn, he knew that while the Qin family of this life was far stronger than in his previous one, and some things had unfolded differently, the broad strokes of the future remained unchanged. He was sure that the Qin family's trajectory would still lead to decline.

And the information he possessed would surely command Qin Jiang's attention.
