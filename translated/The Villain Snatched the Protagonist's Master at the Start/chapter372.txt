Qin Jiang's gaze was fixed on the Li family ancestor — the True Immortal. A light flickered in his eyes. In his mind, the system's notification had popped up the moment the old man appeared.

【A Child of Destiny has been detected in connection with the Host. One spoiler is available. The Host may view the Child of Destiny's trajectory for the next hundred years. Altering the plot may yield Villain Points or rewards.】

There really was a Child of Destiny — and it was connected to the Li family.

Nearby, An Xihe held the Zhao True Immortal suspended in mid-air. She tapped a finger against the void. The Zhao ancestor's arm twisted — starting from the fingertips, up to the shoulder, crumbling bit by bit. "You ran. You dared to run." The force intensified. One arm was ground into paste. She started on the other.

The Zhao True Immortal shook violently, face contorted in agony, eyes flooded with terror — but he couldn't struggle, couldn't even scream. He could only hang there and feel his body being crushed, inch by inch.

The Li family ancestor watched, face twitching. He cursed the Zhao bastard in his heart. Trying to drag the Li family down as his dying act — absolutely despicable! Watching the torture brought a small, vicious satisfaction. Served him right.

Still, satisfaction aside, fear lurked beneath. Against an Immortal King, he had no chance whatsoever. He could only pray he wasn't next.

Mid-prayer, he noticed Qin Jiang's gaze on him. He looked up, met those eyes, and forced a dry laugh, nodding politely. Something about that look felt predatory. Had he been targeted?

By then, An Xihe's fury had mostly spent itself. She slapped the Zhao True Immortal dead — his Primordial Spirit obliterated in the same stroke. Mo Mo darted in immediately, collecting every drop of blood. She still needed it for the Bloodline Curse. The surviving Zhao clan members scattered across the world were small fry now. None could withstand the technique.

Qin Jiang turned to Mo Mo. "Can you start?"

She glanced at the Li ancestor, making him stiffen. Start? Start on *him*?

The Li ancestor panicked. "Esteemed lords — no, no, esteemed lords of Huaxia — I truly have nothing to do with that old bastard! He came to our family specifically to redirect your wrath! He wanted to destroy us! My lords, the Li family has always held Huaxia in the highest esteem..."

He'd dropped every pretense of dignity. A True Immortal, calling Qin Jiang "my lord" and groveling. His face was a mask of nervous flattery and barely concealed humiliation. If the Li family was wiped out because of this, he'd die with his eyes open.

Qin Jiang blinked — then realized. The old man had misunderstood. He chuckled. "No connection? Then why did he come to you for help?"

"We really have no connection! Well — we do, but it's a blood feud! He came here specifically to drag us down! Everyone in Grey Cloud Heaven knows this. Manor Lord Qin, you can check — we truly are enemies. That Zhao bastard was trying to use you as a weapon..."

Qin Jiang waved him off. "I don't care about your relationship."

"Manor Lord—"

"Shut up." His expression was pure impatience. After the Li ancestor fell silent, he continued: "You said the Li family holds Huaxia in high esteem?"

"Yes, yes! Manor Lord, Huaxia's might spans heaven and earth, blazing like the sun — the undisputed number one power in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Who wouldn't hold it in esteem? Our Li family is no exception. Manor Lord, you have no idea how many of our disciples idolize Huaxia, and how deeply they admire your brilliance. They all look up to you as their hero!"

The flattery was so thick it nearly dripped. Qin Jiang's lips twitched upward. "Seems the Li family truly reveres Huaxia."

"Absolutely!"

"In that case, why not have the Li family join Huaxia?"

"Huh?" The Li ancestor's face froze. Reluctance showed through his forced smile. "Manor Lord, that's... perhaps not..."

"Oh? You and the Zhao family are allies after all?"

"???"

The old man's mouth twitched. He had no idea how to respond. Qin Jiang laughed. "Ha ha ha, just kidding. Don't mind me. I know the Li family and the Zhao family are enemies."

"Ha ha..." The Li ancestor could only manage a hollow chuckle. Bitterness churned inside him. Without strength, you could only play the grandson. One wrong word and it was annihilation.

This Manor Lord was exactly as the intelligence reports described — not a good person at all.

Qin Jiang turned to Mo Mo. She nodded. "Ready. But I can't be interrupted."

"Will here work?" He glanced at the Li ancestor with a smile. "With Xihe around, no one will bother you."

"Great!"

Mo Mo settled cross-legged in the air, the Zhao True Immortal's blood suspended before her. The Li ancestor exhaled in quiet relief — so it wasn't about him after all.

Demonic qi roiled from Mo Mo's body, laced with threads of crimson. The stench of blood spread thick and cloying. Before her, the blood trembled, then under her deft manipulations split into countless portions — each forming a hair-thin needle of red.

The blood needles plunged into the void and vanished.

Across Grey Cloud Heaven, anyone carrying Zhao blood began dissolving into puddles of red. The blood pooled, reformed into new needles, and disappeared again. It went on for a full day. Throughout the realm, people dropped without warning — melting where they stood. Even Zhao descendants beyond Grey Cloud Heaven weren't safe. Anywhere within the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, the needles would find them.

No mercy. No survivors.
