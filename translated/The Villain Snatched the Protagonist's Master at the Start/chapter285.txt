In the restaurant, Qing Chan and An Xihe stood before Qin Jiang, properly dressed, each beautiful in her own way. Under his appreciative gaze, Qing Chan bore it well enough, but An Xihe's knees went weak—a reflex born of fear that the beast might reawaken.

He reached out and pulled An Xihe close. "Xihe, are you ready to attempt Immortal King?"

She blinked. The question—and the casual way he'd asked it—implied he knew far more than she'd told him. She'd never mentioned her true cultivation to him. Qing Chan knew, but she'd been silenced by Qin Jiang's mouth before she could say a word.

Seeing her confusion, Qin Jiang coughed and flashed a sheepish grin. "Xihe, can you tolerate deception?"

An Xihe froze. Those were her words from yesterday, thrown back at her. A creeping suspicion formed—the sense that a vast net had been cast over her from the very beginning.

After a beat, Qin Jiang chose the path of least resistance: throw someone else under the wagon.

He sold out her subordinates without a second thought.

"The truth is, I've known your identity from the start. Your people contacted me before we ever met."

"???"

"They told me to win you over. Apparently I should 'manage your temper.'"

"!!!"

"So this whole time, they've been helping me put on a show."

An Xihe's fists clenched. Murderous light blazed in her eyes. Backstabbed. By her own people.

She took a long, steadying breath. Looking at Qin Jiang's handsome face, the fury slowly ebbed. This wasn't his fault. It was those worthless subordinates of hers. Qin Jiang was just an innocent victim of their scheming.

Her body relaxed. With him nearby, she couldn't be too fierce. She had to be gentle.

"It's fine," she said softly. "I know you didn't mean to deceive me."

"Exactly. I just liked you too much," he said, nodding with such earnest sincerity that her remaining anger dissolved on the spot.

Off to the side, Qing Chan rolled her eyes. 'Shameless.'

But her attention caught on something else. Had Qin Jiang just said An Xihe was preparing to break through to Immortal King? The woman had failed once, tens of thousands of years ago. Was she going for it again?

"You're really going for Immortal King?" Qing Chan couldn't help asking. Last time, it had been Qing Chan herself—along with several other True Immortals—who'd disrupted the attempt. She wouldn't interfere again, but the other True Immortals of Azure Cloud Heaven wouldn't welcome a new Immortal King. Especially one that wasn't them.

In Qin Jiang's arms, An Xihe nodded. "Of course. What's the point of cultivation if not to reach higher?" She looked up at him. "And once I become Immortal King, Qin Jiang will be the most powerful man in Azure Cloud Heaven. Whatever he wants to do, I'll have his back."

Qing Chan was speechless. Talk about hardball competition for his affection.

Qin Jiang blinked. For a moment, he felt distinctly like a kept man. Not a bad feeling, actually. Very secure.

Qing Chan studied An Xihe. "Even with my help, your odds aren't great. The other True Immortals will try to stop you. I can't hold them all."

"You won't need to. I have a plan." An Xihe's confidence was absolute.

Qin Jiang knew what she meant. Over hundreds of thousands of years, she'd secretly woven a massive formation across all of Azure Cloud Heaven. The Central Regions formation was its core. The array served dual purposes: boosting her breakthrough and trapping every True Immortal in the realm. Once activated, they'd be locked down long enough for her to complete the ascension.

In the original timeline, she'd still failed—because of Chen Qi'er. Decades from now, he would have broken through to True Immortal. With every other True Immortal trapped, he alone would be free to interfere. Azure Cloud Heaven could only produce one Immortal King, and Chen Qi'er had seized that opportunity, destroying her breakthrough. The failure left her crippled and maddened, easy prey for him. A grim end.

Killing intent flickered in Qin Jiang's eyes. But none of that would happen now. An Xihe had him.

Failure was not an option. Anyone who dared interfere would die. True Immortals included.

The Immortal King Seal and the Killing Formation Plate could both slay Immortal Kings—let alone True Immortals. He'd welcome the challenge. True Immortal-grade laws would be excellent. His wives were hungry for them.

He held An Xihe tighter. Her cultivation had long reached True Immortal Perfection. She could attempt Immortal King at any time. With the formation's support and no interruptions, success was virtually guaranteed.

Six other True Immortals remained in Azure Cloud Heaven besides Qing Chan and An Xihe. Then there was Dao Zhen, who might stay neutral. That left five to worry about—plus the Children of Destiny, Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng. Chen Wuming was still small fry.

Weighing his assets against the opposition, the math was favorable.

"Xihe, why not attempt the breakthrough now?"

"Now?" She hesitated. "I'm not fully prepared..."

"You have me. And Qing Chan. And Dao Zhen probably won't cause trouble."

He smiled at her. "You're not alone anymore."

Something trembled in her chest. She'd never felt the power of such simple words before. 'You're not alone anymore.' The sudden urge to have him right there nearly overwhelmed her—but she was still sore.

Coming back to herself, she shook her head. "If you help me and it goes wrong, you'll be dragged down too."

"It won't go wrong," he said easily, twirling a strand of her hair. "Trust me. Anyone who tries to stop you, I'll kill. True Immortals included."

The Immortal King Seal and the Killing Formation—both designed to slay beings of that tier. A few True Immortals? He'd welcome the business.

Qing Chan nodded. "If Qin Jiang uses his trump cards, killing True Immortals shouldn't be a problem." She'd seen the Immortal King Seal. Its power was terrifying—absolutely lethal to True Immortals.

An Xihe looked at Qin Jiang with surprise. He had weapons that could kill True Immortals?

Meeting his confident gaze, she didn't hesitate further. "As long as no one interferes, I will not fail!"
