Five days later, Wu Qi and the others departed.

The moment they left, Qin Jiang was about to finally steal some rest when the entire Space-Time Temple shuddered violently. A vast, surging aura made the temporal energies tremble.

His eyebrows rose, and a grin spread across his face. "That's Mo Mo. She's about to break through to True Immortal."

Mo Mo had been in seclusion for a long time now — roughly a hundred years in Space-Time Temple time. At last, she was ready.

Qin Jiang surveyed the chamber. He'd upgraded the Space-Time Temple once at the Ancient Emperor stage, but it clearly needed another overhaul. The structure was buckling under a True Immortal's breakthrough pressure.

The temporal energies churned into chaos under the assault of True Immortal-level power. Qin Jiang raised his arm, and Human Immortal strength bloomed outward, temporarily stabilizing the temple.

Before him, a sphere of light materialized — Mo Mo's seclusion space. Inside, her eyes were closed, immense power radiating in all directions. Demonic qi billowed upward, but rather than looking sinister, it cast her in an almost saintly glow — a holy maiden wreathed in darkness.

The energy fluctuations persisted for several days before gradually subsiding. At last, Mo Mo opened her eyes, and the Space-Time Temple lurched again. In an instant, every wisp of spiritual energy within the temple surged toward her, consumed in the span of a single day.

When the maelstrom finally calmed, Mo Mo had firmly crossed into the True Immortal realm.

She vanished from the light sphere.

Qin Jiang smiled. With Mo Mo's breakthrough, Huaxia Manor now boasted three True Immortals. And Xue Mei, Ning Xue'er, and Chen Baizhe were all preparing for their own attempts. He'd even heard that Chen Baizhe's teacher, Immortal Kun — Dao Kun — was readying a push for True Immortal as well.

If they all succeeded, Azure Cloud Heaven's strength would be largely restored. One Immortal King, seven True Immortals — with that kind of firepower, they could expand into the other heavens and actually hold what they took.

Qin Jiang was feeling rather pleased with himself. Truly, he was an exceptional leader. Look how far Huaxia Manor had come in such a short time, and it would only grow stronger.

But after waiting a moment, he frowned. Mo Mo hadn't come to find him? That wasn't like her.

The thought had barely formed when she appeared — but not alone. Jian Yao was with her, bound and sealed, hurling a stream of furious curses at Mo Mo.

Qin Jiang blinked, then quickly understood. This was revenge.

Seeing the look on Mo Mo's face, he shook his head with a resigned smile. Fine. Let her vent.

He played along, helping Mo Mo get it out of her system before soothing her afterward. Then there was Jian Yao to console as well.

Once both women had been sent on their way, Qin Jiang took a brief rest before turning to the Space-Time Temple upgrade.

At Human Immortal level, he could push the temple to a significantly higher tier. The time differential could now reach 1:500, though the greater the ratio, the more resources it consumed. Day-to-day operations didn't need the full setting — 1:30 or 1:50 was plenty for Qin Jiang's normal activities.

Individual seclusion chambers could also run at different time speeds, adjustable at will. Very user-friendly.
