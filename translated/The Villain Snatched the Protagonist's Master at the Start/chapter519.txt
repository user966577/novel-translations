The three Children of Destiny were each enduring their own tribulations, like caterpillars waiting to burst from their cocoons. But once they emerged, what awaited them would be Qin Jiang's wicked hands—and against his power, they wouldn't stand a chance.

As for the wicked Qin Jiang himself, he and his wicked hands were thoroughly enjoying life.

Aboard the immortal vessel, Qin Jiang lay with his head resting on a pair of jade-smooth legs while his hands roamed with unerring precision. Wu Yingtao's cheeks were flushed, her small hands gently massaging his temples. She was formidably strong, but her personality remained soft and shy—prone to blushing at the slightest provocation.

"Qin Jiang, did you go see Wu Tian a few days ago?" she asked quietly.

Qin Jiang opened his eyes, his hands settling around her waist. "How did you know?"

"Yun Bao told me." Wu Yingtao pouted. "She said her father rescued someone, and that person was why you went there."

"How do you know it's Wu Tian?"

"Yun Bao also said you told Sister Xihe that you want me to take revenge personally. So you've confirmed he isn't really my brother?"

Wu Yingtao had been holding on to one last shred of hope—maybe, as Qin Jiang had once comforted her, Wu Tian had simply gone mad. But now...

Qin Jiang fell silent for a moment. He sat up, pulled Wu Yingtao into his arms, and sighed. "It's confirmed. At Yun Bao's place, Xihe tried to probe his Primordial Spirit. Even in his severely weakened state, she couldn't penetrate it. You know what that means."

An Xihe's power was no secret to Wu Yingtao. A mighty Immortal King, unable to probe Wu Tian's Primordial Spirit? It could only mean one thing—the person inside Wu Tian's body was no longer her brother. His shell housed a different soul entirely.

Wu Yingtao's expression dimmed. Her last hope had crumbled.

Qin Jiang held her close, gently patting her back, and pressed a soft kiss to her forehead. Under his comforting touch, the sadness in her eyes gradually gave way to resolve.

She looked up at him, her voice steady. "I want to avenge my brother myself."

"Good. I support you." Qin Jiang nodded.

He produced a system reward—a supreme treasure capable of purifying Wu Yingtao's bloodline. "This treasure can purify your Ancient God bloodline. In a short time, it'll transform your strength."

"Purify my bloodline?"

"Yes." Qin Jiang rubbed her head. "The Ancient God bloodline is the foundation of your power. Once it's strengthened, your cultivation will grow accordingly, and your talent will improve too."

Wu Yingtao's eyes brightened. She reached out and took the treasure. The instant it touched her skin, it merged into her body. A flash of heat surged through her and vanished just as quickly. She blinked, feeling nothing.

"How come there's no reaction?" she asked, puzzled.

"This treasure needs to be refined gradually. It'll purify your bloodline over time."

"Oh, I see." Wu Yingtao nodded.

Sitting in Qin Jiang's lap, she closed her eyes and soon located the treasure within her dantian. It sat there obediently, releasing wisps of blood essence that nourished her bloodline. The process was slow, but if she entered seclusion to guide it, the purification would accelerate considerably.

Wu Yingtao opened her eyes and looked at Qin Jiang. Before going into seclusion, she wanted to spend some quality time with him. She wrapped her arms around his neck, a shy warmth coloring her face. "Qin Jiang, I want to go into seclusion."

"Sure."

Wu Yingtao pouted, nibbling her lip, her big eyes fixed on him expectantly.

"Something else?" Qin Jiang asked.

A flash of resentment crossed Wu Yingtao's eyes. This scoundrel was definitely doing it on purpose. The other girls had told her that before their seclusions, he always gave them a proper "send-off." But here he was, withholding hers.

She glared at him with a little huff. 'Fine. If he won't offer, I'll take it myself.'

She tightened her arms around his neck and kissed him, pressing her soft lips against his and giving him a small, resentful bite.

After a while, she pulled back. "I'm going into seclusion now!"

"Alright."

"You..." Wu Yingtao's face fell. He really wasn't going to give her a send-off!

Seeing her expression, Qin Jiang couldn't help but laugh. His arm tightened around her waist. "Alright, alright, I'll stop teasing you. You want to go into seclusion? Let me take you there—and before you start, I'll give you a proper send-off. Sound good?"

"Mm, okay~" Wu Yingtao's expression finally brightened.

Qin Jiang smiled, pinched her cheek, then swept her up into his arms and headed for the Space-Time Temple. Inside, he found a small chamber and set her down, though his arm stayed around her waist.

"You can use this space for your seclusion."

"Mm~" Wu Yingtao nodded. She gazed up at him, her face blooming with a rosy blush. "You still need to give me my send-off~"

"Heh, right." Qin Jiang grinned.

With a wave of his hand, a bed materialized in the chamber. He pulled Wu Yingtao close, kissing her as they moved toward it and fell together onto the soft surface.

After a while, their lips parted. Qin Jiang brushed the hair from her face and kissed her forehead. "Yingtao, how would you like your send-off?"

"Any... any way is fine~"

"Then let's try everything?"

"Mm, okay~"

Wu Yingtao clung to him, eyes half-closed, waiting. The sight was impossibly endearing.

Qin Jiang smiled, tapped the tip of her nose, kissed it, then found her lips again. And with that, he officially began... giving Wu Yingtao her send-off.

A thorough send-off meant she could enter seclusion with a clear mind and no distractions. This was why all the women received one before retreat—it was for their benefit, really.

He was doing this entirely for their sake.
