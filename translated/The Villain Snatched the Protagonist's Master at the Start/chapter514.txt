Elsewhere, Wu Tian's consciousness slowly surfaced through a haze.

He inhaled deeply out of reflex. Clear air—no dirt. Not buried.

He opened his eyes, then immediately frowned. Why was his vantage point so low?

He tried to move and felt that dreaded, familiar constriction. His expression darkened.

Looking down, he discovered that most of his body was embedded in the earth. Only his torso from the chest up protruded, standing bolt upright like a fence post.

His vision swam and he nearly blacked out again.

Still, this was better than being fully underground. At least he could absorb moonlight this way.

Swallowing his frustration, Wu Tian channeled what little energy he had and blasted the packed soil apart, then leaped free.

A careful self-assessment: his injuries had improved somewhat, but not by much. He still needed medicinal herbs to properly heal.

The commotion drew the middle-aged man, who came rushing out and beamed at Wu Tian.

"You're finally awake!"

"..."

The mere sight of the man gave Wu Tian a headache. This idiot and his obsession with burying people.

He expelled a turbid breath, pointed at the hole, and asked, "Why did you bury me again?"

"Well..."

The man paused, then scratched his head, wearing the expression of someone who'd done Wu Tian a great favor. "I read in a book that lying down for too long is bad for injury recovery. So I figured I'd keep you upright. Burying you up to the chest was the easiest way to prop you up."

"???"

Wu Tian was incredulous. "Lying down is bad for recovery?"

Since when? Injured people were supposed to rest. How was lying down harmful?

"Absolutely," the man said with total conviction. "It's in the book. Books don't lie."

"What book?"

The man produced an ancient-looking tome, flipped to a page, and held it out. "See? Right here. 'After sustaining injuries, do not remain supine for extended periods. Stand frequently to promote healing.'"

"Huh. So it does say that."

Wu Tian squinted. "Though this particular line looks awfully fresh."

Among all the aged text on the page, that sentence stood out like new ink.

The man coughed. "I may have just added it."

"???"

"I wrote this book myself."

"???"

Wu Tian's face went completely dark. This man was just messing with him!

"I'm a doctor, you see. Writing my own medical text is perfectly reasonable, no?"

Wu Tian's rising fury hit a wall. He studied the man skeptically. "You're a doctor?"

"You doubt it?"

The man spread his hands, then struck what he apparently considered a sage-like pose. It was not particularly convincing.

Wu Tian frowned, deliberated for a moment, then asked, "Since you're a doctor, can you treat my injuries?"

"No."

"???"

"Alas, one cannot cook without ingredients. I may be a doctor, but without medicinal herbs, I can't do much."

"Don't you know any healing techniques?"

"I don't."

"..."

"My approach is purely material-based. Healing arts require innate talent, and unfortunately, I have none."

"..."

Listening to the man's mournful self-assessment, Wu Tian was thoroughly unimpressed. Still, the man was at least a doctor of some sort. He probably knew more about treating injuries than Wu Tian did. So he asked, "What kind of herbs would I need?"

"Let me take a look."

The man made a great show of examining Wu Tian, then furrowed his brow and pondered at length. Under Wu Tian's impatient prodding, he finally answered.

"One stalk of Immortal King-grade medicine would heal you completely."

"???"

"Ideally, a healing-specific Immortal King herb."

"Ha."

Wu Tian actually laughed—an angry, disbelieving laugh. An Immortal King herb? Even in his previous life, he'd possessed only a handful. Whether this entire realm even contained such a thing was debatable.

And of course an Immortal King herb would heal him. His current body was only Saint Realm. An Immortal King herb could literally resurrect the dead.

"Do you have one? If so, take it immediately," the man said with perfect seriousness.

Wu Tian breathed deeply and deliberately to avoid passing out from sheer rage.

"You're really a doctor?"

"Beyond question!"

"And aside from Immortal King herbs, how else would you treat these injuries?"

"Immortal Emperor herbs would also work. Or something even higher—those might even boost your cultivation."

"..."

Silence.

After a long pause, Wu Tian sighed. "Have you ever actually treated anyone?"

"Uh..."

The man laughed awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck. "Can't say that I have. I'm more of a theorist. Never had a chance to practice. But I could practice on you!"

"..."

"If we don't have Immortal King herbs, that's fine. I can try substituting with other ingredients."

"No!"

Wu Tian refused instantly, hands waving. "My injuries aren't that serious. I wouldn't dream of troubling you."

He was genuinely afraid this man would finish what his enemies had started.

"Come on, it's no trouble at all! Here, let me examine you again. I'll whip up a prescription—"

The man was utterly without self-awareness, grabbing Wu Tian and attempting to begin treatment. In Wu Tian's weakened state, he could barely resist.

After an exhausting back-and-forth, he finally talked the man out of playing doctor.

Taking stock of his condition, Wu Tian decided he was stable enough to stay conscious. It was time to leave. This place was becoming hazardous to his health.

"I, uh... have some business to attend to. And I wouldn't want to impose any further. I should probably get going."

The middle-aged man's heart clenched. Qin Jiang had ordered him to stay by Wu Tian's side and keep tormenting him. He couldn't just let the man walk away.

"Impose? Not at all! With injuries like yours, anything could happen. Stay a few more days."

"I'm a grown man, and there's a young lady here. It's not appropriate."

Wu Tian grasped for any excuse.

The man's face broke into a smile. "Oh, you don't need to worry about that. My daughter left with her husband a few days ago. It's just us now. Plenty appropriate."

"???"
