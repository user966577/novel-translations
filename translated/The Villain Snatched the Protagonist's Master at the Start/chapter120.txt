Two hours later, Liu Shuwan found the two of them.

"Wan'er, something you need?"

Liu Shuwan pointed toward the mansion gates. "The Dragon Emperor sent someone over with an old woman—bound and delivered."

"Hm?" Qin Jiang blinked, then it clicked. "The Ninth Prince's grandmother?"

"Should be."

Qin Jiang glanced at Xia Qianling. He'd originally planned to use the old hag as leverage to coax the girl into giving herself to him. But now the Dragon Emperor had been far too considerate—hand-delivering the woman to his doorstep.

"Let's go have a look."

He headed for the gates first, with Liu Shuwan pulling Xia Qianling gently by the hand as they followed.

Outside the mansion, the Third Princess had already rested and was standing by the entrance, staring at an old woman kneeling on the ground, unsure what was happening. She recognized the woman—the Ninth Prince's grandmother. Thanks to the Dragon Emperor's favoritism toward the Ninth Prince, the old woman's status had risen accordingly. She even outranked a Third Princess.

The one who'd escorted her here was the Fourth Patron.

He looked somewhat disgruntled. Dirty work like this wasn't exactly his preference. But to stay in Qin Jiang's good graces, he'd come personally.

Before long, footsteps approached as Qin Jiang and the others emerged.

The Third Princess immediately came to greet them. No need to think twice—something like this was definitely Qin Jiang's doing.

"Heh heh, Young Lord Qin..." The Fourth Patron sidled over with an ingratiating grin, gesturing toward the old woman. "His Majesty learned what she did and was quite furious. So he had me deliver her—how she's dealt with is entirely your decision."

Qin Jiang studied the old woman. She had virtually no cultivation talent—barely at the Qi-Blood Realm—and was ancient, clearly on death's doorstep. Was the Dragon Emperor really sending a dying woman over just to shield the Ninth Prince?

He looked away and turned to Xia Qianling. "You decide."

"I..." Seeing the person responsible for her father's death, Xia Qianling's face went pale. Hatred flickered in her eyes. But when the power to decide someone's fate was suddenly placed in her hands, she didn't know what to do with it. She was just an ordinary person. She'd never imagined she could one day determine the fate of someone important.

"Do whatever you want," Qin Jiang said softly. "Just don't betray your own heart."

Xia Qianling glanced at him, her fist clenching. She turned and fixed the old woman with a piercing stare, her voice trembling as she spoke her verdict:

"I want her dead!"

The words shook, but every syllable rang with conviction. The moment they left her lips, she lowered her head.

Liu Shuwan, standing beside her, gently patted her shoulder in comfort.

The Fourth Patron looked to Qin Jiang. The final word still had to come from him.

"Why are you looking at me?" Qin Jiang waved dismissively. "Bury her."

"Yes, sir."

The Fourth Patron acknowledged the order. With a sweep of his arm, a squad of imperial cultivators took the old woman away.

Throughout the entire ordeal, the old woman remained calm. As a family member of a Child of Destiny, one had to admit—her composure was remarkable. Perhaps from the moment the Dragon Emperor had taken her, she'd understood her fate. She also understood that only her sacrifice could quench Qin Jiang's anger and protect her grandson. So she offered no resistance.

Besides, she'd lived a life of wealth and privilege. To shield her grandson from disaster at the very end—that was a life well-lived.

Of course, she conveniently forgot that she'd caused this disaster in the first place. Then again, even without her, Qin Jiang would have found a reason to target the Ninth Prince. This calamity was never going to pass.

Watching the old woman being dragged away, the Fourth Patron rubbed his hands together and hesitated before speaking. "Young Lord Qin, the Ninth Prince is the most talented of the next generation. So His Majesty hopes this matter won't implicate him. He's willing to apologize on the Ninth Prince's behalf—to you and to this young lady."

Though it hadn't been formally announced, virtually everyone accepted that the Ninth Prince was the future crown prince and heir to the throne—including the Dragon Emperor himself. Once the Ninth Prince grew a little stronger, the Emperor intended to formally name him heir. For years, he'd been grooming the prince above all others. Whatever treasures were bestowed, the Ninth Prince always got first pick. The rest went to the other princes and princesses. Naturally, this bred resentment, but the Dragon Emperor's backing kept everyone in line. And to his credit, the Ninth Prince was shrewd enough to redistribute some of his rewards, winning hearts in the process.

As for Long Xin'er—she'd always been at odds with the Ninth Prince. The feud traced back a generation: Long Xin'er's mother and the Ninth Prince's mother had been rivals. Then, when Long Xin'er was about ten, her mother had died suddenly. Long Xin'er had always suspected the Ninth Prince's mother was behind it, and she'd been opposing him ever since. Unfortunately, the power gap was too wide. Without her mother's support or the Dragon Emperor's favor, the Third Princess's forces only grew weaker, making it harder and harder to challenge the Ninth Prince.

Now, hearing the Fourth Patron's words, the Third Princess let out a cold snort. A Great Emperor willing to apologize for the sake of one prince—it spoke volumes about how important the Ninth Prince was to the Dragon Emperor.

"No need for apologies." Qin Jiang waved it off, his tone flat. "As for whether the Ninth Prince gets implicated... depends on my mood."

The Fourth Patron's cheek twitched. So he wasn't planning to let the Ninth Prince off at all! Well, not his problem. He'd pass the message along and let the Dragon Emperor deal with the headache.

"One more thing." The Fourth Patron changed the subject. "In five days, the Dragon Nest will open. All royals and nobility are permitted to enter. The Dragon Emperor has reserved a spot for you specifically."

"Dragon Nest?"

"Yes. The Dragon Nest is a secret realm controlled by the imperial family. Legend says it was left behind by the Divine Dragon Empire's founding ancestor. It's filled with countless fortunes, and it only opens once every hundred years. Young Lord Qin's timing couldn't be better. Interested?"

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded. "Interested, sure. But one spot isn't enough."

"How many would you like?"

"Ideally, everyone I've brought gets in."

The Fourth Patron: "..."

Everyone? What was he doing—going shopping?
