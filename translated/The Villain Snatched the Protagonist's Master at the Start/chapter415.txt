Watching them bicker, Qin Jiang was mildly baffled. These girls were just like Qing Chan — he wasn't going to refuse anyone. Was tying him up really necessary?

He observed the squabbling for a while, glancing from one face to the next. When it looked like they were about to come to blows, he finally intervened.

His body shuddered, and the bindings shattered. He rolled his shoulders, gave them all a wolfish grin, and announced: "You don't need to fight. Come at me all at once. I can handle it."

Before they could react, he lunged forward and scooped up two women — the two who'd been arguing the loudest.

"Linlin, Yue'er — we'll start with you two."

The women in his arms were Mo Linlin and Lu Yue, both Ancient Emperors ranked just below the Palace Master and Grand Elders in the Divine Palace hierarchy. Qin Jiang had flirted with them during his previous visit but left before anything could develop. Time to fix that.

Being held against him, both women went stiff. They talked tough, but actual combat was another matter — their hearts were racing.

They looked at each other, exchanged nods of encouragement, then turned to face Qin Jiang. He was here, and they weren't letting him escape. They leaned in simultaneously and kissed him — aggressively, badly, all enthusiasm and zero technique. Like they were trying to eat his face.

After enduring it for a moment, Qin Jiang caught their chins and said flatly, "Do you know how to kiss? Can you be a little gentler? You're going to gnaw my face off."

The two women pouted. They'd never kissed anyone — how were they supposed to know?

Behind them, a crowd of eager faces pressed closer. Tongues darted across lips. They looked ravenous. Qin Jiang's eye twitched. If they all kissed him like that, he'd lose a layer of skin. Not a single experienced one among them.

"Let's slow down. I'll teach you properly."

Using himself as the demonstration model, he worked through technique with Mo Linlin and Lu Yue while the rest observed, whispering commentary and — he noticed — taking notes. Very dedicated students.

Under his guidance, Mo Linlin and Lu Yue improved rapidly. Faces flushed, they melted against him, gazing up with dazed, lovestruck eyes. Time for the advanced curriculum.

"Has everyone learned the basics?" he asked the group.

They all nodded. Cultivators were quick studies — but theory was one thing, practice another.

"Since you've all learned the fundamentals, let Teacher inspect your progress."

He set Mo Linlin and Lu Yue aside with a pinch to each cheek. "Wait here. After I've checked the others, I'll teach you the next lesson."

"Mm..." They nodded shyly. They knew exactly what the next lesson entailed — Qing Chan and the Palace Master had given rave reviews, and the anticipation was killing them.

While they waited, Qin Jiang conducted individual evaluations: thorough, attentive, with real-time corrections and a preview of advanced material. The students were cooperative and well-behaved. The previews left some of them flustered, but they went along with it. Excellent students, the lot of them.

Evaluations took half a day. Returning to Mo Linlin and Lu Yue, he pulled them close. "Have you previewed the material?"

"N-no..." They shook their heads and whispered, "We were hoping you'd help us preview."

"Sure thing."

One arm around each, he found a suitable classroom and got to work. Thanks to the preview, there was only a small hiccup at the start before things proceeded smoothly — even producing noteworthy results, which they offered to Qin Jiang as tuition.

When it came time for one-on-one instruction, both women wanted to go first. They glared at each other, on the verge of another argument, when Qin Jiang grabbed them both.

"No fighting." He kissed each on the lips. "You're doing this together. Final answer."

Before either could protest, he began the lesson in earnest. The preview had smoothed the way — after a brief initial adjustment, everything flowed beautifully, and they proved to be exceptional learners.
