Day three of An Xihe's seclusion.

A pillar of blinding light erupted from the heart of the Chaos District—the nexus of all her formations—and instantly, the great array that had lain dormant over the entire Central Regions roared to life, unleashing its full power. Spiritual energy from every direction was wrenched toward the Chaos District in torrents.

Simultaneously, secondary formations materialized across Azure Cloud Heaven, ringing the Central Regions. They activated in concert, each serving its designated purpose. They weren't just siphoning spiritual energy—they were draining Azure Cloud Heaven's origin power itself. If that origin was depleted, the damage to the entire realm would be catastrophic.

Qin Jiang was aware of this. He didn't particularly care. He wasn't from Azure Cloud Heaven, after all. Using this realm's origin power to fuel his wife's Immortal King breakthrough seemed like an excellent trade. If Azure Cloud Heaven suffered for it, that was Azure Cloud Heaven's problem. Worst case, they'd move somewhere else.

Spiritual energy poured toward the Central Regions from every corner of the realm, alarming cultivators everywhere. Azure Cloud Heaven erupted into chaos. Most people could only feel the spiritual energy draining away—they lacked the sensitivity to detect the origin power being siphoned alongside it.

Until—

From the eastern reaches of the Central Regions, a titanic aura burst forth, sweeping toward the Chaos District with oppressive force.

Qin Jiang was still lounging in the courtyard, head pillowed on Xue Mei's lap, thoroughly enjoying himself. She frowned and looked east. A True Immortal's aura.

Qing Chan appeared before them. "It's the Limitless Holy Land's ancestor."

Qin Jiang nodded. "Ignore it. They can't get through—not yet."

Although every preparation within the Chaos District was already in place, An Xihe had deployed her trapping formations as an extra layer of insurance. They'd been set up hastily and wouldn't hold for long—a month at most.

After that month, the True Immortals would break free, and the real battle would begin. But that was fine. The Immortal Path Laws they carried wouldn't be going anywhere.

In the meantime, Qin Jiang intended to spend the waiting period with his women.

After the Limitless Holy Land ancestor, four more True Immortal auras erupted from beyond the Central Regions. But no matter how violently they raged, none could break free. Distant roars of fury echoed across the land—five True Immortals, trapped and furious.

"An Xihe's formations really are terrifying," Qing Chan marveled. "Five True Immortals, just like that."

She and An Xihe had become close friends by now, spending enough time together to genuinely appreciate each other.

Hearing her praise, Qin Jiang grinned. "If I weren't around, you might've gotten the same treatment."

"..."

Qing Chan's smile froze. She shot him a withering look and grabbed a spirit fruit, stuffing it directly into his mouth to shut him up.

Xue Mei, whose lap was still serving as Qin Jiang's pillow, laughed softly. She plucked the fruit from his mouth and spoke up. "Qing Chan is far too clever and careful to fall for something like that."

"Hmph. See? At least Xue Mei understands me." Qing Chan preened.

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. Clever and careful? Applied to Qing Chan? In the Central Regions, she was famous for being a bull in a china shop. But before he could say anything, Xue Mei had already sliced the spirit fruit into pieces and was gently feeding them to him. Much better than Qing Chan's aggressive approach.

Before long, the other women drifted over. Upon learning that no enemies would arrive for a while, they found themselves with nothing to do—so they gathered around Qin Jiang, naturally, looking to warm up with him before the storm.

---

Chen Qi'er, still hunting for Chen Changsheng, felt the sudden upheaval. The energy shift startled him.

Sensing the currents flowing toward the Chaos District, he frowned. Something felt wrong. Reaching out with his senses, he detected not just spiritual energy but something else—something far more fundamental being drawn toward the Chaos District.

"Is that... Azure Cloud Heaven's origin power?"

The realization hit like a thunderbolt. He stared toward the Chaos District, utterly baffled. Whatever was happening there, one thing was certain: draining a realm's origin power would devastate every cultivator living in it.

He looked toward the five distant points where True Immortal auras were raging. That explained their fury—they'd sensed the origin loss too.

"Wait—they're trapped?"

The five True Immortals were howling and thrashing but going nowhere. Chen Qi'er felt a chill. Whatever entity could imprison five True Immortals at once was beyond terrifying.

"The Chaos District..." he murmured, eyes glinting.

He was perfectly aware of the forces surrounding Qin Jiang. Right now, he didn't stand a chance against them. Even if he captured Chen Changsheng, the most it would achieve was annoying Qin Jiang. And Chen Changsheng had gotten away regardless.

But this entity in the Chaos District—someone who could drain a realm's origin power and casually trap five True Immortals—now, if he could befriend that kind of powerhouse, dealing with Qin Jiang would be trivial.

And if the origin power was being concentrated in one place, there might be scraps to claim. Azure Cloud Heaven's origin power. Even a sliver of it could push him to the threshold of True Immortal in short order.

The thought set his blood racing.

What he failed to notice was that two True Immortals were conspicuously absent from the trapped five—Qing Chan and Dao Zhen. Or perhaps, even knowing the full picture, he would have come regardless. Azure Cloud Heaven's origin power was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He couldn't let it pass.

Fortune favored the bold. His entire cultivation had been built on charging into danger. Risk and reward were two sides of the same coin.

Decision made, Chen Qi'er abandoned the hunt for Chen Changsheng and headed for the Chaos District with Chen Wuming in tow.

Meanwhile, Chen Changsheng—still on the run—had sensed the disturbance as well. Ten lifetimes of accumulated insight let him detect the origin power too. After a moment's hesitation, he turned toward the Chaos District. If he could absorb even a fraction of that origin power and combine it with his ten-life fusion, his strength would skyrocket.

Then he'd settle his score with Qin Jiang. And that androgynous freak—he hadn't forgotten. That one was absolutely not getting away.
