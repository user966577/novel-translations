While Qin Jiang and his entourage were enjoying their scenic tour of Azure Cloud Heaven—

BOOM.

A deafening explosion rocked the heavens. Then, before countless horrified eyes, the sky itself split open.

Blinding golden light spilled through the fracture, and a pressure so immense it defied comprehension poured forth. In an instant, the radiance engulfed the entirety of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Qin Jiang's group tensed.

An Xihe, the strongest among them, immediately stepped forward, shielding the others. She raised her gaze to the golden light, her expression grave. The aura emanating from it dwarfed her own by an incomprehensible margin.

Her energy surged protectively around the group.

"Don't do anything rash," Qin Jiang said, gripping her hand. His eyes narrowed as he studied the phenomenon, already scrolling through the system's arsenal. His accumulated Villain Points could still buy some nasty surprises if a true threat materialized.

Then, within the golden light, a towering silhouette appeared — features indistinguishable, but the sheer weight of authority radiating from it was suffocating. Across the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, countless beings crumpled to their knees, prostrating in worship and terror.

An Xihe's face was stone. "If this being attacks," she said quietly, "I can't stop it."

Its power eclipsed hers entirely. The creature's realm was likely above Immortal King — far above.

That something this powerful would appear in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands...

"It's fine. You've got me." Qin Jiang squeezed her hand reassuringly.

The words had barely left his lips when the titanic figure raised an arm. A golden decree unfurled across the sky, stretching from horizon to horizon.

"THE GRAND SOVEREIGN'S DECREE!"

The voice was cataclysmic, reverberating through every corner of every realm.

"The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands have produced an Immortal King, meeting the standard for a Level Two Domain. By decree — a Heavenly Domain passage shall be established!"

As the last syllable rang out, the golden radiance flooding the world contracted, condensing before the towering figure into a swirling vortex. Spatial energy churned within it, clearly connecting to another world entirely.

Step through, and you would enter that other world.

Every eye fixed on the vortex. The True Immortals of the Nine Heavens stared with naked hunger — at their current level, they'd hit a ceiling in this world. If they wanted to advance further, this Heavenly Domain might be the key.

"The passage is established! It will open in thirty years. At that time, those who meet the requirements may enter the Heavenly Domain."

Thirty years. A blink to cultivators of their caliber. Plenty of time to prepare. The only question was what "requirements" meant.

"The Heavenly Domain?" Qin Jiang's group exchanged glances, then looked to An Xihe. The passage had been triggered by her — she was the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands' first Immortal King, the achievement that elevated this world to Level Two Domain status.

"Have any of you heard of the Heavenly Domain?"

They all shook their heads. They hadn't even known that worlds were ranked by levels.

"Level Two," An Xihe murmured. "I'm the strongest cultivator in this world, and my breakthrough only qualified us for Level Two? There must be Level One domains above us — maybe more. In those places, Immortal Kings are probably as common as True Immortals are here. Maybe less so."

"The Heavenly Domain will be more powerful than anything we've faced," Qin Jiang said, meeting each woman's gaze. "And more dangerous. We have thirty years to get stronger."

He had no doubt they would go. It was the same trajectory as before — Qin Domain to Azure Cloud Heaven, and now Azure Cloud Heaven to the Heavenly Domain. Always ascending.

Thirty years was enough to prepare.

The women nodded.

High above, the titanic figure still lingered. Qin Jiang glanced up.

"Hm?"

The being's gaze seemed to be aimed directly at him.

Then it spoke again:

"Additionally — the Grand Sovereign's spoken decree: That thief Qin Jiang! After entering the Heavenly Domain, behave yourself and stay away from my daughter! Otherwise, I will break your legs!"

Qin Jiang's mind went blank.

Every woman in his group turned to stare at him. This man had connections to a being of this magnitude? No — not to this messenger, but to whoever stood behind it. The "Grand Sovereign."

And apparently Qin Jiang had been pursuing the Grand Sovereign's daughter?

Since when? How? They hadn't heard a word about this! Who was this daughter? Had they met her?

Curiosity mixed with suspicion. Had Qin Jiang been hiding a woman from them?

Across the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, billions of souls were equally baffled. Who was this "Qin Jiang"? How brazen did you have to be to go after a Grand Sovereign's daughter?

Well, he'd been warned now. Served him right.

Those who did know Qin Jiang — particularly the members of Huaxia Manor — stared slack-jawed.

Qin Jiang? Their beloved Manor Lord?

So that was why the Celestial Formation Fairy had chosen him — the man had backing at the highest possible level! A Grand Sovereign's warning? Most people couldn't get noticed by a Grand Sovereign if they tried. The fact that he'd been personally called out spoke to extraordinary status.

In short order, Huaxia Manor's loyalty ticked up another notch. They were already calculating how to double their efforts — if they could win their dear Manor Lord's favor, the sky was the limit.

Some even speculated that An Xihe's breakthrough to Immortal King had been Qin Jiang's doing. On that particular point, they weren't wrong.

Back at the Qin family estate, nobody had forgotten their young master either. And like Huaxia Manor, they didn't care one whit about the Grand Sovereign's threat.

Instead, they were cheering him on. If Qin Jiang actually won the Grand Sovereign's daughter, that made them family. What father-in-law was really going to break his son-in-law's legs?

They didn't believe it for a second.

So their unanimous verdict: Go for it. Definitely try. Win the Grand Sovereign's daughter at all costs.
