The remaining twelve hadn't turned out to be fortune heroines, but they were handpicked beauties nonetheless, and genuinely impressive. With Qin Jiang's nature, there was no way he'd let them go.

However, the priority right now was Wu Yingtao. As for the rest, he couldn't just leave them standing around. He thought for a moment, then spoke. "Your cultivation levels are all a bit low. How about attending Huaxia Academy first?"

The Academy already housed quite a few exceptional women—all reserved by Qin Jiang. Might as well send these along too. Stockpiling.

The women were all clever enough to understand his implication immediately. This was an opportunity, and their respective factions needed a connection to Huaxia. Besides, as things stood, Qin Jiang was their best prospect for the future.

They looked at him and nodded. "We're willing."

"Good. I'll arrange an escort. Once you arrive at Huaxia Academy, someone will take care of you." He smiled. The women bowed in gratitude, and he kept them at his side for the time being.

As for the assembled faction leaders, Qin Jiang swept his gaze over them. "Wait here."

Without further explanation, he brought the women back aboard the airship. After settling them temporarily, he began reviewing the system spoilers.

The Child of Destiny was none other than Wu Yingtao's brother—Wu Tian.

Originally unremarkable in talent, he'd undergone a transformation that seemed almost like cheating. His cultivation had skyrocketed.

The spoilers revealed the reason. This man's origins were extraordinary. He was a reincarnated powerhouse—and not from the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. He hailed from the Heavenly Domain, where he'd already been an Immortal Emperor. Arrogant and domineering, he'd made enemies everywhere, and when he attempted a breakthrough to an even higher realm, he was ambushed.

The breakthrough failed. Wu Tian perished.

But fortune favored him. His primordial spirit, unconscious and drifting, somehow entered the cycle of reincarnation and was reborn here in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, in the body of Wu Tian.

Previously, his talent had been mediocre because his primordial spirit had been dormant, suppressing his body's natural gifts. But now the primordial spirit had awakened.

He was an Immortal Emperor!

Of course, he'd learned from his past life's mistakes. No more arrogance—he kept his head down, endured every slight, and lived like a coward.

Yet as a Child of Destiny, even if he didn't seek trouble, trouble would find him. There was no hiding from it.

Like right now. Wu Tian hadn't provoked Qin Jiang, but Qin Jiang had decided to provoke him. Still, facing a reincarnated Immortal Emperor, caution was warranted. He couldn't push too hard. Who knew what trump cards a former Immortal Emperor might be hiding? Qin Jiang couldn't afford even a sliver of risk.

That said, such a powerful figure produced substantially richer Villain Points and rewards. Just bringing Wu Yingtao into his fold had triggered a jackpot. Beyond the Villain Points, there were treasures that An Xihe needed. She was inching ever closer to Immortal Emperor herself.

Once she broke through, facing a reincarnated Immortal Emperor wouldn't be nearly as daunting. After all, the current Wu Tian was at best an Immortal Emperor's remnant soul. He couldn't possibly exert his full power. A complete Immortal Emperor could crush him with ease.

After reviewing the spoilers, Qin Jiang went to find Wu Yingtao. This girl wasn't ordinary either.

Her bloodline was special—belonging to a God Race from the Heavenly Domain. Extremely powerful. The bloodline was diluted, almost gone, but even so, it had suppressed the Wu family's own bloodline. This meant Wu Yingtao wasn't suited for Wu family cultivation methods—or rather, no method other than the God Race's would work for her. So her talent had never manifested.

According to the spoilers, only after reaching the Heavenly Domain would her bloodline be detected by the God Race, finally allowing her gifts to emerge.

The bloodline's origin traced back to a God Race powerhouse who'd once traveled the myriad realms, visiting the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands and leaving behind a romantic entanglement. That union became the Wu family's progenitor. But without the God Race's specialized cultivation methods, the bloodline faded with each generation. After countless years, it had virtually disappeared.

Wu Yingtao was the exception—a lucky throwback. Her bloodline had partially reverted, reawakening the God Race lineage. Though still diluted, with the right cultivation method, it could be purified.

Moreover, this God Race had remarkably few members. Only a few thousand. Yet those few thousand were powerful enough to earn the title of God Race. Their strength was rooted entirely in their bloodline—anyone who possessed it would reach True Immortal at minimum upon maturity. The denser the bloodline, the greater the power.

Qin Jiang planned to help Wu Yingtao awaken her bloodline early. On one hand, it would earn her affection. On the other, once they reached the Heavenly Domain, her bloodline would give him leverage with the God Race. While they weren't the strongest faction there, they ranked in the top ten. Quite the status. Few dared provoke them, and because their bloodline was so rare, they were extraordinarily united—even warmly welcoming members who'd been separated from the tribe.

So there was no need to worry about Wu Yingtao's bloodline causing problems.

When Wu Yingtao saw him, she was still nervous. She stood quickly, head slightly bowed. "Greetings, Manor Lord Qin."

"No need for formalities." He stepped forward, took her hand, and tilted her chin up with the other. "Don't you know what it means to be chosen by me?"

"I... I know."

"Then what should you be calling me?"

Her lips parted. According to the clan, this was essentially a wife selection. If she'd been chosen, then she should call him... husband?

But she couldn't bring herself to say it.

She glanced at him, face burning crimson, and shook her head. Nothing came out.

Seeing this, Qin Jiang didn't push. He took her hand and sat them both down. "Your cultivation level is a bit low."

"I don't have much talent," she whispered.

She and Wu Tian had both been unremarkable, but now that Wu Tian's cultivation had surged, she'd been funneling most of her resources to him. Her already slow cultivation had slowed even further.
