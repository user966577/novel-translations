After extensive practice, Xue Yue's lips were visibly swollen. Only then did Qin Jiang call it a day.

"Are we done?" she asked quietly.

He smiled and nodded. "You've got the basics down. But there's an advanced version I'd recommend you learn as well."

"Advanced version?" She blinked. Kissing was kissing — how did you upgrade it? 'Well, knowing this man, even if I refuse, he'll force me.'

She nodded. "Tomorrow, then?"

"Sure." He leaned down, kissed her cheek, and said, "That's it for today."

They walked to the gate hand-in-hand. He opened it and smiled. "Same time tomorrow."

"Mm."

"Oh — the advanced version might get your clothes wet. Bring a change."

She didn't understand why, but she nodded anyway. At the gate, she looked at him. "I'll be going?"

"Hold on."

He grinned and leaned toward her. She blushed, instantly understanding, and rose on her toes to plant a quick kiss on his cheek. The moment she did, he swept her into his arms and kissed her deeply — not letting go until she was gasping for air.

She pressed a hand to his chest, breathless and flushed. "You... you're terrible!"

"Just showing you the gap between our skills."

She shot him a look. Her first kiss had been today — of course she couldn't match him yet. But with enough practice, she'd catch up.

"I'm leaving!"

"See you tomorrow."

He watched her walk away until she vanished from sight, then returned to the courtyard, closed the gate, and eyed the bedrooms. He licked his lips. "They should all be rested by now, right?"

Rubbing his hands together, he strode toward one of the rooms with a broad grin on his face.

Meanwhile, Xue Yue returned home to find Nangong Yun waiting for her.

"You — what are you doing here?" She tensed, instantly guilty.

He hadn't noticed her unease. "I was looking for you. Where have you been? Nobody's seen you."

"Nowhere. Just out for a walk. What do you want?"

She deflected quickly, and Nangong Yun didn't press — but his gaze dropped to her lips, and his brow furrowed. "What happened to your mouth? Are you hurt?"

She touched her lips and flashed back to kissing Qin Jiang. Her cheeks colored. 'That jerk — he kissed them swollen!' She'd definitely push back tomorrow. She couldn't let him be so reckless. Then again, tomorrow was the advanced version. She wondered what that entailed. And why she'd need extra clothes — how did kissing make your clothes wet?

Her thoughts spiraled, and she nearly forgot Nangong Yun was standing right there.

"Xue Yue?"

She snapped back. "I saw some berries earlier. Turns out they were poisonous — that's why my lips are a bit swollen."

"Poisoned? Do you need an antidote pill?"

"No, it's minor. It'll heal on its own." She waved him off. "Just tell me what you need."

Once, she'd longed for time with Nangong Yun. But he'd always been chasing Weiwei, keeping her at arm's length. Now, inexplicably, all she wanted was to send him away so time would pass faster and she could see that jerk again.

'Have I moved on?' She looked at Nangong Yun and felt nothing. 'No! Impossible! I'm only cooperating with him for my clansmen. Absolutely not because I like him!'

She'd drifted into thoughts of Qin Jiang again, her expression cycling through several emotions.

"Xue Yue, are you sure you're alright?"

"I'm fine. Just tell me what you need."

"The alliance has been in a slump, so I was hoping to maybe borrow the Blood Tribe's name. With that kind of backing, we could grow strong in no time."

Her face went cold. This fool wanted to drag the Blood Tribe into his doomed rebellion? Huaxia's power was common knowledge. Nangong Yun's own family had been destroyed for opposing them, and now he wanted to put her people on the front line? That was a death sentence.

"No! Don't even think about dragging the Blood Tribe into the Anti-Huaxia Alliance. Me staying here is already the limit. As for the Blood Tribe — forget it."
