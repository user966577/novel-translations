After being thoroughly shaken down, Dao Zhen and Dao Kun finally departed the palace, their faces as black as the bottom of a pot.

They walked in smoldering silence for quite some time before Dao Zhen suddenly wheeled around, glaring at Dao Kun.

"Uh... Ancestor, please don't look at me like that."

Dao Kun shrank back. Dao Zhen's sneer was the only warning he got before the slap landed.

"That disciple of yours! She's had the sect's supreme method for a few days and she's already given it away!"

"Ow!"

Dao Kun yelped. Injury upon injury.

Dao Zhen wasn't finished. He wound up again. "And that brat had the nerve to ask me for gifts! In my entire life, it's always been me taking other people's gifts. No one has ever extorted me!"

"That wasn't me who asked, Ancestor—"

"It was your disciple's man!"

Thwack. Thwack. Thwack.

After a thorough beating, Dao Zhen's mood improved considerably. He looked down at Dao Kun sprawled on the ground and snorted. "Stop playing dead. I barely used any force."

Dao Kun scrambled to his feet, mouth twitching violently. 'Barely any force?' If he'd gone all out, would he have killed me?

'Dear disciple, you've really done your teacher in this time.'

"Ahem... Ancestor, are we still going to try separating Qin Jiang and Baizhe?"

Dao Zhen exhaled deeply. He looked back toward the palace for a long moment, then shook his head. "Let nature take its course."

"Wonderful." Dao Kun's face lit up. His precious disciple had finally found love—he truly didn't want to interfere.

But with Dao Zhen watching, he quickly schooled his expression into neutrality. The old man glanced at him.

"Drop the act. I was the one who lost perspective this time. Dao Follows Nature—let things unfold as they will."

He closed his eyes. He'd spent his whole life refusing to meddle in others' affairs. Qin Jiang's fortune had genuinely alarmed him, driving him to try again and again to keep his distance. But fate, it seemed, could not be denied. The Human Dao Sect was destined to be entangled with Qin Jiang. Forcing separation might invite even worse consequences.

After a moment, he opened his eyes. The dark cloud of fortune still hung over the palace, but his expression was calm, even serene.

"From now on, there's no need to keep Qin Jiang at arm's length."

In the ruined temple, Chen Wuming's expression was grim, his eyes flickering with indecision.

That day, he'd taken some of Chen Qi'er's cultivation resources and traded them for a spirit stone. With it, he'd joined the Human Dao Sect's outer sect. During the enrollment process, he'd casually probed the registrar.

"Sir, in the world of cultivation, would anyone help a stranger for no reason?"

"Absolutely not." The registrar's answer was emphatic. "Don't ever expect gifts from heaven. The cultivation world is unbelievably cruel. No one helps a stranger without a motive. If someone is being generous, it's because you have something they want."

The words had sent a chill down Chen Wuming's spine. A Human Dao Sect registrar was as close to an official authority as a common person could find—surely trustworthy.

He'd pressed further. "But I'm just a beggar. What could anyone possibly want from me?"

"Plenty." The registrar's reply startled him even more. "The cultivation world is full of demonic cultivators. To them, your flesh and blood, even your emotions, can serve as nourishment. Some will even raise a mortal, help them grow strong, and then harvest them—the yield is far greater that way. Demonic cultivators have all manner of methods. Never trust anyone blindly, or you'll pay with your life."

Those words echoed relentlessly in Chen Wuming's mind. He'd stumbled back to the temple in a daze, all thoughts of cultivation forgotten. Between Black Dragon's warning and the registrar's confirmation, his suspicion had hardened into near-certainty.

Chen Qi'er was a demonic cultivator.

He was fattening Chen Wuming up for slaughter. Why else would a stranger lavish resources on a nobody beggar? In the cultivation world, nothing came free. Chen Qi'er's generosity was an investment—and the return would be Chen Wuming's life.

"I won't let him succeed!"

He clenched his fists, convinced he'd uncovered the truth. But how could he escape a demonic cultivator's grasp? Chen Qi'er was enormously powerful. Even Black Dragon, the only person who'd shown him the truth, seemed wary of the man. Finding him again would be difficult, and even then, Black Dragon might not help.

The warning alone had been an enormous kindness. Without it, he'd still be in the dark, thinking Chen Qi'er was his savior.

Chen Wuming punched the ground, pouring out his frustration and helplessness. He was too weak—powerless against any real threat.

Just then, a figure flashed into the temple and vanished again before he could react. The next instant, several more figures burst through the entrance, bristling with killing intent. The pressure froze Chen Wuming in place.

"A beggar? Did you see someone come through here?"

Chen Wuming trembled, pointing in a random direction. A blade of energy swept toward him, and his world went black.

Black Dragon materialized a moment later—he'd been the first figure, the one who'd vanished. He checked on Chen Wuming and breathed a sigh of relief, then turned to the other men.

"Nice acting."

"Heh heh, Boss, we all got our start in the theater. Cons and grift—that's our bread and butter!"

"Enough bragging. Get lost."

"Yes sir!"

The men grinned and scattered. After a while, Black Dragon knelt beside Chen Wuming and fed him a pill. The boy stirred, eyes blurry.

"Kid. You alright?"

Black Dragon patted his cheek. Chen Wuming's focus returned, and recognition flared. "Senior, it's you!"

"Tough little bastard. That slash just barely missed your vitals."

Black Dragon smiled, then continued. "But I should thank you—if you hadn't pointed them in the wrong direction, I might've been done for."
