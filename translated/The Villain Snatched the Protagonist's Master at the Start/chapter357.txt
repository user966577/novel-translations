Qin Domain. Qin family estate.

Qin Jiang had spent an entire day on official business. Afterward, he squeezed in a visit to his grandfather to brief him on Huaxia Academy and ask him to select talented Qin family disciples for enrollment. He also hadn't forgotten the older generation — he asked the old man to survey their resource needs and promised to provide whatever they required.

Simple as that, everything was handled.

But Qin Jiang wasn't idle yet. There was one more thing that demanded his personal attention: accompanying his wives on visits to their families.

Women like Ye Ling'er and Chen Ningbing had been away for years. Now that they were back in Qin Domain, they naturally wanted to go home.

"Let's start with the Chen family," Qin Jiang said, taking Chen Ningbing's hand.

The Chen family was a Qin family vassal and geographically the closest.

Her eyes lit up, and she nodded immediately. "Okay~"

Qin Jiang kept things low-key — no palace, no entourage. He simply took Chen Ningbing's hand, and at Human Immortal speed, they arrived at Azure City Town in under fifteen minutes.

Looking around, Qin Jiang smiled. He squeezed her hand. "This is where you held that tournament for a bride."

"Which you crashed," Chen Ningbing said, rolling her eyes.

Back then, Qin Jiang had been supremely arrogant. He'd beaten her challenger, then ordered the stage demolished and hauled her back to the Chen family. Not long after that, she'd given herself to him.

Looking back, she counted herself lucky. Without Qin Jiang, she might have spent her whole life trapped in this small town — or been married off to some slightly stronger family, living out an unremarkable existence.

She looked up at Qin Jiang and smiled. What she had now — this was the best possible outcome.

Qin Jiang's gaze had drifted to where the tournament stage once stood. A mischievous grin spread across his face. "Bing'er, what if you held another one?"

"What for?"

"Hehe. We skipped a few steps last time. Let me make it up to you."

Chen Ningbing was intrigued despite herself. Their courtship had been... abrupt. A do-over sounded rather nice.

"Alright," she agreed, then fixed him with a look. "But you have to be the first one on stage. I'm not fighting anyone else."

"Obviously. Can't have a Human Immortal tournament and let mortals participate — that would be bullying. They can watch."

"Isn't that a bit... you know. Like they're props?"

Chen Ningbing considered the word for a moment and landed on a precisely accurate one. "Playthings?"

It felt a little strange, but if Qin Jiang wanted to play, she was game.

Within minutes, a new tournament stage materialized. Passing cultivators gathered, drawn by the commotion.

"A bride tournament? This feels familiar."

"Of course it does. Years ago, the Chen family's eldest daughter held one — that's how she met the lord of Qin Domain. It's what launched the Chen family to prominence."

"Someone's copying the idea?"

"Wait — doesn't the woman on stage look awfully familiar?"

"She looks a lot like the Chen daughter, actually."

"You don't think that is the Chen daughter...?"

People began to recognize her, and those who'd been eyeing the stage with interest immediately backed off, hiding in the crowd.

Chen Ningbing stood atop the platform, expression cool and regal — just as she'd been that day. She swept a glance toward Qin Jiang, then spoke in a clear, detached voice:

"Defeat me. Win my approval. Become my husband."

The same words. But where those words had once sparked excitement, the crowd now stood in deathly silence, eyes averted.

Nobody dared move. Nobody dared leave, either. Who knew what game Chen Ningbing was playing?

Had she and that man fought?

Speculation buzzed, but no one was foolish enough to get involved. Better to stand quietly and play the part of living scenery.

Then Qin Jiang sauntered out, all rakish confidence, his eyes roaming over her appreciatively.

"Miss Chen — if I win, do we head straight to the bridal chamber?"

Chen Ningbing's eye twitched. Years ago, another challenger had asked the exact same question with the exact same smirk.

She'd been disgusted then. With Qin Jiang, it was called flirting.

She huffed and nodded. "Beat me, and I'm yours to do with as you please."

"Ha! Excellent!"

Qin Jiang leapt onto the stage.

The onlookers watched him with a mixture of pity and admiration. What a brave fool. Didn't he know this woman belonged to Qin Domain's ruler? Win or lose, stepping onto that stage was a death sentence.

That man had destroyed entire clans over less. There were stories about him snatching a bride right out of another man's wedding — and punishing the groom for not holding the door properly.

They shook their heads at Qin Jiang's retreating back. Youth and lust — a dangerous combination.

While the crowd mourned for the foolhardy stranger, the two began to "fight."

And what a fight it was.

No force whatsoever. Exaggerated slow-motion movements. The crowd stared in bewilderment.

But Qin Jiang and Chen Ningbing performed their roles with gusto — shouting, grunting, and narrating the action as though locked in mortal combat.

"Miss Chen is truly a prodigy among prodigies! Such formidable strength! But alas — still no match for this young master!"

"Hmph, show me your real power. This won't be enough to beat me!"

"Take this palm strike!"

"Ow — I'll bite you!"

"Hey, no biting!"

"Hmph, I'll bite and I'll pinch!"

"Ow! That hurt!"

Qin Jiang winced — she'd gotten a good twist on his waist.

"Hehe, give up. You're no match for me."

"Give up? I haven't shown my ultimate move yet!"

"Ah! You jerk — where are you grabbing?! Stop it, people are watching!"

"Hehe. Does Miss Chen surrender?"

Their theatrical duel continued on stage while the spectators below oscillated between confusion and dawning comprehension.

Some figured it out, and their expressions went dark.

They really were just background decoration.
