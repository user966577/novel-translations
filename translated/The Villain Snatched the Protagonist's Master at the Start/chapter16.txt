The next day.

Qin Jiang stepped out of the room, silently marveling at how smoothly everything had gone.

[Ding. Host has altered a major plotline.

Reward: Heavenless Sword (Great Emperor remnant artifact).

Reward: Sword Intent (allows Host to comprehend Sword Intent).

Reward: Seven Beauties Painting (empty; can house seven women, rapidly elevating them to the Supreme Realm. As Host's power grows, so does theirs. Host lives, they live. Host dies, they die).

Reward: Saint Ascension Pills x1 bottle (20 pills; can help a Unity Realm cultivator at Great Perfection break through to the Saint Realm).

Reward: Villain Points.]

The system's voice rang through his mind.

Qin Jiang sucked in a sharp breath at the cascade of rewards.

A Great Emperor remnant artifact!

In this era, anything associated with the word "Emperor" was extraordinary.

As far as Qin Jiang knew, the Qin family possessed one complete Emperor artifact, but it would only be brought out in the direst of existential crises.

Most ancient clans considered themselves fortunate just to own a Great Emperor remnant artifact. The Ye family—Ye Ling'er's clan—probably didn't even have one, placing them firmly at the bottom among the ancient clans.

And now the system had handed him one directly.

Beyond that, Sword Intent comprehension and the Seven Beauties Painting also delighted him.

The Saint Ascension Pills were slightly less remarkable but still extremely valuable.

They could push someone to the Saint Realm—something the Qin family didn't have many of. Moreover, anyone who could break through on their own talent shouldn't rely on pills, as they would affect one's foundation and hinder future growth.

Then there were the Villain Points, which could buy plenty of treasures from the system shop.

"Not bad."

Qin Jiang nodded in satisfaction.

He suspected this bounty wasn't from Chen Ningbing alone—Ye Ling'er's contributions had stacked with hers, producing these lavish rewards.

At the courtyard entrance, Black Dragon stood guard. Chen Lie hovered nearby, worry written on his face.

At last, Qin Jiang emerged.

Chen Lie rushed over.

"Young sir, my daughter—"

"Relax. Ningbing is fine. She's resting."

Qin Jiang smiled.

The casual way he used her name made Chen Lie's heart leap—then sink, a bittersweet feeling washing over him.

Still, it was a good thing.

As long as this young man cherished his daughter, she'd never suffer.

And Chen Lie had full confidence in his daughter's looks.

She'd definitely be favored.

As they walked out of the Chen estate, Qin Jiang glanced at the surrounding guards.

"Withdraw these men."

"Yes, sir."

Black Dragon immediately relayed the order, and the guards dispersed.

Chen Lie, still trailing behind Qin Jiang, breathed a sigh of relief as the blockade lifted. Having the city lord's manor surrounded wasn't exactly a good look.

"Assign a squad of women to guard Ningbing's safety."

Qin Jiang gave one more instruction.

Before long, arrangements were in place, and Qin Jiang left the Chen estate.

---

Back at the restaurant, Ye Ling'er sat by the window, chin propped in her hand, lost in thought.

Qin Jiang walked up behind her and gently wrapped his arms around her.

He felt her body stiffen immediately.

Her face flushed crimson.

She didn't turn around. Qin Jiang's scent was familiar enough.

Compared to Chen Ningbing, Ye Ling'er was like a timid little rabbit.

So pitifully adorable that one's heart ached—while simultaneously wanting to make her cry.

Qin Jiang held her close and said softly:

"Xiao Fan should be leaving soon. Want to go see him off?"

"No~"

Ye Ling'er shook her head.

The last person she wanted to see right now was Xiao Fan.

Partly because she was genuinely disappointed in him, and partly because she didn't know how to face him.

Moreover, Qin Jiang was gradually occupying a place in her heart. After all...

He'd taken her innocence.

That was an undeniable fact.

Perhaps before long, his presence in her heart would only grow larger.

She didn't understand why.

Logic told her she should hate Qin Jiang. But deep down, she was slowly accepting him.

The contradiction tore at her.

"Let's go see him. You need closure."

Qin Jiang said.

Ye Ling'er's expression grew complicated. She understood—Qin Jiang was asking her to cut ties with Xiao Fan for good.

She was quiet for a while before nodding.

"Alright."

---

A secluded corner of town. A ramshackle courtyard. Xiao Fan was gnawing on a stale, rock-hard bun.

He chewed with murderous intensity.

"Qin Jiang... Qin Jiang..."

Hatred dripped from every syllable.

Yesterday, Qin Jiang's soundwave had knocked him unconscious. When he'd come to, he'd been dumped in a garbage heap, reeking from head to toe.

Worse, with Qin Jiang still in town, he was too afraid of being targeted. He'd skulked around until he found this abandoned courtyard and slipped inside.

The bun in his hand? Fished out of the garbage.

His life could only be described as wretched.

And then—

"He's in here?"

A familiar voice made Xiao Fan stiffen. Then elation flooded through him.

'That's Ling'er!'

He scrambled to the door and yanked it open—only for the smile to freeze on his face.

Qin Jiang was naturally at Ye Ling'er's side.

"Ugh, it stinks!"

Ye Ling'er wrinkled her nose, immediately pinching it shut and waving her hand. She stumbled several steps backward.

Only then did she realize the person at the door was Xiao Fan.

But she didn't know how deeply those few backward steps had cut him.

His last shred of pride shattered in that instant.

"Xiao Fan... Xiao Fan, you..."

Seeing his state, Ye Ling'er was stunned. What had happened to him?

He looked worse than a beggar.

Filthy robes, greasy hair, a grime-streaked face, and a blackened bun clutched in his hand...

In that moment, she couldn't suppress a twinge of revulsion.

She looked at Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang shrugged.

"This wasn't my doing..."

He grinned. Ye Ling'er's face flushed instantly, and her hand darted up to cover his mouth.

She knew all too well—this man would say anything.

"Don't say it~"

Her voice was pleading, with a hint of coquettishness.

Qin Jiang smiled and nodded.

Ye Ling'er relaxed, her gaze returning to Xiao Fan. Her brows knit together.
