They spent an entire day in the hidden space before returning to the main room.

Qin Jiang and Murong Qing were curled up together, cheeks touching, whispering and stealing the occasional kiss.

Murong Qing stood and walked to the side table, returning with a fruit platter. She set it before Qin Jiang, her face faintly pink. "Here. They've been soaking in the hot spring. Your favorites."

"Hot spring soaked?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

He picked up a spirit fruit, examined it, and shook his head. "These aren't fresh."

"What do you mean? I prepared them right before you arrived. They're perfectly fresh!"

Qin Jiang held the fruit in one hand and wrapped his other arm around Murong Qing. A wicked grin spread across his face. "Heh, I prefer eating them straight from the hot spring."

"You're terrible~" Murong Qing blushed and gave his chest a light slap. After a moment's hesitation, she said, "Should I... put them back in?"

"Allow me."

Qin Jiang winked. Murong Qing shot him a look but nodded, making the preparations.

He placed the spirit fruit inside with a cheeky grin, and even thoughtfully sealed things up afterward.

Murong Qing's cheeks burned. She leaned against him, her body growing languid. "Give it a minute."

"Mm. Needs a good soak."

They waited about fifteen minutes before Murong Qing murmured, "Should be ready."

"Let's see."

She opened up, and Qin Jiang peered in. The spirit fruit glistened, jewel-bright and impossibly enticing even at a glance.

"Time to taste."

Qin Jiang licked his lips, leaned in, and with a soft pop, drew the fruit into his mouth. He bit down—bursting with juice.

His eyes lit up. "Excellent. Juicy. I love it."

"There's more." Murong Qing gestured to the platter, still holding several spirit fruits. They were small enough that a few could fit at once.

Grinning, Qin Jiang picked up a handful and placed them inside one after another.

"That's too many~" Murong Qing bit her lip and swatted his hand away, her voice a breathy protest. How many was he going to stuff in there?

"That should do it," he said, satisfied.

But this small batch certainly wouldn't be enough. Once these were gone, he'd need to reload.

And so, over the course of several hours, Murong Qing fed Qin Jiang until he was fully sated.

She slumped against his chest, drained. "Shouldn't you be heading back?"

"No rush."

"Xue Yue will notice."

"Still worried about getting caught, Qing'er?" Qin Jiang teased.

She shot him an exasperated look. "Best if she doesn't."

She'd come to accept that their relationship could go public, but ideally, the secret would hold a while longer. The thrill was half the fun—and she genuinely didn't know if Xue Yue could handle the truth.

What she didn't know was that Xue Yue had known everything from the start, had been acting her part all along, and had long been waiting for a chance to join in.

"Best if she doesn't, hm?" Qin Jiang smiled. "Funny—some of the things you've done lately haven't exactly been discreet."

Murong Qing's face reddened. Things had gotten a bit out of hand recently. Several times, they'd come dangerously close to being caught. But looking back, those near-misses had been unbearably exciting.

She glanced at him, pursed her lips, and muttered, "That's because you like it."

"And Qing'er doesn't?"

"Mm~" A shy smile flickered across her face, and she whispered, "I like it too~"

"Heh, I'll stick around a while. Maybe Yue'er will come looking." His grin was pure mischief.

Murong Qing's heart skipped. If Xue Yue really did show up, should she hide Qin Jiang? Or better yet—let Xue Yue see him in plain sight and then bluff her way through it?

Option two. Definitely option two. Far more exciting.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang had fished out another spirit fruit from inside. He was full, but there were still a few left—perfect as a snack.

He popped it into his mouth and smiled. "This one's even juicier."

"Scoundrel~" Murong Qing gave him a look. It was his fault—bringing up Xue Yue had made the fruit juicier all on its own.

"There are only a few left. Once you finish, go back."

Qin Jiang nodded agreeably. The "few left" took several more hours to polish off. But no one came looking. The others were clearly giving them space, knowing Murong Qing rarely got time alone with Qin Jiang since their relationship was still unofficial.

Seeing that no one was coming, Qin Jiang was a bit disappointed—he'd wanted to put on a show with Murong Qing.

They left the room hand in hand and strolled through the immortal vessel. After a while, Qin Jiang said, "I should head back."

"Mm~"

"Why not come with me?"

Murong Qing's heart stirred. She wanted to, but at the academy, the quarters were smaller. Getting caught there was far more likely than on the spacious vessel, where they could do as they pleased.

After a moment's hesitation, she let temptation win. Face flushed, she nodded. "Alright. Let's go together."

"Good."

Qin Jiang took her hand, and the two of them soared into the sky, landing at Huaxia Academy.

Walking the grounds together, hand in hand in broad daylight, students recognized Qin Jiang and bowed respectfully. Murong Qing felt a flutter of nerves. Since the beginning of their relationship, they'd never been this openly affectionate in front of others. Her palms grew damp.

Qin Jiang glanced down at her, gave her hand a gentle squeeze, and kissed her forehead. "Relax. The students won't say anything."

This was private business, and no student would dare gossip. With as many women as Qin Jiang had, seeing him hold someone's hand was barely worth mentioning. At most, someone might note, 'I saw the Lord of Huaxia today.' The rest was trivial.
