Deep in the mountains, several explosions rang out as two figures fled at top speed. After a while, five battered and disheveled pursuers emerged from the dust.

"Damn it. We underestimated him."

The five were the woman in white's subordinates—all Human Immortals. They'd been dispatched to eliminate Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming, but despite their combined strength, not only had they failed, they'd been left looking like they'd lost a bar fight.

"What now? He got away."

"The man's powerful. He's practically at the True Immortal threshold. Even five-on-one, we couldn't pin him down."

"So what do we do? Go back empty-handed?"

Silence fell among them. Their mistress was already in a foul mood. Returning with news of another failure would not end well for them.

After a long pause, one of them cleared his throat. "Remember the plan we gave our mistress?"

The other four flinched. Unlike their mistress, they had at least a passing familiarity with matters of the heart—enough to realize the plan they'd written was fundamentally flawed. But they hadn't dared say so.

"Ahem. Our mistress is incredibly powerful, but she has zero experience with romance. If we just let the plan play out..."

"If we let the plan play out, she's going to hand herself over on a silver platter."

"Exactly. Which means, when the dust settles, she'll have a man at her side."

"Oh?"

The five exchanged looks, eyes brightening.

"So you're saying we should start getting on Qin Jiang's good side early?"

"That's exactly what I'm saying! Think about it. If our plan runs its course, I guarantee our mistress will fall for him like a lovesick fool. When that happens, our real boss won't be her anymore—it'll be Qin Jiang. So why not quietly help him win her over?"

"That... actually makes sense."

"Our mistress has been getting more displeased with us. This is our chance to save our own skins."

"Brilliant!"

Their eyes grew brighter as they fleshed out the idea, each one nodding along.

"Let's refine the plan!"

"Agreed. But what if she catches on?"

"Relax. Before she was sealed, all she ever did was cultivate. Then she was sealed for ages on top of that. She's incredibly naive about this stuff. A little misdirection and she'll never suspect a thing."

"Are we sure this isn't a backstab?"

"How is this a backstab? We're looking out for her best interests! We've seen Qin Jiang's dossier—apart from having too many women, he's practically the perfect match for our mistress. It'd be a shame if she missed out. She'll thank us later."

On the other side of the mountains, the woman in white had no idea her own people were scheming to deliver her on a platter.

She'd wandered out of the forest and was exploring the Human Dao Sect. In truth, calling her "inexperienced" wasn't entirely an act. Before being sealed, she'd spent virtually all her time cultivating. Later, she'd chosen to seal herself away for the sake of her breakthrough. Now her cultivation had reached the verge of Immortal King—she was confident that no one in all of Azure Cloud Heaven was stronger.

But her strength came at a cost. In every other respect, she was sorely lacking. She found the Human Dao Sect endlessly fascinating, wandering about like an actual wide-eyed young woman. Occasionally, her gaze drifted up toward the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's traveling palace. But the figure she hoped to see never appeared.

She frowned, then caught herself and felt a flash of irritation. It was just a man. What was there to look forward to? She'd tame him eventually, make him stand before her whenever she wished.

She huffed, and her eyes involuntarily drifted back to the palace again.

She shook her head. Something was off. Qin Jiang's image kept surfacing in her mind—the way he'd appeared before her, asking if she was alright with that warm, genuine concern. His kindness hadn't been an act, and it had stirred something in her.

Only a day had passed, and she already missed him. That definitely wasn't right.

Feeling restless, she opened the plan again. Every step required being in Qin Jiang's presence, but she could barely get near him. "I shouldn't have left so quickly yesterday," she muttered with regret. Those women and their endless "little sister" had been unbearable, driving her to flee. In hindsight, she should have at least set up another meeting—offered to thank Qin Jiang properly. That would have given her another chance.

"So frustrating!" She pouted and stamped her foot. The entire Human Dao Sect shuddered.

Her eyes went wide. She vanished on the spot, and moments later, several powerful figures arrived to investigate the disturbance.

Qin Jiang was surprised to find someone standing before him. He recognized the man—one of the woman in white's entourage.

After verifying the man's identity, Qin Jiang brought him up to the traveling palace. "What brings you here?"

"Young Master Qin, might we speak privately?" The man coughed, glancing at the women surrounding them.

This was a backstab operation, after all. The fewer witnesses, the better. And if the plan succeeded, these women would become his mistress's sisters. If any of them told his mistress what he'd said here, he couldn't be sure Qin Jiang would be able to protect him.

"Privately?" Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed.

The women frowned as well, their gazes turning dangerous. Under the weight of their collective stares, the man went rigid. One wrong move and these women would reduce him to paste.

"You're a Human Immortal?" Qin Jiang asked.

The man nodded. He was the only one among the group whose cultivation hadn't been concealed during the incident.

Qin Jiang's expression warmed into a smile. "Alright. Let's talk privately."

In his hands, he'd already palmed the Immortal King Seal and the Myriad Dao Stone. If this woman in white wanted to play games, he had a small agenda of his own. This Human Immortal was one of her subordinates—normally untouchable. But if the man had hostile intentions, well, that was one more Immortal Path Law for the collection.

He nodded to the women. They hesitated, then withdrew into the main hall.

Outside, only Qin Jiang and the subordinate remained. Qin Jiang smiled. "Go ahead. What did you want to discuss?"
