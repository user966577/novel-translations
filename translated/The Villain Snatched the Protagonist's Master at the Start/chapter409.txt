Ye Xuan stared at Zhao Juncai coldly. She'd given him a taste, and he'd gotten greedy.

Zhao Juncai stood frozen, indignant. She hadn't really resisted — with her strength, she could have broken free anytime. She hadn't needed Li Yang's rescue.

Then Ye Xuan's voice whispered directly into his mind: "Next time, when Li Yang isn't around, I'll give you a surprise."

Zhao Juncai's eyes went wide. He looked at Ye Xuan, and heat surged through him. She winked.

It all clicked. Ye Xuan had befriended Li Yang out of pity, but Li Yang had caught real feelings for her. Earlier, she hadn't resisted at first — she clearly liked Zhao Juncai back. It was only when Li Yang returned that she'd pulled away. Kind as she was, she wouldn't hurt Li Yang's feelings.

His resentment evaporated. He looked at Ye Xuan and Li Yang with an apologetic expression. "Miss Ye Xuan, I'm sorry. I think I lost my mind for a moment..."

"Hmph. Lost your mind? Zhao Juncai, you don't even have the guts to own what you did." Li Yang sneered.

Zhao Juncai's brow creased. "Li Yang, you're a remedial student without even a room to your name, mooching off my hospitality. Where do you get off criticizing me?"

"Tch — I don't need your charity!" Li Yang scoffed.

Ye Xuan tugged gently at his sleeve, and he turned to her, his expression softening instantly. "I can build my own quarters. You don't need to humble yourself with someone like him for my sake. Let's go."

He took Ye Xuan's hand and walked straight out of Zhao Juncai's dorm. Before they cleared the doorway, Ye Xuan glanced back and mouthed two silent words: "Wait for me."

Zhao Juncai's lips curled into a satisfied smile. He ran a hand through his hair and hummed a cheerful tune.

Back at the manor, Qin Jiang lounged with his women. The system's notification chimes rang in his head at irregular intervals — every time Li Yang suffered a blow, it awarded a handful of Villain Points.

With Ye Xuan stationed beside him, Li Yang got stung several times a day. Qin Jiang didn't even have to lift a finger.

Deploying Ye Xuan had been a stroke of genius. If other Children of Destiny appeared, he could assign them to her as well. Of course, a dedicated employee deserved perks — he'd arranged for Ye Xuan to receive favorable treatment at Huaxia Academy.

Half a month slipped by.

On the enormous bed, Qin Jiang extracted himself from the tangle of warm bodies with some difficulty. He glanced back and nearly dove right in again — far too tempting.

A full two weeks, and he'd only just managed to escape. He was running on fumes.

"Hee hee, running away, big brother?" A soft body pressed against his back. He stiffened, then grabbed Lian'er by the arm and swung her around into his lap.

Holding her close, he pinched her cheek. "Running? Me? I'm just worried that if this goes on any longer, none of you will be able to keep up."

Inside this room, Qin Jiang had deployed the Space-Time Law. Half a month outside had been three full years within.

Three years of dedicated effort, and the results were remarkable. Every woman's cultivation had improved significantly. The little white foxes had all broken through to Ancient Emperor. Li Qingqiu, previously the weakest, had reached Great Emperor — and thanks to Qin Jiang's attentions, she was only a step away from Ancient Emperor.

"We can totally keep up!" Lian'er pouted. She wrapped her arms around his neck and swayed against him — clearly issuing a challenge.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "Lian'er, you're getting awfully cocky lately."

"Nyeh nyeh — come punish me if you can!" She seemed unafraid.

Qin Jiang's gaze swept the room. The others were watching too, little smirks of provocation on their faces. All this time helping them cultivate without any real intensity had left them restless.

He lowered his head until his forehead touched Lian'er's, then pressed a kiss to her lips. "Don't beg for mercy, then."

He tossed her onto the bed and pounced. Amid a chorus of startled cries, Qin Jiang demonstrated once again the full scope of his terrifying prowess.

Three days later, he looked down at Lian'er with a cocky grin. "Still feeling brave?"

"Ah! You're so mean!"

Her face was scarlet, teeth sunk into her lower lip, legs kicking weakly. He caught her foot and gave it a firm squeeze. "Still squirming?"

"I said I'd stop! I give up!" She looked thoroughly aggrieved. She'd begged for mercy long ago, but Qin Jiang hadn't let her off. Instead, he'd switched to a different form of punishment — one that made Lian'er feel strange in ways she wasn't prepared to examine.

She found herself wanting him to continue. But he didn't oblige. He flipped her over, pulled her into his arms, and tweaked her nose. "Next time you get cocky, same punishment."

"Hmph! Meanie!" Secretly, she was already planning her next provocation.

After dealing with Lian'er, Qin Jiang spent time comforting the others — they'd all been through the wringer. Once everyone was properly soothed, he finally settled into the nest of warm bodies with a contented sigh.

"Qin Jiang, the academy's running smoothly now. When are you going to visit the Divine Palace?" Qing Chan asked.

He turned toward her, inhaled deeply — her fragrance was intoxicating — and grinned. "Couple of days."

"Well, hurry up. Those girls keep pestering me about you."

"Ha! No problem."

The academy was humming along. As long as Ye Xuan stayed to needle Li Yang, Villain Points would keep rolling in without him lifting a finger.

Of course, before leaving, he wanted to toy with Li Yang one more time. And he'd bring Li Qingqiu along. He wondered — between Li Yang's white moonlight and Ye Xuan, which held more power over him?

A wicked grin crossed his face. Either way, Li Yang would never have either of them. Though Ye Xuan might take an interest, if she felt like it.
