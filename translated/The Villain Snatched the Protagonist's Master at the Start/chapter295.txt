With Dao Zhen monitoring the two Children of Destiny, Qin Jiang focused on what mattered most: spending time with his wives.

Compared to dealing with fate's chosen, he vastly preferred burying his face in soft, fragrant warmth. That was the good life.

This particular day, Chen Baizhe had taken a break from cultivating. Qin Jiang's head rested in her lap while he nuzzled against her stomach, arms wrapped around her waist. Each warm breath brushing against her skin made her cheeks flush.

"Baizhe, you smell incredible."

She gently lifted his head away from her belly. If he kept nuzzling like that, she wouldn't be able to contain herself. By now, things were probably already showing.

"Stop that," she pouted. What he was smelling was probably... well.

"Brat."

She wanted to, truth be told. But with all the other women focused on cultivation and her being the odd one out, she was a little intimidated. Without backup, satisfying this beast single-handedly would be exhausting. Qin Jiang showed some restraint when it was one-on-one, but "some" was a relative term.

While she was still debating with herself, Qin Jiang sat up and pulled her into his arms. She let out a startled gasp, cheeks flushing, anticipation sparking in her eyes. She was afraid, but if he wanted her, she'd give herself willingly. Spoiling their man was the sisterhood's unspoken consensus.

"Want to?" Her arms found his neck, her voice dripping with invitation.

Qin Jiang licked his lips. With his wife being this enticing, he couldn't possibly disappoint her.

And so he did not.

About two hours later, Chen Baizhe was draped against his chest, looking up at him with a hint of confusion. "Just once?"

Her beautiful eyes held a flicker of worry. Usually, he'd keep her busy for an entire day. But today...

Had he gotten bored of her?

The thought sent a spike of panic through her heart, and she clutched him tighter.

Qin Jiang smiled, arms circling her waist. "Rest a bit first. I need to go out later, and we'll pick up where we left off when I get back."

"Where are you going?"

Though puzzled, she relaxed. He said they'd continue. He wasn't tired of her. She still had his attention.

Seeing her expression shift, Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. He sat up and gathered her onto his lap. "Were you overthinking just now?"

"Huh?"

She blushed. "I thought... I thought you'd gotten bored of me."

Her voice trailed off into a whisper. Qin Jiang's face went still for a heartbeat, then he swept her into a crushing embrace.

"Don't be ridiculous."

He didn't waste words—he showed her. Sitting together, she gasped and braced against his shoulders as he demonstrated exactly how far from "bored" he was.

He'd originally planned to visit Chen Qi'er. But right now, nothing mattered more than putting his wife's mind at ease.

Qin Jiang understood that with so many women in his life, some of them would inevitably have doubts. Worrying that he didn't love them. Worrying that he'd grown tired. Every time those thoughts surfaced, he'd answer with action. Words were never enough.

Hours passed. Chen Baizhe's eyes had drifted shut. Her hands weakly pushed at his chest. "No more... stop..."

But he didn't listen.

More hours. Only then did he finally slow, cradling her gently. She was utterly spent, barely able to open her eyes, tears glistening as she looked up at him and weakly swatted his chest.

"Brat."

She'd told him to stop. She'd begged. She'd even cried—and he still wouldn't let up.

By the end, she'd lost track of how many tears she'd shed. She felt practically dehydrated.

Qin Jiang pulled her close, unapologetic. "That's what you get for saying I'm bored of you. Consider that proof."

Chen Baizhe: "..."

She'd apologized. She'd surrendered. Multiple times. And he still hadn't stopped. "Proof"—sure. More like he'd gotten carried away.

She grumbled silently, but her body was honest. She pressed herself against him and closed her eyes, asleep within minutes.

Qin Jiang looked down at her face—a faint smile on her rosy lips. Satisfied. Content. Safe.

He didn't leave until the next morning, when she finally woke. Her first sight was his face, and a warm smile spread across hers. She burrowed deeper into his embrace with a contented sigh.

"Feeling better?"

"Mm..." She shot him a look. Mentally, she was fine. Physically, everything ached. Yesterday's marathon—extended well beyond the original plan by a single careless remark—had been relentless.

"Going out today?"

She figured yesterday's outing had been postponed on her account.

Qin Jiang didn't hide anything from her. "Chen Qi'er's in the Chaos District. I thought we'd go take a look."

She sat bolt upright, staring at him intently, heedless of the blanket falling away.

"Qin Jiang!"

Her lips pressed together, a faint tremble of hurt in her voice. "You think I still have feelings for him?"

She felt wronged. She'd broken things off with Chen Qi'er back at the Human Dao Sect. He'd even tried to assault An Xihe—though she later learned that had been part of An Xihe's own scheme. But Chen Qi'er's peeping had been real enough. That kind of man disgusted her. Qin Jiang was all she wanted now.

And her husband suspected her?

Qin Jiang blinked rapidly and shook his head. "I never said—" He pulled her back against his chest, stroking her hair. "Baizhe, I don't doubt you. I want to bring you along because..." He paused, looking slightly sheepish. "Honestly? I want to rub it in his face."

"???"

"And having you there makes it sting even more."

"..."

The tension drained from Chen Baizhe's face. As long as he wasn't doubting her, everything was fine. She rested her head on his shoulder. "Are you planning to deal with him?"

"Mm-hm."

She thought of Chen Qi'er's hatred for Qin Jiang. His strength. Her lips parted, and her voice came out soft but firm.

"He's a threat to you. Then kill him."
