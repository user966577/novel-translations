Qin Jiang cleared his throat, studied Chen Ningshuang for a moment, then spoke carefully. "The earlier checkup was admittedly a bit cursory. How about... a more thorough one?"

"Yes please!" Ningshuang giggled, bobbing her little head. "How are you going to examine me, Brother Qin Jiang?"

"My room?"

"Okay!"

She agreed without hesitation, and Qin Jiang scooped her up and carried her straight to his chambers. He shut the door and set her on the bed. She kicked off her shoes and knelt on the mattress — this room was anything but unfamiliar to her. She'd snuck in more times than she could count, even spending the night on occasion.

She looked up at him, eyes bright with anticipation. "Can you start the examination now?"

"Of course."

He sat down beside her, smiled, and with a sweep of his arm — rip. A shredded dress fluttered to the floor.

"Ah!" Ningshuang let out a small yelp, her face flushing, and dove straight into Qin Jiang's embrace. He caught her, patted her back, and spoke softly. "Don't worry. It's just a checkup."

"Mm..." She nodded into his chest.

Then, gently, he eased her back to arm's length and began his examination in earnest.

Observation, auscultation, inquiry, and palpation — the four diagnostic pillars of traditional medicine. Qin Jiang was... passingly familiar with them.

First came observation. He looked carefully — up, down, left, right — leaving nothing unchecked. Then auscultation. He leaned in close, nostrils flaring slightly. A fresh, clean fragrance. He even expanded his methodology beyond the classical four to include tasting. Flavor, after all, could reveal diagnostic clues that other methods missed. This was his strongest technique by far. He sampled thoroughly and nodded to himself — from a flavor perspective, everything was perfectly healthy.

"Shuang'er, how does that feel?"

She looked at him, teeth pressed lightly into her lower lip, her cheeks pink. "A little... tingly."

"Tingly? That's perfectly normal. Anything else?"

"Mm... it feels really warm."

"Warm is also normal," he said, continuing. "Do you like how it feels, Shuang'er?"

"I like it."

"Good. Your body appears quite healthy, but we'll need to go a bit deeper." Three of the four methods down, one to go. As a responsible practitioner, Qin Jiang wouldn't allow a single diagnostic shortcut. Every available technique had to be deployed to ensure accuracy.

He extended his hand, first taking her wrist to check her pulse. After a while, he shifted his examination elsewhere, continuing to "palpate" with meticulous care. His palms worked like precision instruments, covering every inch from top to bottom. Before long, he had a comprehensive understanding of her body.

"Are you done, Brother Qin Jiang?" Ningshuang asked softly.

He withdrew his hands and nodded, a smile on his face. "All done, Shuang'er. You're in excellent health. But at your age, you're in the most critical stage of development, so we can't be careless. Come to me for regular checkups from now on."

"Okay!"

"Also, I'll teach you some poses and techniques that are good for your body. Follow along."

She was extremely cooperative, and Qin Jiang taught patiently. But the little thing was clumsy — after half the day, she still hadn't gotten it right. She looked at him with a pitiful expression, her small hand tugging his. "Brother Qin Jiang, I can't learn it..."

"That's fine. I'll teach you again."

She nodded, practicing while sneaking glances at him. After a moment's hesitation, she spoke up. "Brother Qin Jiang... can I just not learn it?"

"It's good for you."

"Can't you just do it for me?"

Her eyes sparkled with expectation. Qin Jiang arched an eyebrow. He'd seen through her ages ago — she wasn't failing because she couldn't learn. She simply didn't want to. He'd assumed she just wanted to spend more time with him, but it turned out she was angling for an ongoing arrangement.

After a brief pause, he nodded. "Fine. But you still need to practice on your own. I don't always have time, so when I'm not available, you'll have to manage yourself."

"Yay!" Her face lit up. She'd mastered the techniques long ago, of course. As a Unity Realm cultivator, she could hardly fail to learn such simple movements.

"Practice well. I'll be conducting spot checks."

"Spot checks?" Her face reddened, a shy gleam in her eyes. She nodded. "That's fine... When will you do the spot checks, Brother Qin Jiang?"

"The whole point of a spot check is that you don't know when it's coming. If I told you in advance and you prepared, it wouldn't be a spot check."

"But my sisters said... if you don't prepare first, it really hurts..."

"???"

"And you might get hurt."

"!!!"

"And it's not comfortable."

"..."

Qin Jiang rubbed his forehead. What on earth had this girl been learning? And from Ningbing and the others, no less! She was still a child!

A pang of self-reproach struck him — then he realized that what he'd been doing was arguably worse. He coughed, feeling the faintest twinge of guilt.

"Brother Qin Jiang, just let me prepare before the spot check, okay? Please?" She hugged his arm, pouting sweetly.

Something surged in Qin Jiang — though not in the head he'd have preferred. He took a deep breath and forced it back down, pulling her into his arms. "Alright. When the time comes, you won't even need to prepare yourself. I'll do the preparation for you."

"Hehe, Brother Qin Jiang is the best!" Ningshuang buried her face against his shoulder, nuzzling happily.

He raised a hand and rubbed her head. This little imp was a handful — even more so than her sister.

"Alright, that's enough studying for today. Lesson's over."

Ningshuang looked reluctant, her lips in a small pout. "But I haven't learned it yet."

"I'll teach you again next time."

"Are you going to see my sisters now?"

"That's right. After cultivation, they're all exhausted. Your brother needs to help them relax."

"Oh..." Still pouting, she nodded, clearly unhappy.

Qin Jiang smiled, pulled her close, and leaned down to press a light kiss to her lips. "Better?"
