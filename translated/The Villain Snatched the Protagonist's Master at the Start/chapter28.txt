"And if you can't reach Great Emperor?"

Yan Shiya frowned.

Qin Jiang gave an arrogant smile:

"Put it this way—

If I want to, three years is all I need to become a Great Emperor."

Yan Shiya rolled her eyes. 'Big talk is cheap.'

She fell silent, torn. With her own talent, reaching Great Emperor was virtually impossible.

And this Seven Beauties Painting...

Becoming one of the Seven Beauties was essentially becoming Qin Jiang's servant. And who could guarantee he'd actually reach Great Emperor?

It was a gamble.

A gamble where she'd be betting everything.

Betting that Qin Jiang could become a Great Emperor. Betting that he'd actually help her.

After lengthy deliberation, Yan Shiya looked at Qin Jiang:

"What about Yun'er? Are you planning to make her one of the Seven Beauties too?"

"Little Yun'er won't do."

Qin Jiang shook his head.

Yan Shiya relaxed slightly. She would be one of the Seven Beauties, while Yan Yun would be Qin Jiang's woman. That at least ensured he'd help them.

But still...

"Why choose me as one of the Seven Beauties?"

Yan Shiya asked, puzzled.

Qin Jiang smiled faintly:

"Because you're difficult to control. I'm too lazy to waste time, so once you become one of the Seven Beauties, whatever I want you to do, you'll do."

Yan Shiya: "..."

'Brutally honest, isn't he.'

In the spoilers, Yan Yun had been easily manipulated, like putty in anyone's hands. Yan Shiya, on the other hand, had maintained her guard around Ye Xuan the entire time.

For a full year, she'd never let her vigilance slip.

Or rather, she kept her guard up around everyone. On this continent, she and Yan Yun only had each other. With Yan Yun being so trusting, if Yan Shiya hadn't stayed vigilant, they'd have been devoured long ago.

Not to mention the blood feud they carried.

Hearing Qin Jiang's words, Yan Yun frowned slightly. If her aunt was difficult to control, then she was...

Easy to control?

She felt thoroughly insulted!

But before she could object, Yan Shiya spoke:

"How do I become one of the Seven Beauties?"

Qin Jiang toyed with the painting, then looked at Yan Shiya:

"Give me a drop of your blood."

Yan Shiya channeled spiritual energy, forcing a drop of blood from her fingertip, and flicked it toward Qin Jiang.

He caught it with the painting. Upon activation, the blood was instantly absorbed. Yan Shiya faintly sensed a connection forming between herself and the painting.

Strangely, even looking at Qin Jiang felt... less objectionable now.

At that moment, Qin Jiang tossed the painting into the air. The scroll unfurled and wrapped around Yan Shiya:

"Don't resist!"

Qin Jiang called out.

Yan Shiya took a deep breath and suppressed her instinct to fight back. The painting tightened, and a tremendous pulling force erupted from within.

In a flash, the scroll engulfed her and drew her inside.

The Seven Beauties Painting rolled itself up and floated back to Qin Jiang.

He smiled and unfurled it. Where one of the seven positions had been empty, a figure now stood—unmistakably Yan Shiya.

Yan Yun's jaw dropped:

"That's my aunt?"

Qin Jiang nodded:

"The Seven Beauties Painting is boosting her cultivation as we speak. Looks like it'll take some time."

"She won't be harmed, will she?"

Yan Yun asked worriedly.

Qin Jiang scooped her up with a mischievous grin:

"You think I'd let anything happen to a beauty like her?"

Yan Yun blinked, glanced at Qin Jiang, then at Yan Shiya in the painting. Then she relaxed completely.

With Qin Jiang's... appetites, he'd never let anything happen to Yan Shiya.

"By the way—you said my aunt is difficult to control. Does that mean I'm... easy to control?"

With her aunt's safety no longer a concern, Yan Yun was ready to settle old scores.

Qin Jiang studied her with exaggerated seriousness:

"Was I wrong?"

"Of course! I'm very clever, thank you!"

Yan Yun pouted.

Qin Jiang nodded:

"You're right.

If you weren't so clever, I wouldn't have gotten to enjoy—"

Yan Yun: "..."

Thinking back, from the very beginning, she'd practically delivered herself to Qin Jiang on a silver platter. Every "clever" move she'd made had played right into his hands, culminating in that bet.

The realization stung. Could it be that she really wasn't...

That smart?

Seeing her spiral into self-doubt, Qin Jiang laughed and pulled her into his arms:

"Actually, you're quite smart. Just a little... innocent.

This massive casino—I'm guessing your aunt's people handle the day-to-day management?"

Yan Yun's cheeks reddened. Officially, she ran the casino. In reality, Yan Shiya's people handled almost everything.

She was more of a mascot.

"Starting now, I'll manage the casino myself!"

As if to prove a point, Yan Yun declared with determination.

Qin Jiang ruffled her hair:

"Don't be silly. You're practically the Qin family's Young Madam now. All you need to do is enjoy yourself. Leave the grunt work to the servants."

"But you just said I'm naive."

"Your aunt was too weak to protect you—that's how I managed to swoop in. But now that I'm here, you could be the most gullible person alive and it wouldn't matter."

Yan Yun: "..."

'You're the gullible one!'

Still, she nodded reluctantly:

"Fine.

Then I won't bother trying."

She'd been feeling insecure about it anyway. She'd never had a head for management. Getting permission to drop the pretense was honestly a relief.

She was secretly delighted. Lying flat and going with the flow—that was the life.

Compared to Yan Shiya, she carried very little resentment. She'd been so young during the massacre that she had no memories of it—no deep feelings for her parents or the relatives who'd perished.

Only Yan Shiya, who'd raised her, held a true place in her heart.

But Yan Shiya was consumed by revenge, spending most of her time cultivating or building her forces. Her care for Yan Yun was inevitably lacking.

One thing Qin Jiang did appreciate about Yan Shiya, though—she'd never indoctrinated Yan Yun with thoughts of vengeance. She simply wanted her niece to live an easy life.

Perhaps she knew revenge was hopeless and didn't want Yan Yun to live consumed by hatred the way she did.

Either way, Yan Shiya was an excellent aunt.

Watching Yan Yun's carefree expression, Qin Jiang smiled softly and gathered her into his arms.
