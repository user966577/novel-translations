"So there really is an Immortal King's treasure?" Qin Jiang asked.

Jian Yao shook her head. "No one knows for certain. It's only ever been a rumor — no one's actually seen it. When I was still at the sect, plenty of people suspected it was fabricated to give rivals an excuse to tear the Sword Sect down from its peak."

"I doubt it's just a rumor," An Xihe said, scanning the entire sect with her senses. "If it were baseless, the Sword Sect would have been eradicated entirely. They wouldn't have been kept alive."

Mo Mo agreed. "Back then, the story was incredibly detailed. And I personally felt a terrifying surge of power from the Sword Sect once."

"So the treasure might be real?" Qing Chan's eyes sparkled.

Jian Yao remained skeptical. Over the millennia, every inch of the Sword Sect had been searched with nothing to show for it. If the treasure had ever existed, it was long gone — stolen during the chaos of war by someone savvy enough not to advertise.

"Enough about treasure," Qin Jiang said. "We're here to settle scores. Yao Yao, shall we just destroy the whole sect?"

"That's not necessary. But everyone who hunted me doesn't get to walk away." She pulled out a list she'd prepared before leaving — every name that bore her a grudge was on it. "Besides the Sword Sect, there's also the Zhao family. They can be wiped out entirely."

The Zhao family — the clan that had tried to force her into marriage. One of Grey Cloud Heaven's great powers, with a True Immortal at its head. Their young master had wanted Jian Yao for her beauty and, more practically, for the rumored treasure. As the Saintess, she qualified as a Sword Sect heir who might unlock it.

"Consider it done." Qin Jiang didn't need convincing. Anyone who'd touched his woman would answer for it. As for the Sword Sect itself — they'd raised Jian Yao, so the innocent would be spared.

List in hand, the group strode openly into the Sword Sect. Strangely, there was no resistance, and few disciples in sight.

"Barely anyone here," Qin Jiang noted.

"The sect's reputation has fallen so far that nobody wants to join," Jian Yao said. "They lose members every year. At this rate, they'll simply cease to exist."

Qin Jiang stroked his chin. A once-mighty sect, fallen from grace, rumored treasure, no prospects — by every trope in the book, this place should have spawned a Child of Destiny. The keywords were all there. He felt a spark of excitement. Even without Lian'er's system, he could sniff one out by pattern alone!

"The main hall," Jian Yao directed. "Elders are usually there."

They headed straight for it. Near the hall, the number of disciples increased, though nearly all of them were old — hardly any young blood. The sect's future was bleak.

Their arrival drew immediate attention. In a sect this small, everyone knew everyone. "Who are you?" A disciple approached warily, sword drawn.

Qin Jiang ignored him and turned to Jian Yao. "Anyone from the list?"

She scanned the area and shook her head. "No. These are all new additions from after I left. But I sense familiar presences inside the hall."

"Then let's go."

Qin Jiang flicked his wrist. Every disciple near the entrance froze in place — not a single one above Great Emperor cultivation. What hope did they have against a Human Immortal?

They walked into the main hall unchallenged. Inside, a sizable gathering of Sword Sect elders appeared to be mid-discussion. Every head turned.

"Who let you in here? This is restricted ground — get out!" one of them barked, assuming they were wayward disciples.

A poor assumption.

The instant the words left his mouth, the women's gazes turned glacial. Mo Mo snorted. The man's eyes bulged, his face went purple, and blood streamed from every orifice as he convulsed and went still.

The remaining elders leapt to their feet in horror. Only now did they realize these weren't their own.

"Who are you?!"

Jian Yao's eyes swept the room. She raised her hand and pointed. "Him. Him. And him..."

One after another — people who'd attacked her, people who'd voted for the forced marriage. Qin Jiang seized each one and forced them to their knees. Every attempt at resistance was like a mayfly trying to topple a mountain.

The Sword Sect's sole Human Immortal ancestor wasn't present. Not that it would have mattered.

"That's all of them."

Nearly half the room now knelt before Qin Jiang. The humiliation was plain on every face, but no one dared resist. They'd seen what he could do — immortal path cultivation, at minimum on par with their ancestor.
