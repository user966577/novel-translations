In the end, Chen Changsheng endured the humiliation and was squeezed for another five thousand spirit stones.

Watching the steward's smug grin, his expression grew darker by the second.

"Alright, you can go."

Chen Changsheng said nothing. Token in hand, he turned and left. He couldn't afford to make enemies here—one trumped-up charge from a nobody, and he'd have the entire Human Dao Sect on his back.

No status meant no voice. Without standing, you didn't get to argue your case. He'd already burned bridges with the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. If he antagonized the Human Dao Sect too, the Limitless Holy Land would never touch him—and what if he managed to offend them as well?

Calming himself, Chen Changsheng fastened the token to his waist. From this moment forward, he was a proud outer disciple of the Human Dao Sect.

'First, find a way into the inner sect. Then a lowly steward like that...'

He cast one last cold look over his shoulder before heading toward the sect's main territory.

Back at the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, amid the sea of flowers, Qin Jiang lounged in a reclining chair, basking in the sun. Nearby, Jian Yao and the others were comparing insights and discussing cultivation techniques, with Qing Chan offering pointers.

Meanwhile, Ning Xue'er could only watch longingly from beside Qin Jiang, her hands on his shoulders, kneading away while muttering under her breath.

"Knead, knead, knead... knead you to death!"

Qin Jiang ignored her grumbling. He tapped the table with one finger. Ning Xue'er withdrew her hands, picked up the teapot, and poured him a cup. She brought it to his lips.

He didn't open his mouth. Ning Xue'er's hand twitched with the urge to dump the tea on his face, but a glance at Qing Chan in the distance made her paste on a smile and coo: "Brother, your tea~"

"Not bad."

He took a sip and nodded approvingly. Then he patted his thigh. Ning Xue'er's cheeks flushed pink. She set down the cup, perched herself on his lap, slipped off her shoes, and rested her sock-clad feet against his chest.

In just a few days, she could interpret his every gesture. She'd even resigned herself to offering her virtue—only to discover that Qin Jiang seemed to be stringing her along. Teasing and toying but never taking the final step. She was nearly desperate enough to do what Qing Chan had done: pin him down and have her way with him. Except her cultivation was sealed, so she couldn't overpower him. And she was still a little shy.

Since his talk with Qing Chan, Qin Jiang had had something of an epiphany. Women who already liked him—he wanted to win them through charm rather than force. Ning Xue'er was the test case. So far, it was working well. He hadn't forced anything—Qing Chan had done the forcing, and that had nothing to do with him.

Watching him take her foot in his hand, Ning Xue'er's toes curled. Her face reddened further. She murmured: "Pervert."

She couldn't fathom the appeal. Everyone had feet. If he wanted to look at something, why not something she had that he didn't? She could handle him looking. Even something more. She'd even take the initiative, like Qing Chan. But this man just wouldn't make his move. Infuriating.

And yet... just having him hold her foot made her feel strange. A sort of itch. In her heart.

Feet had plenty of acupressure points. Qin Jiang had studied the subject thoroughly. Some points were extremely sensitive. He worked them with seeming casualness—a natural-looking massage hiding deliberate, escalating stimulation.

Ning Xue'er bit her lip, gripping his thigh, fighting to stay silent.

After a while, he finally set her foot down. She exhaled with relief. Meeting his gaze, she obediently tucked her feet back and nestled into his arms, becoming a human pillow.

Her lips parted slightly, breath warm and delicate, one hand resting on his chest. "Brother, when are you going to ask Qing Chan to unseal my cultivation?"

Being sealed meant being at his mercy, with no initiative of her own. If she were unsealed, she could take charge—pin Qin Jiang down with ease. Whatever impulse struck, she could just act on it instead of suppressing it.

Qin Jiang glanced down and pinched her flushed cheek. "Never mind the seal. Don't you owe me some laundry?"

"Hm?"

"Look."

He pointed to where she'd been sitting.

Ning Xue'er followed his finger, and her face went incandescent.

"I... I couldn't help it~"

Her voice came out tiny. In the haze of sensation, she'd felt it happening but hadn't thought it would actually... Oh, the mortification.

She buried her face against him and peeked toward Qing Chan and the others—they hadn't noticed. Only Qin Jiang knew. Not a complete social death, at least.

"Take off your pants and I'll wash them~" she whispered.

She wanted him to change immediately—if Qing Chan spotted the evidence, she'd die of embarrassment.

Qin Jiang started to stand, but Ning Xue'er stopped him. "Wait."

"What?"

"If you stand up, they'll see."

"So?"

"No~" She shook her head, eyes beseeching. "Please. It's so humiliating."

"Then what do you suggest?"

He leaned in close, their faces nearly touching. Ning Xue'er thought for a moment, checked the angles, and said:

"How about... you carry me inside and change there?"

"Carry you?"

"Yes—I can block it."

She shifted position, shielding the incriminating spot, then looked up. "See? Perfect cover."

"That position is..."

Qin Jiang's expression turned odd.

Ning Xue'er didn't see the problem. She wrapped her arms around him. "Okay, you can stand up now."

He nodded, cupping his hands beneath her, and rose. He carried her straight toward the cottage.

Ning Xue'er, meanwhile, frowned. She was fairly sure that what was supporting her weight included more than just his hands...
