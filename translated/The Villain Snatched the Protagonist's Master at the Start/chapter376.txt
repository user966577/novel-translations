The moment he stepped out, the Li ancestor materialized before him. One glance at Qin Jiang's carefully curated appearance and the old man's face twitched. No question — the wolf was on the hunt.

"Oh, Old Li. Morning."

"Ha ha..." A dry laugh. "Manor Lord, you're looking..."

"Yesterday's girl — that was your heir, right? Seems she's out of seclusion after all."

The old man's feet stopped. He could only smile and nod. "I didn't expect Qingqiu to break through so quickly."

"Qingqiu. Li Qingqiu. Nice name." Qin Jiang smiled. "Didn't you say she admires me? Since she's out now, I should pay her a visit."

"Ha ha. Of course."

What else could he say? He led Qin Jiang to Li Qingqiu's courtyard, heart aching the entire way — personally delivering the wolf to the lamb.

"Manor Lord, this is where Qingqiu lives."

Qin Jiang nodded, approached the gate, then paused. "Don't you have things to do?"

The old man hesitated, then caught on — he was being dismissed. He glanced at the gate one last time, sighed, and turned to leave. With each step, he looked back. Would his precious girl be devoured the instant he was gone?

He clenched his fists. A True Immortal, accustomed to having the world at his command — and here he was, powerless before an Immortal King.

Qin Jiang pushed the gate open. A wave of cold air washed over him, refreshing rather than uncomfortable. In the courtyard, a woman in blue sat in the lone stone chair, staring at nothing.

Li Qingqiu.

He closed the gate behind him and walked straight toward her. She didn't react. Not a flicker. This was well within his expectations — her temperament was genuinely frigid, devoid of interest in anything or anyone.

Like a block of ice.

Qin Jiang's lips curled. He leaned in close, his face nearly touching hers. Finally, a micro-expression — her brows drew together and she tilted back. "You're very rude."

He leaned closer. She frowned deeper, shifted her legs, and stood, putting distance between them. From a step away, she regarded him with renewed blankness.

Qin Jiang straightened. "So are you."

"???"

"A guest comes and you don't even offer hospitality?"

He clicked his tongue. Li Qingqiu lowered her eyes. She never entertained guests. Besides, someone who walked in without knocking and immediately got in her face hardly counted as one.

Seeing her silence, Qin Jiang shook his head. Talking to an ice block really was exhausting. He stepped forward, sat down in the only stone chair, and looked up — directly into her eyes.

Her gaze held nothing but indifference. He stared back, unblinking. She didn't look away. Some kind of unspoken contest began — two people, perfectly still, eye to eye.

After a long while, Qin Jiang broke first. She hadn't been looking at him at all. Her eyes had simply passed through him, as if he didn't exist.

He smacked his lips. "You know you're sick, right?"

"???"

"Faced with someone this ridiculously handsome and you don't feel a thing? Definitely sick."

"..."

A minute movement of her lips. Almost a reaction. But still no words.

"Lucky for you, I can cure it." He stood. In a flash, he had her in his arms.

Cold — but soft. Very soft.

Li Qingqiu stiffened. Then she struggled, trying to break free. But she was only Supreme Realm against a Human Immortal. The resistance was futile.

Qin Jiang looked down at her. "See? That's more like it. Walking around frozen all day — what's the point?"

"Let go!" Her second sentence since he'd walked in. She looked up, realized she couldn't escape, and the spark in her eyes extinguished as quickly as it had appeared. She stopped struggling and stared at him flatly.

"Still not enough emotion." Her head was tilted up, lips flushed and inviting. So he kissed her.

Li Qingqiu's pupils contracted. Her body went rigid, and her small hands clutched his clothes. She shook her head, trying to pull away, but Qin Jiang held firm — there was no escape.

His eyes stayed on her face, watching with amusement. No emotion? He'd just summoned hers in two seconds flat.

When he finally pulled back, the faintest blush colored her cheeks. Her body trembled, her eyes glistening. "Let go!"

"No." He raised an eyebrow, arms tightening around her waist. Li Qingqiu clenched her fists — too weak to fight, not eloquent enough to argue. And this man was utterly shameless.

Every other man she'd met had tripped over himself trying to seem like a gentleman in her presence. This one was pure rogue. A rogue with power and backing, against whom she had no recourse.

She lowered her head and said nothing more. Surrender, apparently.

Qin Jiang sat back down, pulling her onto his lap. The position made her bristle — especially when she felt something beneath her undergoing a dramatic transformation. The sheer force of it nearly lifted her off his legs entirely.

Her eyes widened. That much energy? If they actually...

'No no no. Stop thinking about that.'
