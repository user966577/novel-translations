They'd been at the Yang estate for only a few days when the massive immortal ship came sailing in. All of Qin Jiang's women had come looking for him—even Mengjin had abandoned the Merfolk tribe to tag along. True Immortals, Immortal Kings, even an Immortal Emperor. Though none of them deliberately released their auras, the ambient pressure alone had every member of the Yang family trembling and dropping to their knees.

With so many people, the Yang estate couldn't possibly accommodate them all. Qin Jiang simply took Yang Manman aboard the immortal ship and introduced her to the others.

Liu Shuwan appeared at his side, reaching out to smooth the creases in his robes. "Did you have fun on your own?" she asked softly.

"Of course I missed you all terribly," Qin Jiang said with a grin, catching her hand. They'd only been apart a few days, but sweet nothings were always worth saying—everyone liked hearing them.

"Smooth talker." Liu Shuwan rolled her eyes, then turned to Yang Manman. Qin Jiang made the introduction. "Yang Manman. You can call her Manman."

Liu Shuwan nodded, regarding Yang Manman with a warm smile. "Hello, Manman."

"Hello, Sister~" Yang Manman replied shyly.

Liu Shuwan reached out and took Yang Manman's arm. "Come with me. I'll show you around and introduce you to everyone."

"Okay~"

Qin Jiang tried to follow, but Liu Shuwan pointed toward another ship. "The Skyreach City people have business with you. Go see what they want."

"They need me?"

Liu Shuwan nodded, looking puzzled herself. "They were being very mysterious about it. Said they could only tell you directly."

"Fine, I'll go check."

"Hurry back~" Liu Shuwan waved, smiling.

Qin Jiang licked his lips, stepped forward, and kissed her squarely on the mouth. Then, not wanting to leave anyone out, he kissed Yang Manman too. Only then did he leave, waving over his shoulder. "When I get back, we're doing a group training session."

"We'll be waiting~" Liu Shuwan called after him.

Yang Manman watched his retreating figure with curiosity. Once he'd disappeared from view, she turned to Liu Shuwan. "Sister, what's 'group training'?"

Liu Shuwan's cheeks colored faintly. She didn't elaborate. "You'll find out when he gets back. Let me introduce you to the other sisters first."

"Okay~"

On the other ship, the ten Immortal Kings from Skyreach City greeted Qin Jiang at once with respectful bows. "Master."

"At ease." He waved them off and studied them. "What do you need?"

"Well..."

"If there's something, you can reach me through the True Spirit Slave Seal. What's so important that I had to come in person?" He rolled his eyes. He hadn't been eating well these past few days—Yang Manman alone simply couldn't keep up with him. He was anxious to get back to dinner.

The Immortal Kings exchanged glances, and one of them said quietly, "Master, let's speak somewhere more private."

"So mysterious."

Qin Jiang shook his head but followed them to a secluded corner. He was just about to speak when the world spun around him. When it stopped, he found himself no longer on the ship.

He immediately went on alert, scanning his surroundings. The Immortal Kings had vanished. He was alone.

"What's going on?"

His brow furrowed. Were they trying to harm him? No—the True Spirit Slave Seal would have alerted him the instant any of them harbored hostile intent. Besides, this place didn't look dangerous. Gentle waters, warm mountains, serene and elegant—a paradise straight out of a painting.

Then a flute melody drifted through the air, ethereal and delicate. It was captivating—the kind of sound that made you ache to meet the person playing it.

Qin Jiang blinked. The next instant, he spun on his heel. He had absolutely no desire to meet any mysterious flute player.

But the moment he turned, the melody shifted. The gentle notes hardened into something sharp and lethal, and a strand of his hair floated to the ground, sliced clean off.

Qin Jiang went rigid. His throat bobbed. He drew a deep breath, plastered a smile back onto his face, turned around, and began walking toward the music.

Sure enough, the melody softened again—gentle, beautiful, enchanting.

He walked at an unhurried pace and soon arrived at a small stream. A woman sat on a rock at the water's edge, slender fingers working a bamboo flute with focused grace. What caught his eye even more were her bare, porcelain-white feet dangling in the stream, swaying lazily back and forth. Water droplets scattered through the air.

Qin Jiang's throat went dry.

After a time, the melody faded. The woman's cool voice carried across the stream. "Seen enough?"

"Ah." Qin Jiang snapped back to himself and offered an awkward laugh, cupping his hands politely. "My apologies, miss. I stumbled in by accident. If you've no need of me, I'll just be on my way."

He turned to leave. But before he'd taken a step, she materialized in front of him, silent as a ghost.

The moment he saw her face, his eyes went wide.

She was stunning. Beyond stunning. He searched her features for even the slightest flaw and found nothing—not a single imperfection. Every angle, every proportion was flawless. Compared to her, everyone else dimmed to nothing.

This woman had to be his.

He licked his lips, raw desire blazing in his eyes.

"Such a coward?" Her red lips parted, her beautiful eyes narrowing with a dangerous edge. "Then how did you find the nerve to impersonate my husband?"

The words hit like cold water. Qin Jiang's mind sharpened instantly. Impersonate her husband? She was the Grand Sovereign's daughter?

It was over.

It had only been a few days—how had she found him already? And her power was utterly unfathomable.

"You're... the Grand Sovereign's daughter?"

"I have a name, you know," she said with a faint, dismissive smile.

Qin Jiang was about to ask what it was when she raised her hand. The Immortal King Seal appeared, summoned from wherever he'd been keeping it. She closed her fingers around it. The artifact—sturdy enough that Qin Jiang couldn't have scratched it at full power—crumbled to dust in her palm. A flick of her wrist, and the powder scattered into nothing.

Qin Jiang stared in disbelief. That was his ID! And she'd just destroyed it!
