"Something's wrong—the Ye family was prepared!"

The commander's expression changed. He whipped around to stare at Ye Qingtian, suspicion flashing through his mind.

At the same moment, Ye Qingtian's face darkened:

"What happened? Was our intelligence compromised?"

Seeing his reaction, the commander's brow furrowed. 'It wasn't Ye Qingtian's doing?'

The battle erupted in full force.

A prepared Ye family was far more than these death squads could handle.

In mere moments, casualties piled up.

Ye Qingtian clenched his jaw, face grim:

"The plan's been leaked. We need to retreat!"

"Retreat?"

The commander shook his head:

"We can't. Since the Ye family was already prepared, we're probably trapped with no way out."

At those words, Ye Qingtian's expression twisted into something savage:

"No!

I have to escape! Send your men to clear a path for me. As long as I'm alive, the Ye family will never know peace!"

Watching him lose composure like a madman, a flicker of pity crossed the commander's face. He surveyed their surroundings and said calmly:

"It's not over yet. We still don't know about the Ye family's ancestral elders. If that end succeeds, we'll be fine."

"Right, right!"

Ye Qingtian nodded rapidly:

"That's where the real battle is! The Ye elders are definitely poisoned. I haven't lost yet!

Kill! Keep killing—force the Ye elders out!"

"Very well!"

These men were expendable from the start. At the command, every death soldier went berserk.

Finally...

"What scoundrels dare assault the Ye family!"

A thunderous roar, accompanied by a terrifying aura that blanketed nearly all of Ye City.

Both Ye Qingtian and the commander froze.

But the next moment...

That overwhelming aura dissipated like a retreating tide. In its final throes, both men sensed the weakness beneath it.

They exchanged glances and saw matching elation in each other's eyes.

"It worked!"

---

On the other side.

Ye Lingtian was equally alarmed. He too felt the fading power behind his ancestral elders' aura.

"What's going on?"

He spun around to face the leisurely Qin Jiang:

"Was this your doing?"

"Relax."

Qin Jiang glanced at him, then turned his gaze toward the city outskirts, a smile playing on his lips:

"Time to show themselves."

BOOM!!!

The instant his words fell, a deafening explosion rocked the entirety of Ye City. Moments later, everyone witnessed a massive barrier descend, sealing the city entirely.

In the blink of an eye, Ye City was locked down.

Ye Lingtian's face was ashen. He fixed Qin Jiang with a death stare:

"What exactly are you doing?"

Before Qin Jiang could answer, a series of immense auras erupted from the perimeter of Ye City:

"Ha ha ha ha! Ye family—today marks your annihilation!"

The booming declaration rolled across the land.

In the sky, figure after figure appeared like descending gods. Ye Lingtian went slack-jawed:

"Supremes..."

All of them were Supremes. Over thirty in total!

"That's it?"

Qin Jiang frowned. Seeing Ye Lingtian's gaze on him again, he pointed at the gathered Supremes:

"These are all the people who've been plotting against your Ye family. I've drawn every last one of them out for you."

Ye Lingtian: "???"

'What good does drawing them out do? We can't beat them!'

He nearly broke down. After all that scheming, it was just to lure the enemy out?

Luring the snake from its hole?

More like setting your own damn house on fire!

Even if all the Ye family elders attacked together, they might not win. Oh right—the elders had problems too.

"What happened to the ancestral elders?"

Ye Lingtian demanded.

Qin Jiang replied with a straight face:

"I poisoned them."

"You..."

Ye Lingtian went weak in the knees, nearly fainting on the spot.

Qin Jiang spread his hands innocently:

"If I hadn't poisoned them, you think these people would've crawled out of hiding?"

Ye Lingtian gritted his teeth, staring at the sky full of Supremes, completely helpless:

"What do we do now?"

He looked at Qin Jiang. The man had gone to such lengths—surely he had an endgame.

Qin Jiang seemed pleasantly surprised:

'Finally showing some sense.'

He waved his hand:

"Relax. Everything's under control."

---

The Zhao family.

One of the Ye family's enemies, they had deployed seven Supreme-level experts for this assault. Additionally, numerous other powerhouses were stationed near Ye City as backup.

Which meant the Zhao family compound itself was at its weakest.

And outside the Zhao family compound, two teams stood in the shadows, staring at each other wide-eyed.

"What are you doing here?"

Both sides spoke simultaneously.

After a beat of mutual glaring, one side demanded:

"Aren't you supposed to be protecting Young Jiang? Why are you here?"

"It was Young Jiang's idea. Several ancient clans, including the Zhao family, sent most of their forces against the Ye family. This is when they're most vulnerable. Young Jiang said our Qin family did all this work—we can't come out empty-handed. So he sent us to...

Er, rob the Zhao family's treasury.

What about you?"

"The Fourth Ancestor sent us. Also to rob the treasury."

Both sides fell silent with exasperation.

They were Supreme-level experts, ancestral figures of a great family—and they'd been dispatched as common thieves.

Granted, they were robbing an ancient clan.

"In that case, let's work together."

"Agreed."

And it wasn't just the Zhao family. The other enemy clans were experiencing virtually identical situations.

---

Back at the Ye family.

The Fourth Ancestor surveyed the barrier surrounding the city and nodded in satisfaction:

"Not bad. Didn't even need me to act—they sealed themselves in."

"Fourth Ancestor, thirty-two Supremes. Can you handle them?"

Qin Jiang asked with a grin.

The Fourth Ancestor regarded the assembled Supremes and sighed:

"A bit thin. By rights, for my first battle after ascending to Great Emperor, I should've had at least a few hundred Supremes to christen my blade.

Still, these ancient clans are pretty weak. I won't hold it against them."

With that, he pointed a single finger.

The thirty-plus Supreme experts vanished without a trace, their terrifying auras dissipating in an instant.

Ye Lingtian stood dumbstruck, face blank with shock.

Had he heard right?

Ascending to Emperor?

"Young... Young Jiang, that man..."

"My family's Fourth Ancestor. What about him?"

"His strength?"

"Didn't you just hear?"

Qin Jiang smiled faintly.

Ye Lingtian's heart shook. A real Great Emperor!

The Qin family actually had a Great Emperor!

His mind drifted. Hadn't all the Great Emperors of the Heavenly Mystery Continent mysteriously vanished?

How did the Qin family still have one?

And if the Qin family did... could other ancient clans also be hiding Great Emperors?

Did that mean only the Ye family truly had none?

The thought left Ye Lingtian feeling rather dejected. The Ye family really was weak.

They didn't even have a Great Emperor.

"Stop spacing out. The remaining enemies still need you to deal with!"

Qin Jiang spoke up, snapping him out of his spiraling thoughts.

Coming to his senses, Ye Lingtian looked toward the city. These small fry were clearly beneath that man's notice. It was up to the Ye family to handle them.

He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and began directing operations. Eventually, he even joined the battle himself.

And truth be told, he looked rather impressive doing it.
