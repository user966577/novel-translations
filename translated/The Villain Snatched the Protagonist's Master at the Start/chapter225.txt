Once again, Lian'er and Zi Fu found themselves squatting outside the Space-Time Temple, wearing matching expressions of melancholy.

"Sigh." Zi Fu let out a long breath.

Lian'er glanced at her and followed suit. "Sigh~"

They looked at each other.

"What are you sighing about?" Zi Fu asked.

"What about you?" Lian'er countered.

Zi Fu propped her chin in her hand, staring at the Space-Time Temple with a scowl. She didn't need to imagine what was going on inside. "I'm trying to figure out why so many women like your brother when he's so... unhinged."

It was genuinely bothering her. These past few days of observing Qin Jiang had planted a seed of something in her own heart. Pulling back now? Too late.

Lian'er gazed at the temple and held up one finger. "First, my brother's handsome. First impressions matter, and what girl doesn't like a good-looking guy? Zi Fu, don't tell me you prefer ugly men."

Zi Fu had nothing to say to that.

Two fingers. "Second, he's strong. You saw it yourself—three straight months, and he satisfied every single sister-in-law, with enough left over to give you a go. How can you not appreciate that?"

"I haven't tried it," Zi Fu muttered, face reddening.

Three fingers. "Third, my brother's talent is number one in all the myriad realms. You know the Myriad Realms Tower? The top-ranked person is my brother."

"Number one in the Myriad Realms Tower?" That genuinely shocked her. She understood the weight of that ranking—while it didn't necessarily make someone the most talented prodigy across all realms, it certainly made them a top contender.

"Fourth, he's rich and generous. He hands out Immortal Path Laws like candy. Zi Fu, weren't you after one too?"

"Fifth, he treats his women well—actually, he treats everyone close to him well. Tough on the outside, gentle on the inside. Iron and silk. A real man!"

"Sixth..."

The list went on and on, painting a picture of perfection.

"Doesn't he have any flaws?" Zi Fu finally cut in.

Lian'er paused, scratching her head. After a long moment: "I can't think of any."

Zi Fu was dumbfounded. Sure, Lian'er had a point about the tough exterior and gentle core—to outsiders, Qin Jiang was nothing but flaws, but to Lian'er, his only flaw was being her brother.

Zi Fu shook her head. She could see a few flaws. His behavior at the casino, for instance—outrageously brazen, the type to invite trouble. Then again, his exchange with Chen Qi'er hinted that his brazenness was always calculated, always within his control. Deliberate provocation, part of a plan. She couldn't decide if that counted as a flaw.

Beyond that, he was perverted—though "passionate" sounded better, and the women certainly didn't seem to mind. He was also a massive hypocrite, but then, everyone was; at least he was honest about it. Ruthless and vicious too, but only toward outsiders.

"Oh! He's shameless!" she declared after extensive deliberation. "Your brother is completely, utterly shameless. That's definitely a flaw!"

At the casino, they'd barely met, and he'd called her "wifey" to her face. Said it was because she was pretty. Absolutely brazen!

"Shameless?" Lian'er mulled it over. Her brother was a bit shameless, true, but... "That's not really a flaw, is it? When he's shameless toward enemies, it's to protect the people he cares about. When he's shameless toward you, it's because he wants to give you a better life. That's a virtue!"

"???"

No wonder Lian'er couldn't think of flaws—she beautified every single one. Filters cranked to maximum. Zi Fu rolled her eyes and gave up talking to her. The girl was a certified brother-worshipper. In her eyes, Qin Jiang glowed from head to toe. And Qin Jiang was a certified sister-worshipper right back. A matched set, each convinced the other was flawless.

This time, Qin Jiang emerged in less than a day. The two were still chatting aimlessly, each lost in their own thoughts.

"Where are the sisters-in-law?" Lian'er looked up, seeing only Qin Jiang.

He spread his hands. "All training hard."

Zi Fu bit her tongue. "Training hard." Right. Training hard—in bed.

"Lian'er," Qin Jiang said, "you should put in some effort too. How about going into seclusion and breaking through to Supreme?"

Lian'er had picked up a few of her brother's bad habits—like not wanting to train. With a Nirvana Divine Body, she was still only at the Saint Realm. It was criminal.

"Train? Yes—I need to train hard!" She snapped to attention, suddenly blazing with determination. Her recent failures had all been due to insufficient strength. If she were strong enough, she could knock her brother out cold, no problem. Just like their mother had knocked out their father and carried him off. Lian'er would learn from the best. No daughter of a tigress was ever a lamb. She'd train hard, surpass her brother, and knock him out and carry him away.

The thought made her giggle to herself.

"What's so funny?" Qin Jiang flicked her forehead.

Lian'er looked up, face dead serious. "I'm going to train until I reach the Immortal level!"

"..."

He'd been thinking the Supreme Realm—achievable inside the Space-Time Temple in under a month. But Immortal? A bit ambitious.

Before he could respond, Lian'er sprinted to her room. "Where are you going?"

"To drag Little Red out! Having her with me makes my training more efficient!" She disappeared and returned moments later with a very confused Little Red in tow, then charged straight into the Space-Time Temple.

Her decisiveness left even Qin Jiang a little stunned. He scratched his head and turned to Zi Fu. "Did something set Lian'er off?"
