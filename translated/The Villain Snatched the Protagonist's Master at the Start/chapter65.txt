"Looks like Sword Valley poses no challenge whatsoever for a Sword Emperor," Qin Jiang mused.

He'd seen Lin Chen descend into the valley in the system's spoilers. Even Lin Chen had felt some pressure despite being stronger than ordinary disciples. But Qin Jiang felt nothing at all as he strolled through the depths.

As he went deeper, the number of Holy Sword Sect disciples thinned out. Past the 10,000-foot mark, he encountered almost none. Sword Intent was a realm that eluded most cultivators—even Bai Jingyun, the Sect Master himself, had only reached that level. The Grand Elder's sword comprehension was stronger, having achieved Sword Force.

Beyond that, the sect's true foundation lay hidden in the valley's depths. Below 20,000 feet, the occupants were all ancestral elders—Sword Force masters who'd spent their lives in seclusion, caring about nothing except the sword. Unless the sect faced an existential crisis, they remained in permanent closed-door cultivation, exploring the limits of swordsmanship.

At 20,000 feet, even these recluses grew sparse. Qin Jiang checked the system's plot data but found the terrain uniformly similar throughout the valley.

"How the hell am I supposed to find anyone down here?" he muttered.

Lin Chen had stumbled upon the ancestral elder through protagonist luck—a fated romantic encounter. Qin Jiang, as the villain, enjoyed no such plot armor. He'd have to make his own luck.

Scratching his head, he pressed onward. According to the spoilers, the woman he was looking for—Liu Shuwan—resided around the 27,000-foot depth. He wouldn't find her this high up.

Around 23,000 feet, Qin Jiang spotted a stone hut—the kind the sect's ancestral elders built for their seclusion. His face brightened and he approached.

He rapped on the door. Hard.

"Which bastard dares disturb this ancestor's seclusion?!" a furious voice roared from within. The stone door swung open and a wrathful old man stormed out, immediately spotting Qin Jiang.

His brow furrowed in surprise. So young? He scrutinized Qin Jiang carefully, confirming this was genuinely a young person. While most powerful cultivators could maintain a youthful appearance, they couldn't fake the vitality of actual youth. A man like Fourth Ancestor might look young, but the ancient, weathered aura around him gave him away in an instant.

"Boy, why have you disturbed my seclusion?" Despite his surprise, he was still annoyed at the interruption.

Qin Jiang appraised the old man in turn. A Supreme Realm cultivator—formidable normally, but here in Sword Valley, raw power meant little. Sword comprehension was king. In a fight down here, Qin Jiang could wipe the floor with him.

"I'm looking for someone. Know where Liu Shuwan is?"

The old man's eyes narrowed. Sword pressure began radiating from him toward Qin Jiang. Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow—oh, getting feisty, was he?—and casually unleashed his Sword Heart. In Sword Valley, the ambient sword will bent to his command.

The old man's face went white as an irresistible force slammed down on him. His knees buckled and he dropped to the ground before Qin Jiang with a thud.

"What the—?"

When his brain caught up, his eyes went wide. He stared up at Qin Jiang in disbelief. "You... that's... Sword Heart? You're a Sword Emperor?"

"Not bad—you've got some discernment." Qin Jiang smiled and nodded.

The old man went rigid. A Sword Emperor had actually been born! He gaped at Qin Jiang, so stunned he forgot he was still kneeling.

"Alright, get up. At your age, staying on your knees can't be good for the joints."

The old man's face reddened and he scrambled to his feet. Though, kneeling before a Sword Emperor wasn't exactly shameful.

"So... you really have Sword Heart?" he asked cautiously.

Qin Jiang raised his hand with a half-smile. "Want me to demonstrate again?"

"Uh... I'll pass."

The old man shook his head vigorously, then recalled Qin Jiang's question. "You're looking for the Saintess?"

"Saintess?"

"That's right. Liu Shuwan was the Saintess of my generation—the most talented of us all. Shame she never quite reached Sword Heart." He peered at Qin Jiang with undisguised wonder. This boy was genuinely young. How had someone so young achieved Sword Heart? Did prodigies like this actually exist?

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang absorbed this new information. So Liu Shuwan had been a Saintess. No wonder she had that certain quality about her.

"Where is she secluded?" he asked.

The old man scratched his head sheepishly. "The Saintess is around the 27,000-foot mark. I can't reach that depth, so I don't know her exact location. But there's another old-timer secluded near 25,000 feet—I know where he is, and I can just barely get there. Want me to take you to ask him?"

"Lead the way."

The old man eagerly set off with Qin Jiang in tow, heading deeper into the valley.

"Lord Sword Emperor, what business do you have with the Saintess?" he asked along the way, stubbornly using the honorific despite being told Qin Jiang's actual name. Qin Jiang didn't push the issue. "Sword Emperor" had a nice ring to it.

"I've taken an interest in her," Qin Jiang said bluntly.

The old man stopped dead in his tracks, jaw dropping. "Huh?"

"Problem?" Qin Jiang asked.

The old man's expression grew complicated. He studied Qin Jiang delicately. "If you don't mind me asking, Lord Sword Emperor... how old are you?"

"Eighteen. Legal adult."

The old man: "..."

Eighteen years old. An eighteen-year-old Sword Emperor!

He'd known Qin Jiang was young, but this young? This was what a true prodigy looked like. Compared to this, his own accomplishments were dog shit.

But his expression turned odd. Eighteen, and he'd set his sights on the Saintess of his generation?

A bit... unusual.

"Do you know how old the Saintess is?" he ventured.

Qin Jiang shook his head. He genuinely didn't know Liu Shuwan's exact age—she probably didn't remember it herself.

"She and I are from the same era. My age is, well... about six thousand. So the Saintess is roughly..."

"Six thousand." Qin Jiang mulled it over. "They say a woman three years older brings gold bricks. If she's six thousand years older, imagine how many gold bricks that is."

Listening to this logic, the old man was rendered speechless. Internally, though, he felt nothing but pure admiration.

This kid played a different game entirely.
