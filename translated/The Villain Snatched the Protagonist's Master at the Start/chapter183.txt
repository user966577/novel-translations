Xue Mei's eyelid twitched at the sight of Xiao Jiu's spontaneous kiss.

'The girl is far too easy to win over. One immortal herb and she's throwing herself at him!'

She glanced at Qin Jiang, wondering idly—if he gave her an immortal herb, would she do the same...

Unfortunately, he didn't offer.

"Adjust your condition first. Tonight, I'll help you refine the herb," Qin Jiang said.

Xiao Jiu's cultivation wasn't strong enough to refine an immortal herb on her own. She'd need an assistant. Qin Jiang was perfect for the job.

Xiao Jiu nodded obediently, then turned to Xue Mei. "Ancestor, I need to go prepare."

"No need to leave." Xue Mei shook her head and pointed at the lake. "There's a hidden chamber at the bottom. Refine it there."

Inside the underwater chamber, Qin Jiang and Xiao Jiu were alone.

A man and a woman in a sealed room—Xiao Jiu couldn't help feeling nervous. She steadied herself and looked at him. "Can we begin?"

"Just call me by my name." He checked her state and nodded. "Let's start."

She picked up the Three Dawn Miracle Bloom and blinked at it. "How do I use it?"

"Just eat the petals. Only the three-colored ones—ignore the rest."

She parted her lips and bit delicately into the flower. The instant her teeth touched it, the petals trembled and dissolved into a cascade of three-colored radiance that poured into her mouth.

A tremendous energy began surging through her body.

"Steady your mind," Qin Jiang instructed. "Refine the energy and fuse it into your physical body."

Xiao Jiu closed her eyes and sank her awareness inward. The immortal herb's energy was immense but gentle in nature—no risk of injuring her. The problem was volume. Her refinement speed couldn't keep up with the rate of release.

Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed as excess energy burst outward, shredding Xiao Jiu's clothes in the process.

"Energy going to waste," he murmured.

He settled behind her, pressed his palms to her back, and activated the Taotie Divine Body. The scattered immortal energy was drawn back and channeled into her body. Then he began placing seals across her skin—purely functional, to prevent further energy leakage.

After a while, Xiao Jiu was covered head to toe in densely packed seals. Qin Jiang examined his handiwork with satisfaction. No wasted energy, and the visual effect was... rather pleasing.

Full refinement would take considerable time. He watched for a while longer, then left the chamber.

Night had fallen.

By the lake, a small courtyard had been hastily constructed. Jian Yao and the others were staying there. Qin Jiang strolled in.

Every room was dark. He rubbed his chin. "Which room tonight?"

His finger traced through the air, finally settling on one. He grinned. "You're it."

Without hesitation, he slipped through the window. A figure with exquisite curves sat cross-legged on the bed, meditating. For most cultivators, meditation served as rest.

He crept onto the bed and wrapped his arms around her from behind. She trembled, froze for an instant, then softened.

The moment he made contact, he knew who it was—that plush warmth could only belong to the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's ancestor.

She didn't resist.

So he proceeded.

It was well past noon the next day when Qin Jiang finally emerged.

He looked down at the woman in his arms with a sigh of genuine appreciation. The pinnacle of curvaceous beauty really was every man's dream.

He lingered a moment longer, then rose at the sound of voices outside. After straightening his clothes, he leaned down and kissed Xue Mei lightly on the cheek before stepping out.

The other women were already assembled. None looked surprised to see him leaving Xue Mei's room—they'd heard plenty the night before.

Only Hu Xian'er stared at him with puffed cheeks. She'd left her door open and everything, and he still hadn't come to her.

'Clearly, the more eager you are, the less you're valued. From now on, I'm playing it cool.'

Sensing her little tantrum, Qin Jiang went over to soothe her with a few sweet words. This airhead was so easy to placate—a handful of honeyed phrases and she was beaming again, clinging to his arm with no intention of letting go.

Jian Yao and the others watched the spectacle in mild disbelief. 'He's literally sweet-talking a fool.'

After some leisurely time with the women, Qin Jiang left the courtyard and sought out the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's clan chief. Using Xue Mei's authority, he issued a directive: hunt down Tang Yin. The moment he was spotted, mobilize and kill.

Not that it would actually work. Tang Yin was a Child of Destiny—cockroach-level survivability. But it would alter the plot trajectory, and every bit of pressure was worth the Villain Points.

'Squeeze every last drop. In half a month, this leek retires.'

By then, Chen Changsheng should be arriving in the Demon Domain. That thick, lush leek was the real prize.
