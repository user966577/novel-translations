With time dilation on his side, it didn't take Qin Jiang long to thoroughly welcome all twelve women. Their extended stay at the academy had left them somewhat reserved around him, however—careful, almost timid, as though one wrong move might see them cast aside again.

That would take time to fix. He'd have to let them settle in gradually. Once they spent enough time in the inner circle and understood his nature, they'd loosen up.

For now, they were exceptionally accommodating. Whatever he suggested, they went along with—even things that pushed boundaries. For Qin Jiang, these were the good days, because once they truly understood him, they'd inevitably develop a rebellious streak. Emboldened by his indulgence, they'd push every limit they could find.

The "punishments" he meted out for such behavior? To them, those were rewards. And honestly, the things they got up to were rewards for him too.

Little romantic games—just slightly depraved ones.

With the newcomers settled, Qin Jiang still had one more appointment to keep. His time was precious, and only the Space-Time Law made it all manageable.

He left the estate and returned to the immortal vessel. There was still the matter of Murong Qing—their relationship had never been made public. Her resistance had long since softened, but Qin Jiang enjoyed the clandestine nature of their affair. It was thrilling. Murong Qing felt the same way.

Since she'd come to terms with letting Xue Yue learn the truth, she'd grown far bolder. She'd tease Qin Jiang right under Xue Yue's nose, sometimes sneaking to Xue Yue's door and pressing herself against it while he had his way with her.

Once, Xue Yue had come looking for her mother while the two were still in Murong Qing's room. In a panic, Murong Qing had shoved Qin Jiang under the covers. Her legs disappeared under the blankets too, and she'd chatted with Xue Yue for half a day, face perfectly composed—while Qin Jiang nearly suffocated underneath. He'd choked on several mouthfuls.

This kind of thing had happened more than once, and Murong Qing loved every second of it. The thrill was unmistakable to Qin Jiang each time.

Xue Yue, for her part, was growing frustrated. She'd been hoping for a chance to join Murong Qing, but after more than a decade, that wish remained unfulfilled. Meanwhile, Qin Jiang and her mother's antics were getting progressively more outrageous.

All she could do was watch from the sidelines. And not just watch—she had to play along, pretending to notice suspicious signs, stepping outside to "investigate" while the two hid in the bushes nearby and she pretended not to see them.

In Murong Qing's room, she'd have to act as though something seemed off, voicing her suspicions to heighten the sense of near-discovery that her mother craved.

It was exhausting. She almost wished she'd never known in the first place. But as a daughter, indulging her mother was only right. And every time the performance ended, Qin Jiang showed her some very special appreciation for her trouble.

That appreciation, she quite enjoyed.

Aboard the vessel, Murong Qing was waiting. The moment she saw him, her face bloomed into a smile. She leaped into his arms, legs wrapping around his waist, arms circling his neck like an octopus.

"You're late! That means punishment!"

Her pouty lips conveyed mock displeasure at being kept waiting.

Qin Jiang laughed, supporting her with both arms. "I accept Qing'er's punishment."

"My room first?"

"Let's go."

He carried her there, and once inside, they slipped into the hidden sub-space they'd designed together. The compact room was more elaborately decorated than anything in the estate, with props and furnishings for every occasion.

Murong Qing's body flickered out of his grasp. She hovered barefoot just above the floor, a head taller than him, and leaned down to press a finger between his brows.

"Today, I'm the queen!"

"And I am...?"

"Minister Qin, you are my most trusted pillar of the realm." She giggled, then let the smile fade, replacing it with an expression of regal distress. "But lately, affairs of state weigh heavily upon me. I wonder if Minister Qin might help me... relax."

She drifted to the bed and sat, crossing her legs, one foot bouncing idly. Every movement was an invitation.

Qin Jiang stepped forward, an obsequious grin plastered across his face. "Your Majesty, your humble servant exists to ease your burdens."

He knelt, took her foot in his hands, and looked up. "Your Majesty's weariness stems from physical exhaustion. Allow me to relieve it."

Murong Qing leaned back, placing her foot in his lap and tracing a circle on his chest. "You always did understand me best, Minister Qin."

He began massaging her foot, eyes gleaming. Before long, his hands developed a mind of their own, creeping gradually upward...

Murong Qing's eyes snapped open. "Minister Qin! You presume too much!"

"Do I?" He caught her calf, rose to his feet, and tipped her backward onto the bed. She clenched her teeth. "Insolence! You dare disrespect your queen!"

"Your Majesty, I am the most powerful minister in the court. One word from me and the nation moves. If I'm in a sour mood, well... rebellions happen. You wouldn't want your subjects to suffer, would you?"

"You... you traitor! I trusted you!"

"As long as Your Majesty cooperates, I remain your most loyal servant."

Murong Qing's expression cycled from fury to sorrow. Qin Jiang pinned her down, grinning. "Be good, Your Majesty. Otherwise..."

"Treasonous scoundrel!"

"Heh, Your Majesty may insult me all she likes. I rather enjoy it."

"You... deviant!"

Fists clenched, face the picture of righteous indignation, Murong Qing finally drew a deep breath. For the sake of her kingdom, her people—she relented.

"Do not undermine the realm. My people must not suffer."

"As long as Your Majesty behaves, the kingdom remains as it is."

"Then... do as you will. So long as you serve the throne faithfully, I shall... make it worth your while."

"Heh. Your humble servant obeys."
