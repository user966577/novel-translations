  "synopsis": "Qin Jiang transmigrated into a xuanhuan world—as the young patriarch of a villain family. His adorable little sister wants to break off her engagement with some 'trash' named Xiao Fan, and Qin Jiang's eighteen years of web novel experience tells him exactly what that means: Xiao Fan is the protagonist, and his family are the cannon-fodder villains destined to be face-slapped.\n\nBut just as he resolves to defy fate, the Villain Spoiler System awakens, granting him the ability to see the Child of Destiny's future trajectory. Armed with foreknowledge of every lucky encounter and power-up the protagonist is supposed to receive, Qin Jiang decides to do what any sensible transmigrator would do—snatch everything first.\n\nStarting with the protagonist's beautiful master.",
