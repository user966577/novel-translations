At the center of the formation, Wu Tian was dazed. The hand that had held the pearl was gone—his entire arm obliterated, half his body blown away.

The pearl burst? He'd overloaded it?

Even now, he didn't suspect the middle-aged man. His trust ran that deep.

After a moment, he shook his head and regained some clarity. The searing pain hit all at once. He looked down—his body was a ruin. Not a single inch was intact.

Gritting his teeth, face chalk-white, he swatted aside the lingering explosion waves with his remaining arm, then looked toward where the man had gone. Had he caught the treasure? Had the pearl exploding hurt him?

Hurt, broken, and his first thought was still for his companion.

Truly, he was deeply moved. He could cry.

The middle-aged man, meanwhile, was watching from a safe distance, heart still pounding. Good thing he'd been clever enough to find an excuse to leave. Otherwise, that blast might have killed him.

A shame about the long-term meal ticket, though. At least he still had his son-in-law to fall back on. Surely the man wouldn't let his own father-in-law starve?

He was daydreaming about his cushy future when Qin Jiang appeared behind him and clapped a hand on his shoulder.

"Who—?!" The man nearly jumped out of his skin—a guilty conscience will do that. Seeing Qin Jiang, he sagged with relief and plastered on an ingratiating grin. "Oh, Lord Manor Lord! Your humble servant greets you."

He bowed deeply. Despite being Qin Jiang's father-in-law, he knew his place—better to keep the posture low.

"At ease." Qin Jiang waved him off and glanced toward Wu Tian with a satisfied smile. "Well done."

He produced the Chaos Sword. It had lost its spiritual essence, but for a Pixiu, essence or no essence, it was all food. "Your reward."

He tossed it over. The man's eyes lit up at the Immortal King weapon's aura. He caught it and hugged it to his chest, nearly drooling. Now this was a real treasure! Twenty years with Wu Tian and he'd never eaten this well.

His son-in-law really was the best—a massive gift right off the bat. "Thank you for the reward, my lord!"

"A trifle." Qin Jiang jerked his thumb toward Wu Tian. "Want to come watch the show?"

"Uh..." The man's head retracted into his shoulders. He gave a sheepish laugh. "I'll pass, if it's all the same."

He knew Wu Tian was about to die. And a cornered Immortal Emperor reincarnation? The death throes would be catastrophic. Having spent years swindling the man, he'd be a prime target. What if Wu Tian dragged him down as a parting gift?

Qin Jiang had anticipated exactly this. Using the man as a hate magnet was far preferable to putting himself or his women in the line of fire.

He grabbed the man. "Let's go."

They rose into the air and appeared before Wu Tian in an instant. Simultaneously, An Xihe and the others materialized, encircling Wu Tian completely.

The sudden arrivals startled Wu Tian. He scanned the faces and his heart sank.

One Immortal Emperor. Eight Immortal Kings.

Huaxia. In full force.

His gaze found Qin Jiang. Though it was their first meeting, Wu Tian recognized him instantly—this was the Lord of Huaxia. His sister was one of this man's women, and he had no idea what kind of life she was living. He'd heard Qin Jiang had women by the dozen. In that sort of arrangement, his sister surely wasn't happy.

For years, he'd dreamed of rescuing her. But against Huaxia, even he felt powerless. He could only keep building his strength.

Then An Xihe had broken through to Immortal Emperor, and the gap became insurmountable.

He tried to calm himself. Why were they here? He'd never clashed with Huaxia directly—only that one attempt to free his sister, and he'd escaped without being identified. And whatever else, his sister was Qin Jiang's woman. Surely that counted for something?

But one Immortal Emperor and eight Immortal Kings, deployed in full? In the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, who else warranted this kind of response?

As he puzzled it out, the fidgeting middle-aged man was shoved to the front by Qin Jiang. His face fell. Being used as bait was exactly the sort of thing his wonderful son-in-law would do.

Seeing the man, Wu Tian frowned. A theory formed.

Were they after the Pixiu? Wanted to capture him as Huaxia's auspicious beast?

But capturing one middle-aged Pixiu didn't require this much firepower. Wait—maybe they weren't after Old Yun at all. Maybe it was the treasure Old Yun had sensed!

After all that digging, they'd never caught it. The Treasure-Seeking Pearl had even detonated—probably a backlash from the treasure itself. And Old Yun looked rattled. Probably injured.

If the treasure was powerful enough to do all that, it must be truly extraordinary. Huaxia must have detected it and come in force.

Wu Tian's mind raced through this theory, still not harboring a single shred of suspicion toward the middle-aged man. He was even trying to figure out how to rescue him.

Their eyes met. Wu Tian tried to convey a message through his gaze, but the middle-aged man immediately looked away.

He felt a twinge of guilt. He also hadn't expected Wu Tian to trust him this completely—the man was literally blown to pieces and still hadn't suspected a thing.

Truly loyal. And truly stupid.

Seeing the man avert his gaze, Wu Tian was exasperated. This idiot—couldn't he at least pass along some information?

He exhaled heavily. With no help from that quarter, he'd have to work on Qin Jiang directly. After all, the man was technically his brother-in-law. Some face had to be given, right? At a minimum, Old Yun should be safe.

But first, he needed to identify himself. With the state he was in, even his own sister might not recognize him.

He cleared his throat and, with what dignity he could muster, bowed slightly. "Wu Tian of the Wu family greets the Lord of Huaxia."
