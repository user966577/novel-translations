Deep within the Snake Race's territory, mist swirled through a cavern, occasionally flickering with threads of dark radiance.

Mo Ling stepped inside and took a deep, appreciative breath. This was the ideal environment for their Black Water Serpent bloodline.

A pair of crimson serpentine eyes snapped open. In an instant, the mist vanished. Light flickered, and a black-robed elder materialized before Mo Ling.

"Mo Ling greets the Ancestor."

This elder was the Black Serpent Ancestor—an Immortal-path cultivator and one of the Snake Race's five great Immortals.

The old man sat cross-legged, regarding Mo Ling with an impassive gaze. His voice was ancient and weathered. "Speak. What do you want?"

"This descendant wishes to ask the Ancestor to emerge from seclusion and help secure the Snake Race chieftain's seat."

The Black Serpent Ancestor frowned. "What happened? Did the poison I gave you fail to cripple the Purple-Scale girl's bloodline?"

"It worked at first," Mo Ling said, stealing a cautious glance at the elder. The poison had been the Ancestor's own creation, and having it broken must have been a blow to his pride.

"And then?"

Mo Ling cleared his throat. "Then... somehow, she found a way to neutralize it."

The Black Serpent Ancestor's face darkened.

Mo Ling quickly lowered his head. Just as he'd suspected—the old man was embarrassed. Back when he'd provided the poison, he'd sworn that no one in all of Azure Cloud Heaven could undo it. Mo Ling had been privately skeptical even then.

And look—broken. Just like that.

This was a valuable lesson: never speak in absolutes. Mo Ling filed that one away.

"Who broke it?" the Ancestor asked, his voice cutting.

Mo Ling's eyes glinted. "According to our intelligence, it was a human youth. A Supreme, actually."

The Black Serpent Ancestor stared at him. He had the distinct feeling this junior was rubbing salt in the wound, deliberately emphasizing that a mere Supreme had undone his masterwork. He snorted coldly. "A Supreme is enough to make you come begging for my help?"

"Well, there are also three Immortals at his side."

"What?" The Ancestor's composure cracked, his aura trembling slightly. "Three Immortals? You're certain?"

"Certain."

The elder's eyes narrowed. "So it was those Immortals who cured the poison. That makes more sense. But..." He fixed Mo Ling with an icy stare. "You want me to take on three Immortals? Are you trying to get me killed?"

Mo Ling's mouth twitched. The Ancestor's bluntness was going to be the death of him. "Our Snake Race has four other Immortals," he ventured.

The Ancestor laughed coldly. "And why would they help you? The Purple-Scale faction managed to secure three Immortals as allies—that speaks to their capability. Backing them, befriending those Immortals—wouldn't that be the smarter play?"

A shadow crossed his gaze. The other four Immortals would almost certainly support the Purple-Scale Serpent. But he was the one who'd provided the poison that had nearly killed their Empress. If those three Immortals were close enough to the Purple-Scale faction, they might turn on him.

The more he thought about it, the colder his stare became when he looked at Mo Ling. If this useless descendant hadn't come asking for poison in the first place, he wouldn't be in this predicament. One chieftain's seat—it meant nothing to him.

But the regret was useless now.

"You clearly came here with something in mind," he said to Mo Ling, his brow furrowed. "What's your angle?"

"Heh." Mo Ling grinned. "Ancestor, one of those three Immortals is a demonic cultivator. A full-blown demon, interfering in the Snake Race's internal affairs for no apparent reason. Surely she must have some sinister agenda."

At the Purple-Scale Serpent territory, the clan had spent some time recuperating. Their injured had recovered, and the competition for the Snake Race chieftainship was set to resume.

Only two factions were genuine contenders—the Black Water Serpent and the Purple-Scale Serpent. Every other serpent species had gone to ground, watching and waiting to see which side gained the upper hand before committing their support.

"How does your Snake Race choose its chieftain?" Qin Jiang asked.

Yu Lan explained: "The Snake Race has over a hundred different species, and each holds a vote. The chieftainship competition lasts a full year. Whichever faction receives the most votes claims the seat."

"Voting?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

"It prevents the succession from becoming too destructive. Too much in-fighting weakens the entire race."

He made a face. "Doesn't seem to be working very well."

Without him, the entire Purple-Scale Serpent faction would have been annihilated. That seemed like pretty destructive competition.

Yu Lan smiled ruefully. "You're not wrong. But if the five Immortal Ancestors intervene directly, they can appoint the chieftain themselves. The previous chieftain was nominated by three of the five."

"Oh? Then why haven't they stepped in this time?"

"The previous chieftain was a prodigy—born with a royal bloodline, personally mentored by the Ancestors. She became a Great Emperor and assumed the seat. Now, barely a thousand years later, she's already attempting a breakthrough to the Immortal path. In terms of seniority, she's actually my junior."

A thousand years from Great Emperor to the Immortal path—impressive talent, especially for someone without cheats.

Qin Jiang squeezed Yu Lan's hand. "You're no less capable than her. If she can be chieftain, my Lan Lan certainly can too."

"I'm prettier than her, though," Yu Lan said with a playful wink, leaning into him.

Qin Jiang paused. "Wait—the previous chieftain was a woman?"

"Mhm." Yu Lan nodded. "Interested?"

"Well, a heavenly talent like that—I'd certainly like to meet her."

Yu Lan rolled her eyes. She knew exactly how Qin Jiang's mind worked. If he ever laid eyes on the previous chieftain, he'd move heaven and earth to make her his.

"Don't bother. She's in seclusion. She won't be coming out anytime soon," Yu Lan said.

Breaking through to the Immortal path took considerable time. Yan Shiya had possessed the Immortal Path Law and the Time-Space Disc, and it had still taken her over a decade. Doing it through pure cultivation could easily take centuries.

Qin Jiang sighed with genuine regret. Centuries—he couldn't wait that long.

He looked down at Yu Lan. Those sparkling eyes of hers told him she'd raised the topic on purpose, knowing it would rile him up. He smirked, pulling her close. When the itch needed scratching, she was the one who'd have to help.
