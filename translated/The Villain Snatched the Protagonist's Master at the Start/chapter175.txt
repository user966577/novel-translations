The Demon Domain.

This was yao territory. Across the vast expanse of Azure Cloud Heaven, the yao race's strength rivaled the humans'. Fortunately, the two great races maintained relative peace, with only occasional minor skirmishes that never escalated.

Many human cultivators were happy to venture into the Demon Domain for training. The outer reaches held only ordinary yao beasts—most hadn't even developed sentience. But deeper in, one began to encounter yao clans proper. Any tribe that had organized into a clan possessed at least a Saint Realm cultivator, and no ordinary person dared provoke them.

The deeper one went, the stronger the clans became.

In a verdant, spiritually rich valley, one such powerful yao clan made its home—the White Fox Tribe.

Most fox clans were known for their cunning and cruelty. The White Fox Tribe was the opposite: famously innocent and kindhearted. If not for their considerable strength, creatures with that disposition would have been wiped out long ago.

"So this is the White Fox Tribe?"

A strikingly beautiful woman appeared at the valley's rim, gazing down. Among the greenery below, she could make out a few snow-white little foxes tumbling over each other in play. Adorable.

She spared them only a passing glance before unleashing her Primordial Spirit Power, which swept across the entire White Fox Tribe in an instant. She murmured to herself, "Qin Jiang said there's an immortal herb here..."

This was Jian Yao.

Qin Jiang himself hadn't arrived yet, but he knew from the system's plot data that Tang Yin would eventually come for the White Fox Tribe's immortal herb. So he'd sent Jian Yao ahead to intercept.

He was curious to see the look on the Tang family's face when they came to seize the herb—and found an Immortal waiting for them.

The moment Jian Yao's Primordial Spirit Power unfurled, a powerful aura erupted from within the White Fox Tribe. A figure materialized before her in an instant.

It was a woman in a flowing white dress. Despite Jian Yao's blatantly aggressive intrusion, her expression remained gentle—curious, even, her pretty eyes blinking with innocent interest.

"Are you here to visit our White Fox Tribe, big sister?"

Her voice was soft and sweet, the kind that immediately put people at ease.

Jian Yao reined in her aura and studied the woman, one elegant brow arching. What a gentle creature. Even though they'd barely exchanged a word, the woman's innate warmth made Jian Yao feel her own temper soften—just a touch.

"Big sister?"

When Jian Yao didn't respond, the woman tilted her head, blinking again.

Good grief.

Jian Yao snapped back to the present and gave the woman a long, appraising look. If she put this one in front of Qin Jiang, the lecherous wolf would lose his mind.

Then again, knowing him, that was probably why he'd sent her here in the first place—he already knew a beauty was waiting.

Taking a breath, Jian Yao put on a smile. "You're the White Fox Tribe's clan chief?"

"That's right! I'm Hu Xian'er, chief of the White Fox Tribe and also its strongest member." The woman beamed, managing to spill her entire hand of cards in two sentences. "Would you like to come play in our tribe, big sister?" She pointed toward the valley.

Looking at Hu Xian'er, Jian Yao was speechless. If Qin Jiang hadn't warned her that the White Fox Tribe was genuinely this guileless, she would have pegged Hu Xian'er as a master manipulator hiding behind an airheaded facade.

But this level of naivety was borderline excessive.

She nodded. "I actually came here on purpose. I heard the White Fox Tribe has an immortal herb?"

At the first sentence, Hu Xian'er's face lit up. At the mention of the immortal herb, it froze. Wariness crept into her pretty eyes.

She was naive, not stupid.

An immortal herb was the kind of treasure that could spark wars. One wrong move and the White Fox Tribe would be history.

"You must be mistaken, big sister. We don't have an immortal herb!" Her expression was stiff with forced casualness.

"Really?"

"Really!"

Hu Xian'er nodded vigorously, but her big eyes were darting back and forth—an obvious tell.

Jian Yao smiled without pressing the point. Her main objective wasn't the herb anyway—it was to stop Tang Yin from getting it.

After a moment's thought, she asked, "Then can I come visit your tribe?"

"Huh?"

Hu Xian'er's heart sank. She was worried that once Jian Yao entered the tribe, she'd discover the herb.

"Well, actually..." She fumbled for words, stammering badly. "There really isn't much to see in our tribe. Maybe... you'd enjoy going somewhere else?"

"Didn't you just invite me?"

Hu Xian'er's expression crumbled. 'You hadn't mentioned the immortal herb yet!'

Seeing her face, Jian Yao grinned. "Or does the White Fox Tribe really have an immortal herb, and you're afraid I'll see it, so you don't dare let me in?"

"No no no!" Hu Xian'er shook her head like a rattle drum. "We don't have an immortal herb!"

"Then I can come in?"

"O... okay." She agreed reluctantly, not daring to refuse for fear of raising more suspicion. But the unhappiness was written plainly across her face.

Jian Yao shook her head. This was a textbook airhead—every emotion on full display. If she ever fell into Qin Jiang's hands... the poor thing wouldn't stand a chance against that deviant.

Following Hu Xian'er into the valley, Jian Yao found the environment quite lovely. The moment they entered, a group of little foxes came bounding over to play. Hu Xian'er, still in a sour mood, waved her hand and sent the whole cluster tumbling away.

The ground was covered in soft grass, so no one was hurt. The foxes landed, glowed briefly, and transformed into a gaggle of children, all puffing their cheeks indignantly at Hu Xian'er.

"Chief's being a bully!"

"Shoo!"

Hu Xian'er puffed up her own cheeks and glared right back. The standoff made Jian Yao chuckle despite herself.

This White Fox Tribe was certainly entertaining.

No sooner had the children been chased off than a group of pretty young women appeared, clustering around Jian Yao and chattering excitedly.

"Wow, big sister, you're so beautiful!"

"Are you human?"

"Even prettier than our chief!"

"That's not true—our chief is prettier!"

"No way! This big sister is prettier. And look at those curves—that's what our chief is missing."

Hu Xian'er couldn't help glancing down at herself, then at Jian Yao. Her cheeks flushed pink.

"Enough, enough! This sister is an honored guest. Go play somewhere else, all of you. Any more disruptions and I'll enforce tribal law!"

She planted her fists on her hips and shooed them away. They scattered with giggles, clearly unafraid, but left willingly enough.

Jian Yao stared in quiet amazement. How on earth had this tribe of fox spirits survived this long? They had the temperament of children.

In a world of survival of the fittest, the White Fox Tribe's continued existence was nothing short of a miracle.

And so far, every member she'd seen appeared to be female.
