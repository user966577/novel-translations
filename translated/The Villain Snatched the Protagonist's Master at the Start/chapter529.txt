At Huaxia Academy, Qin Jiang strolled around with Murong Qing for a while before returning to the estate. Murong Qing followed, naturally. The other women didn't ask too many questions. Only Xue Yue put on a brief show, and Murong Qing easily brushed it aside.

Watching both of them deceive each other, Qin Jiang couldn't help but smile—only to receive simultaneous glares from Murong Qing and Xue Yue.

Meanwhile, he was already hatching a plan: it was time for Xue Yue to stage an "affair-catching" scene. After all these years, Murong Qing really should be brought into the fold.

And so, over the following days, with Qin Jiang's encouragement, Murong Qing grew bolder and bolder. Several times, they came dangerously close to being discovered.

One evening, Qin Jiang slipped into Murong Qing's room and swept her into his arms. "Heh, Qing'er, did you miss me?"

"Why are you here so early?" Murong Qing asked in surprise. It was still the first half of the night—normally this rascal didn't come until well past midnight.

"I was with Yue'er, but she got tired, so I came to find you instead. It's been days since I've seen you—missed you terribly." He carried her straight to the bed, tossed her onto it, and pounced after her.

On the bed, they held each other close, and Qin Jiang pressed his lips to hers. When they finally parted, Murong Qing's breathing had quickened. She gave him a light smack and huffed, "What's the rush?"

"Heh, I just missed you, that's all." He grinned.

Her gaze softened. She lifted her arms and wrapped them around his neck. "Then... go ahead."

"Gladly."

He kissed her firmly, and they began in earnest. Murong Qing matched his every move—they knew each other well by now—and before long, they were lost in each other.

At the same time, he kept teasing between breaths. "Qing'er, want to go outside Yue'er's room?"

"Mm, no~"

"She's already asleep. She won't catch us. Sure you don't want to?"

"No~" Murong Qing shook her head. Her eyes were half-lidded, teeth grazing her lower lip, and though she said no, her heart was already racing with anticipation—hoping Qin Jiang would simply carry her there.

And he understood her perfectly.

He smiled, lifted her up, and she let out a small yelp, arms flying around his neck. Supporting her with one arm, he kissed her cheek and grinned. "I'll carry you over, Qing'er."

"Mm~" She gave a soft sound of assent, burying her face in his chest, trembling faintly.

Carrying Murong Qing, Qin Jiang opened the door—and stopped dead. Xue Yue was standing right outside.

He winked at her. She glared back, though she was in a rather good mood. This rascal was finally willing to come clean. After this, she and Murong Qing could be together... just the thought was thrilling.

In his arms, Murong Qing sensed that he'd stopped moving. She looked up, puzzled. "What's wrong?"

With Qin Jiang holding her and Xue Yue behind her back, she had no idea. He cleared his throat. "Qing'er, what would you do if... Yue'er saw us right now, like this?"

"Then let her join!" Murong Qing answered without a shred of hesitation. This sort of hypothetical wasn't new between them—it added a bit of spice.

"Really?"

"Of course!"

"Yue'er is right behind you."

"???"

She stiffened, but quickly scoffed and nipped at his neck. "You scoundrel, you're trying to scare me again!"

"She's really behind you."

"Then let's all do it together—you pervert, isn't this what you've always wanted?" A mischievous glint flashed in her eyes. "When the time comes, you can find out for yourself who feels better—me or Yue'er."

Qin Jiang blinked. He looked at Murong Qing, then at Xue Yue. Licking his lips, he cleared his throat. "Yue'er, what do you think?"

"I think you two should start by explaining yourselves."

"!!!"

Xue Yue's voice hit Murong Qing like a thunderbolt. Her body went rigid, her flushed face draining of color. She twisted around and locked eyes with Xue Yue.

Seeing her there, Murong Qing's lips trembled. Her mind went blank. Panic flooded in.

The only part of her that wasn't panicking was the part still connected to Qin Jiang—and that part wasn't merely calm, it was excited beyond measure.

After a moment of heavy silence, Murong Qing recovered slightly and tried to get down, but Qin Jiang held her fast. She shot him a reproachful look, then spoke in a quavering voice. "Yue'er, I..."

She wanted to explain but had no idea where to begin. She lowered her head, ashamed. Especially since, right now, that part of her was still... but she truly couldn't control it. With Xue Yue right there, even without Qin Jiang moving, just the contact alone was overwhelming.

She didn't dare look at Xue Yue and buried her face in Qin Jiang's chest like an ostrich.

He'd never seen her like this. She was genuinely frightened—all that bold talk earlier was pure bluster. The moment Xue Yue actually appeared, she crumbled.

He smiled, lowered his head, and kissed her forehead. She shivered, shook her head, but still wouldn't look up.

"Qing'er~" he called softly.

No response. She was playing dead.

Gentle persuasion wasn't working—time for a more physical approach. His prowess, after all, was considerable. And so he escalated.

Before long, Murong Qing couldn't suppress a muffled moan, her hands gripping his clothes so fiercely she nearly tore them. But she still refused to lift her head, silently shedding tears.

Qin Jiang didn't relent. Finally, Murong Qing clung to him with all her strength, her head tilting back of its own accord. She stared at him, eyes brimming with hurt.

That expression shattered his restraint. He leaned in and kissed her.

"Mm, don't~" She tried to resist, but her resistance was feeble. Once his lips met hers, muscle memory kicked in, and she kissed him back.

After a long while, he held her close and whispered in her ear. "Qing'er, I need to tell you something. Promise not to get mad?"

"Hm?"

"Actually... Yue'er has known about us the whole time. We've been putting on an act together."

"???"
