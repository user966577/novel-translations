Hearing his daughter's denial, Bai Jingyun sighed, assuming she was just embarrassed.

He continued gently:

"Susu, I know about you and Qin Jiang. Since things have already... progressed this far, and you're already..."

He glanced at Bai Susu's stomach but ultimately couldn't bring himself to say the word "child." He simply urged:

"From now on, you two should be good to each other. Qin Jiang might be a bit of a rascal, but his status, talent, and strength are more than worthy of you."

Bai Jingyun shot Qin Jiang a look as he spoke these reluctant words. Before coming to the Qin family, he'd done his homework—Qin Jiang already had several women.

All of whom he'd taken by force.

The fact that this thug had gotten his hands on his precious daughter...

It was infuriating just thinking about it.

But what was done was done. All he could hope for now was that Qin Jiang and Bai Susu would build a life together, and that at the very least, his daughter could find happiness.

With that thought, he turned a warning glare on Qin Jiang.

"Qin Jiang, I'm entrusting Susu to you. But if you dare mistreat her, the Holy Sword Sect won't stand for it!"

He was putting the full weight of the sect behind his daughter.

Listening to her father hand her over to Qin Jiang in the span of a few sentences, Bai Susu was stunned. True, at this point she didn't have many options.

But her father's reaction was completely out of character.

This wasn't like him at all.

Having said his piece, Bai Jingyun took a deep breath. He seemed to be struggling internally. With a wave of his hand:

"Alright, Susu, get some rest. I'm heading back."

Bai Susu: "..."

Before she could process what had just happened, Qin Jiang and Bai Jingyun were already walking out of the courtyard.

"Why are you following me? Shouldn't you be looking after Susu?"

Bai Jingyun eyed Qin Jiang.

In his mind, Bai Susu was pregnant. Qin Jiang, as the husband, should be at her side around the clock.

Caring for her, of course. Preferably not the other kind of attention.

Qin Jiang glanced back and smiled.

"I just wanted to ask—does Susu have a senior brother at the Holy Sword Sect?"

"Hm?"

Bai Jingyun stopped walking, his expression sharpening.

"Susu told you?"

Lin Chen's identity was classified as top secret within the Holy Sword Sect. He'd accompanied Bai Jingyun here under the guise of an ordinary disciple.

By all rights, Qin Jiang shouldn't have known.

Qin Jiang nodded.

"Susu told me they're very close."

Bai Jingyun gave him a sidelong look, immediately reading the subtext.

"Relax. Susu and her senior brother have nothing between them. Before, there might have been some mutual attraction, but now... She told you one of the Holy Sword Sect's most closely guarded secrets. If that doesn't earn your trust, what will?"

Internally, he was baffled. It had been, what, a month at most?

And Bai Susu had already spilled classified intel to Qin Jiang? Had she moved on that quickly?

Back at the sect, he'd known perfectly well that his daughter had feelings for Lin Chen. She'd just been too shy to act on them. And now...

After a single month with Qin Jiang, she'd shifted her affections entirely.

Bai Jingyun studied Qin Jiang. He had to admit—looks alone, Qin Jiang far outclassed Lin Chen. And his background and talent were equally impressive.

Factor in their... intimacy, and Bai Susu's change of heart seemed practically inevitable.

With these thoughts, Bai Jingyun finally relaxed. Whatever the circumstances, his daughter had apparently fallen for Qin Jiang. Being with him should make her happy.

'I'll need to have a talk with Lin Chen. The boy still seems to have feelings for Susu.'

Two people pining for each other, neither willing to make the first move—and then a third party had come along, kicked the door down, and walked off with the girl.

Lin Chen was the unlucky one here.

"Could I meet Susu's senior brother?"

Qin Jiang spoke up.

Bai Jingyun snapped back to the present.

"Well..."

He was torn. On one hand, Lin Chen's identity was classified. On the other, would Qin Jiang going to see Lin Chen come across as rubbing salt in the wound?

"He is classified within our Holy Sword Sect. You—"

"Classified?"

Qin Jiang blinked innocently.

"But Susu gave me the full rundown. I know his name is Lin Chen, he's Susu's senior brother, the Holy Sword Sect's Holy Son, and he has an Innate Sword Body. Oh, and I even have his portrait..."

Bai Jingyun: "..."

Watching Qin Jiang actually produce a portrait, Bai Jingyun nearly lost his composure.

Their most closely guarded secret, and Bai Susu had held nothing back—laid it all bare for Qin Jiang. In that moment, he began to question his own existence.

His daughter had essentially sold out the entire Holy Sword Sect.

"Classified" had become a punchline.

Especially the way Qin Jiang said it with that questioning lilt—as if subtly mocking him. Bai Jingyun's cheek twitched.

"Uncle Bai?"

Qin Jiang prompted.

Bai Jingyun collected himself. Looking at the portrait in Qin Jiang's hands, he felt a headache coming on.

"About Lin Chen's information... is there any chance you could—"

"Oh, of course. Lin Chen is your sect's top secret. I won't breathe a word."

Qin Jiang assured him solemnly.

Bai Jingyun: "..."

Coming from someone who already possessed a detailed portrait, the word "secret" now sounded like a taunt.

But there was nothing he could do. His own daughter had blown the lid off.

He could only force an awkward smile.

"Much appreciated, my boy."

"Happy to help."

Qin Jiang smiled back warmly, then continued:

"So... can I go see Lin Chen? If I'm not mistaken, he's here at the Qin estate right now, isn't he?"

Bai Jingyun gave a dry laugh.

"Sharp eyes. What exactly do you want with my disciple?"

"Nothing major."

Qin Jiang's smile was easy, carefree.

"It's just that from the way Susu talked about Lin Chen, she seemed to admire him quite a lot. So I'm curious—what makes him worthy of that kind of admiration."

"Ah..."

Bai Jingyun understood immediately. Qin Jiang was looking for a fight.

His brow furrowed slightly in concern.

Lin Chen possessed an Innate Sword Body, while Qin Jiang reportedly had the Immaculate Divine Body.

The two physiques were roughly equal in grade.

But Qin Jiang had the full backing of the Qin family behind him, whereas Lin Chen had only risen to prominence three years ago. Lin Chen might be at a disadvantage.

Then again, the Immaculate Divine Body's primary advantage lay in cultivation speed, while the Innate Sword Body was renowned for its lethal offensive power.

In an actual fight, the outcome was far from certain.

The bigger issue, though, was location. This was the Qin family's home ground.

Win or lose, Lin Chen couldn't come out ahead here.
