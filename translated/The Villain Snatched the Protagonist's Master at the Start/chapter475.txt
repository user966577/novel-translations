The airship cruised toward Blood Tribe territory at a leisurely pace. At that speed, the journey would take several days -- which naturally meant several days of enjoyment for Qin Jiang. He timed things perfectly, though, so the women had recovered by arrival.

Blood Tribe territory was drenched in crimson. The air hung thick with a coppery, metallic scent -- not actual blood, but the fragrance of Blood Spirit Grass, which blanketed the entire region. For the Blood Tribe, it was a staple cultivation resource. Not essential, but cultivation slowed without it.

Xue Yue had been smart enough to stockpile a massive supply before her escape, enough to last until now. Standing on the airship, Qin Jiang took a breath. The scent was overwhelming for most people. But Xue Yue was breathing it in blissfully. "The smell of home~"

Mo Mo also enjoyed the blood-like aroma, though she was mildly disappointed it wasn't the real thing. The rest of the women wrinkled their noses and shielded themselves with spiritual energy.

The airship's arrival was quickly noticed. Unlike with the Zhou family, no one had warned the Blood Tribe. Sentries surged into the sky to intercept them.

"Who goes there?"

"It's me." Xue Yue stepped forward.

As Blood Tribe royalty -- and a notorious one at that -- nearly every warrior recognized her. The guard's expression shifted. A year ago she'd been disowned, but now she was the hottest ticket in the realm.

"Princess Xue Yue." He bowed hastily, eyes flicking nervously toward the airship. If she was here, then the person inside must be... He sent an urgent message back to the tribe without hesitation.

Forcing a smile, he said, "Princess, the chief has been missing you terribly since you left. He'll be overjoyed to hear you've returned."

He didn't dare mention the disownment. All he could do was talk up the chief's feelings and hope she bore no grudge. Against Huaxia, the Blood Tribe had zero leverage.

What he didn't realize was that Xue Yue was completely oblivious to her own expulsion. She nodded brightly. "Take me to my father."

She turned to the airship and waved. "Qin Jiang, come on~"

He appeared beside her, smiling at the guard. "Lead the way."

The guard's face froze. This was the lord of Huaxia. He nodded stiffly and guided them toward the Blood Tribe's palace. Before long, a massive delegation rushed out to greet them -- practically every high-ranking elder, including the Blood Tribe chief himself. They couldn't afford to keep such guests waiting.

Xue Yue spotted them and waved. "Father! Over here!"

The chief and his entourage reached the couple. Looking at Xue Yue's warm, beaming smile, guilt gnawed at every one of them. The chief felt it worst -- he'd had his own daughter expelled for the tribe's sake, and here she was, smiling without a trace of resentment.

'She must understand I had no choice,' he consoled himself.

His gaze shifted to Qin Jiang. Xue Yue made the introduction. "Father, this is my husband -- Qin Jiang. The lord of Huaxia. You've heard of him?"

"Manor Lord Qin." The chief bowed.

On paper, he was Qin Jiang's father-in-law. But the gap in status was immense, and this particular son-in-law didn't seem the type to defer to his elders. Better to tread carefully.

Qin Jiang smiled and gestured for him to rise. "No need for formalities, Chief. I'm just here with Yueyue for a visit. She's been away from home too long and missed the family."

The Blood Tribe elders wilted with guilt. They'd expelled her, and she missed them?

"I want to see my old room first," Xue Yue said cheerfully. "Then Qin Jiang has some business to discuss with you, Father."

The chief stiffened but managed a laugh. "Your old quarters were getting a bit run-down, so I had them... renovated."

"Renovated?"

He nodded, avoiding her eyes. In truth, when Xue Yue had founded the Anti-Huaxia Alliance, he'd ordered every trace of her existence scrubbed from the compound. When she'd later become Qin Jiang's woman, the tribe scrambled to rebuild. So "renovated" was a generous description.

"That's nice -- the old place was pretty shabby," Xue Yue said.

The collective sigh of relief was nearly audible. The chief smiled and led them to the residence.

When Xue Yue saw it, she froze. "This is renovated? Are you sure it wasn't demolished and rebuilt from scratch?"
