During the walk down memory lane, Bai Susu had turned the tables entirely — Qin Jiang nearly became her plaything.

Not that he was complaining. The experience had been thrilling.

Better still, every memory worth revisiting had been faithfully recreated, with several new ones developed along the way. And for most of it, Bai Susu had done all the serving. Qin Jiang simply sat back and enjoyed — truly VIP treatment.

He was quite satisfied.

The only shame was Bai Susu's stamina. After just one day, she was already spent. She lay boneless in his arms, small hands resting on his chest, flushed cheeks pressed against him. Her lips parted slightly, each warm breath stirring the loose strands of hair that trailed across his skin.

The intense activity had left her drenched in a glistening sheen. Qin Jiang held her close, gently wiping her down.

After a while, when he'd finished, he pressed a kiss to her forehead and grinned. "Susu, now that you've had your fun, I believe it's my turn?"

Her expression froze. She gazed up at him with pitiful eyes. "Right now?"

"Mm."

Her delicate frame trembled. This past day, she'd poured every last ounce of energy into serving him. Now she had nothing left.

Qin Jiang chuckled, dipped his head, and kissed her lips. A long moment later, he drew back and murmured against her ear, "This time, I'll serve you."

She flushed crimson, closed her eyes, and nodded gently. "Be gentle~"

He was. He held her like something fragile, something precious. The sensation was like the tide — the slow, rhythmic ebb and flow of the ocean. Not fierce, but deep and unrelenting.

Bai Susu hummed softly, arms draped around his neck, head resting on his shoulder. Eyes half-closed, savoring every moment.

Qin Jiang smoothed her hair and smiled. "Susu, how does it feel?"

"Mm~ It feels wonderful~" Her voice was silky, her face a picture of contentment.

He continued diligently. Customer satisfaction was paramount, after all, and he took his service responsibilities seriously.

But then Bai Susu frowned, opened her eyes, and swatted his hand lightly. "Too much pressure — gentler~"

He adjusted. The customer was always right.

That earned him a satisfied peck on the cheek. She settled back against him, enjoying the rare luxury of being the one attended to. His arms tightened around her. The two pressed close together.

At this intensity, Qin Jiang could have gone for three days without tiring.

And so, after roughly half a day — though the force was barely more than a massage — persistence eventually won out. Bai Susu bit down on her lip, both arms clutching him tight. She was almost there. Almost. Like an arrow drawn to the bowstring, straining for release, but needing one final push.

Her breathing quickened. She swept her hair aside, pressed her lips to his, and whispered, "Husband~ A little harder..."

"Alright~"

He paused, drew back — fully loaded.

"Ready?"

"Mm~"

Finally. With his help, Bai Susu exhaled deeply and melted into his chest. After a moment's rest, she lifted her head, swallowed dryly, and glanced down. A reproachful look crossed her face.

"You're still not done?"

Half a day, and he was still going. She hesitated briefly. At least she wasn't tired anymore.

Qin Jiang shrugged helplessly. "At this intensity, three days wouldn't be enough."

"Hmph. Beast."

With a huff, Bai Susu steeled herself. She couldn't very well leave her husband hanging. She wrapped herself around him and once again took the lead. "I'll help you."

Her stamina had recovered somewhat over the past half-day. She threw everything she had at it — every trick, every technique. Two hours later, she raised her head, licked her lips, and shot him a plaintive look.

"Better now?"

"All better~"

She rolled her eyes and snuggled into his arms. The scoundrel was incorrigible, but she still loved being close to him. She loved his scent, his warmth, his presence — everything about him.

They lingered together for a while before Qin Jiang spoke. "Susu, I have a gift for you."

"What is it? Is it an immortal-path law?"

She looked up, eyes bright with anticipation.

Qin Jiang stared. He flipped his palm and produced a Sword Dao Law. "How did you guess?"

"It really is?" Her face lit up with delight, then settled into a smug expression. "The moment you gave Ningbing an immortal-path law, I knew — you'd have one for each of us. You've never played favorites."

She smiled warmly. She knew this scoundrel well. He might have his preferences, but when it came to what mattered, none of his women were ever left wanting.

Especially those like her — the ones who weren't yet strong enough to stand by his side. He always found other ways to make up for it. This law was secondary. What truly mattered was that he carved out time to be with her alone. He'd played with her, catered to her whims, served her on her terms. And yes, he was still the one who came out on top in the end — but the gesture itself was enough to set her heart at ease. It told every one of his women that he was always thinking of them.

"Sigh. I was hoping it'd be a surprise," Qin Jiang said, smacking his lips.

Bai Susu giggled, grabbed his head, and planted a fierce kiss on his lips. "The law isn't the surprise. You are."

"Is that so~?"

His lips curled. Everyone liked hearing sweet nothings, Qin Jiang included. Warmth spread through his chest. His expression turned adorably smug.

Seeing him like that, Bai Susu couldn't help but laugh. She nodded emphatically. "Of course~ My husband is the greatest surprise. And if he could stay with me just a little longer — that would be even better~"

"Heh. However long Susu wants, I'll stay."

"Really?"

"Mm."

He knew her as well as she knew him. She might ask for a little more time, but she'd always know where the line was. She'd never be unreasonable.

Besides, unlike him, his women weren't the type to lounge around indulging themselves. They only let themselves be spoiled when he was present, and even then, they knew better than to cling too long. Fall behind, and one day they might truly lose the right to stand at his side.
