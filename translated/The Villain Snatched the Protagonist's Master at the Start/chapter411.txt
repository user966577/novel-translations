After the "strong treatment," Li Qingqiu's request was one Qin Jiang would never refuse.

He pulled her to her feet, grinning. "Want to try it standing?"

"Mm..." She'd never tried that before. Whatever it felt like, she was fairly certain she wouldn't remain upright for long — she could barely stay conscious even lying down. Standing would be exponentially harder. But she trusted Qin Jiang to catch her.

"Say, Qingqiu — can you do the splits?"

His tone turned mischievous. She blinked, then nodded. "Yes."

"Show me?"

"What? Why?"

"Come on, be a good girl. Just let your husband see."

"Pervert!" She blushed and hesitated, then lowered herself into a full split. The instant she did, Qin Jiang scooped her up, and she yelped — immediately understanding what he had in mind.

Her face went crimson, but underneath the embarrassment, anticipation stirred. "Hold still, Qingqiu."

"Mm..."

In her anticipation, Qin Jiang delivered — carrying her through an extraordinary experience.

Meanwhile, Ye Xuan and Li Yang happened to be near the grove. Over the past two weeks, Ye Xuan had played Li Yang like a fiddle. He was completely under her spell — her devoted admirer, visiting the elite quarter daily. If he didn't see her, he couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't even motivate himself to cultivate.

Today was no different, except that today she'd actually invited him for a walk. He was over the moon.

But for some reason, the grove ahead seemed to have an invisible barrier. Beyond a certain point, they simply couldn't enter.

"What's going on?" Li Yang frowned. He'd been hoping to stroll through the trees with Ye Xuan — enjoy the atmosphere, maybe hold her hand, maybe even steal a kiss. But the grove was sealed off.

He looked at Ye Xuan awkwardly. "Maybe we should walk somewhere else?"

Just then, strange sounds drifted out from deep within the trees. A woman's voice.

"Someone's in there?"

The voice sounded familiar. Li Yang's brow creased. He searched his memory — and his eyes flew wide. It was Cousin Qingqiu.

In Ye Xuan's company, he'd nearly forgotten the reason he'd come to Huaxia Academy in the first place — to be near Li Qingqiu. He hadn't even seen her yet, but that voice was unmistakable. Back at the Li estate, she'd called him "dirty" — a single word seared into his memory. Even his illusion during the entrance exam had replayed that scene.

His gaze fixed on the grove. He could hear but not see. And those sounds... He was inexperienced, but he wasn't a child. He had some idea.

His "white moonlight" — the Li family's untouchable ice goddess — was doing that? In broad daylight? In a grove?

He couldn't believe it. He almost convinced himself he was hearing things. But the intermittent sounds were unmistakable.

He stood frozen. After what felt like an eternity, a sharp cry rang out, and then — silence.

Inside the grove, Qin Jiang held Li Qingqiu close, kissing her flushed face. She was dazed, barely present, until his lips found hers and pulled her back. When they finally separated, he released her, and she stumbled — nearly collapsing before he caught her.

She shot him a reproachful look and gave his chest a weak slap. "Jerk. Making me hold that position for so long — my legs are numb. Rub them."

"Of course. Let your husband take care of it."

He rubbed her legs for a while, then looked puzzled. "Qingqiu, what about my gift?"

"It's... still inside," she whispered, cheeks pink. She wanted to savor his gift, so she'd stored it in the safest place — as long as she kept the door closed, nothing would spill.

"Wow. You didn't lose any of it?"

"That's your fault," she huffed. "It's already a secure spot, and you delivered it so deep — of course nothing's getting out."

"Heh. Well, keep it safe, then."

"No way." She tossed her head. "Out with the old, in with the new. Unless you're saying you won't give me another gift?"

She put on a wounded expression — big dewy eyes, trembling lower lip. Qin Jiang melted, sweeping her into his arms and peppering her face with kisses. "Of course I will. Every day, if you want."

"Mm — no! If it's every day, my gift room won't be big enough."

"Really?"

"Really! You should know by now — among all the sisters, my gift room is practically the smallest."

"Heh. Give it a few deliveries and it'll stretch."

"No!" She shook her head firmly. "Don't you like small gift rooms best?"

"What if it's too small for my gifts?"

"Mm..." She considered this, then brightened. "From now on, I'll clean out my gift room every day, ready for the next delivery."

"Works for me." He grinned. "But today's gift is fresh — make sure you keep it safe."

"Mm." She nodded. Her gift room was already quite full. Qin Jiang's gifts were always generous, and her room was on the smaller side — a single delivery filled it to capacity.

Not that she minded the feeling of being completely full.

They cuddled and bantered for a while longer before Qin Jiang helped her stand. "Can you walk?"

"Of course."

"Nothing going to fall out?"

"Nope." She grinned triumphantly. "I've already locked the door."
