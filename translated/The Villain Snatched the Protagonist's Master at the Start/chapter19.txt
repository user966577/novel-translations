"Because of Ling'er, I've spared you time and again. Consider the debt to the Xiao family repaid.

"This time, I won't kill you. But from here on, Ling'er owes your Xiao family nothing.

"Black Dragon—throw him out."

With a sweep of his arm, Qin Jiang sent a burst of force that launched Xiao Fan into the air.

Black Dragon sneered, caught Xiao Fan by the scruff, and hurled him off the mountainside with a casual toss.

Ye Ling'er winced at the sight but said nothing. Her heart was already tilting firmly toward Qin Jiang.

He took her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. She came back to herself, and seeing his warm smile, her somber mood lifted.

"Let's see what we've got."

Qin Jiang grinned.

Ye Ling'er nodded, curiosity piqued. She wanted to know what treasures Qin Jiang had been so intent on finding.

Xiao Fan had already cleared all the traps—and Black Dragon had demolished the rest. Before them stood a stone chamber, still sealed.

That was Qin Jiang's target.

He looked at the chamber.

"Black Dragon."

Black Dragon read his intent instantly. He walked to the stone chamber, gauged the wall's thickness, then drove his fist through it.

His immense power ground the rubble to dust, opening a makeshift doorway.

"Young Patriarch, after you."

Qin Jiang nodded and led Ye Ling'er inside.

Even before entering, a wave of heat washed over him.

Inside, rows of vibrant spiritual herbs swayed gently—all of them fire-attribute.

"Fire-attribute..."

Qin Jiang murmured.

These herbs would have been priceless to Xiao Fan, given his Fire Divine Body.

"So many herbs!"

Ye Ling'er's eyes lit up.

The chamber was more spacious than expected, most of it filled with herbs. At the center, however, lay a small pool of clear water.

Qin Jiang crouched beside it. The water was warm—almost like a hot spring.

Unfortunately, the pool was too small to fit more than one person. A shame—a couple's bath would've been nice.

"Black Dragon, dive in and take a look."

The pool was small but impossibly deep—its bottom invisible.

Black Dragon peered into it, took a deep breath, and leapt in with a splash.

"There's something down there?"

Ye Ling'er asked.

Qin Jiang nodded.

"With this many fire-attribute herbs growing here, the pool is almost certainly the reason. But the water itself is ordinary, which means something at the bottom must be generating the heat—a fire-attribute treasure."

Ye Ling'er thought this made perfect sense. She looked at Qin Jiang admiringly—not just powerful, but clever too.

He seemed... far better than Xiao Fan in every way.

But thinking of Xiao Fan dampened her mood. Every encounter, his hostility toward her deepened.

She didn't understand why.

She'd protected him time and again, yet he repaid her with nothing but scorn.

He'd changed.

At least there was a far more dazzling man at her side now.

About fifteen minutes later, Black Dragon burst from the pool in a column of water.

"Young Patriarch, I found it."

He held out a crimson pearl.

White flames flickered across its surface, warping the air around it.

Qin Jiang took the pearl. Searing heat made him flinch, and he quickly wrapped it in spiritual energy to insulate against the temperature.

The pearl had originally been nameless, though in the storyline, Xiao Fan would have called it the Fire Divine Pearl. Qin Jiang's knowledge of the plot didn't extend far enough to reveal the flame's origins.

What he did know: at full power, this flame could incinerate a Yin-Yang Realm expert to ashes. It also had applications in alchemy.

There were likely other effects beyond what he knew.

"Is that the treasure from the pool?"

Ye Ling'er gazed at the pearl.

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile.

"The herbs, the warm spring—they all exist because of this pearl. But it only works with pure fire-attribute energy, which limits its usefulness. It's not as valuable as you'd think—though for a pure fire-attribute cultivator, it would be an unparalleled treasure."

Ye Ling'er felt a twinge of disappointment. None of them were pure fire-attribute cultivators.

She didn't yet know that Xiao Fan was exactly that—and that this pearl was one of his most critical opportunities. A pity it had now fallen into different hands...

Reward: Supreme Alchemy (can refine pills up to the Supreme grade).

Reward: Villain Points.]

The system's voice sounded in his mind once more.

This haul was even richer than the last, further confirming the Fire Spirit Pearl's importance to Xiao Fan.

More important than a destiny-blessed heroine!

And the pearl itself was almost certainly more valuable than Qin Jiang had assumed.

"Good haul."

Qin Jiang smiled and pocketed the pearl.

He surveyed the remaining fire-attribute herbs, then after a moment's consideration:

"Ling'er, what do you say we leave some of these for Xiao Fan?"

"Huh?"

She blinked.

At the same time, warmth flooded her chest. Xiao Fan had provoked Qin Jiang repeatedly, yet he still showed mercy for her sake—even deliberately leaving behind a share for Xiao Fan.

Ye Ling'er sniffled and reached for Qin Jiang's hand.

"Qin Jiang, thank you~

"But I don't want you to give up what's rightfully yours because of me."

It was the first time Ye Ling'er had put Qin Jiang's interests first.

Qin Jiang smiled, squeezing her hand.

"I'll take some and leave the rest. Consider it compensation for Xiao Fan.

"After all, the Xiao family did raise you. I don't want that weighing on your conscience."

His gentle words made her cheeks flush.

She ducked her head and nodded.

"Whatever you say~"

Qin Jiang harvested a portion of the herbs, leaving the rest for Xiao Fan. Except...

No one noticed that among the remaining herbs, Qin Jiang had slipped in a little something extra.

"All done. Let's head back."

He dusted off his hands.

Without lingering, he led Ye Ling'er back to Azure City Town.

He'd planned to visit Chen Ningbing, but—

"Qin Jiang, tonight... could you stay with me?"

Ye Ling'er's soft, shy voice made him change his plans. Tonight, the big bad wolf and the little white rabbit were destined to raise a storm.
