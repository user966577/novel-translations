Qin Family City.

Qin Jiang lay with his eyes closed, head resting in Liu Shuwan's lap. She gazed down at him tenderly, her slender fingers gently kneading his temples.

His consciousness, meanwhile, was immersed in the system.

Ever since the encounter with the Tang family Great Emperors, the system had detected a new Child of Destiny. Now that his business was settled, it was time to check.

After a while, Qin Jiang opened his eyes, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

'Tang Yin...'

His gaze flickered with interest. This Tang Yin was just like him—a transmigrator. The difference was that Tang Yin appeared to have crossed over from a wuxia world. A transmigrator naturally came with the standard protagonist package: good family, good talent.

But the poor bastard didn't have a cheat system.

Which meant he was destined to become a stepping stone.

Qin Jiang smiled, shifted his head, reached up to wrap his arms around Liu Shuwan's waist, and buried himself against her like a newborn searching for milk.

Liu Shuwan's cheeks flushed. "How old are you? Still haven't weaned yourself..."

"Hehe..."

He grinned shamelessly, lingering for a good while before finally sitting up. Then he pulled Liu Shuwan into his arms from behind.

"Nothing beats being held by Wan'er."

She rolled her eyes but closed them with a quiet sigh, settling into his embrace.

Ever since Jian Yao and Mo Mo had joined Qin Jiang's side, her usefulness to him had shrunk. By now, it seemed like all she had left to offer was... physical comfort. That thought left a thread of anxiety winding through her heart. She was afraid that one day he'd grow bored and start drifting away.

Fortunately, even now, she could still feel his affection—unchanged since the beginning, as warm as the first day.

But she couldn't rest easy.

Qin Jiang's cultivation speed was simply too fast. Even as a Great Emperor, she knew the day would come when he left her behind entirely—just like the other women. It wasn't that Qin Jiang didn't want them by his side. It was that they were too weak. Against powerful enemies, they'd only get hurt. And none of them wanted to be Qin Jiang's burden, so they stayed in the Void Divine Temple, training desperately to keep up with his pace.

But it was so, so hard.

The others couldn't even see his back anymore. Liu Shuwan feared she'd end up the same way.

At that thought, a tremor ran through her body.

As if sensing her unease, Qin Jiang held her tighter. He frowned slightly. He'd had some inkling of what the women were feeling, and he'd already given them considerable help. But matching his pace was still an enormous challenge.

The only silver lining was that the system seemed to have anticipated this predicament from the very start. Most of the early rewards had been designed for the people around him, which kept the gap large but not unbridgeable.

Still, Liu Shuwan's level was already impressive. Under Qin Jiang's guidance, her sword dao continued to advance, and her cultivation was on the verge of stepping into the Ancient Emperor realm. But the immortal path remained impossibly far away.

Treasures that could help someone enter the immortal path were exceedingly rare. An Immortal Path Law might work, but it had to suit the recipient. The Ghost Immortal's law, for instance—if given to Liu Shuwan, it might let her break through, but it would become a limitation in the long run.

The ideal solution was an Immortal Path Seed—the same kind he'd given Jian Yao. A blank Immortal Path Law that could transform into any type of law. Jian Yao's had naturally become a Sword Dao Law after her breakthrough.

Liu Shuwan's best fit would also be a Sword Dao Law. Given enough time, she might comprehend one on her own and reach the immortal path. But that could take ages.

Finding one ready-made was the simpler path.

He held Liu Shuwan without offering excessive comfort or empty promises. Just held her tight.

After a while, the trembling in her body gradually subsided.

Qin Jiang smiled softly and pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Come on another trip with me?"

Liu Shuwan opened her eyes and looked up at him. "Today?"

He calculated the timing. Tang Yin would need to prepare something before visiting the Celestial Rabbit Tribe—that would take time. There was no rush.

"In a couple of days. I'm going to spend some time with Ling'er and the others first."

A smile touched Liu Shuwan's face. She slipped out of his arms. "Go be with Ling'er and the girls. They haven't seen you in ages."

---

The Tang family.

Tang Yin had saved the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's little princess once, but a single act of kindness wasn't nearly enough to make the Celestial Rabbit Tribe go to war against an Immortal.

He needed something more.

"Father, the Celestial Rabbit Tribe's princess has experienced a bloodline reversion. Her future potential is enormous—she could reach the immortal path—and she's the tribe's greatest hope. But her body has a problem."

Tang Yin smiled at his father's puzzled expression and continued. "Her bloodline is incredibly powerful, but her physical body is too frail to withstand it. To keep growing, she needs to strengthen her body. The Celestial Rabbit Tribe has searched for countless treasures to help, but a congenital deficiency is nearly impossible to remedy. It's become a constant worry for them. If we could solve that problem, the Celestial Rabbit Tribe would absolutely help us."

"A congenital deficiency?" The Tang Patriarch frowned. They were experts in poisons and, by extension, medicines—but congenital defects were the hardest to address. "If it's truly congenital, even our Tang family might not have an answer. Unless... we had an immortal herb."

"I know where to find one."

Tang Yin's eyes glinted.

The elders all turned to him. "You do?"

He nodded. "The White Fox Tribe. During my travels, I ran into some trouble and hid among them for a while. I happened to discover that the White Fox Tribe is guarding an immortal herb—one that strengthens the physique. It's perfectly suited for the little princess's condition."

The White Fox Tribe wasn't particularly strong. Their most powerful member was a single Great Emperor—weaker than even the Tang family.

The Patriarch frowned. "You're saying the White Fox Tribe helped you?"

"They did."

"Then... wouldn't stealing their immortal herb be wrong?"

A flash of cold passed through Tang Yin's eyes. "Everything is for the sake of the family."
