From the sidelines, Lian'er and Zi Fu watched everything unfold. Zi Fu's expression was peculiar as she whispered, "These women... are all your brother's... wives?"

"Yep." Lian'er nodded, a flicker of envy in her eyes—she wanted to be part of that circle too.

"Your brother is really..." Zi Fu searched for words for a long moment before finally settling on one: "...a beast." Could he actually keep up with that many women? She had her doubts. Fields could never be plowed to ruin, but even the strongest ox would drop dead if it had too many fields to work. Zi Fu was certain of that.

Lian'er glanced at her with a playful grin. "My brother did call you 'wifey' too, you know."

Zi Fu's face stiffened. She shot Lian'er a look and scoffed, "Your brother was just being a dog in heat."

"Or maybe it was love at first sight?"

"With this many women, they're all love at first sight?"

"My brother's amazing—isn't it normal for him to have more women?"

Zi Fu was speechless. She was convinced Lian'er had a terminal case of big-brother goggles. Then a thought struck her, and her brow creased. "When you first came to find me... it wasn't to set me up with your brother, was it?"

"No! Absolutely not!" Lian'er shook her head, a touch guiltily. Zi Fu scrutinized her with growing suspicion. Had she known about Lian'er kidnapping Bai Susu, she wouldn't have doubted—she'd have been certain.

"Hehe, don't worry, Zi Fu. My brother believes in mutual consent. If you're not willing, he won't force you." Lian'er deflected with a grin.

That actually did put Zi Fu at ease—she'd genuinely been a little worried. After all, quite a few women around Qin Jiang were stronger than her. She honestly couldn't understand why so many exceptional women had gathered around this one man. Based on what she'd observed, he definitely wasn't a good person. Yet Zi Fu found herself increasingly curious. There had to be something worthwhile about him to attract so many hearts. It couldn't be just his looks... though that was an advantage. The first one she'd found so far.

Meanwhile, after Qin Jiang announced the move, everyone cheered and pitched in to relocate his mansion into the Space-Time Temple. While they worked, Qin Jiang found Chen Ningbing and pulled her into his arms.

"Bing'er."

"What is it, my darling Jiang?" She nestled against him, batting her beautiful eyes—alluring and enticing.

"Can't I hold you for no reason?"

Her small hands rested on his shoulders as she pressed close, perfectly obedient. "Of course you can. You're my master, after all~" She rose on tiptoe to whisper in his ear, her breath warm and inviting.

Qin Jiang inhaled deeply and pinched her cheek. "Are you seducing me?"

"Obviously." Her red lips grazed his cheek, a touch of grievance in her voice. "If I don't seduce you, would you even come find me?"

He fell quiet. With more and more women around him, he'd admittedly neglected some of them. Seeing his silence, Chen Ningbing smiled softly and stroked his face. "It's okay. I'm not upset. I know you're busy, and I'm working hard too—to keep up with you. So that one day, I can stand at your side."

Qin Jiang grew stronger every day, just as she'd said before—so strong she could only look up to him. So strong there was no reason to ever betray him. All she could do was push herself, hoping that someday she'd be worthy of standing beside him. Her drive to follow strength made her stronger in turn.

Coming back to himself, Qin Jiang looked at her radiant smile. This woman who'd once made him uneasy seemed to have changed. He lowered his head and kissed her lips gently, then leaned to her ear. "I haven't forgotten about you."

"Hm?"

He smiled. The Poison Dao Law he'd prepared long ago materialized in his palm. "This is an Immortal Path Law. Your cultivation is only at the Saint Realm right now, but once you fuse with it, you'll be able to advance rapidly—all the way to the Immortal Path."

Chen Ningbing's eyes lit up.

"However, this is a Poison Dao Law. You understand—poison tends to be reviled by the world, even despised. If you don't want it, I'll hunt down a different Immortal Path Law for you later."

Before he even finished, Chen Ningbing extended her hand. "I want this one!"

"You're sure?"

She nodded, looking up into his eyes with a smile. "So what if the world won't accept me? As long as you accept me, that's enough."

Qin Jiang smiled and took her hand, wrapping the Immortal Path Law around it. Chen Ningbing examined it curiously, then turned to him, a spark of excitement on her face. "Once I refine this law, will I be stronger than you?"

"Yes."

Her excitement intensified. She hooked her arms around his neck with a giggle. "Then I'm definitely pinning you down!"

"???"

Having been at Qin Jiang's side for so long, even if her strength truly surpassed his, she'd never dream of betraying him. Chen Ningbing might chase power, but she wasn't heartless. She knew everything she had came from Qin Jiang—without him, she might have spent her entire life trapped in that small town. Her heart and soul were already his. So once she surpassed him, her one and only thought was to pin him down. She wanted to be the one in control.

"That's... probably not going to happen," Qin Jiang said, shutting her down.

In that department, he was on a completely different level—even the Immortal Path couldn't compare. Of course, he occasionally let his partners take the lead, but he'd never done so with Chen Ningbing. Given her temperament... it was better to keep her firmly under control.

She pouted, clutching the law. "We'll see about that! And you'd better not beg for mercy."

"Actually, we could test it right now." He grinned wickedly.

Her face reddened. She glanced around, then swatted his chest. "Stop it. The others are still here."

"Then why are you seducing me?"

"Because I missed you..."

She nuzzled against him, then looked up hopefully. "Will you come see me tonight?"

"Sure~"

He nodded, ruffling her hair. "I'll spend tonight with you. After that, start your seclusion."
