【Ding! Host has altered a major plotline.

Reward: Emperor weapon—Phoenix Sword;

Reward: Kidney Treasure Pill formula;

Reward: Villain Points.】

"Holy—"

Listening to the rewards roll in, Qin Jiang's eyes went wide:

"This haul is massive!"

Innate Primordial Purple Qi, an Immortal technique, an Emperor weapon...

They'd squeezed Ye Xuan completely dry.

But what was the deal with the Kidney Treasure Pill? Was the system looking down on him?

Hmph. He'd just have to investigate what this pill could do.

Muttering to himself, Qin Jiang returned to the Ye estate. Black Dragon had finished his task and was back at his side.

"Young Lord, I found a treasure on him."

Black Dragon reported excitedly.

He scurried over, palm outstretched. A small bronze cauldron sat spinning in his hand. Qin Jiang was momentarily speechless.

Just as he'd thought—they'd squeezed Ye Xuan for everything he had.

Even his natal treasure had dropped.

This little cauldron was the foundation of Ye Xuan's rise. From what Qin Jiang knew, it could refine virtually anything into pure energy—energy that could be absorbed directly without further refinement, while also enhancing talent and tempering the body.

For an ordinary cultivator, possessing such a cauldron was a true golden ticket.

Unfortunately, it wasn't particularly useful to Qin Jiang himself.

But the Qin family's younger generation could benefit from it.

"I'll take the cauldron. I'll compensate you later."

Qin Jiang said, pocketing it.

Black Dragon scratched his head:

"Young Lord, no compensation needed."

He'd brought the cauldron out intending to hand it over anyway. Besides, Qin Jiang had recently gifted him Ancestral Dragon blood essence—worth far more than this trinket.

Qin Jiang didn't argue. He'd give Black Dragon something suitable when the opportunity arose.

Examining the cauldron, he shook his head:

"Shame about this leek. He's all used up."

No wonder this round of rewards had been so generous—his interference had essentially ruined Ye Xuan.

Xiao Fan was disfigured. Ye Xuan was finished. The next Child of Destiny was anyone's guess.

Several days passed.

Qin Jiang shuttled between the Ye estate and Rose Casino.

During this time, Huo Qing'er emerged from seclusion.

Qin Jiang took the opportunity to refine a batch of Kidney Treasure Pills. True to form—system recipes produced nothing short of excellence.

The pills' effects far exceeded expectations.

Three full days later.

Qin Jiang descended the stairs at Rose Casino.

"Young Lord."

Black Dragon jogged over the moment he appeared.

Qin Jiang rubbed his temples:

"What is it?"

"Ye Qingtian sent a message yesterday. Says his son went missing—wants us to help search."

Qin Jiang paused. Ye Xuan was currently enjoying himself quite thoroughly—in no state to go anywhere.

"How is Ye Xuan doing?"

Black Dragon hesitated, as though reluctant to speak. After a long pause:

"He seems to have... taken to it."

"Pfft—!"

Qin Jiang's jaw dropped:

"What did you just say?"

"I have a recording crystal, if the Young Lord would like to see—"

"Ugh—"

Qin Jiang waved him off in disgust. He had no desire to scar his eyes.

After collecting himself, he muttered:

"Truly worthy of a Child of Destiny. What adaptability."

He was genuinely impressed.

"Young Lord, about Ye Qingtian..."

"Tell him we'll help look."

"Yes, sir."
