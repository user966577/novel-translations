When Chen Qi'er reached the inner sect, he kept his presence suppressed this time—no grand entrance. He glanced up at the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's traveling palace, still floating overhead, and his fists tightened. Baizhe was probably up there. Along with that bastard Qin Jiang. And right now, the two of them were probably...

His aura flickered. He drew a deep breath and steadied himself. He was about to look away when two figures leapt from the palace.

His eyes narrowed. A man and a woman—Qin Jiang and Baizhe.

More importantly, Baizhe was clearly upset. Qin Jiang trailed behind her, and she kept shrugging off his attempts to get close. Chen Qi'er's eyes lit up, a spark of hope flaring in his chest.

"They're fighting?"

He masked his aura and moved to follow. This was his chance—his chance to take Baizhe back. He'd known Qin Jiang was no good. Of course the man had done something to upset her. He had to rescue his sister.

Chen Baizhe was indeed angry. She'd been deceived. From the very start, Qin Jiang had been lying to her—all that talk about "no love, no crossing the line," about his principled restraint. Lies, every word. He was nothing but a fraud!

"You big liar! Stop following me!" She swatted his hand away and turned her head, refusing to look at him.

Of course, despite her anger, she wasn't actually trying to leave. With her strength, if she'd genuinely wanted to shake him, Qin Jiang couldn't have kept up.

Girls. A little coaxing went a long way.

He flashed in front of her, but before he could speak, she huffed and pivoted away. After several attempts, he gave up on the frontal approach and simply wrapped his arms around her from behind.

"Let go of me." She squirmed, her voice thick with resentment, but her struggles lacked any real force—nowhere near enough to break free.

He tightened his hold, his voice low and earnest. "I did deceive you. But my love for you—not a single drop of it is fake."

"Hmph." She pouted, cheeks flushed. "I don't believe you. You're a big liar!"

She gave a token wriggle. He rested his chin on her shoulder, lips brushing her earlobe. "Then how about I show you... right now... how real my feelings are?"

"You..." Her face went crimson. She knew exactly what he meant by "feelings."

She lowered her head, voice small. "Not here..."

"Too bad. I need to prove myself."

He grinned roguishly. She felt something shift behind her and squirmed with genuine alarm. "Not here! Let me go!"

---

From the shadows, Chen Qi'er watched, and his blood boiled.

He'd heard enough. Baizhe had been tricked. Though Qin Jiang was spouting sweet nothings, she clearly didn't trust him anymore. And now he was trying to force himself on her.

Seeing Baizhe struggling, Chen Qi'er couldn't hold back any longer. His sister would not be violated.

"Let go of her, you bastard!" He burst from concealment with a roar.

Qin Jiang's brow ticked upward. Chen Baizhe froze, then turned scarlet to the roots of her hair.

"Let me go, you jerk," she whispered.

Qin Jiang smiled—and instead of releasing her, tightened his hold. She shot him a look but understood his intent. Still, she was supposed to be angry. Should she break free? On one hand, staying in his arms while she was mad at him sent mixed signals. On the other, pulling away would definitely annoy him. And this idiot had deceived her...

She peeked up at his profile. Bit her lip. Fine—she wouldn't embarrass him in front of someone else.

Her inner debate only fed Chen Qi'er's misinterpretation. He was certain Qin Jiang was threatening her into compliance, and his rage doubled.

"Qin Jiang! Let her go, or—"

"Or what?"

The casual reply was like a slap. Chen Qi'er's aura rippled with fury. "I'll kill you!"

At that, Chen Baizhe wrenched free and planted herself squarely between them, shielding Qin Jiang. Her eyes swept back to Chen Qi'er with sudden suspicion—when he'd appeared, she hadn't sensed his aura at all.

He'd been hiding it. And why would he do that? One look at the savage intent on his face told her everything. He'd come to hurt Qin Jiang.

All this over a trivial grudge? Fury mixed with her growing disappointment. He hadn't spared a single thought for how she'd feel if Qin Jiang were harmed. He only cared about his own vendetta. He never considered her.

She drew a steadying breath. "I won't let you hurt Qin Jiang."

"Baizhe..." Chen Qi'er stared, disbelieving. "Why? He lied to you! And just now, he was forcing you—why are you still protecting him?!"

She glanced back. Qin Jiang's brow was creased with worry—worry for her. A smile touched her lips, and she turned to face Chen Qi'er squarely.

"Whatever happens between us is between us. Qin Jiang is my husband. You have no right to judge."

Chen Qi'er's jaw went slack. This wasn't the sister he remembered. She felt like a stranger. His whole body swayed, as though all the life had been drained from him. Then his gaze snapped to Qin Jiang, vicious and trembling.

Chen Baizhe's own aura surged in response, ready to intervene.

"Qin Jiang! Stop hiding behind a woman! Face me yourself—settle this man to man!"

With Baizhe in the way, he couldn't touch Qin Jiang. Her strength was only marginally below his own, and they were in the Human Dao Sect's inner sanctum.

Qin Jiang adopted an expression of perfect innocence. He stepped forward and took Baizhe's hand.

"Sweetheart~"
