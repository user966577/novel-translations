After securing Qin Jiang's promise — and extracting a bit of personal attention — Qing Chan finally left.

She strolled through the spacious estate to a smaller courtyard. The instant she stepped inside, four beautiful figures surrounded her.

"Qing Chan-jiejie~"

These four were the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's remaining Human Immortals, aside from Ning Xue'er. Each was lovely and charming in her own right.

Seeing their eager expressions, Qing Chan shot them a look. "It's just a man. Look how desperate you all are."

In truth, she'd nearly forgotten the old arrangement with Qin Jiang. But these four had actually come to her of their own accord. They hadn't said it outright, but everything they said circled back to one thing: they wanted to stay by Qin Jiang's side. Too shy to approach him directly, they'd left the task to Qing Chan — which reminded her of the agreement.

The four women blushed at her teasing. They pulled her to a stone bench in the courtyard and spoke with a touch of petulance.

"Qing Chan-jiejie, we're women too~ Back at the palace, it was fine — no men around, and we just focused on cultivation. But now we're around Qin Jiang almost every day. Who wouldn't have thoughts?"

"Exactly! And he's so handsome!"

"Besides, you all don't exactly keep it down. You're having the time of your lives while the four of us can only listen through the walls. You have no idea how frustrating that is."

"And Xue'er-jiejie told us — you already gave us to Qin Jiang a long time ago. So there. We're staying with him. We're going to be his women."

The complaints grew bolder with each speaker. Qing Chan stared at them, somewhat speechless. These were Divine Palace elders — and they were throwing themselves at him like this?

If Qin Jiang found out, he'd lose his mind with glee.

Then again, this was a culture she herself had created. She was hardly in a position to judge.

Under their expectant stares, Qing Chan shook her head and sighed. "Relax, all of you. With that man's appetite, there's no way he'd let you go. He's had his eye on you for ages. He just hasn't had time lately. Once things settle down, you'll get your turn."

"Really?" Four faces lit up at once.

Qing Chan nodded. "Of course. But our life isn't as glamorous as you imagine. Most of the time, it's pretty... grueling."

"Grueling? But you all look like you're enjoying it?"

"Well... it is grueling, but I'll admit — it's also a kind of pleasure. A lot of women can only dream of this sort of thing, and with Qin Jiang around, we'll never run short." Qing Chan allowed herself a moment of reflection. She was quite satisfied with her current life. Qin Jiang knew how to be tender, and he'd never actually break them. The upkeep was excellent, too. If anything, Qing Chan felt even more... well-maintained than before he'd come into her life.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang had sent Qing Chan off and was stretching lazily, mulling over how to win over the four Divine Palace Immortals.

'They shouldn't be too resistant to me, right?' he mused. They'd been living under the same roof for a while now. This estate housed only his women — and them. If they'd chosen to stay, they must have been mentally prepared.

Maybe they were waiting for him.

The thought made him grin. He glanced toward their courtyard. 'Should I go play?'

After a moment's hesitation, he shook his head. An Xihe's breakthrough was only days away. He could wait.

Besides, with his women constantly around, he was never lonely. Whenever the mood struck, he'd pick a name at random — though more often than not, it was the women picking him. Multiple names at once, sometimes, with extras joining mid-session.

Impossible to escape.

As he was musing, Linglong and Dan Yu appeared. The moment they spotted him, they broke into a jog and threw themselves into his arms. He caught them easily, one in each arm, and carried them toward the courtyard.

"Hey — we didn't come to do that..." Linglong's cheeks flushed.

But Qin Jiang wasn't interested in explanations. Get them inside first.

He shut the door, settled into a chair with both women on his lap, and raised an eyebrow. "So what did you come for?"

"Business, obviously." Linglong rolled her eyes.

Business? Qin Jiang's hands immediately started moving, prompting a startled yelp from Linglong. She grabbed his wandering hand. "I said business!"

"Isn't this business?"

He took the opportunity to hold her hand. Soft, smooth — very pleasant.

"No it isn't!" Linglong puffed her cheeks. Seeing he was about to continue, she blurted out, "I want to discuss the Immortal Pill Dao with you."

The Immortal Pill Dao — a system reward Qin Jiang had given Linglong and Dan Yu to study together. Hearing this, he turned serious. "Hit a bottleneck?"

"Mm." Linglong nodded. "My level is limited. There are parts of the Immortal Pill Dao I can't wrap my head around. Dan Yu's even more stuck than I am. Your alchemy surpasses mine — I thought if we discussed it together, it might help."

"Alright. Show me what's giving you trouble."

Linglong produced a scroll containing the Immortal Pill Dao and launched into her questions, reminding Dan Yu to listen as well. Dan Yu nodded, though she was finding it difficult to concentrate — Qin Jiang's arm was wrapped around her waist, and coherent thought was becoming increasingly optional. Eventually, she gave up entirely and rested her head against his chest. She didn't hear a word about the Immortal Pill Dao.

Linglong, at least, stayed focused. She and Qin Jiang debated back and forth — though she had to swat his roaming hand away more than once.

"We're discussing alchemy! Stop groping. And — hey! Stop teasing Dan Yu. This is a learning opportunity for her. Let her listen properly. If you can't control yourself, then focus on me—"

"Teacher, I'm fine, really."

"You're not fine!"

"I..."

Dan Yu pouted. Her teacher was being mean. She was enjoying it.
