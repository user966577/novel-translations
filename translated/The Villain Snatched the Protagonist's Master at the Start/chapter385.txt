Their eyes met. The heat in Li Qingqiu's gaze was unmistakable.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. Hungry again? What a greedy little kitten.

He smiled, took the hand she'd rested on his chest, and teased, "Qingqiu's hungry again?"

Her cheeks flushed. She said nothing — but silence was answer enough.

Definitely hungry. Wanted more.

Qin Jiang never went against a woman's wishes. He pulled her close and started cooking again. This time, he was determined to feed her until she was thoroughly satisfied. Li Qingqiu had some experience now and could help — their coordination was surprisingly smooth. She handled the simple parts well enough.

Before long, he upped the difficulty. She couldn't keep pace. Who knew that something so simple could involve so many variations? All she could do was follow his lead, drenched in fragrant perspiration. Fortunately, he was patient — guiding her hands, pausing to let her try on her own, giving her a chance to rest while she learned.

A full day. Course after exquisite course. The greedy kitten was finally satisfied.

Along the way, she'd picked up quite a bit. Her technique was still rough, but with practice, she'd improve quickly. And once their coordination matured, the results would only get better.

She lay against his chest, exhausted. Learning all those new techniques had taken everything she had. But the results were undeniably worth it — the advanced methods produced far more satisfying meals.

Eyes half-closed, she tried to rest, but her mind replayed every detail like a student reviewing notes. Before long, she batted away his wandering hands with what little strength she had left.

"Aren't you tired?"

"Not at all." He caught her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze.

Tired? Against hundreds, he'd still come out on top. One Li Qingqiu — and a raw recruit at that — wasn't going to wear him out.

She sighed, closed her eyes again, and pillowed her head on his chest. She stopped minding his roaming hands. Too exhausted to care. Besides, it actually felt nice. A massage, she told herself.

Under his expert touch, she drifted off in minutes.

He looked at her sleeping face, pinched her cheek, and closed his own eyes. Holding a cool, soft beauty while sleeping was remarkably comfortable. He ran hot — always had. The chill was refreshing.

Some time later, Li Qingqiu opened bleary eyes, stared blankly for a moment, then rubbed them with one hand. She propped herself up on his chest and sat beside him, gazing down.

Asleep?

She studied him for a long moment, then reached out and poked his cheek. A small smile crossed her face.

Fun.

So this was why he was always pinching her face. Soft. Lovely texture.

She poked him a few more times. Then her attention wandered — chest, abs... Her hand crept down before she could stop it.

Wow. The texture was incredible. She hadn't appreciated it before, but touching him properly now — this was beyond anything she'd imagined.

Then Qin Jiang rolled over and settled his head directly in her lap. She went rigid. After a tense moment, she confirmed he hadn't woken and relaxed.

But this position... She swallowed, cheeks warming. She could distinctly feel his breath against her "red lips." It was... distracting.

She considered moving his head. If this continued, she was fairly certain her body's response would wake him. A face-wash he didn't ask for.

But before she could act, his nose twitched — once, twice — and then, like a man who'd caught the scent of a delicacy, he zeroed in.

His face wore a contented smile. His lips smacked. And he began to eat.

Very greedy.

Li Qingqiu froze solid, not daring to move a muscle.

Not until the sounds of swallowing — him finishing his meal with a drink to wash it down — broke the spell.

He opened his eyes, stretched, sat up, and pulled the scarlet-faced girl into his arms. "Qingqiu, you smell wonderful."

She stared at him, noted his teasing expression, and asked, "You were awake the whole time?"

"Mm." He nodded. "Woke up a while ago. Felt a bit peckish, so I helped myself to a snack."

"You—"

Her fist clenched. The blush climbed higher, and indignation flooded in. He'd been awake — which meant he'd felt her poking his face, touching his abs. Worse, he'd eaten every last drop of her, and he'd done it while pretending to sleep.

It wasn't as though she'd have refused him! Did he really need to fake it? Absolutely terrible!

He caught her little fist. "Still tired?"

"Yes!"

She nodded vehemently. She'd nearly recovered from sleep, but his little snack had burned through her reserves all over again. Physically drained, though mentally she felt fine. Just... boneless.

"Want to rest more?"

She shook her head and shot him a look. This man was utterly incorrigible. If she stayed in bed, he'd only torment her further.

He produced a pill and popped it into her mouth. A recovery pill. Warmth spread through her limbs instantly.

"How do you feel?"

She tested her body, clenched her fist, and punched him squarely in the chest.

"..."

She nodded. "Much better."

"Better, so you hit me?"

He flicked her forehead. She huffed. "That's for bullying me."

She slipped away and dressed in a flash. Qin Jiang sat on the bed, stretching lazily. She glanced at him, looked away — but her eyes kept drifting back.

'That body has to be the finest any man has ever had.'

He dressed quickly and took her hand, leading her toward the door. "Come on. Mo Mo and the others are probably waiting."
