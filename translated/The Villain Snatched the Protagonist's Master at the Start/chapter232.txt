In a daze, Qin Jiang was tossed onto a bed. He already had the Immortal King Seal primed—but the woman's next words stopped him cold.

"Hehehe, come on, handsome. Be a good boy and warm big sister's bed."

"..."

His face went black as he grasped his situation. Dammit. He'd always been the one stealing women. Now a woman had stolen him. He'd gone and followed in his father's footsteps. Was this hereditary?!

He was the picture of despair. If his father ever found out, the old man would die laughing—Qin Jiang had spent years ribbing him about getting carried off by their mother, and now here he was.

"Hm? Why so glum, handsome?" Qing Chan pounced, tilting his chin up. Her voice dripped with flirtation. "Smile for big sister. Come on, show me those pearly whites."

"..."

"Ooh, you're even more handsome in person. Way better than the portrait. Don't squirm—let big sister have a kiss. Mwah~ Hehe, you smell so good."

"..."

Qin Jiang wanted to cry. He'd always known being handsome wasn't all sunshine and roses—and here was the proof. Kidnapped by a female degenerate. And she wouldn't stop pawing at him.

A man out in the world needed to protect himself, or he'd lose his virtue.

"Stop blocking, handsome—let big sister get a proper look. Oho, these pecs... mmm, and an eight-pack! Mwah mwah mwah~ Oh my, the texture..."

Qing Chan's eyes were shining, her hands tearing at his clothes as she explored. The tables had turned completely.

This was genuinely a first for Qin Jiang, and he was at a total loss. Fortunately, the woman was clearly a novice—despite all the tearing and pawing, she hadn't made any real progress. Just that flushed little mouth, kissing anything it could reach. Somewhat anticlimactic.

Once the shock wore off, Qin Jiang studied her. Something about her seemed familiar. His eyes narrowed. This was the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's ancestor—Black Dragon had just shown him her portrait. He hadn't even begun his approach, and she'd come for him first.

So the hunter became the prey.

Watching her continue her eager but inexpert exploration, Qin Jiang shattered the rest of his clothing himself.

"..."

Qing Chan froze. She looked up at him, stunned, her face turning scarlet in an instant. Until now, she'd only been indulging herself—savoring the novelty of touching a man for the first time. She wasn't ready to go all the way so soon.

"Are you up for this or not?" Qin Jiang asked.

"???"

Her eyes flared. Was he questioning her? She fixed him with a burning stare and set her jaw. "Hmph! Big sister will show you exactly what she's capable of!"

Then she just... stared at him. He stared back. He raised an eyebrow. Well?

She looked down at herself, wrestled with indecision, then glanced at his challenging expression—and committed. She'd grabbed him and gotten this far. Couldn't exactly stop now.

With a huff, she tilted his chin up again. "Big sister has hundreds of thousands of years of cultivation behind her. If you can't take it, just say so. I'd hate to break you."

Outside the Azure Lotus Divine Palace, Jian Yao, Mo Mo, and Yan Shiya had arrived. They exchanged a glance.

"He's here. I can feel Qin Jiang's aura."

"So he really was kidnapped to be a bed-warmer? Is this karmic payback?"

"Regardless, we need to check on him. If it is just bed-warming, fine—but if she means him harm, we have to create an opening for him to use that weapon. Against a True Immortal, he might not get the chance otherwise."

They knew about Qin Jiang's trump card. Powerful as it was, it needed an opening. If the enemy was on guard, even the deadliest weapon was useless against a True Immortal.

They nodded in agreement, suppressed their auras, and headed toward Qin Jiang's location.

They barely made it inside before a figure blocked their path. Ning Xue'er.

"You three?"

Surprised to see them, Ning Xue'er showed no hostility. She recognized them from the investigation into Qin Jiang after the Ghost Immortal incident.

The three women paused. "You know us?"

"Of course—you're always around Qin Jiang. After he killed that Immortal, we looked into him." Ning Xue'er smiled.

The three frowned. So that's how Qin Jiang ended up on their radar.

Ning Xue'er eyed them curiously. "What brings you here?"

"Your ancestor abducted Qin Jiang. You didn't know?"

Jian Yao's voice was icy. Ning Xue'er's eyes went wide—then lit up with delight. "Qing Chan really made her move? She actually grabbed him?"

"..."

"Come on, come on—let's go see! She's finally gone after a man!" Ning Xue'er practically dragged the three women along, buzzing with excitement.

Before long, they reached the flower fields and heard a voice from the cottage—thick with tears.

"Ow! I don't want to anymore~"

That was Qing Chan.

Ning Xue'er's expression shifted. Her big sister sounded like she was in pain. She was about to rush forward, but Jian Yao stopped her.

"We're too late."

"???"

Ning Xue'er stared, uncomprehending.

"Don't worry. Give it a moment."

"But—"

"She's a True Immortal. If she truly wanted to resist, do you think there'd be no commotion?"

"...Good point."

So the four of them camped outside the cottage, listening to the sounds drifting out. What began as teary whimpers gradually shifted to something unmistakably... enthusiastic.

"Told you it was fine," Jian Yao said.

They waited from dawn to dusk, from dusk to dawn. "A True Immortal's constitution really is something," the three murmured. They knew Qin Jiang's stamina well, yet Qing Chan only now showed the first hints of fatigue.

More time passed. By the second nightfall, a plaintive, pleading voice drifted out.

"I'm sorry~ I'll never tease you again~"

"This isn't about teasing! You kidnapped me—do you know how humiliating that is?"

"I'm sorry~ I'll never do it again~"

"Sorry isn't enough. This is a permanent stain on my record. What are you going to do about it?"

"I... I don't know~"

"You don't know? Hmph. First—this stays between us. When we walk out of here, the story is that we've been together for a while and you came to the Chaos District to personally escort me to the Azure Lotus Divine Palace."

"Okay~"

"Second—from now on, you're responsible for my safety."

"Okay~"

"Third—call me 'darling.'"

"Darling~"
