Well past midday, the next day.

The abandoned Nangong Yun had finally found his way back to the mountain. At the base of a familiar peak, he allowed himself a smile. "Master, I'm back."

He launched himself upward — only to slam into a barrier halfway to the summit. The same kind of barrier that had blocked him at Weiwei's courtyard.

His smile froze. 'I know this feeling.'

He looked toward the top, and a dreadful suspicion took shape. 'Master wouldn't have also been...'

His fists clenched. He took a steadying breath. "No. Master would never end up like senior sister."

Deep down, though, he harbored real feelings for Mu Yunxiao. She'd saved him at his lowest point, and her gentleness had left a lasting impression. If he was being honest, she meant more to him than Weiwei ever had. Their time together had been brief, but it had mattered.

And now — a barrier, separating them. Just like before.

He stood there, rooted, unable to go up. All he could do was wait.

This time, the wait was mercifully short. The barrier dropped, and Nangong Yun scrambled up to the courtyard. He scanned the area — no sign of his master, no sign of that man.

His stomach sank. His master's bedroom door was still closed at this hour.

Weiwei and the others were scattered around the courtyard. Nangong Yun plastered on a smile and approached her. "Senior sister, where's Master? I brought fire-attribute spirit medicines. They should help her."

Weiwei barely glanced at him, jerking her chin toward the closed door. "She's in her room. As for the medicines, keep them. Master doesn't need those anymore."

"What?"

"My husband can fix Master's condition permanently. He's in there with her right now. Should be about done."

The color drained from Nangong Yun's face. So his worst fear had come true. They'd only been here a day, and his master was already...

Bitterness welled up. Everyone closest to him was being taken, one by one. Worse, they seemed to go willingly. No matter how many times he told himself they were doing it for his sake, the disgust in Weiwei's and Xue Yue's eyes made the lie harder to sustain.

"Hey — stay back. You reek." Lian'er wrinkled her nose.

Before Nangong Yun could react, she flicked her wrist, and a wave of force sent him tumbling out of the courtyard. The gate slammed shut behind him. She fanned the air theatrically, as if purging some foul odor.

He sat on the ground, dazed. He shook his head, stared at the closed gate, and felt his face burn. He'd been humiliated.

He got to his feet and almost kicked the gate in — but remembered his power level. With effort, he swallowed his rage.

'Endure. Those who achieve great things don't sweat the small stuff. This humiliation is nothing. I still have a blood debt to repay. Until my revenge is complete, I can't afford to be reckless.'

He sat cross-legged outside the gate, eyes locked on the entrance, cold and unblinking.

'Someday, every last indignity will be returned.'

Voices and laughter drifted from within the courtyard for what felt like hours. Then — the creak of a door opening.

Nangong Yun sprang to his feet. He'd know that voice anywhere.

'Master!'

Inside, Qin Jiang and Mu Yunxiao stepped out of the bedroom. She took one look at the assembled women and turned scarlet.

Weiwei immediately bounced over and took her arm. "So, Master — did you like the gift I sent you?"

"You little brat!" Mu Yunxiao glared at her.

Qin Jiang had told her everything in the room — that Weiwei had sent him as a gift. She hadn't quite believed it then.

But now, hearing Weiwei say it herself with that impish grin, there was no denying it.

Her cheeks blazed as she stole a glance at Qin Jiang. Credit where it was due — her disciple had excellent taste. She liked the gift very much.

Then she remembered: she was also a gift. To him.

"And you had the nerve to gift me to him too?" she huffed.

Weiwei blinked innocently. "Does Master not like it?"

"I..."

She wanted to say yes. But the words stuck in her throat — not with everyone watching. She could have said it in private, just her and Qin Jiang, but here? Impossible.

And saying she didn't like it was equally unthinkable. Qin Jiang's temper was unpredictable. Beneath his current warmth, who knew what lurked?

Besides, the "treasure" he'd given her genuinely worked. After refining it, she'd felt a real, permanent boost to her fire-attribute origin. The only issue was that a few sessions' worth wasn't enough to fully balance her constitution.

She'd need more. And Qin Jiang had generously promised that she could have as much as she wanted, whenever she wanted.

The thought painted another layer of pink across her face.

Weiwei grinned. "Looks like Master likes it a lot~"

"Hush, you—"

Qin Jiang's eyebrow quirked. He looked down at Mu Yunxiao. "Mother-in-law doesn't like it?"

"That's not what I—" She waved her hands frantically, desperate to prevent any misunderstanding.

But she couldn't bring herself to say the word "like" with everyone present. If it were just the two of them, she could have mustered the courage. But not here. Not in front of all these eyes.

She looked at him nervously, lips parting and closing, trembling faintly.

He smiled. "So Mother-in-law does like it?"

"Mm~"

A small nod was easy enough. Mu Yunxiao dipped her head, letting out a soft hum of agreement.

That would have to do.
