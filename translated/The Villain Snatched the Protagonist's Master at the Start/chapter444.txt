On the appointed day, the gates of Yue Weiwei's courtyard finally swung open.

Nangong Yun was waiting outside. His gaze snapped toward the entrance — and froze.

Qin Jiang strolled out with a woman on each arm, Weiwei on one side and Xue Yue on the other. He gave Nangong Yun a loaded look, smirked, and planted a loud kiss on each woman's lips, making them blush and squirm. Then, arms around their waists, he sauntered toward Nangong Yun.

Both women turned their gazes on him — eyes filled with helplessness and sorrow.

Nangong Yun caught it all. His body trembled. He quickly looked away, not daring to hold their gaze, his heart aching.

It hurt.

What stung most was the resentment in Xue Yue's eyes. He understood it — she had every right to hate him. Even after she'd destroyed his manhood with that stick, it still couldn't make up for the suffering he'd caused her. Guilt flooded through him.

"Ah, junior brother," Qin Jiang said lightly. "That matter you asked me to look into? It's all been sorted out."

Nangong Yun's head snapped up, a flicker of hope in his eyes. After so many days, finally some good news. "Really? Who killed my brothers? What happened that night?"

Qin Jiang studied him for a moment, then smiled. "Your real name isn't Gu Yun, is it? It's Nangong Yun."

Nangong Yun tensed and glanced at Weiwei and Xue Yue. Both knew his real name — could one of them have revealed it? But he immediately dismissed the thought. Both women had genuine feelings for him; they'd sacrificed so much on his behalf. They would never betray his identity. This man must have uncovered it through his own investigation. If he could dig up a hidden name, his connections must run deep. That made Nangong Yun a little nervous.

"Relax," Qin Jiang said reassuringly. "I've already joined the Anti-Huaxia Alliance. Why would I sell out a fugitive that Huaxia missed?"

The words sounded almost mocking, but Nangong Yun could only manage a dry laugh. "You're impressive, senior brother. My real name is indeed Nangong Yun."

Qin Jiang nodded. "Since you're Nangong Yun, then you know the Nangong family had enemies. Your survival was discovered by one of those enemies, and they sent people to eliminate you — root and branch. That night, you passed out at my place, so they couldn't find you. But your two brothers... they took the blow meant for you."

The color drained from Nangong Yun's face. His brothers had died because of him. His fists clenched, his voice shaking. "Who exactly did it?"

"The Zhou family. Your Nangong family's sworn enemies. The one who struck was a Human Immortal. I'm afraid you can't get revenge."

"The Zhou family!" Nangong Yun bit out through clenched teeth.

The Zhou family — the Nangong family's mortal foe. The Nangong family was gone, but the Zhou family still thrived, with True Immortals among their ranks. With Nangong Yun's current strength, going against them was like a mayfly trying to topple a tree.

But he wasn't afraid. He'd had the guts to found the Anti-Huaxia Alliance and oppose Huaxia itself — what was one Zhou family? He might not be strong enough now, but someday he would be. He took a deep breath and suppressed the impulse. "Thank you for this, senior brother."

"Don't thank me." Qin Jiang waved him off and looked down at Weiwei with a sly grin. "These past few days, Weiwei's been the one pushing me to investigate. And to keep me motivated, she's been working herself to the bone every night."

"Eek~ You're so embarrassing~" Weiwei's face went red. For a split second, her eyes met Nangong Yun's — and he clearly saw the sorrow and helplessness in them.

Then she buried her face in Qin Jiang's chest.

Nangong Yun's heart clenched. No wonder the investigation had been so thorough in such a short time. Behind the scenes, his senior sister had been paying the price — working herself ragged every single night. 'She must be exhausted. She's probably even swollen by now.'

Meanwhile, Xue Yue kept her face cold and refused to look at Nangong Yun. Her acting wasn't good enough for subtlety, so she'd settled on the simplest approach — and besides, keeping a cold face around Nangong Yun was easy. The only challenge was not looking at Qin Jiang, because if Nangong Yun saw the desire in her eyes when she looked at him, the whole charade would collapse.

Both women's performances cut Nangong Yun to the quick. But he had to endure. Now wasn't the time to show his hand — he was far too weak. And a thought was forming in his mind: perhaps, if his senior sister and Xue Yue worked a little harder, they could get this man to help him move against the Zhou family.

The idea made him feel guilty. But for his brothers' sake, he'd bear that guilt. He just needed his senior sister and Xue Yue to suffer a bit more. Given their feelings for him, they'd surely agree — just as Xue Yue had. She'd been furious enough to smash his manhood, but she'd still chosen to help him in the end. His senior sister would be no different.

The only difficulty was finding a way to communicate his plan.

Just then, Qin Jiang interrupted his thoughts. "Yueyue, why the long face today?"

Xue Yue forced a thin smile. She shook her head quietly. "I'm fine. Just... a bit uncomfortable."

No acting required — being around Nangong Yun genuinely made her nauseous. She wanted to hit him with a stick again.

"Uncomfortable?" Qin Jiang frowned with concern and pulled her into his arms. He leaned down, pressing gentle kisses to her cheek. "Was it too much yesterday?"

"Mm~ No~" Her voice was silky-soft, her eyes fluttering shut. Without acting talent, the only option was to hide from the audience. If Nangong Yun caught a glimpse of that look — drenched in affection and desire — the whole show would be over.
