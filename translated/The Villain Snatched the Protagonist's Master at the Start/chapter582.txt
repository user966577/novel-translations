The raging energy continued to churn, threatening to destroy everything in its path. But an Immortal Emperor's heart's blood wasn't so easily destroyed—it still gleamed brilliantly amid the chaos, drawing every eye.

With the maze collapsing, everyone who'd been trapped was suddenly freed. They froze for a moment, then spotted the Immortal Emperor's legacy. Eyes blazed with hunger. The atmosphere crystallized, and someone snapped first—charging straight for the legacy. That broke the dam. Who didn't want an Immortal Emperor's legacy? And now it was right there.

Liu Xing and Zhao Sheng were closest. At Liu Xing's urging, Zhao Sheng had been about to make a grab for it, but the sight of the frenzied crowd gave him pause. He was a Human Immortal—if he got dragged into that melee, one misstep and he was dead. And Liu Xing was injured. He took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and pulled Liu Xing to a safer distance. Better to let the others fight first. If an opportunity arose, he'd make his move. A lone Human Immortal had no business going head-to-head with that mob.

Just then, the two True Immortals who'd been part of Liu Xing's act appeared before them. "What happened to you?" they asked, feigning shock and concern.

Liu Xing waved them off. "I'm fine. Go help him—help him get the legacy back. It was always his. The Heavenly Waters Great Emperor himself acknowledged it. No one can take it from him."

The two hesitated. Zhao Sheng noticed their reluctance—not everyone was as selfless as Liu Xing. Before they could argue, he spoke up. "It's too chaotic right now. If we jump in, we'll get hurt or worse. Let's observe first. If it's really hopeless, we'll let the legacy go."

Liu Xing considered this, glancing toward the blood pool where cultivators were tearing each other apart. "That works."

On the other side, Black Dragon's group had also quietly withdrawn, staying out of the fight. Their concern wasn't the other cultivators—it was making sure the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor was truly finished. Better to let the others test the waters first. Others with sense hung back as well, watching the situation unfold.

The pool of heart's blood shifted constantly under the onslaught—no one could hold it for long. Its crushing pressure made it impossible to store in spatial artifacts, forcing an endless tug-of-war. Cultivators were taking serious injuries, and some had already fallen.

The two True Immortals beside Liu Xing grew restless. "When do we move?"

"Wait a bit longer," Liu Xing said. Without overwhelming force, grabbing the legacy would only paint a target on your back—you'd get swarmed and lose everything, legacy and life alike.

Then he turned to Zhao Sheng. "Don't go in yourself. I'll have them get it for you. This legacy was always meant to be yours—the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor confirmed it. No one can take that from you."

"Thank you, but my things—I'll take them back myself. Just have them support me."

"But—"

"Don't worry. I've got a plan." Zhao Sheng smiled.

He knew Liu Xing was worried. Most of the combatants were True Immortals, and the few Human Immortals who'd tried had already been killed—completely outclassed. But Zhao Sheng had a card to play. He touched his forehead, his eyes flickering as he gazed at the legacy. "I think it's time."

"Now?"

"Yes."

"Maybe we should wait a little longer? Give me time to recover and I can help."

"No need. Rest up. Those two can back me." Zhao Sheng's tone was firm.

Liu Xing relented and turned to the other two with a serious look. "Help him. Be careful. If it's not working, forget the legacy—just bring him back safe."

"Fine," the two replied with barely concealed indifference, drawing a frown from Liu Xing. Before he could press the point, Zhao Sheng cut in. "Thank you both."

They were clearly unhappy about it, but they'd be useful enough. He looked at Liu Xing one more time. "Take care of yourself."

"I'll be alright—I can still fight if I have to. You watch yourself."

The three of them charged into the fray. Attacks hammered them from every direction the moment they entered—once in, there was no stepping back. Every moment demanded full vigilance. One lapse meant injury. The drain was immense.

Zhao Sheng's expression turned grim as he deflected attacks from all sides. At his level, he couldn't even find an opening to go on offense. "Can you two get me closer to the legacy?" he shouted.

The two True Immortals, perfunctory as they were, nodded and flanked him. They carved a path through the crowd toward the Immortal Emperor's legacy—and they were strong, among the best of the True Immortals present. They delivered Zhao Sheng to the blood pool with surprising ease, even impressing him.

But that proximity drew a storm of attacks. Even the two of them together couldn't hold the position for long. "Whatever you're going to do, do it now!" they shouted.

Zhao Sheng knew they couldn't hold out. He nodded, and in the next instant, dove headlong into the blood pool.

Everyone stared in shock. Others had tried the same thing before—and every single one had been ripped apart the moment they entered. Several more had attempted it afterward, refusing to believe it. None survived. That was why everyone had stopped trying.

The two Huaxia True Immortals frowned. They'd gone through all that effort because they suspected this man might be who the Manor Lord was looking for. If he'd just gotten himself killed, it would be a total waste.
