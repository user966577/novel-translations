Staring at Qin Jiang and his retinue, the city lord's face went rigid. Weren't they from the lower realms? How did a lower realm produce this kind of firepower?

To the Heavenly Domain, both Level One and Level Two Domains were considered "lower." But even most Level One Domains couldn't field a lineup like this.

The city lord cursed silently. That messenger had clearly set him up. "Fierce battle." "Ambushed." Right. One Immortal Emperor and eight Immortal Kings—he couldn't put up a fierce battle if he tried.

He should have killed the man on the spot instead of holding back. Too late for regrets now. Whether he'd get another chance was no longer up to him.

Despite being the lord of Skyreach City, his captors had dared to bind his people and extort him—they were clearly no saints. He might very well die here today.

"You're the city lord of Skyreach City?" Qin Jiang asked.

From the positioning, the city lord could tell Qin Jiang was the one in charge. He forced a humble smile. "That would be me."

"Good." Qin Jiang smiled, then pointed at the bound enforcers. "These are your people, correct?"

"Yes."

"Well then. They unprovoked attacked and injured members of my entourage. Black Dragon, how many casualties?"

"Thirteen thousand, two hundred and eight."

"Right. They injured thirteen thousand, two hundred and eight of my people. I trust Skyreach City will compensate us for the medical expenses?"

The city lord's mouth twitched. His handful of enforcers had injured over thirteen thousand people? They weren't even pretending anymore.

But might made right. "Of course. I'll pay in full."

"Additionally, they damaged several valuable artifacts."

"I'll cover everything."

He didn't hesitate. Skyreach City had money. His life was what mattered. Besides, once he made it back inside the city walls, who'd be paying whom was another question entirely.

"Excellent." Qin Jiang nodded approvingly. "Black Dragon, tally up our losses. The city lord has generously agreed to cover them."

"Yes, sir."

Black Dragon and Little Xu huddled together, murmuring back and forth for a long while. The city lord watched in growing horror as the stacks of paper beside them grew taller—multiple piles, each over three feet high.

His face twitched continuously. At this rate, the entire city's treasury might not suffice.

After most of the day, Black Dragon carried the mountain of paperwork over and set it before the city lord. "Here. Have a look."

The city lord's expression was black. Look? What was the point? He obviously couldn't pay. But he'd never intended to, so it didn't matter.

He took a deep breath. "No need to review it. I'll pay."

"Excellent. Then sign this agreement."

Qin Jiang produced a scroll—a Dao Covenant. Once signed, the terms were inviolable.

The city lord's expression shifted. How did a lower-realm cultivator have one of these? And if he signed it, how would he pay? The damages exceeded the city's entire worth.

"What's wrong? Don't want to sign?" Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed, his voice turning cold.

The city lord forced a laugh. "Is that really necessary? Covenant scrolls are quite rare. Using one on me seems wasteful."

"Don't worry about that. I have plenty. Want to sign a few extras?"

"Uh..."

He shook his head vigorously. He couldn't cover one copy, let alone several. But his suspicion deepened. Lower-realm cultivator? Impossible. True outsiders from below were meek and obedient—nobody dared bind Skyreach City's people, let alone shake them down. And Dao Covenant scrolls were precious even in the Heavenly Domain. A lower-realm traveler wouldn't have them, certainly not multiple.

This had to be someone powerful—a scion of one of the Holy Clans, perhaps even a God Clan. Someone with extraordinary status.

Only that kind of person would have the nerve to target Skyreach City.

His posture softened. "My lord, truthfully, the damages exceed what my city can cover."

"Can't cover it?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. "No problem. The Skyreach Cities are all connected, aren't they? Borrow what you need from the others."

That confirmed it. No true outsider would know about the inter-city network. This had been calculated from the start. The man's target was Skyreach City's accumulated wealth—and his appetite was bigger than expected. He wasn't just after one city.

The city lord steadied himself. "My lord, you must realize that Skyreach City has powerful backers. If you're confident you can withstand that pressure—I'll arrange the loan."

"Powerful backers?" Qin Jiang scoffed. "I know Skyreach City was founded by the Grand Sovereign in conjunction with numerous powerhouses. They're big shots, sure. But do you know who I am?"

"Who might you be?"

Qin Jiang smiled. He rose to his feet, pride written across his face. "I am the Grand Sovereign's son-in-law."

The city lord's brain stopped working. The Grand Sovereign's son-in-law?

The Grand Sovereign—supreme being of the myriad realms. He had a daughter; that was common knowledge. She was a top-tier powerhouse in her own right. But no one had ever heard of her taking an interest in men.

The city lord studied Qin Jiang—the face, the build, the... well, he couldn't assess everything. But maybe, just maybe, she really would be interested.
