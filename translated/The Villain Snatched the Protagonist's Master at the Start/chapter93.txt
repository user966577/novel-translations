"Three-year pact?" Qin Lian'er looked utterly bewildered. What was that supposed to be? She was the person in question, and she had no memory of ever making any kind of pact with Xiao Fan. And Xiao Fan was "no ordinary person"? Ha—if being extraordinarily worthless counted, then sure.

Seeing her blank expression, Chu Yuan was somewhat surprised, but he pressed on: "Three years from now, Xiao Fan's strength will surge. He'll go to the Qin family to fulfill the pact, and in that battle, you'll be utterly defeated. The Qin family's reputation will crumble, and Xiao Fan will rise to glory on the back of your family's humiliation! If you act now and keep tabs on Xiao Fan, you might still have a chance to turn things around. Otherwise..."

His voice dripped with confidence, as if he held the strings of fate itself.

Qin Lian'er's brow furrowed. "Brother, did I hit this guy so hard he went stupid? What's he babbling about?"

"You don't believe me?" Chu Yuan scoffed. "If you keep letting Xiao Fan grow unchecked, you will lose the three-year pact. Guaranteed."

"What three-year pact?" Qin Lian'er rolled her eyes. "Since when does a piece of trash have the right to make pacts with me? Three years? What a waste of my time."

Chu Yuan stared at her, momentarily stunned. "There's no three-year pact?"

Qin Lian'er couldn't be bothered to respond to his nonsense.

Chu Yuan's brow creased deeply. This made no sense. In his previous life, the three-year pact had been known across the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent. It was that very event that had catapulted Xiao Fan to fame. But in this life, the pact simply... didn't exist?

Something this significant couldn't just vanish.

"That's impossible," he murmured. Then it hit him, and he snapped his head up. "Wait—the Ye family! The ancient Ye clan will support Xiao Fan. Even without the three-year pact, Xiao Fan won't let the broken engagement slide. He holds a grudge against your Qin family, and the Ye family will back him. They'll be a real threat in the future."

"The Ye family?" Qin Lian'er looked at him as if he'd grown a second head. "The Ye family princess is my brother's woman. You think the Ye family is going to move against us? What kind of joke is that? Besides, a tiny Ye family without a single Great Emperor—what are they going to threaten us with? Their lives?"

Chu Yuan felt the ground shift beneath him. The Qin family of this life was far more powerful than in his previous one. The Ye family couldn't threaten them at all. And the only "Ye family princess" he could think of was Ye Ling'er.

"Ye Ling'er is Qin Jiang's woman?" His confusion deepened. Ye Ling'er and Xiao Fan were childhood sweethearts. How had she ended up with Qin Jiang?

Nothing made sense. Everything was wrong.

"How can this be... how can any of this be..." he muttered. He was starting to wonder if the memories in his head were just a dream.

Qin Jiang, standing to the side, paid Chu Yuan no mind. Instead, he had his arm around Chu Hanyan's waist, savoring her softness, his hands wandering in small, idle movements that left her cheeks flushed and her attention far from her brother.

After a while, Qin Jiang finally spoke. "Sounds like you've got nothing useful to say."

"I—" Chu Yuan opened his mouth but couldn't form a response.

The frustration was suffocating. He'd been reborn—he was supposed to know the future. But everything he'd encountered so far was different from his previous life. Well, not everything. Just the things related to the Qin family.

The realization drew his gaze to Qin Jiang. There he stood, a smile on his face, his eyes bright and unfathomable, radiating an air of effortless control—as if he held all the cards.

A chill ran down Chu Yuan's spine. For a fleeting moment, he felt as though Qin Jiang could see right through him.

When Chu Yuan said nothing more, Qin Jiang chuckled softly and walked out of the courtyard with Chu Hanyan in his arms.

"Sister..." Chu Yuan's face twisted with anguish.

Chu Hanyan hesitated, but she knew—as long as Qin Jiang didn't change his mind, there was no escaping. She sighed inwardly. After all these years of guarding herself, was this how it would end? She was destined to be taken?

She looked up. Qin Jiang's handsome face, at least, didn't repulse her. Compared to the leering predators she'd dealt with before, this was a significant improvement.

"Young Master Qin, could you give me a few days to say goodbye to my brother?" she asked softly.

Qin Jiang shook his head. "No."

No room for negotiation. He took Chu Hanyan straight out of the courtyard. Qin Lian'er followed behind. Chu Yuan tried to chase after them, but Black Dragon materialized in his path.

"Move!" Chu Yuan roared.

Black Dragon sneered and swatted him with one palm, sending him flying.

"No!" Chu Hanyan cried out, but Qin Jiang's arm around her was immovable as a mountain. Desperate, she could only plead: "Young Master Qin, I'll go with you. Please, just spare my brother."

"Relax. He won't die," Qin Jiang said.

He didn't slow his pace. Chu Hanyan kept looking back until the courtyard disappeared from view, her heart heavy with worry.

Before long, the three of them returned to the traveling palace. Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er were still resting in their room, so Qin Jiang didn't disturb them.

Chu Hanyan let out a small breath of relief, some of her anxiety easing.

Qin Jiang noticed. "Feeling better now?"

Her heart jolted, but before she could respond, he continued: "I know what you're capable of. Puppet Sect techniques—remnants from the sect that was destroyed a thousand years ago. I have to say, I didn't expect that after such a thorough purge, the Puppet Sect still had an heir. Impressive, truly."

Chu Hanyan's body went rigid, her face pale with alarm. "How... how do you know?"

The Puppet Sect had once been on the verge of becoming the most powerful organization on the Heavenly Mystery Continent. But their methods were unusual, and their actions, frankly, despicable. They'd stolen the ancestral remains of major powers and refined them into puppets—a grievous insult to every faction involved. In response, more than half the continent's forces had united to annihilate them. The Puppet Sect was strong, but they couldn't fight the entire world. They'd been wiped out to the last.

In the thousand years since, the occasional Puppet Sect remnant had surfaced, only to be hunted down and killed by righteous cultivators. Chu Hanyan was the last known heir.

Chu Yuan knew nothing of any of this. Even in his previous life, he'd never learned these things. He'd been an unremarkable person, living under Chu Hanyan's protection until the day she died—and even then, he'd never discovered who her enemies truly were.

In this life, reborn, he'd wanted to change everything.
