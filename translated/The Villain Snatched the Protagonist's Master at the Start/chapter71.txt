Qin Jiang had originally planned to delve deeper into Sword Valley immediately after clearing Liu Shuwan's injuries, but she insisted he stay a few more days.

Three days later, Liu Shuwan reluctantly escorted him toward the valley's depths. At around the 28,000-foot mark, her complexion began to pale.

Qin Jiang stopped and looked at her with concern. "That's far enough."

Liu Shuwan didn't push it—going deeper would aggravate the injuries Qin Jiang had just healed. She nodded, then for the first time took the initiative to step forward and embrace him. "Be careful," she whispered.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Get some rest and recover your strength. When I come back, I'll help you break through to Sword Heart."

"Mm. I believe in you."

She answered softly, then rose on her toes and planted a quick kiss on his cheek before turning and walking away.

Qin Jiang watched her figure recede until it vanished from sight, then continued his descent. At this depth, savage sword pressure filled the air—even a Supreme Realm cultivator would struggle to endure for long, and weaker Supremes risked being torn apart. But Qin Jiang strolled through as if on flat ground. The dense waves of sword pressure parted before him, not daring to approach, practically bowing in reverence.

With nothing impeding him, he reached the 30,000-foot bottom in under fifteen minutes.

To his surprise, all sword pressure had vanished here—a serene oasis at the valley's deepest point, utterly devoid of sword energy.

"Finally, someone made it down here."

A voice drifted through the silence. Qin Jiang started and turned toward it. A translucent, ghostly figure shimmered into view nearby—a woman. And her beauty rivaled Liu Shuwan's. But her form was so faint she didn't even qualify as a proper spiritual remnant—just the barest echo of consciousness.

The woman noticed his gaze and where it lingered. Her expression darkened. "Eyes up here, you little creep."

"Uh..." Qin Jiang laughed awkwardly and scratched his nose, though his eyes didn't move. "If you don't mind me asking... were you always this well-endowed, or did your, uh, remnant projection deliberately—"

"I've been dead for tens of thousands of years!" the woman snapped. "There's nothing left but a wisp of consciousness, and you're still hitting on me?!"

Her aura surged, and the entire valley trembled.

Qin Jiang's eyes narrowed as he sensed her power. "You're the Holy Sword Sect's founder?"

Her energy signature was identical to Sword Valley's ambient force—only the creator of Sword Valley would carry that exact resonance.

The woman snorted. "Scared yet?"

Looking at her, Qin Jiang hadn't expected the sect's legendary founder to be such a stunning woman. "What a shame," he sighed.

She frowned, and he continued, "What a shame you died so early. If you were still alive, I'd definitely make you my woman."

The woman: "???"

Seeing how serious he looked, she took a deep breath and ground her teeth. "If it weren't for the fact that you're the only person in tens of thousands of years to reach this place, I'd have your head!"

"Oh?" Qin Jiang cocked his head. "In your current state, you think you could?"

"Want to find out?" She swept her arm, and Sword Valley's power surged toward her. Despite being merely a wisp of consciousness, her sword comprehension was fully intact. As the valley's energy poured in, her presence swelled, pressing down on Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang frowned and raised his hand. A ripple spread outward, blanketing the area for dozens of feet. Instantly, her rising momentum halted. Her face went slack. "You've achieved Sword Heart?"

Qin Jiang had activated his Sword Heart, sealing the surrounding space and cutting off her connection to Sword Valley.

"You designed this valley yourself," he said flatly. "Didn't you know that without Sword Heart, no one could make it this far?"

"What? They can't get in without Sword Heart?" The woman blanched, then burst out, "No wonder nobody's shown up in tens of thousands of years! I thought the Holy Sword Sect had been wiped out! Turns out the difficulty was just too damn high!"

Qin Jiang: "..."

This woman was... something else. But she had a point—her valley was overtuned. Only a Sword Heart master or a Child of Destiny like Lin Chen could make it through.

The woman groaned about her oversight for a while longer before turning her attention back to Qin Jiang. Her mood improved slightly—the kid might be a rogue, but as a mere wisp of consciousness, what did she have to worry about?

"Are you a Holy Sword Sect disciple?" she asked.

Qin Jiang shook his head. "No."

The woman: "..."

"Don't tell me you destroyed my Holy Sword Sect."

"I didn't."

She relaxed. "So you heard about the treasure I left in Sword Valley and came for it?"

"Yep." Qin Jiang nodded. "Hand it over."

The woman stared at him. The nerve of this guy.

"If you won't give it willingly, I'll take it by force," he added helpfully.

She clenched her teeth. "What I left here—you can't even use it!"

"I still want it."

"You..."

She shook her head firmly. "I can't give it to you. I left it for Holy Sword Sect disciples."

"I'll deliver it to them on your behalf."

Her look of disdain said everything. She might not know him well, but she knew he absolutely could not be trusted.

"Really!" Qin Jiang insisted.

"Swear a Heavenly Dao oath, and I'll believe you."

"A Heavenly Dao oath? I'm doing you a favor, and you want me to swear an oath?" Qin Jiang's eyes blazed. "Listen here—hand it over before I lose my patience. Otherwise, I'll tear this valley apart and slaughter every last person in the Holy Sword Sect! Move it!"
