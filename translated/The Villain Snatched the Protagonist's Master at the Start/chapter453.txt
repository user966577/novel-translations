In his arms, Mu Yunxiao was a portrait of shy desire — enough to make Qin Jiang swallow hard.

He'd played around long enough. Time for the main event.

Without another word, he scooped her up and strode toward the bed. She gasped, and before she could process what was happening, he'd dropped her onto the sheets and followed her down.

Her breath caught. Her heartbeat hammered so loud she was sure he could hear it. Face blazing, she simply closed her eyes.

He brushed her hair aside, kissed her forehead, and murmured, "Seems Weiwei really does know you well."

"Hm?" She was confused — one moment he'd been using Weiwei's name coldly, and now it was back to the familiar pet name.

She opened her eyes. His grinning face hovered above hers, close enough to kiss. She almost did.

Her throat bobbed. She turned away from his burning gaze.

He laughed softly. "What — afraid of me?"

"N-No~"

She shook her head, but the flicker of fear in her eyes was poorly hidden beneath an avalanche of shyness.

He tapped her nose. "I was teasing before. I may not be a good man, but I've never hurt a beautiful woman."

She studied him, doubt plain on her face.

"You don't believe me?"

Under his stare, she could only manage a weak, "I believe you~"

Clearly forced. He shook his head — he'd overdone the intimidation act. Given her a bit of a complex, probably.

No matter. He was excellent at treating that particular condition. Sufficient stimulation, and the complex would dissolve entirely.

"Believe me or not, you know what to do next, right?" He flashed that devilish grin.

Her heart raced. Was this it? He liked proactive women — should she take the lead? But this was about her life and Weiwei's safety. If she could satisfy him...

'For Weiwei's sake,' she told herself firmly. 'Definitely for Weiwei. Not because I want this.'

Qin Jiang was nothing if not patient. This wasn't his first time teaching, and he had the routine down cold. Since Mu Yunxiao and Weiwei were master and disciple, he naturally offered them the same curriculum — starting with a thorough introduction to the fundamentals.

She was cooperative, if tentative. Unable to lead, she followed his direction, expressing her willingness through compliance. Once she'd grasped the basics, she began to take initiative on her own.

Hours passed. Mu Yunxiao lay flushed and spent against his chest. She was exhausted.

Then Qin Jiang sat up, bringing her with him. "It's not time to rest yet."

"What?" She looked at him, pleading. "I'm tired~"

"Tough."

"...Okay~"

She bit her lip and glared at him reproachfully. 'Knew it — this man is merciless!' Hours without a break. She steeled herself, leaned into him, and whispered, "Alright... go ahead~"

He blinked, then pinched her cheek with a laugh. "What are you imagining? I meant it's time to fix your body."

"You're going to fix my body now?"

Her eyes lit up. Her sacrifice had paid off!

"Settle down." He grinned and pointed downward. "Otherwise the treasure that'll fix you is going to leak out."

She looked where he pointed, and her eyes went wide. She stared at him. "That's the treasure?"

"Yep."

She went quiet, lowering her gaze to examine the so-called treasure. After a moment's thought, she settled back against him. "Let's keep going."

"Hm?"

She had already wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him into a kiss.

He wasn't about to refuse what was being freely offered.

As for the body problem — there was no rush.

Propelled by Mu Yunxiao's newfound enthusiasm, another two hours slipped by before she collapsed against him. "Now can we?"

"Can we what?"

"Fix my body."

"Didn't I already give you the treasure?"

She froze. She looked down again, then back at him. "You're not joking?"

"Why would I joke about this?"

He spread his hands and frowned. "I thought you were being so proactive because you were grateful. Turns out you were just bribing me."

She flushed, glancing again at his so-called treasure. Skepticism lingered. "This really works?"

"Absolutely. Once you refine it, you'll see I wasn't lying."

"How do I... refine it?"

"Treat it like medicine. Oral or topical — either works. Any part of the body can absorb it. Your choice."

"Oh~ Let me try~"
