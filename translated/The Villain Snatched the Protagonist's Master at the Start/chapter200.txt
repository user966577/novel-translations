Yu Lan and Yu Ru joined Qin Jiang. At the sight of him, a complex flicker passed through Yu Lan's eyes. She didn't quite know what to say.

Yu Ru caught her sister's hesitation. Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she darted forward and latched onto Qin Jiang's arm. "Qin Jiang, Sister's injuries still haven't fully healed. With the Black Water Serpent faction coming, you wouldn't let her get hurt again, would you?"

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. He was just now discovering Yu Ru's talent for playing the coy matchmaker.

Yu Lan overheard and blushed faintly, shooting her sister a covert glare. Then, trying not to be obvious, she stole a glance at Qin Jiang's reaction.

He was already looking at her. Their eyes met, and Yu Lan quickly turned away, the pink in her cheeks deepening to reveal the shyness beneath.

Qin Jiang smiled, then addressed Yu Ru. "Relax. As long as I'm here, your sister won't be hurt. And neither will you."

Yu Ru beamed and nodded, tossing Yu Lan a cheeky wink.

Some of the tension left Yu Lan's features. The softness in her gaze as she watched Qin Jiang was unmistakable.

Mo Mo and Xue Mei flanked Qin Jiang, silent but ready. They knew they'd be the ones doing the actual fighting, but they weren't about to undermine his authority in front of the sisters. If they were jealous, they'd settle the score later—and the compensation would be substantial.

"Should we interfere with whoever's breaking the formation?" Yu Lan moved to Qin Jiang's side, her voice gentle.

Qin Jiang took her hand naturally, and she let him, even curling her fingers around his.

"Let them break through. Trust me—I'll keep everyone safe."

"I trust you."

"Have your people prepare for battle," Qin Jiang added.

Yu Lan had barely nodded when Yu Ru cut in. "I'll go give the order!"

She winked at Yu Lan again—now was the perfect moment for her sister and Qin Jiang to bond. Facing a threat together, side by side—textbook romance.

Before long, the Purple-Scale Serpent faction was mobilized for combat. Their strength was formidable—numerous Great Emperors among them. In a real fight, they constituted a fearsome force. After all, this was one of the Snake Race's two royal bloodlines: the Purple-Scale Serpent.

The rival faction—the Black Water Serpent—was comparable in depth, but with Yu Lan critically weakened, their momentum had surged. If they captured the Purple-Scale faction, their leader's ascension to clan chief was all but guaranteed.

As the spatial tremors grew more violent, they could now make out a figure methodically dismantling the formation.

"Just one person?" Yu Lan frowned. "Did the Black Water Serpent faction hire a formation master?"

Qin Jiang studied the silhouette and let a knowing grin spread across his face. Just as he'd expected—it was Chen Changsheng.

Right on schedule. But too late.

And demolishing the formation the moment he arrived? That was actively endangering Yu Lan's people. Some hero. If not for his protagonist's luck, he'd have been slapped to death already.

"It's a formation master. And an acquaintance, as it happens."

"You know him?"

"More or less. We've crossed paths. I beat him up once."

Yu Lan: "..."

So they were enemies.

Her expression turned peculiar. The formation was nearly broken, the figure growing clearer. His aura was nothing special—merely Supreme-level.

She tilted her head, thinking, then looked at Qin Jiang. "Want me to kill him for you?"

"Hm?"

"If you fought him before, he must have provoked you. I'll take him out."

Looking at her earnest offer, Qin Jiang squeezed her hand and chuckled. "No need. He's still useful alive."

A walking gold mine like Chen Changsheng could yield incredible rewards. Some of his treasures were Immortal-grade. Killing him now would be a colossal waste. Besides, there were potential fortune heroines orbiting around Chen Changsheng. And most importantly, Qin Jiang had his eye on the Reincarnation Law. Once Chen Changsheng fully developed it, Qin Jiang would claim it for himself.

Reincarnation Law plus Space-Time Law. With those two as a foundation and enough power behind them, Qin Jiang could forge an entire world. He'd be a minor Heavenly Dao unto himself—and as his world grew, so would his strength, until one day, he'd preside over an entire universe.

A cosmos of his own creation: mountains and rivers, flora and fauna, humans and beasts—all under his dominion.

The Reincarnation Law was non-negotiable.

At that moment, the formation shuddered violently and collapsed. The concealment shattered, the surroundings transforming in seconds.

Chen Changsheng's face split into a triumphant grin. "Finally!"

Figures materialized before him—the Purple-Scale Serpent faction, exposed. Hostile eyes bored into him.

He scanned the crowd, passing over face after face, until he reached Yu Ru... then Yu Lan.

His gaze locked on. But the smile forming on his lips froze before it could fully bloom.

His eyes had found two hands—one large, one small—clasped together.

Yu Lan, the goddess of his fantasies, was holding another man's hand.

His eyes traced up the arm to the face, and the frozen expression curdled into shock and seething fury.

Him.

The one who'd beaten him bloody, stolen his disciple, and gotten him exiled from Pill City.

And now the bastard was holding his goddess's hand.

The elation of his breakthrough plummeted to nothing. His heart went ice-cold.

Worse, he'd witnessed Qin Jiang's killing power firsthand back in Pill City. From that moment, a seed of fear had been planted—and it hadn't faded.

Yu Lan's gaze turned frigid as she regarded Chen Changsheng. Wounded as she was, the pressure of an Ancient Emperor still crashed over him like a wave, making him shudder.

Sensing extreme danger, he forced a smile and stepped forward. "Yu Lan, it's me. I'm—"

Before he could finish, Yu Lan struck from a distance—a casual palm that launched him clear across the sky.

She had absolutely no idea who he was.
