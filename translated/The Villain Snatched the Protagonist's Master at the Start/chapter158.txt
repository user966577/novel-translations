The Pill Emperor kept her head bowed, pressed close against Qin Jiang. She said nothing, but her silence spoke volumes.

Qin Jiang's lips curved upward. "Your room?"

"Mm~"

Her heart had finally, fully given way. Or perhaps the restlessness had been building since that sleepless night, simmering just beneath the surface. Hearing her quiet assent, Qin Jiang swept her into his arms and carried her toward her chambers.

Inside, the door slammed shut.

A muffled sound. The Pill Emperor squeezed her eyes closed.

---

A long time passed before she could breathe again. Qin Jiang leaned close to her ear and said softly: "Actually, I'm not your master."

The haze in the Pill Emperor's eyes shattered. She whipped her head to stare at him, shock written across every feature. "You're... you're not...?"

"No. I'm not."

Qin Jiang propped himself up slightly, a grin on his face. Watching the astonishment on her delicate features, a mischievous glint danced in his eyes.

---

The Pill Emperor collected herself. Looking at Qin Jiang's face, her fists clenched. She exhaled slowly, letting out a long, trembling breath before she could manage words.

"So you've been deceiving me this entire time?"

"That's right."

"Then how do you know the things between me and my master?"

Qin Jiang's appearance and personality bore zero resemblance to Chen Changsheng. The only reason the Pill Emperor had believed him was that he knew secrets shared exclusively between her and Chen Changsheng.

"Divination," Qin Jiang said. "If I want to know something, there's nothing in this world I can't find out. For instance—your real master has indeed been reborn. And he's right here in Pill City."

"You truly aren't my master?"

"Do I look like him?"

"Not in the slightest."

A wave of relief washed through the Pill Emperor. The supposed relationship between them had been the last barrier in her heart. If not for Qin Jiang's overwhelming forcefulness, she didn't know how long it would have taken her to overcome that mental hurdle. Now, hearing his confession, she actually felt lighter.

After all, what was done was done.

And Qin Jiang was impressive in his own right—the kind of man she could genuinely admire.

She relaxed at last.

---

About an hour later, the Pill Emperor finally recovered enough to think straight.

She hadn't expected that even at the Ancient Emperor level, she'd struggle to keep up after just one hour. The energy expenditure was terrifying.

Several deep breaths later, she raised her eyes to Qin Jiang. Her feelings were complicated.

They'd known each other for only two days. In just two days, she'd gone and...

Looking back, the whole thing felt absurd.

Of course, the initial catalyst had been her belief that he was her old master, which created an instinctive closeness. As for how quickly things had escalated to this point—that was entirely due to Qin Jiang's relentless assertiveness.

Sensing her gaze, Qin Jiang tilted his head down, and the Pill Emperor's cheeks flushed again.

She averted her eyes and broke the silence: "Who are you, really? And why did you impersonate my master to trick me?"

"Just an ordinary family's young lord—nobody special. Small operation, modest resources. As for why I tricked you..." Qin Jiang dipped his head and pressed his lips to her cheek, his voice low: "Pure lust. I happened to see a portrait of you in Pill City, and I decided right then and there—you had to be mine."

The Pill Emperor: "..."

'An ordinary young lord? Please.'

An "ordinary" young lord with immortal-path bodyguards? That was about as ordinary as a phoenix in a chicken coop.

The lust part, though—that was entirely believable. Every instinct told her this man was a world-class lecher.

Case in point: right now.

---

A thought surfaced. During the act, she recalled Qin Jiang mentioning that her real master had been reborn and was in Pill City. She looked at him again.

"My master... he really came back?"

"Mm." Qin Jiang nodded. "He really did. And I divined some details about him. Tch—that man is the real animal."

"What do you mean?"

"He has... certain feelings toward both you and little Dan Yu."

Qin Jiang's expression was peculiar.

The Pill Emperor's brows drew together. After everything Qin Jiang had put her through, her tolerance had expanded considerably.

But still—"My master would be as depraved as you?"

She was skeptical.

Qin Jiang: "???"

"I'm depraved?"

"You aren't?" The Pill Emperor scoffed. "Dan Yu and I are master and disciple, and you didn't spare either of us. Actually, I suspect you deliberately impersonated my master specifically to chase that kind of twisted thrill—"

Qin Jiang: "..."

'Did I? I don't think so?'

"I may be a bit depraved on the surface," he protested, "but some people look like perfect gentlemen while harboring thoughts you wouldn't believe."
