【Ding! Detected a new Child of Destiny who has established a connection with the Host. One spoiler is available. The Host may view the Child of Destiny's trajectory for the next year. Would you like to view it?】

Qin Jiang hadn't even left the Demon Domain yet when the system's voice suddenly echoed in his mind.

His face lit up. "Another dreamer!"

Chen Changsheng had slipped away, and based on the storyline, he'd probably gone running back to his old friends. Qin Jiang had been planning to squeeze him dry sooner rather than later—he still needed to complete the Time-Space Disc. But now it seemed Chen Changsheng could wait. Better to let him develop in peace, flesh out the Reincarnation Law, and become an even juicier target down the line.

This new Child of Destiny should be able to help him collect the final Time-Space Disc fragment. Chen Changsheng had already been an incredibly productive leek—still thick and green even after all the harvesting. Qin Jiang estimated only one fragment remained before the disc was whole.

But where had this connection come from?

"Don't tell me it's Lian'er again," he muttered.

He activated the spoiler.

An image of a beggar appeared in his mind—a blind one, at that. He watched the year-long storyline unfold, then opened his eyes.

"It really is Lian'er."

Qin Jiang stroked his chin. In the spoiler, he'd seen the conflict between the Qin family and the blind beggar—all set in Qin Family City, all sparked by Lian'er. A minor squabble that escalated step by step until it became a fight to the death.

And the blind beggar was no ordinary man.

"An Immortal... red dust heart tempering..."

The beggar was an Immortal who had sealed his own cultivation and entered the mortal world to temper his dao heart—all in pursuit of the next breakthrough.

Beyond that, another person had caught his attention: the fortune heroine.

"Zi Fu—the previous Snake Race chieftain?"

Qin Jiang's expression turned peculiar. The former Snake Race chieftain was supposed to be in seclusion, pushing for the immortal path. How had she ended up in Qin Family City?

"Interesting." A smile spread across his face. Yu Lan had mentioned the former chieftain before, and he'd felt a twinge of regret at the missed opportunity. Now it seemed fate had other plans. This Zi Fu was destined to cross his path.

---

In Qin Family City, Lian'er and Zi Fu had hit it off remarkably well. Zi Fu was powerful, but her temperament was surprisingly innocent.

"Zi Fu, you don't seem to know much about everyday life," Lian'er observed.

Zi Fu pursed her lips, a candied hawthorn stick in her hand, one of the little fruits still stuffed in her cheek. "From the moment I could think for myself, all I did was cultivate, cultivate, cultivate," she said, her words slightly muffled. "Then the old men in the tribe made me manage clan affairs. This time, I actually snuck out."

As she spoke, her lovely eyes wandered everywhere, curiosity sparking at every new sight.

Lian'er hooked her arm through Zi Fu's and giggled. "Those old codgers are so stuffy—no fun at all."

"Exactly!" Zi Fu nodded in agreement. Then a smile broke across her face. "But they can't control me anymore. I can do whatever I want now."

The two girls chattered and laughed as they strolled, their steps light and carefree. Lian'er's usual grand entourage was nowhere in sight—only the Fourth Ancestor and a few others shadowing them from concealment.

"Ooh, what's that place?" Zi Fu pointed toward a building from which raucous noise poured out. People inside sounded wildly excited.

"That's a casino," Lian'er said. "Want to check it out?"

"Is it fun?"

"I've never actually played, but my brother's amazing at it—he's known as the King of Gamblers!"

Zi Fu gave her a look. In the time they'd spent together, Lian'er had mentioned Qin Jiang more times than she could count, painting him as an utterly flawless human being.

"Your brother really is something," Zi Fu said.

"Of course!" Lian'er puffed up with pride. "My brother knows everything and he's incredible at all of it. Plus, he's super handsome. He's not here right now, but once he gets back, I'll introduce you!"

"Sure!" Zi Fu nodded. She was genuinely curious about this omnipotent brother Lian'er wouldn't stop gushing about.

"So... want to try the casino?" Zi Fu blinked expectantly.

Lian'er's eyes gleamed. She'd only ever heard her brother's tales of dominating the gambling tables—she'd never gotten to play herself.

"Try it?"

"Let's do it!"

The two strode into the casino. The noise hit them like a wall—shouting, cheering, wailing—along with a few unpleasant smells. They waved their hands in front of their noses and peered around with wide-eyed curiosity. Some patrons laughed triumphantly, others sobbed in despair, and still others bellowed in rage.

The girls exchanged a glance. This looked kind of exciting.

"Welcome, ladies! What would you like to play? You can start by exchanging some chips." A casino attendant hurried over to greet them.

Lian'er blinked, cleared her throat, and tried to look like a seasoned regular. She leaned close to Zi Fu's ear and whispered, "We can't let them know we don't know what we're doing, or they'll rip us off."

Zi Fu nodded solemnly, then addressed the attendant with perfect composure: "Get us some chips first."

"Right this way, ladies."

Under the attendant's guidance, the two girls exchanged a staggering quantity of chips with the casual extravagance of people who'd never worried about money in their lives. The attendant could barely contain his grin—this was commission-worthy business.

Chips in hand, the girls surveyed the floor and immediately hit a wall. They had no idea how to play anything.

"Would you like me to guide you?" the attendant offered helpfully.

The two hesitated, but Lian'er put on a stern face and waved him off. "No need—we know what we're doing!"

Zi Fu glanced at her. She had a feeling their act wasn't fooling anyone.

Across the casino, a number of eyes had already locked onto them—or more precisely, onto the mountain of chips in their hands. Those gazes were predatory, like wolves spotting prey.

"I think we've attracted some attention," Zi Fu said via transmission.

Just then, Lian'er tugged at Zi Fu's sleeve and pointed toward one of the tables. "Look over there..."

"Hm?"

At that table sat the blind beggar.

The two girls exchanged a look, then marched straight over. As it happened, a group of dejected gamblers were just filing away from the beggar's table, having apparently lost everything.

"How does this work?" Zi Fu asked.

One of the losers looked up, and the sight of two beauties lifted his mood marginally. He jerked a thumb toward the blind beggar. "You gamble against him. But fair warning—he's really good..."

"Hmph, he's just a smelly beggar," Lian'er scoffed.

She pulled Zi Fu along, mimicking what the other gamblers had done—propping one foot on a stool, slamming her chips down with flair. Zi Fu's eyes lit up, and she copied the pose, smacking down her own chips with a satisfying thwack.

"We sisters want to see just how good he is. Let's gamble!"

The blind beggar tilted his head slightly, the black cloth over his eyes seeming to regard the pair. He nodded.

"Gamble."
