When they left the courtyard, Qin Jiang had a new passenger in his arms.

Chen Ningbing eyed the little girl skeptically. "You're really taking her back with us?"

"Why not? Your dad practically gift-wrapped her. Besides, it's good practice for when we have our own." He bounced Chen Ningshuang on his arm as he walked.

Chen Ningbing could only nod. Her father was a shrewd man — he knew his youngest daughter would receive far better care at Qin Jiang's side. Her mother had wanted to come along to help, but Chen Lie had vetoed that idea. Chen Ningbing had to promise she'd look after her little sister before the woman finally relented.

Once her mother was out of earshot, Chen Ningbing breathed a sigh of relief. She'd genuinely been worried. Her mother was still quite beautiful, with that mature allure and maternal warmth that younger women simply couldn't replicate. Qin Jiang might not have any ideas now, but given enough proximity, who knew what the man's appetite might produce? He was practically an incubus — few women could resist being around him for long.

If her mother ever wavered, Qin Jiang would never say no. Chen Ningbing was certain of that. Her sister as a future addition was one thing, but her mother? That would be unconscionable — mainly because it would be so unfair to her poor father.

They stayed at the Chen estate for three days in total.

When they returned home, the other women spotted the toddler in Qin Jiang's arms and nearly lost their composure. They stared at him and Chen Ningbing in disbelief — three days apart, and they'd already produced a child?

"You guys—"

"Ahem. This is Bing'er's little sister, Chen Ningshuang," Qin Jiang said hastily.

The clarification came just in time. Judging by the looks in their eyes, they'd been about half a second from tackling him. For these women, the moment one sister had a baby, every single one of them would need one too. Not that they were ready for children — none of them had finished having fun yet.

"Bing'er's sister?" The tension drained from their faces. They crowded around Chen Ningshuang, cooing with curiosity. The little girl stared back at the parade of beautiful women with wide eyes.

So many pretty sisters! And they all looked at the handsome big brother the same way her own big sister did.

"Handsome big brother, are you all these sisters' husband too?" she asked.

Her question drew a round of laughter. Such a young thing, and already aware of "handsome."

"That's right, sweetie — he's all of ours," the women answered before Qin Jiang could get a word in.

Chen Ningshuang blinked, her eyes brightening. So husbands weren't exclusive! That meant big sister's husband could be her husband too!

The women plucked her from Qin Jiang's arms and took turns holding her — early practice for motherhood. The girl was an instant hit, porcelain-pretty and not the least bit fussy, though some of her questions made the women stifle laughter. The little imp was already scheming about the handsome man at her age. Promising, they agreed. At this rate, she'd be one of them someday.

Although looking at the three-year-old among women ranging from their twenties to hundreds of thousands of years old, it did feel a bit unusual. Every one of them looked youthful and radiant regardless of age, but this one was a genuine toddler who couldn't do anything yet. She'd need raising. At least she was already weaned — otherwise it would have been genuinely difficult.

Seeing that the women had taken to Chen Ningshuang, Qin Jiang left her in their care and pulled Ye Ling'er aside. "Ling'er, let me take you home to the Ye family."

Ye Ling'er's parents had once lived at the Qin estate during the Ye family's internal power struggles, but with Qin Domain's rapid expansion and the Ye family's own growth, they'd moved back home. Otherwise, he wouldn't have needed to make the trip. Honestly, he'd rather not go — the Ye estate harbored great terror.

Ye Ling'er's eyes lit up. "Yes! When are we going?"

"Right now."

After a quick word to the others, they set off. Ye Ling'er technically had a second family — the Xiao family, her birth family. But word had reached them that the Xiaos, fearing retribution from the Qins, had fled long ago. They'd likely met with an accident during the relocation, because no trace of them remained in Qin Domain. Ye Ling'er had been sad about it, and Qin Jiang had spent some time consoling her.

As for Xiao Fan, she hadn't looked into him. She didn't want to give Qin Jiang the wrong impression over someone irrelevant. Besides, the last time she'd seen Xiao Fan, he'd been in terrible shape. He was almost certainly dead by now, and if not, probably wished he were.

En route, they passed the old Xiao estate. The family was long gone, replaced by another clan. Everything had changed. Ye Ling'er gazed down from the void for a moment, sighed, and took Qin Jiang's hand. "Let's go to the Ye family."

The Xiaos had once saved her life, true. But Qin Jiang had spared Xiao Fan multiple times. All debts were settled. There was no point mourning a family that no longer existed.

Qin Jiang squeezed her hand and kissed her forehead. "Come on. I'll take you home."

"Mm~" Ye Ling'er smiled. The Qin family was her true home now. The Ye estate was just where she'd grown up.

They traveled at a leisurely pace but still arrived within a day. The Ye family had grown considerably since their last visit. Standing outside the gates, Qin Jiang hesitated. Ye Ling'er noticed and covered her mouth to hide a laugh — she knew exactly why. Someone at the Ye estate had been pining for him, even sending letters to the Qin family during his years away. Quite devoted.

For Qin Jiang, the Ye estate was a den of pure horror.

He took a deep breath, gripped Ye Ling'er's hand tight, and steeled himself. He was about to step forward when a voice rang out from nearby, bright with surprise.

"Young Master Qin!"

Before the words finished echoing, a rush of fragrant air swept past him, and a figure materialized in his path.
