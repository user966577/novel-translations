The Heavenly Pill Palace.

Deep within its grounds lay a serene, private courtyard that no one was permitted to approach. This was the Pill Emperor's personal residence. Aside from the Pill Emperor herself, only Dan Yu was allowed to visit on occasion.

The Pill Emperor brought Dan Yu back to the courtyard. Seeing the girl's pallid face, she suppressed the chaos in her own heart and produced a medicinal pill. "Take this. Recover first."

Dan Yu accepted the pill and nodded. She didn't know what to say either—the current relationship between them felt painfully awkward.

After taking the medicine, some color returned to Dan Yu's face and the pain eased.

She looked at the Pill Emperor, hesitated, then ventured: "Master, about me and Grandmaster..."

"He is not your grandmaster," the Pill Emperor cut her off immediately.

After a pause, she studied Dan Yu and asked: "Tell me—how did the two of you... How did you meet?"

Dan Yu thought back and recounted everything from the beginning. When the Pill Emperor heard that Qin Jiang had demanded Dan Yu become his woman from the very first moment, her brow furrowed deeply.

'How did my master become like this?'

Dan Yu continued—the confrontation, Qin Jiang taking her into the private chamber...

At this point, Dan Yu's cheeks flushed. She stole a glance at the Pill Emperor and said meekly: "Once we were inside, he demonstrated his alchemy and refined a pill for me to take..."

"What kind of pill?"

"He said it was a specialized body-tempering elixir that would enhance my control over fire."

"Oh?" The Pill Emperor's interest was piqued. "Did it work?"

Dan Yu nodded. "It did. But..." She blushed again and snuck another look at her master before continuing. "I thought he'd drugged me. So I..."

The Pill Emperor could fill in the rest. "Enough. You don't need to continue."

Dan Yu exhaled in relief. Describing that kind of thing to her own master was beyond mortifying.

The Pill Emperor fell silent. Qin Jiang's personality bore absolutely no resemblance to the master she remembered. Yet the things he knew, combined with his extraordinary alchemy, all pointed to him being Chen Changsheng.

"Could reincarnation really change someone's personality that much?" she murmured.

She knew Chen Changsheng had been through multiple cycles, but she'd only met him in his previous life. She had no idea what his other incarnations had been like or whether reincarnation could truly alter someone so fundamentally.

Based on what she'd seen, the answer appeared to be yes—and the change was dramatic.

A headache was forming. This version of her master seemed to be... well, a raging pervert.

Dan Yu had been his victim, and he had a bevy of beautiful women at his side. Those were just the ones she'd seen—who knew how many more there were? In his previous life, her master had been a lifelong bachelor. Was this life supposed to make up for all those missed years?

And there was one more troubling detail. The way he'd looked at her during their meeting... something in his eyes hadn't been right. He'd grabbed her hand the instant they met, and she'd felt him give it a subtle squeeze before she pulled away.

A chill crept up her spine.

'I'm his disciple. He couldn't possibly...'

Then again, he'd already gone after his own grand-disciple, so having designs on his direct disciple wasn't exactly a stretch.

The Pill Emperor's expression grew complicated. She had no idea how to face her master anymore.

"Master..." Dan Yu spoke up softly.

The Pill Emperor snapped out of her thoughts and looked at Dan Yu. She sighed. Dan Yu had it worse—at least she herself hadn't fallen victim yet.

"What is it, Dan Yu?"

"Master," Dan Yu said carefully, "he also told me he intends to... win you over."

"Hmm?"

"The same way he did with me..."

Dan Yu watched the Pill Emperor's face intently. When she detected no change in expression, a flicker of hope stirred within her. Perhaps the rift between them could actually be mended.

The Pill Emperor's composure wasn't surprise—she'd already guessed as much, so hearing Dan Yu confirm it didn't shock her.

"Did he say anything else?"

Dan Yu shook her head. The Pill Emperor nodded and waved her hand. "Go rest."

"Okay."

Dan Yu turned to leave but lingered, conflicted. The Pill Emperor noticed. "What's wrong? Is there something else?"

Dan Yu bit her lip and asked: "Master... what do you think of him?"

The Pill Emperor blinked, then her face hardened. "Dan Yu, what are you implying?"

"He's actually quite impressive. Handsome, powerful—Master, you could..."

"Stop!"

The Pill Emperor's sharp rebuke silenced her. Her expression was cold, her chest rising and falling with barely contained emotion.

Dan Yu lowered her head, not daring to push further.

After a long moment, the Pill Emperor steadied herself enough to speak: "Dan Yu, remember—he is my master."

"He's technically my grandmaster too, and he still..." Dan Yu trailed off.

The Pill Emperor: "..."

'Fair point.' This incarnation of her master really was a beast.

"Besides," Dan Yu pressed on, "he was your master in his previous life. He's been reborn—so technically, he isn't your master anymore. And you said yourself that this version of him is completely different from the old one. You could treat him as a different person entirely. Given his qualities, he's certainly worthy of you."

Dan Yu was on a roll now. Her arguments were surprisingly coherent, and the Pill Emperor found herself... wavering.

Because Dan Yu wasn't wrong.

He'd been her master in a previous life. What did that have to do with this one? And these two versions of him were practically two entirely different people—different in appearance, personality, everything.

She could treat him as someone new entirely.

The previous incarnation was her master. This one... could be a dao companion.

Under Dan Yu's persistent advocacy, the Pill Emperor's resolve had genuinely begun to crack. But at the critical moment, the face of her old master surfaced in her memory. She shook her head hard.

'No! How could I think that way? No matter how much he's changed, he's still my master. I can't...'

And yet, he really was nothing like the same person.

'Maybe... give it a try?'
