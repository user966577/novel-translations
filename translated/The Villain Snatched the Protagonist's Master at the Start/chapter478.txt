Qin Jiang explained the True Spirit Slave Seal in detail. When he finished, Murong Qing frowned.

Merely controlling the Blood Tribe chief? That hardly qualified as punishment. She understood that from his position as chief, the decision hadn't been wrong. But from hers, he'd abandoned her daughter. He deserved to die.

Still, it was Xue Yue's father. She turned to her daughter. "What do you think, Yueyue?"

"Huh? About what?"

"Is the True Spirit Slave Seal too lenient?"

"It's enough," Xue Yue said quickly. "The seal is incredibly powerful. For Father, it's a serious punishment already."

Truthfully, being expelled hadn't affected Xue Yue much at all. She bore no real grudge. What angered her was that her mother had been imprisoned. Seeing Murong Qing's tears, sensing the anguish she must have endured during that year of confinement—that was what demanded justice. Their position wasn't the tribe's. It was a mother's and a daughter's.

Murong Qing relented. "If that's what you want, then the True Spirit Slave Seal it is."

"Done." Qin Jiang smiled.

Xue Yue linked arms with her mother, beaming. "Let's go get your justice, Mother."

"Heh, alright."

The three found the Blood Tribe chief and his entourage. The sight of Murong Qing set the elders on edge. She'd been hostile toward the tribe ever since her release, and now she was here with Qin Jiang and Xue Yue. This reeked of a reckoning.

The chief steeled himself and stepped forward, but before he could speak, Murong Qing's eyes found Qin Jiang's. He understood immediately.

"Chief," Qin Jiang said, the seal dancing on his fingertip, "what happened with Yueyue and her mother—don't you think you owe them an explanation?"

The chief's expression hardened. As expected. He looked at Murong Qing, then at Xue Yue, and sighed. "I wronged them both."

As chief, his duty was to the tribe. He didn't regret expelling Xue Yue—given the same circumstances, he'd do it again. But there was no denying he'd failed as a husband and father.

"Whatever answer you want, I'll accept it."

"Good."

The True Spirit Slave Seal shot from Qin Jiang's finger and sank into the chief's mind, fusing with his Primordial Spirit. The process was agonizing. Color drained from his face as sweat poured down and his body convulsed. He dropped to one knee, clutching his head, howling in pain.

Qin Jiang watched with his usual smile, deliberately intensifying the seal's effect. Murong Qing observed with grim satisfaction.

Two hours passed before the seal fully integrated. The chief nearly collapsed. He staggered upright, eyes glassy, and looked at Qin Jiang. He could feel it—his life was no longer his own. Every thought, every action, visible to his new master. He retained his consciousness, but for all practical purposes, he was a puppet.

In silence, he rose. A True Immortal—now someone's slave. It would take time to accept. Not that he had a choice. Even the desire to die now required Qin Jiang's permission.

Murong Qing studied the chief. "That's it?"

"Mm." Qin Jiang nodded.

She frowned. "The pain ended too quickly. He got off easy."

He coughed. "Actually, I can make him feel pain at any time."

"You can?"

"Watch." He activated the seal.

Across the courtyard, the chief staggered and crumpled to his knees again, clutching his skull and screaming. Every elder's face went white.

Murong Qing's eyes lit up. This was perfect. She'd spent nearly a year locked away, drowning in anxiety, and the chief had suffered for all of two hours? But the ability to inflict pain on demand changed everything. Whenever she felt wronged, she could have Qin Jiang give him a dose.

He didn't overdo it—a brief demonstration before releasing the seal. "There. Available anytime."

"Not bad at all." She smiled.

Her gaze left the chief and swept across the remaining Blood Tribe elders, settling on a Human Immortal. This was the one who had first proposed expelling Xue Yue. He'd done it for the tribe's sake.

But from her perspective, he'd harmed her daughter. He deserved to die.
