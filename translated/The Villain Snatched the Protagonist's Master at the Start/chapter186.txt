"Damn the Celestial Rabbit Tribe!"

Inside a hidden cave, Tang Yin suppressed his aura, his voice seething with fury.

For days he'd been on the run. No matter where he hid, the Celestial Rabbit Tribe always found his trail, never giving him a moment's rest. He shifted slightly and winced, sucking in a sharp breath through his teeth. He glanced down and his mouth twitched uncontrollably.

During the chase, he'd been on the receiving end of far too many Rabbit Kicks—nearly all aimed at the same vulnerable area. Everything was technically still attached, but after a few experimental attempts... it was probably out of commission.

'Damn it all! Celestial Rabbit Tribe, just you wait. I'll make every last one of you pay!'

The killing intent in his voice was frigid. But the moment the words left his mouth, a voice drifted in from outside.

"Tang Yin. Come on out."

His body went rigid, eyes flashing with vicious rage. How had they found him again so quickly? He drew a steadying breath, burst out of the cave, and was poised to flee—until he saw who was waiting.

Not the Celestial Rabbit Tribe.

Qin Jiang studied Tang Yin with a raised brow. A Child of Destiny, reduced to this state. Truly an embarrassment to the title.

"Who are you people?" Tang Yin asked warily.

Qin Jiang smiled. "Here to rescue you. Your situation doesn't look too great."

"Rescue me?"

Qin Jiang nodded. "Seeing how miserable you are, I felt a little guilty. So out of the goodness of my heart, I'm here to deliver you to the Western Paradise. No more suffering."

"Huh?"

Tang Yin stared blankly, then the meaning clicked. These people weren't friendly.

His expression hardened. "You're with the Celestial Rabbit Tribe?"

"More accurately, the Celestial Rabbit Tribe is with me. Well—with me, as in they're my rabbits."

Qin Jiang grinned.

Tang Yin's face shifted. Then realization struck, and he glared at Qin Jiang with burning hatred. "The Celestial Rabbit Tribe turning on me—that was all your doing?"

"My doing?" Qin Jiang scoffed. "You're the one who screwed up and ruined my Jiu'er's bloodline. Shouldn't I come after you?"

Jiu'er? Xiao Jiu?

Tang Yin naturally knew the little princess's name. Hearing the intimate nickname from Qin Jiang's lips, his gaze turned arctic. Xiao Jiu was supposed to be his woman. He'd been entirely confident he could win her over, but now... someone had beaten him to it.

"Enough talk," Qin Jiang said with a lazy wave. "I've had my fun playing with you, and your usefulness has run out. Time to go join your father."

He flashed a wide grin. This time, he'd handle it personally.

Supreme Realm aura erupted!

That's right—Qin Jiang had long since broken through to the Supreme Realm. Combined with the terrifying power of his dual Divine Bodies, he could crush any Supreme. Even a Great Emperor wasn't entirely out of reach.

Seeing Qin Jiang attack, a flicker of killing intent surfaced in Tang Yin's eyes, mixed with mockery.

Supreme? So was he. And at the same level, he was invincible!

He'd been wary of the woman accompanying Qin Jiang—her aura was oppressive—but if this fool was charging in personally, all Tang Yin had to do was take him hostage and he'd have his escape.

He watched Qin Jiang approach with naked contempt and raised his arm with an air of casual dismissal.

'Same-realm invincible. I'll crush you.'

But—

The instant they clashed, Tang Yin's placid expression shattered. An incomprehensible force detonated from Qin Jiang's body. Savage energy slammed into him like a tidal wave. His eyes bulged. Blood sprayed from his mouth as he was blasted into the mountainside.

Qin Jiang pressed the attack without mercy, raining blow after devastating blow. The entire peak nearly crumbled under the onslaught. Tang Yin had been in a daze from the very first exchange—within seconds, he was critically wounded.

As the mountain fractured and rubble filled the air, Qin Jiang strode through the curtain of falling stone and planted a foot squarely on Tang Yin's chest.

"That weak?"

He muttered it almost to himself. Chen Changsheng at early Saint Realm was probably stronger than this Supreme. How had this guy even qualified as a Child of Destiny? No wonder the system rewards were so pitiful. With a punching bag this flimsy, what kind of payout could he expect?

Tang Yin heard the disdain and coughed up another mouthful of blood, his vision going dark. The severity of his injuries was dragging his consciousness under.

"Qin Jiang, you came all this way just to kill an ordinary Supreme?"

Liu Shuwan appeared before him, curiosity in her eyes.

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched. Tang Yin really was remarkably... ordinary. He looked down at the man lying there like a dead dog and curled his lip.

"Looking at him makes me sick. Alive, he's wasting perfectly good air. I'm doing the world a favor!"

As the last word fell, he pressed down hard.

Annihilating force surged into Tang Yin's body. He didn't even have time to scream before he burst into a cloud of crimson mist.

Liu Shuwan wrinkled her nose and flared her spiritual energy, dispersing the bloody haze.

Simultaneously, the system's rewards flooded Qin Jiang's mind—along with Tang Yin's plundered fortune. He gave the haul a cursory glance, expecting nothing impressive, but then—

"Holy—!"

His eyes lit up. He stared at one particular reward, then whipped his head toward Liu Shuwan, beaming.

"What is it?" she asked, startled.

Qin Jiang threw his arms around her, planted a firm kiss on her lips, and laughed. "Wan'er, your lucky day has arrived!"

"What?"

He winked, producing the Myriad Dao Stone with a flourish. He tossed it into Tang Yin's lingering blood mist—a bit of theater—while actually extracting a law from his system space and slipping it into the stone. As the mist dissipated, he retrieved the Myriad Dao Stone and handed it to Liu Shuwan.

"Wan'er, look at this."

"An Immortal Path Law?"

"That's right. And not just any law—a Sword Dao Law!"
