"Someone's here?" Yue Weiwei yelped, diving into Qin Jiang's chest, face burning. She hadn't exactly been quiet earlier. Had someone heard all of that?

Qin Jiang carried her out. Nangong Yun was picking himself up off the ground, still dazed from the blow. He shook his head to clear it and focused on Qin Jiang walking toward him — and the woman cradled in his arms.

"Senior Sister..."

Nangong Yun's jaw dropped. A thread of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.

Hearing the familiar voice, Yue Weiwei started. She lifted her head from Qin Jiang's chest and looked at Nangong Yun, genuinely surprised.

"Junior Brother?"

These past few days wrapped up in Qin Jiang, she'd forgotten Nangong Yun entirely — and the anti-Huaxia alliance along with him. It had completely slipped her mind that she'd been abducted, and that her allies were presumably still plotting her rescue.

Nangong Yun's face was a storm of emotions. No need for questions — he could see plainly enough. His senior sister now belonged to another man. And outside that door, he'd heard her actively asking for more.

But in front of him, she'd always been the picture of prim restraint. He'd spent half a year courting her without so much as touching her hand. And now, in just a few days...

Desolation washed over him.

Qin Jiang, clearly relishing the moment, tilted Yue Weiwei's chin up and — right in front of Nangong Yun — placed a gentle kiss on her lips. "Weiwei, this is your junior brother?"

"Mm." She nodded, shooting Qin Jiang a puzzled look. He'd investigated the entire anti-Huaxia alliance — he had to know what Nangong Yun looked like. Why was he asking her?

"So you're Weiwei's junior brother! She's told me about you. It's a pleasure." Qin Jiang beamed.

Nangong Yun finally looked at Qin Jiang properly. Noble, refined, devastatingly handsome — the very image of a true aristocrat. In that instant, a wave of inferiority crashed over him. Senior Sister and this man were a matched pair. And he... was a clown between them.

He struggled to his feet, wiped the blood from his mouth, and turned to Yue Weiwei. "Senior Sister, he's...?"

"I'm Weiwei's husband." Qin Jiang cut in smoothly, all smiles. "A few days ago, she was kidnapped by scoundrels, and I happened to be nearby. I rescued her. Afterward, we fell for each other at first sight and pledged ourselves to one another."

He glanced down at Weiwei with a wink. She'd spent enough time around him by now to read him perfectly. The scoundrel wanted to toy with her junior brother — the same way he'd toyed with her.

After a moment's hesitation, she looked at Nangong Yun and played along. "Junior Brother, if not for my husband, I wouldn't have escaped safely. I care for him deeply, and I've given myself to him. From now on, you should call him Senior Brother."

Nangong Yun's expression locked up.

Qin Jiang stepped forward, clapped a friendly hand on his shoulder, and grinned. "Don't worry, Junior Brother. Your senior sister is in good hands. I'll make sure she's well-fed every day, keep her white and soft and pampered. Heh — isn't that right, Weiwei?"

"Mm. I trust you, Husband."

Her face reddened as she pinched a bit of flesh at his waist. Saying things like that in front of people — how embarrassing.

Still, she didn't contradict him. She played along beautifully.

Nangong Yun stood frozen, his lips twitching in a hollow grin as he watched them flirt. His throat tightened, his vision swam — and then a mouthful of blood burst from his lips.

He collapsed, unconscious before he hit the ground.

Qin Jiang blinked, genuinely surprised. A Child of Destiny, knocked out by sheer fury? Well — to be fair, that palm strike earlier had done most of the work. An ordinary Supreme would have died outright. Nangong Yun lasting this long was already impressive.

"He fainted," Yue Weiwei observed. She looked at Qin Jiang. "Want to keep playing?"

"Clever girl — you knew just how to follow my lead." He pulled her close and kissed her deeply. Nangong Yun, unconscious on the ground, was promptly ignored.

A long while later, Weiwei nearly ran out of breath before he let go. He flicked her nose and smiled.

"How about I go visit the anti-Huaxia alliance?"

She gave him a look. The Lord of Huaxia, personally visiting the anti-Huaxia alliance. That was practically assassinating them with irony.

But seeing his eager expression, she relented. "Fine. I'll take you. But should we bring Yao-jie and Mo-jie? In case there's danger, they can protect you."

Qin Jiang's eye twitched. "Excuse me? I — the Lord of Huaxia, a man among men — needing their protection?"

"You don't?"

A cool voice floated from behind him. He turned to find all the women standing there. Jian Yao had her arms crossed. Mo Mo stood with hands on hips. None of them looked pleased.

"Ahem." He coughed, quickly composing himself. "What are you all doing out here?"

"Enjoying someone's bold declarations, obviously," Jian Yao said with a sweet smile.

Mo Mo huffed. "Seems like someone doesn't need us anymore. Planning to abandon us, are you?"

Qin Jiang laughed awkwardly, released Yue Weiwei, and went straight to Mo Mo, pulling her into his arms for a kiss. "Mo Mo, don't be silly. How could I ever leave you? I can barely love you all enough as it is."

He kissed her again, let go, and immediately buried his face in Jian Yao's chest. "Yao Yao, I can prove my bold claims right now, in your room."

"Pervert." Jian Yao blushed and tried to push him away, but he clung to her like a barnacle. Of course, she wasn't trying very hard. When pushing failed, she simply wrapped her arms around him.

"Then let's go to my room. We'll all see just how bold you really are."

"Absolutely."

His voice came out muffled against her. He nodded without lifting his head, then followed Jian Yao inside.

She looked back at Liu Shuwan, Lian'er, Mo Mo, and Yue Weiwei, beckoning. "Come on. All of us together."
