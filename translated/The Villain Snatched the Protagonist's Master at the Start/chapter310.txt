The five True Immortals exchanged a glance and led their forces directly into the Chaos District, their combined aura pressing down like a physical weight.

The instant they crossed the threshold, Qin Jiang raised his arm. The Immortal King Killing Formation roared to life, engulfing the entire district. He wasn't about to let a single one escape.

His face was alight with excitement. The cage was sealed — no way out now.

He seized control of the formation. In a heartbeat, the sky over the Chaos District seemed to collapse. A suffocating pressure descended, making everyone's breath catch.

"So this is his real trump card," Dao Zhen murmured. The formation's lethal edge wasn't aimed at him, yet even he felt a deep, instinctive dread. Power on this scale — no True Immortal could withstand it. Only an Immortal King could hope to break free.

"Chan'er — go."

At Qin Jiang's command, Qing Chan led the women into battle alongside Dao Zhen and An Xihe's forces. Qin Jiang himself kept his eyes locked on the five True Immortals, channeling the formation's full fury against them. Wave after wave of devastating attacks hammered down.

The five True Immortals reacted with instinctive alarm. They had no time to worry about Qing Chan's group — the Immortal King Killing Formation struck faster and harder than anything else on the field. Five voices roared in unison as they combined their True Immortal power to weather the opening salvo.

They held — barely. But the force hurled them from the sky, sending them crashing to earth. Blood churned in their bodies, and shock painted their faces. They'd assumed five True Immortals acting in concert would be unstoppable in Azure Cloud Heaven. Instead, the very first exchange had been a body blow.

Qing Chan's forces engaged the enemy subordinates. Qing Chan herself hung back, content to let her sisters vent their frustrations — they were still seething about the interruption, after all. Her role was guardian, and as a True Immortal, keeping them safe was effortless. The women's own strength was nothing to scoff at, either.

"Kill!" The women attacked with icy expressions and savage efficiency, their collective aura radiating pure aggression. Their opponents could feel it — something was off about these women. They fought like they'd eaten gunpowder for breakfast.

Liu Shuwan and Jian Yao paired up, their twin swords carving through a Human Immortal's defenses in perfect harmony, driving the enemy into constant retreat.

Mo Mo unleashed the full weight of her demonic power. Among the women, she was one of the absolute strongest — infinitely close to True Immortal. She shouldered a massive warhammer and took on three Human Immortals solo. Between her bizarre techniques and explosive brutality, the trio was utterly overwhelmed.

Xue Mei, a veteran Human Immortal, engaged her opponent with deceptive simplicity. Each seemingly ordinary strike carried tremendous force — yao beasts' physical power was inherently superior at equal cultivation levels.

Ning Xue'er, the Azure Lotus Divine Palace's master, was all softness and demure charm when around Qin Jiang — a practiced green-tea act that Qing Chan loved to bully her for. But in combat, her strength was beyond question. Like Mo Mo, she took on three opponents at once with room to spare, her figure ghosting between attacks so fluidly that none of her enemies could so much as graze her clothing.

Chen Baizhe fought with the poise of the Human Dao Sect's heir, selecting a single opponent and utterly crushing them. Same realm, but the gap was enormous.

The four other Azure Lotus Divine Palace Immortals each chose their own targets, while the remainder were handled by An Xihe's subordinates and Dao Zhen.

The women below Human Immortal knew their limits and stayed out of the fighting, unwilling to become distractions.

Meanwhile, Qin Jiang was methodically pummeling the five True Immortals. Credit where it was due — they were durable. "Too bad I need to preserve their bodies," he muttered. "If I went all-out, this would already be over."

Restraint was necessary. Overkill would reduce them to dust, and their corpses were too valuable to waste. So he calibrated his attacks carefully, gradually ratcheting up the pressure.

The five True Immortals were in sorry shape. They looked up at Qin Jiang, having finally identified him as the one controlling the formation.

"The formation's getting stronger. If this continues, we won't survive."

"No matter how powerful the formation is — kill the controller, and it falls."

"He's just a Great Emperor."

"Who goes?"

"I will. Cover me."

A brief exchange was all they needed. The plan was simple: eliminate Qin Jiang. Four would absorb the formation's attacks while one broke free to strike.

The designated True Immortal materialized before Qin Jiang in a flash, a contemptuous smile on his lips as he reached out to seize him.

Qin Jiang flicked a finger.

The True Immortal rocketed backward like a cannonball, slamming into the ground hard enough to crater it. When the dust cleared, his body was a ruin — drenched in blood, flesh split open in deep fissures.

The other four stared, pupils contracting. What kind of monstrous power could do that to a True Immortal's body with a single flick?

They looked at Qin Jiang, and for the first time, genuine unease took root.

This was not as simple as they'd assumed.

On the women's side, Yan Shiya had vanished from sight the moment battle commenced. She prowled the battlefield like a phantom, waiting. When Liu Shuwan and Jian Yao's relentless assault finally created an opening in their opponent's guard —

One strike. Lethal.

Yan Shiya's blade punched through the back of the man's skull and out the front. A pulse of immortal-path energy shredded his Primordial Spirit on the spot.

The first enemy Human Immortal fell.

"Nice work, Shiya." Liu Shuwan and Jian Yao offered brief praise, then pivoted to their next target. Yan Shiya melted back into the shadows, gliding across the battlefield, hunting for the next opening. As long as she remained hidden, no one could detect her.

Back among the True Immortals, all five erupted with power. Four braced against the formation's latest onslaught while the fifth — battered but alive — hurled himself at Qin Jiang again.

Qin Jiang flicked him away a second time. The man crashed down trailing blood, even more broken than before.

The remaining four True Immortals' faces drained of color. They stared at Qin Jiang — a mere Great Emperor — and the terrifying truth finally sank in.

Things were very, very wrong.
