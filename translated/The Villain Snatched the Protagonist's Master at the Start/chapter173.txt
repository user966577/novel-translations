Qin Jiang's expression was cold.

He flicked his palm. Five streams of light ripped free from the captives' bodies.

Great Emperor Laws.

Five of them, orbiting slowly above his hand.

Fourth Ancestor and the others stared, their pupils contracting. They'd broken through to Great Emperor themselves thanks to the laws Qin Jiang had provided—but this was the first time they'd witnessed where those laws actually came from.

He tore them out of people. By force.

"Fourth Ancestor, you handle the distribution." Qin Jiang tossed the five Great Emperor Laws over with a casual smile. He had no shortage of them. The system had rewarded plenty lately, and in Azure Cloud Heaven, Great Emperors were hardly rare. If he wanted more, he could grab them anytime.

Every eye in the room locked onto those swirling laws, especially the half-Emperors among them. With a Great Emperor Law, any of them could break through in an instant.

But the method of acquisition sent a chill down their spines. Someone who could rip laws out of people by brute force...

They looked at the laws, then at Qin Jiang. The newly recruited cultivators couldn't suppress the flicker of fear in their eyes.

"Give them to the half-Emperors first," Fourth Ancestor said, glancing at Qin Jiang for approval.

Four of the half-Emperors hadn't come from the Heavenly Mystery Continent—they were local recruits. But having witnessed Azure Cloud Heaven's overwhelming strength firsthand, Fourth Ancestor wanted to bolster their forces as quickly as possible.

Qin Jiang had no objections. Great Emperor Laws were cheap commodities to him. He nodded.

"Go ahead. I can take them back anytime I want."

His gaze swept over the four unfamiliar half-Emperors as he said it. A warning.

All four kept their heads down, not daring to breathe a word. They'd just seen exactly what Qin Jiang was capable of.

The Tang family.

Three Great Emperors staggered back home in disarray, sending the entire clan into turmoil. News of five Great Emperors falling spread like wildfire.

Inside the great hall, the atmosphere was suffocating. The clan elders fixed their gazes on the three survivors, whose faces still carried the pallor of terror.

At the head of the hall sat a sharp-eyed old man. He frowned at his three cowering Great Emperors and barked, "You are Great Emperors! Compose yourselves!"

His voice boomed like a temple bell, draining the color from their faces but steadying their nerves somewhat. After a moment, they managed to look up at their clan head with bitter smiles.

"Patriarch, I'm afraid the Tang family has kicked an iron plate."

"Tell me what happened."

The three exchanged glances, then laid out the entire ordeal.

The elders' faces grew increasingly grim.

"An Immortal?"

"Yes. We hadn't even reached Qin Family City when we encountered that Immortal. The moment they learned we were from the Tang family, they attacked without a word. They're definitely Qin Family City's people."

The memory still made them shudder. If the enemy hadn't underestimated them, if they hadn't sacrificed their companions as a diversion, if the Patriarch's protective measures hadn't been in place...

They wouldn't have made it back alive.

The Tang Patriarch's expression was grave. He was the clan's strongest—an Ancient Emperor—but even that was merely one step from the immortal path. And that single step might trap him for the rest of his life. He'd once challenged an Immortal cultivator. The Immortal had held back, and even so, three moves was all it took to crush him.

He'd gained something from that fight, but not nearly enough to cross into the immortal path.

If Qin Family City truly had an Immortal guarding it, the Tang family's prospects were dire.

"Patriarch, Qin Family City operates with arrogance and tyranny. Now that we've made enemies of them, they won't show us mercy."

The other elders nodded. They'd investigated Qin Family City—Fourth Ancestor and his people were known for their ruthless, domineering ways. Once a grudge was made, there would be no quarter.

Silence fell. In the Emperor path alone, the Tang family feared no one. Their patriarch's strength was virtually at the pinnacle of the Emperor realm.

But against an Immortal...

The gap was simply insurmountable.

"Should we fight it out?" someone whispered.

The Patriarch shot the speaker a look. "Fight? A single Immortal could wipe out the entire Tang family. What exactly would we fight with?"

Having challenged one himself, he knew precisely how terrifying Immortals were. Even if every Tang clansman attacked together, they couldn't scratch an Immortal. Hidden weapons and poisons would be equally useless. If it came to fleeing... perhaps he could escape. But the rest of the clan wouldn't survive.

Just as the elders were racking their brains, footsteps echoed from the hall entrance. All eyes turned—it was a young man.

The moment they saw him, the tension in the elders' brows eased.

"Father." The young man entered and addressed the patriarch with a respectful bow.

The Tang Patriarch's expression softened. He had many children—so many that his descendants spanned dozens of generations by now. But this young man was his youngest son: Tang Yin.

Barely a hundred years old.

A century ago, the Patriarch had been experimenting with poisons when an accident turned one of his concoctions into an aphrodisiac. A little maidservant had been attending him at the time, and to help him neutralize the effects... she'd offered herself.

One shot, one hit. Tang Yin was the result.

The maidservant was pretty enough that the Patriarch had taken a liking to her, and as Tang Yin grew, his talent proved superior to every one of the Patriarch's other children.

At just a hundred years old, Tang Yin had already reached the Supreme Realm.

The Patriarch was convinced his youngest son's future would surpass his own. Reaching the immortal path wasn't out of the question.

"What is it, Yin'er?"

Tang Yin smiled and met his father's gaze. "Father, I overheard your discussion. Perhaps... I can help."

"You?"

The Patriarch frowned. Tang Yin was talented, but a Supreme against an Immortal cultivator?

"Don't be ridiculous, Yin'er."

He waved dismissively. The other elders shook their heads—they didn't have time for this.

Tang Yin's expression didn't waver. "Father. A while back, during my travels, I saved a girl. It turned out she was the princess of the Celestial Rabbit Tribe. I may be able to secure their help."

The Celestial Rabbit Tribe was a powerful race among the yao clans, with Immortal-path cultivators of their own—far stronger than the Tang family.

Hearing this, the Patriarch and elders' faces went from surprise to delight. "Yin'er, can you really... get the Celestial Rabbit Tribe to help us?"
