Qin Jiang's remark made Zi Fu's cheeks flush pink. As expected, this guy was no good—he was already setting his sights on her. She shot him a glare and turned away.

Lian'er's eyes darted mischievously, and she grabbed Zi Fu's hand, afraid the woman might bolt. Meanwhile, Mo Mo twirled a strand of hair around her finger, her beautiful eyes gleaming with excitement, ready at any moment to seal Zi Fu and toss her onto Qin Jiang's bed. Perhaps because of her own experience, she thoroughly enjoyed sealing other women and delivering them to Qin Jiang—let them all experience what she'd gone through.

"Any more questions?" Qin Jiang continued, watching Zi Fu.

She let out a soft huff. She genuinely had considered leaving, but Lian'er had her hand, and there was an Immortal at Qin Jiang's side. She couldn't exactly run. Shaking her head, she let Lian'er lead her back toward the Qin estate. Mo Mo looked slightly disappointed, but she linked her arm through Qin Jiang's and walked alongside him.

"Brother, you still haven't answered my question," Lian'er said as they walked.

Qin Jiang smiled. "My gambling king title is the real deal."

"Really?"

"Of course!" He nodded confidently. "Go ask Yun'er. Back then, it was through gambling that she lost both herself and her aunt to me."

"Is that so?" Lian'er's eyes sparkled with gossip—this was the first she'd heard of it.

They arrived back at the Qin estate before long. Everyone headed into the Void Divine Temple, while Lian'er dragged Zi Fu off to find Yan Yun.

Qin Jiang found an empty space and, with a thought, constructed a smaller temple within the Void Divine Temple. Then he flipped his palm, and the Time-Space Disc appeared.

The complete Time-Space Disc—when he'd beaten Chen Qi'er earlier, the altered trajectory had triggered a system reward, which included a Time-Space Disc fragment. The last fragment. At long last, the Time-Space Disc was whole.

Mo Mo eyed the smaller temple curiously. "Qin Jiang, what are you doing?"

"I'm going to build a Space-Time Temple."

"A Space-Time Temple?"

He nodded, gazing at the structure with a smile. "That's right. From now on, this will be the Space-Time Temple. Like the Void Divine Temple, it contains infinite space, but beyond that, it can also accelerate time. When any of you go into seclusion, you can enter here."

Originally, he'd planned to infuse the Time-Space Disc's power directly into the Void Divine Temple, but since the women lived there day-to-day, accelerating time across the entire space would waste their precious youth. After careful consideration, he decided to build a separate temple within the Void Divine Temple instead.

He tossed the Time-Space Disc into the Space-Time Temple, then channeled all the energy he'd accumulated from the Myriad Realms Tower into it. There wasn't much left, but it would sustain operations for a while. Once that energy ran out, spirit stones could power it instead. The complete disc wasn't as picky as before—though the quantity required would be substantial, it was more than worth it. The Qin family could afford it. And if push came to shove, he could always conscript some people to mine spirit stones specifically for the temple.

The Time-Space Disc activated, and a hazy aura of space-time power enveloped the temple. Qin Jiang stepped inside. The interior needed furnishing, but since it was meant for seclusion, nothing fancy was required—just a series of clean, simple private chambers. With the disc's power at his disposal, the setup was effortless.

Looking up, the Time-Space Disc hung overhead. He waved his hand, cloaking it from sight, then beckoned. A strand of law power descended from above.

"The Space-Time Law!"

Qin Jiang's eyes burned with intensity. A complete Space-Time Law! Once he refined it, he too could command the power of space and time—and the disc itself wouldn't be affected in the slightest. He willed it into his body. Since the disc had already acknowledged him as its master, the law offered no resistance and merged with him smoothly.

This law didn't belong to any fixed tier—it was a growth-type ability that would strengthen as Qin Jiang himself grew stronger.

With the Space-Time Law fused into him, Qin Jiang extended his hand. Wisps of space-time energy flickered across his palm, growing denser as he channeled more power. After a while, he withdrew his energy and shook his head—his output still couldn't match the disc's. Of course, that was because the disc consumed far more energy than he could personally generate. Without a sufficient supply, the disc was just a paperweight. Still, possessing space-time power meant he could now craft artifacts similar to the Time-Space Disc—though nothing near the disc's caliber, given his current strength.

"I should build a Space-Time Temple for the ancestors too," he murmured. The Void Divine Temple's version was for his women, but the ancestors needed to improve as well. Mere Great Emperors just weren't cutting it anymore. How were they supposed to serve as muscle? Time for the old guard to step up their game.

With the temple complete, Qin Jiang notified the women to come try it out. After experiencing the time acceleration firsthand, they were all beaming.

"With this temple, Qin Jiang's time just got a lot more flexible."

"Exactly! Let's just move Qin Jiang's big house into the Space-Time Temple. That way, whoever wants to see him can just go straight there—think of how much time that saves!"

"That's brilliant!"

As the women discussed enthusiastically, Qin Jiang's expression darkened. This wasn't how it was supposed to go. He'd built the Space-Time Temple so they could train harder, but now they were all scheming about how to squeeze more out of him?

Looking at their expectant gazes, he thought it over and had to admit—they had a point. With accelerated time, he really could make time for all of them. At maximum time dilation, he could cycle through everyone in a single day.

Though... somehow that made him feel like a... courtesan. Entertaining clients all day? He looked up. Dozens of eager, burning gazes made him shiver. This was bad. He'd truly become the star attraction—no different from the top performer at a pleasure house.

"Qin Jiang~ Jiang-Jiang~ Jiang darling~~"

Soft, honeyed voices made his knees go weak. Fortunately, he was battle-hardened and held his ground. Taking a deep breath, he surveyed the room, then met their expectant eyes and nodded.

"I'll move in right away."
