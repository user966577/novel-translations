"Don't blow my cover," Liu Xing transmitted.

Yang Hong gave an imperceptible nod. Then he raised a hand and waved his guards aside. Liu Xing smiled and patted his shoulder. "Smart man."

He beckoned to Zhao Sheng. "Come on, let's head in."

"Right." Zhao Sheng hurried to catch up.

As he passed Yang Hong, he paused. Not wanting to burn bridges, he offered an apologetic look. "Patriarch Yang, I'm sorry. I just want to see Miss Manman—one look, and I'll leave."

"Hmph." Yang Hong turned away, refusing to acknowledge him.

Ahead of them, Liu Xing was internally exasperated. He'd played the heavy to get Zhao Sheng in, and the kid immediately went and apologized to the man. So Liu Xing got to be the villain while Zhao Sheng played the gentleman. The Manor Lord would never pull something like that. He led from the front, owned every bold move, and didn't look back. Compared to the Manor Lord, this kid was truly pathetic.

Zhao Sheng could sense Yang Hong's anger and said nothing more. He caught up with Liu Xing. "Thanks, Liu-ge."

On his own, he could have overpowered Yang Hong, but the fallout would have been ugly—too much noise, too much collateral. With Liu Xing, a True Immortal who could effortlessly suppress a Human Immortal, none of that was necessary.

Liu Xing waved it off. "We're practically family. Don't mention it. Now go find your girl."

"Right."

But once inside the Yang estate, Zhao Sheng realized he had no idea where Yang Manman lived. He stood there, scratching his head sheepishly. "Uh... Liu-ge, I don't actually know where her residence is."

Liu Xing looked at Yang Hong. The patriarch stood stone-faced and silent—good acting instincts. Liu Xing gave a subtle nod of approval, then raised an eyebrow at him. "Hey, care to show us the way?"

Only then did Yang Hong respond, looking thoroughly unwilling. But under duress, he nodded. "Follow me."

They walked in silence, Yang Hong's expression dark. Before long, they arrived outside Yang Manman's courtyard. Standing at the gate were three familiar figures.

At the sight of them, both Liu Xing and Zhao Sheng stiffened. Black Dragon and Little Xu—Zhao Sheng had encountered them both in the secret realm, even fought them. What were they doing at the Yang estate?

A sickening feeling bloomed in Zhao Sheng's chest. Had Yang Hong been telling the truth? Did she really have another man?

Liu Xing and Zhao Sheng's feet rooted to the ground. Yang Hong, meanwhile, quickened his pace toward Black Dragon and pointed at the two newcomers. "Sir, these men are here to cause trouble!"

The three had already spotted them. Black Dragon and Little Xu wore identical smirks. Little Xu even raised a hand in a cheerful wave.

Both Liu Xing and Zhao Sheng's faces fell. Without a moment's hesitation, Liu Xing grabbed Zhao Sheng and bolted. But Tianji flicked a finger, and Liu Xing discovered with horror that no matter how hard he ran, he stayed in exactly the same spot.

He struggled for a while to no avail. Reluctantly, he stopped and turned to Tianji, muttering under his breath. The kid had some real skill—who was he? Liu Xing had never seen him before. New hire?

Zhao Sheng, meanwhile, was utterly helpless. "Liu-ge." He looked at Liu Xing—his only lifeline.

"Running off so soon? After we came all this way?" Black Dragon chuckled.

Liu Xing forced a laugh. "Fancy meeting you here."

"Small world." Black Dragon nodded agreeably.

The two chatted like old acquaintances while Liu Xing and Zhao Sheng quietly tested Tianji's binding, probing for weaknesses. Tianji just smiled—and released the hold.

Their faces lit up. They spun to flee. This time, Tianji didn't stop them.

Little Xu did. He materialized in front of them and delivered a single casual palm strike that sent them tumbling back to their starting position.

"You're not going anywhere," Little Xu said flatly.

Zhao Sheng's expression darkened. Liu Xing had absorbed most of the blow, but even the residual force had set Zhao Sheng's blood churning. True Immortal-level combat was completely beyond him. Liu Xing alone couldn't escape, and carrying Zhao Sheng as dead weight made it even more hopeless.

"Liu-ge, go. I'll hold them off." Zhao Sheng steeled himself. Last time, Liu Xing had been the one to buy him time. Now it was his turn.

Liu Xing frowned and cuffed him upside the head. "Don't be stupid. If we go, we go together."

"Liu-ge..."

"I said shut it!"

Zhao Sheng's mouth opened and closed. His eyes burned with emotion. Liu-ge was closer than an actual brother.

Little Xu clapped his hands together, watching the two with undisguised amusement. "How touching. Too bad neither of you is leaving."

He was about to press the attack when the courtyard gate swung open.

Two figures stepped out—Qin Jiang and Yang Manman.

Little Xu immediately pulled back. In a blink, he was beside Qin Jiang, standing with Black Dragon. They bowed in unison. "Young Master. Young Madam."

"At ease." Qin Jiang waved them off. Yang Manman's cheeks colored faintly at the title.

Across the way, Liu Xing and Zhao Sheng saw them too. Zhao Sheng went rigid.

A perfect couple.

Looking at Qin Jiang and Yang Manman together, that was the only phrase that came to mind. And he, standing here—he was the clown.

Qin Jiang had his arm around Yang Manman's waist as they stepped out of the courtyard. Both their gazes settled on Zhao Sheng.

"What's going on?" Qin Jiang asked casually.

"Young Master, they ran into each other during the Immortal Emperor's legacy affair..." Black Dragon gave a brief explanation.

Before he finished, Yang Manman spoke up from within Qin Jiang's embrace. "I know him."

"Oh?" Qin Jiang's brow rose. His arm tightened around her waist. "You know him?"

"Mm." She nodded, shooting Qin Jiang a discreet look.

He could have just explained everything directly. But no—he'd orchestrated this entire scene. He wanted her to play-act that she still had lingering feelings for Zhao Sheng, then magnanimously let him go. She was almost certain Qin Jiang was a pervert.
