Noticing the woman's gaze, Qin Jiang withdrew his foot and turned to Black Dragon with an accusing look. "Black Dragon, where are your manners?"

"Please punish me, Young Master." Black Dragon played along without missing a beat.

Qin Jiang shook his head and waved it off. "Forget it. Just watch yourself next time. When we get back, your punishment will be one month limited to ten blocks of Immortal Marrow."

"Yes, sir."

The woman in the courtyard watched their little performance and finally snapped out of her daze. She immediately became wary, her eyes fixed on Qin Jiang. "Who are you people?"

She might not know every member of the Yang family, but she was certain these men weren't from the clan. With looks like theirs, they couldn't possibly be nobodies.

Qin Jiang smiled and strolled into the courtyard. Black Dragon and the others stayed outside, thoughtfully pulling the gate shut behind him. This only made the woman more nervous. She stood and took several cautious steps backward, trying to put distance between them. Not that a few steps meant anything to cultivators—the extra distance was purely psychological comfort.

"Don't be afraid, Miss Yang. I'm not a bad person." Qin Jiang chuckled.

The woman said nothing. He certainly didn't look like a bad person. But his behavior... She'd watched him kick the gate open and blame someone else. Definitely a bad person.

Qin Jiang wasn't in a rush. He sat down in the courtyard, studying her with a look that was rich with implication.

"Who are you? What do you want?" she demanded.

"My, Miss Yang truly is a beauty." Qin Jiang said admiringly.

The woman tensed. Was he after her looks? She immediately adopted a threatening tone. "Don't try anything. This is the Yang family estate. My father is the Yang family patriarch!"

In this neck of the woods, the Yang patriarch's name carried weight. Unfortunately, to Qin Jiang, a mere Human Immortal didn't even register. But seeing her wariness, a mischievous urge seized him.

"You're the Yang patriarch's daughter?" He arranged his features into something resembling awe.

Spotting what she thought was trepidation, the woman relaxed slightly and stood a bit taller. "That's right!"

Qin Jiang drew a sharp breath and leapt to his feet. Before she could react, he'd closed the distance, taken her by the arm, and guided her to sit down—all while wearing a mask of humble respect. "The Yang family patriarch's daughter! A Human Immortal! What a powerful existence—practically a king of the Heavenly Domain, nigh invincible!"

"???"

The woman was bewildered. The flattery was wildly exaggerated, and something about the delivery felt distinctly sarcastic. More importantly—

"Your hand..." Her cheeks flushed. While steadying her arm, his fingers had been wandering, and it tickled.

"Oh—sorry, sorry." Qin Jiang apologized quickly, then gave her arm a couple of pats. "Look at that, I got you all dusty. Let me brush it off."

"!!!"

The woman went rigid. Before she could pull away, Qin Jiang pressed her back down. She could only glare at him, cheeks burning.

After a few casual pats, Qin Jiang withdrew his hand, looking pleased. "There, all better."

Why did she suddenly feel a draft? She glanced down and her eyes widened. Her dress had two holes in it.

"Let go of me!" She struggled fiercely, threatening him between gasps. "Let me go, or my father will never forgive you!"

"Oh, I'm so scared," Qin Jiang drawled, his voice dripping with amusement.

The woman realized the truth—he'd been acting the whole time. He wasn't afraid of the Yang family at all. She forced herself to calm down, fists clenching. "What do you really want?"

"Hmm, I suppose I can tell you." His gaze drifted pointedly to the torn parts of her dress, making her squirm helplessly.

"Do you know Zhao Sheng?"

The name made her pause. Zhao Sheng—the Zhao family patriarch. She'd always admired him, the kind of man who could shoulder the weight of an entire clan.

"I'm his friend." Qin Jiang smiled.

Her eyes went wide. "You're his friend?"

"That's right." Qin Jiang nodded. "He likes you, but he isn't sure how you feel about him. So he sent me to test you."

"???"

Test her? Was this how people ran tests? She looked at Qin Jiang, suspicion written all over her face.

"What? Don't believe me?"

She didn't answer. Instead, she glanced down at her ruined dress. Catching her look, Qin Jiang cleared his throat. "Don't sweat the details." Then he reached out and gave her another pat, making her flinch.

She looked up, glaring. After taking a deep breath to steady herself, she said, "If you're really his friend, why are you treating me like this?"

"Heh heh—all's fair with a buddy's girl, right?"

That wasn't how the saying went at all! This man was definitely not Zhao Sheng's friend. More likely an enemy—one who couldn't get to Zhao Sheng directly and had decided to target her instead.

"What do you actually want?" Her voice turned cold.

Qin Jiang studied her for a moment, then clicked his tongue and shook his head. "Forget it. This isn't fun anymore."

Without further preamble, he placed a hand on her shoulder and sent a pulse of energy through it. In an instant, her clothing disintegrated.

"You—"

She froze. She hadn't expected him to be so direct. He scooped her up in his arms, grinning. "Let's skip to the main event."

"No—!" Panic flooded her face, shattering her composure entirely. "Don't touch me! Put me down!"

Qin Jiang carried her straight into her room. The decor was actually quite nice—everything in soft pinks. Very girly. He set her on the bed and pinned her down. She was only a Great Emperor—against an Immortal King, she had no more power to resist than a mortal.

"No—let me go—"

She struggled, but her feeble resistance only spurred him on. He leaned down and kissed her.

"Mmph—"

Tears spilled from her eyes instantly. Her first kiss—gone. And what followed was likely to cost her far more than that.

After a long, deep kiss, Qin Jiang moved his lips to her ear and whispered, "I love picking fruit that hasn't ripened yet. Keep struggling, darling—the more you fight, the more I enjoy it."
