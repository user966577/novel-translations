With Yu Ru gone, only Qin Jiang and Yu Lan remained in the room.

After a brief silence, Yu Lan spoke. "Your clothes..."

"Hm?"

Qin Jiang looked down and raised a brow. In all the earlier exertion, his clothes had gotten soaked with "sweat."

His expression didn't waver. "Hot weather. I perspire easily."

Yu Lan nodded and looked away. She wasn't comfortable around strangers, and Qin Jiang was very much a stranger. Were it not for Yu Ru's claim that he'd saved their people, she wouldn't have let him stay in the room at all.

An awkward silence settled between them.

Qin Jiang studied her, considered his approach, then stepped closer. "Let me examine your condition."

"That's not necessary."

A flat refusal.

He sat on the edge of the bed anyway and looked her over. Yu Lan's brow knit in displeasure, her lips parting to protest—but the debt she owed him kept her silent.

"Your injuries are severe. If I'm not mistaken, they targeted your royal bloodline with poison."

His tone was grave.

Yu Lan's eyes widened. She gave a slight nod. "My bloodline has indeed been compromised."

"If the toxins aren't purged soon, your royal bloodline may be permanently destroyed. But in your current state, clearing them on your own would be nearly impossible."

Yu Lan's lashes lowered. Since the Snake Race's clan chief had announced her seclusion to attempt the immortal path, the rivalry between the two royal bloodline holders had escalated relentlessly. At first, both sides had exercised restraint. But as the chief formally entered seclusion, the competition turned white-hot.

What Yu Lan hadn't anticipated was betrayal from within—a handmaiden who'd been turned, slipping poison into her system. Her bloodline had been compromised at the worst possible moment, and the rival bloodline holder had seized that exact window to strike. Yu Lan had been beaten decisively. Critically wounded, she'd had no choice but to flee.

Her injuries were worse than she'd feared, and Yu Ru's people couldn't help her. If this dragged on, the royal bloodline truly might be destroyed.

She turned to Qin Jiang. He was watching her with deep concern, his eyes sincere, without a trace of ulterior motive. The very picture of a righteous man.

Pure and kind-hearted.

Her gaze softened slightly. "Young Master Qin is an alchemist?"

"I have a little talent. Managed to reach Emperor-grade, barely."

He scratched his head bashfully.

Yu Lan pressed her lips together, a serious cast settling over her features. "Would Young Master Qin be able to cure this bloodline poison of mine?"

Qin Jiang hesitated. A long pause. A deep breath. "I'd need to examine you more closely."

"Very well."

"I'll need you to cooperate. My energy will need to enter your body..."

He sat on the edge of the bed and took her hand. Yu Lan's arm flinched—instinct screaming to pull away—but the gravity of his expression held her in place.

A moment later, she felt a thread of his energy flow from her palm into her body.

"Don't resist. Just relax."

His voice was clinical.

Yu Lan took several deep breaths and forced her power down. She turned her head away, refusing to look at him. The foreign energy inside her felt almost... playful. It flowed through her in gentle currents, occasionally pulsing in ways that made her skin tingle.

Before she realized it, a warm flush had crept across her cheeks.

After what felt like an eternity, she couldn't bear it any longer. She turned back to him, breathing heavier than she liked. "Young Master Qin, is that sufficient?"

He nodded and withdrew his hand, brow furrowed in apparent deliberation over how to proceed.

Yu Lan watched him. "Can this poison be cured?"

"It can. However..."

His expression turned conflicted.

Hope sparked in Yu Lan's eyes. As long as there was a way—if her royal bloodline were destroyed, she'd lose any chance of reclaiming power. But his hesitation worried her.

"Young Master Qin, whatever the cost, as long as you can cure this bloodline poison, I will give you anything within my power."

Qin Jiang shook his head. "I don't need anything from you. It's just that the method may be... difficult for you to accept."

"What do you need?"

"Bloodline poisons have always been the hardest to cure. Yours has had time to fuse with your bloodline itself—conventional methods, even immortal-grade elixirs, likely won't work."

Yu Lan's expression darkened. She knew the severity of her situation. If she'd been able to address the poison immediately, she could have expelled it herself. But the rival bloodline's attack had come at the worst moment, leaving her no time. Days of hiding and running had only made things worse.

She looked at Qin Jiang cautiously. "You said you can cure this poison. What... would it cost?"

"Conventional methods won't work. But..."

He seemed to wrestle with himself.

"Please speak freely, Young Master Qin."

He nodded, drew a breath, and began. "I possess a special physique—the Taotie Divine Body. It can devour anything, including toxins, and refine them into pure energy. If I activate it, I can draw every trace of poison from your bloodline. The problem is, it requires extremely precise control. One mistake, and I could devour your bloodline along with the poison. That level of precision demands... extremely intimate contact."
