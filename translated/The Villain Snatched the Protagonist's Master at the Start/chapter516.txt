Taking the treasure, the middle-aged man's eyes lit up. He couldn't tell it was an Immortal King artifact just by looking, but his Pixiu senses told him it was no ordinary object. Licking his lips, he swallowed it whole without a moment's hesitation—before Wu Tian could change his mind.

After gulping down the Immortal King artifact, the middle-aged man looked at Wu Tian again. "Got any more?"

Wu Tian's expression froze. This Pixiu was insatiable. One Immortal King artifact had already been painful enough to part with, and this fellow wanted more?

He rolled his eyes. "Do you even know what you just ate? That was an Immortal King artifact. You think treasures of that caliber grow on trees?"

He'd given the treasure away, so naturally he needed the recipient to understand its value. Otherwise, what was the point?

Sure enough, hearing "Immortal King artifact," the middle-aged man's eyes went wide. "An Immortal King artifact?"

"What did you think?"

"That piece of junk was an Immortal King artifact?" The man's face was pure disbelief. Though it had felt quite good going down, he needed to play it cool. Denial was the name of the game.

"It really is an Immortal King artifact," Wu Tian explained. "Severely damaged, yes, but it could still be repaired."

On the surface, it didn't look like much. But with a Pixiu's senses, the man had certainly felt its value—otherwise he wouldn't have swallowed it without the slightest hesitation. This fellow was trying to lowball him!

"Severely damaged? Then it barely qualifies as an Immortal King artifact," the middle-aged man said dismissively. "At most, it's a fragment of one."

From Wu Tian's attitude, he could tell the man clearly wanted him to follow along. This was the perfect time to play hard to get—string him along a bit.

Wu Tian rolled his eyes, not wanting to argue further. As long as this Pixiu knew the truth in his heart, that was enough. He still needed to focus on healing, and there was plenty of time. He'd find opportunities later to build their relationship and earn the creature's loyalty.

For now, given his condition, it was best not to reveal too much.

Just like that, Wu Tian settled in temporarily. Meanwhile, in a certain city...

Nangong Yun's ordeal made Wu Tian's situation look like a vacation.

Some time ago, Nangong Yun had been stripped of everything he owned. He'd even been physically transformed into a woman. He'd thought that after all this torment, the Zhou family's powerhouses might finally let him go.

He was wrong. The real torment had only just begun.

After his transformation, the Zhou family's men had brought him to a city and deposited him directly into a brothel. That had been over ten days ago, and he'd been receiving clients every single day without a moment's rest.

Right now, Nangong Yun gritted his teeth, face streaked with tears and humiliation. His fists were clenched tight, his mind burning with a singular conviction—revenge. That conviction was all that had kept him going.

After a long while, the man behind Nangong Yun let out a satisfied sigh and sat off to the side. Nangong Yun collapsed in exhaustion, barely managing to prop himself up halfway to look at the man.

This one was a regular—came almost every day. Quite fond of him, in fact. Over the past few days, the man had even mentioned taking him away from the brothel. The Zhou family's involvement had scared him off at first, but Nangong Yun's persistent efforts had begun to sway him.

"Little Yun, you really are something else, but the Zhou family..." The man gazed at Nangong Yun with pity, reaching out to stroke his cheek. He truly wanted to take him away.

Tears glistened in Nangong Yun's eyes. He grasped the hand on his cheek. "Brother Jie, please take me away. I'm begging you."

Being taken by Brother Jie would still mean enduring certain things, but one person's attentions were far better than a crowd's. And Brother Jie seemed to have considerable influence. He could use his charms to manipulate Brother Jie into helping him take revenge.

"Brother Jie~"

Nangong Yun's expression stirred something tender in Brother Jie. He fell silent for a moment, took a deep breath, and his gaze gradually hardened with resolve. "I'll see what I can do."

"Really?"

"Sigh. I'm only doing this for you. Otherwise, I really wouldn't want to cross the Zhou family."

"Brother Jie, we can sneak away. The Zhou family won't even know it was you who rescued me."

"Let's hope so." Brother Jie sighed, pinching Nangong Yun's cheek. "Give me a few days to prepare. You'll need to hang on until then."

"Alright. Thank you, Brother Jie."

Nangong Yun's face flooded with gratitude. Then, gritting his teeth, he turned around. "Brother Jie, let me thank you properly."

"Heh, well aren't you sweet," Brother Jie chuckled.

(The author skipped the details—too unpleasant.)

About an hour later, Brother Jie held Nangong Yun in his arms, tilting his chin up. "Sweetheart, wait for me. I'll get you out of here."

"Mm, okay~" Nangong Yun nodded, his voice barely a whisper.

Seeing how weak he looked, Brother Jie was overcome with sympathy. "I'll come for you as soon as I can. Until then, I'm sorry you'll have to suffer a bit longer."

"It's fine. I can endure it."

A pale smile tugged at the corners of Nangong Yun's ashen face, making Brother Jie's heart ache even more. He took a deep breath, lowered his head, and pressed a firm kiss to Nangong Yun's lips.

Nangong Yun's eyes went wide, his fists clenching. In the end, he could only close his eyes and endure it, a single tear sliding down his cheek.

After a long moment, Brother Jie raised his head and released him, his expression earnest. "I'm going to prepare now. Wait for me!"

"Brother Jie~" Nangong Yun's face was full of reluctance. Once Brother Jie left, he'd have to keep receiving clients. Compared to Brother Jie's gentleness, the others were... truly hard to bear.

"Wait for me!" Brother Jie said firmly. Though he was reluctant to part, for the sake of their future together, he turned and left.

Before long, a burly brute of a man walked in. Seeing him, a bitter smile crossed Nangong Yun's face.

"Please give me a moment to freshen up," Nangong Yun said.

This brief tidying time was one of his rare moments of respite—a chance to stall. But the brute strode right up, scooped Nangong Yun into his arms, and laughed heartily. "No need for that! I like a road that's already been traveled—easier going."

"Sir, you..." Nangong Yun's expression shifted.

Everyone who came for him was a deviant to some degree. He was used to it by now. With a sigh, Nangong Yun could only cooperate. The alternative was far worse—he never wanted to experience being surrounded by a room full of men again.
