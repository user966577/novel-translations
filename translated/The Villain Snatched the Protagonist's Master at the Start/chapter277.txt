Watching the scene, Qin Jiang's face twitched. A phantom chill crept through his lower half.

Qing Chan, meanwhile, flicked her wrist and sent both men flying into the distance. Only then did she turn around, beaming with satisfaction. She looked at Qin Jiang and smiled. "That was a fitting lesson, don't you think? From now on, they'll never be able to prey on anyone again."

Qin Jiang coughed dryly and nodded. Thank heavens Qing Chan was his wife—she'd never do that to him. Otherwise, that particular ability of hers would be genuinely terrifying.

Walking back to Qin Jiang's side, Qing Chan also took notice of the woman in white, examining her up and down. There was something vaguely familiar about her, though she couldn't quite place it. "Have we met before, little sister?" she asked.

The woman in white blinked and shook her head. "I don't think so. This is my first time away from home, so we definitely haven't met... sister." That last word came out with palpable reluctance.

After another careful look, Qing Chan shook her head inwardly. She must have been mistaken. Still, she glanced at Qin Jiang. A girl this beautiful—he wouldn't let her get away, would he? Especially one they'd just rescued. All the more reason to claim her before someone else did.

The other women were clearly thinking the same thing. Knowing Qin Jiang, this girl was destined to become one of their sisters. They crowded around her, all warmth and intimacy, one "little sister" after another.

The woman in white's fists clenched beneath her sleeves. Little sister? With this youthful disguise, apparently any woman on the street could call her that. She could accept it from Qing Chan—they were both True Immortals, so "elder sister" was tolerable. But from these women, who were all her juniors? The word "sister" simply would not leave her throat.

Finally, unable to bear it any longer, she made an excuse and left.

Watching her retreating figure, the women looked at Qin Jiang with surprise. He'd actually let her walk away?

Far from the palace, the woman in white's expression turned stormy. Her subordinates trailed behind her in silence, not daring to speak. They'd suddenly realized their plan had a fatal flaw: the setup shouldn't have been "hero saves the beauty." It should have been "beauty saves the hero." As things stood, they were basically helping Qin Jiang tame their mistress. The irony made every last one of them wince.

When she finally stopped, they exchanged uneasy glances, heads lowered. She took a deep breath and said evenly, "Find those two men. You know what to do with them."

Relieved that she wasn't punishing them, the subordinates nodded hastily and scattered to hunt down Chen Qi'er and Chen Wuming.

The woman in white stood alone, gazing back toward the palace. Then she leaped up onto a tree branch, settling in where she could still just barely make out Qin Jiang in the distance. Resting her chin on one hand, her large eyes blinking softly, she murmured, "So there really are men that handsome."

Her cheeks flushed pink. Her pale calves swung gently beneath the branch. She'd become a bit shallow, hadn't she? Then again, confronted with a face like that, a little shallowness was only natural.

"No wonder Qing Chan made her move." She pursed her lips. Qing Chan was shallow, sure, but the woman had impeccable taste. After all these millennia without finding anyone who met her standards, she'd gone straight for the best.

If only she'd acted sooner herself. Back when Qin Jiang had been in the Chaos District, she'd had the home advantage. But she hadn't paid attention then, and Qing Chan had beaten her to it.

The thought filled her with regret. If she'd made her move first, Qin Jiang would belong to her alone. She could have locked him away, kept him all to herself. But with Qing Chan in the picture, taking him by force would be difficult. And having him all to herself was out of the question.

She sighed and shook her head. "Forget it. Tame him first, worry about the rest later."

She hadn't yet realized that the plan her subordinates had drafted wasn't designed to tame Qin Jiang at all. At this rate, she was the one who was going to fall.

All she knew was that today's encounter had established a connection between them. The plan was on track!

"Time for the next step, right?" she muttered. "We've had our 'chance meeting,' we've been introduced. Next should be... deepening the relationship. A little flirtation."

She pulled out a written plan and studied it seriously. The "hero saves beauty" objective could be considered complete. Beyond that, there were options like feigning an injury to appear vulnerable—the kind of thing that triggered a man's protective instincts.

"Fake an injury?" She considered this, nodding to herself. She should have done that earlier, but the missed opportunity wasn't fatal. There would be other chances.

She tucked the plan away, her eyes blazing with resolve as she looked toward Qin Jiang. "Qin Jiang, just you wait. I will tame you!"

Back at the palace, Qing Chan spoke up. "Qin Jiang, something about that woman felt off."

Though she couldn't pinpoint the source of that nagging familiarity, her instincts told her something wasn't right. Better to give Qin Jiang a heads-up.

He nodded. "I noticed. She's here for me."

"Hm?"

"The way she looked at me was off," he said matter-of-factly. He turned to Qing Chan. "Just like when you first saw me. Like she wanted to devour me whole."

Qing Chan's face reddened. She shot him a look. He made it sound like she was some kind of predator.

She huffed. "Regardless, be careful. I don't want to become a widow."

"Hehe, don't worry, Chan'er. I'll make sure you're never lonely."

He pulled her close with a grin. The other women chimed in with their own warnings to be careful. They couldn't bear the thought of anything happening to him.

Surrounded by his women, they returned to the palace, where he set about reassuring each of them with action. He paid special attention to Baizhe. He was pleased with how she'd handled things, though he knew she wasn't as unaffected as she appeared. After all, she'd waited tens of thousands of years for Chen Qi'er.

But it was clear that the man she'd waited all those years for had fallen far behind Qin Jiang in her heart. Every time she'd had to choose, she'd chosen him without a moment's hesitation.

Curled up in Qin Jiang's arms, Baizhe's cheeks were flushed. She gave him a petulant look. "You're so mean. All you ever do is bully me."

"Bully?" He held her tighter, leaning down to kiss the tip of her nose, pinching her cheek gently. "I specifically carved out time to spend with you. If little Baizhe doesn't want it, I can give it to someone else?"

"No!" she said instantly.

"Then don't say I'm bullying you."

"I don't want it right now, but you can't give it to anyone else either. Save it for when I do want it." She wrapped her arms around him, chin resting against his chest, eyes wide and pleading. "Deal?"

"Deal."
