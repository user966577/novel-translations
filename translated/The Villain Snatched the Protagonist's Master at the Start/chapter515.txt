Wu Tian's expression stiffened. He hadn't expected his casual excuse to be so useless, and the girl actually had a husband? Looking at her, she seemed so young and innocent, practically underage. He truly hadn't imagined she was already married.

Under the middle-aged man's enthusiasm, Wu Tian resigned himself to staying. The man was unreliable, but at least he was alive. And this location was quite well hidden—staying here was relatively safe.

"Ahem, the thing is..." The middle-aged man coughed awkwardly. "There's no spare room for you here, so if you're staying, you'll have to sleep in the vegetable garden."

Wu Tian rolled his eyes. The man had insisted he stay, and now there wasn't even a room for him? He glanced over the garden—it was clean enough—and nodded. "I'll stay here."

He'd already spent days in this garden anyway. A few more wouldn't kill him. In his previous life, he'd reached the Immortal Emperor realm. What hardships hadn't he endured along the way? It was just a vegetable garden. Besides, his injuries still needed moonlight to heal, and the garden had nothing blocking the sky—perfect for his recovery.

Hearing Wu Tian agree, the middle-aged man rubbed his hands together and pressed on. "So, about what you said before—that you're from the Wu family, and once you recover, you'd repay me. Does that still count?"

Repay? Wu Tian looked at the man. This fellow had some nerve. He'd buried Wu Tian three times and still expected a reward? Not pursuing the matter was already generous enough. As for repayment...

"Once my injuries heal, I'll give you something in return," Wu Tian said.

He couldn't afford to make waves while still recovering. Best to play it safe and avoid capsizing in the gutter. Once he recovered, this fellow could be repaid by being made his servant. That would be reward enough.

He was an Immortal Emperor! In his previous life, he didn't take servants lightly. Being chosen to serve him was already a tremendous opportunity in itself. This fellow was lucky—he'd helped Wu Tian in his hour of need, so the requirements for servanthood could be lowered somewhat.

Though Wu Tian kept a low profile, deep down, his pride remained intact.

While he was lost in thought, the middle-aged man spoke up sheepishly. "Could I maybe get a little something in advance?"

"Hm?" Wu Tian frowned.

"Anything's fine, really," the man said hastily. "As long as it's a treasure, I'll take whatever you've got."

"Anything? What do you want it for?"

"To eat!"

Now that he had Qin Jiang backing him, the middle-aged man didn't care about revealing his identity as a Pixiu. Besides, his mission was to stay by Wu Tian's side and torment him constantly. If he didn't show some value, Wu Tian would likely leave within days, and there'd be no way to keep following him. After careful deliberation, the middle-aged man decided to reveal his true nature.

"Eat?" Wu Tian blinked.

The middle-aged man nodded, patting his belly. "I'm a Pixiu. What's wrong with eating treasures?"

"You're a Pixiu?" Wu Tian's eyes lit up.

He stared at the middle-aged man in astonishment, looking him up and down as a surge of pleasant surprise welled up inside him. There were still Pixiu in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, and he'd stumbled right into one! This was incredible—an Auspicious Beast! If handled properly, it could aid his return to his former peak.

"You're really a Pixiu?" If he weren't injured, he could channel his past life's power and see through to the man's true form. But he'd been severely wounded, and using his past life's power had caused a backlash. Unless it was absolutely critical, he shouldn't draw on it again.

Under Wu Tian's skeptical gaze, a flash of pride crossed the middle-aged man's face. The Pixiu were a noble race. If not for his wife's death and his daughter's youth, he would never have holed up in this backwater.

"That's right! I am a Pixiu!" he declared.

Above his head, a spectral Pixiu image materialized, fixing Wu Tian with the same haughty stare as its master.

"Now do you believe me?" the man said smugly.

Wu Tian nodded. His expression was no longer one of annoyance or disdain—this Auspicious Beast was a real treasure. A bit eccentric and unreliable, perhaps, but still an Auspicious Beast. He had to find a way to keep this creature by his side. He absolutely couldn't let this opportunity slip away.

Wu Tian's gaze softened. "I didn't expect you to be a Pixiu—one of heaven and earth's Auspicious Beasts. But how did a Pixiu end up in a place like this?"

A Pixiu of all creatures shouldn't be languishing in some forgotten corner. There had to be a story behind it, and where there was a story, there was leverage.

Wu Tian watched the man's expression carefully. Sure enough, the man's eyes dimmed slightly. But he didn't elaborate—just glared at Wu Tian and snapped, "I like it here. Got a problem with that?"

"Heh. How unique of you," Wu Tian said with a faint smile.

Given a Pixiu's pride, it wouldn't easily reveal its scars. But Wu Tian wasn't in a rush. His injuries would take at least several months to heal—there was plenty of time to build a rapport with this Pixiu. As for the story behind it all, he'd learn it eventually.

Just then, the middle-aged man spoke again, his tone tinged with irritation. "Do you actually have any treasures? Looking at you, don't tell me you're not really from the Wu family."

"Treasures, you say..." Wu Tian smiled faintly.

True, he was quite poor. The Wu family had confiscated most of his cultivation resources, and he'd used another portion to bribe Huaxia Branch Office guards. But as a Child of Destiny, he still had treasures on him—each one extraordinary.

Letting the middle-aged man eat them would pain him greatly, but for the long game, Wu Tian gritted his teeth and produced a treasure. It looked plain and unremarkable, even somewhat damaged. But Wu Tian knew it was an Immortal King artifact—just badly damaged. He'd found it by chance before his awakening. Afterward, he'd recognized its extraordinary nature and planned to repair it someday for his own use.

But now, for the sake of this Pixiu, he had no choice but to part with it. Compared to what he stood to gain, it was worth it.

He handed the artifact over. Though it pained him, his expression remained calm and collected. "Will this suffice as repayment?"
