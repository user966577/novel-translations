Myriad Demon Forest.

Shortly after Qin Jiang's departure, a limping figure appeared in the stone chamber.

"Qin Jiang... Ye Ling'er... just you wait!"

The voice seethed with hatred.

Xiao Fan, naturally.

Black Dragon's toss had sent him tumbling off the mountainside. A tree snagged him partway down—the only thing that saved his life.

But he'd suffered badly. Broken bones, deep bruises.

He'd rested for a long while before finally spotting Qin Jiang's group flying away. Still unwilling to accept his loss, he dragged himself back up the mountain and into the cave.

The moment he entered the stone chamber, a wave of fiery energy hit him. He inhaled deeply, pure bliss crossing his face.

This was the Fire Divine Body's ideal environment.

Better still, the chamber was lined with herbs—all fire-attribute.

"Qin Jiang didn't take everything?"

Xiao Fan was stunned.

He hurried forward, examining each herb with growing excitement. Then he noticed the empty patches where herbs had been uprooted, and his expression darkened.

"He probably left whatever he thought was beneath him. Damn it—the ones he took must have been far more valuable!"

His fists clenched, brimming with resentment.

He took a steadying breath and forced a cold laugh.

"Qin Jiang never imagined I'd come back. These herbs may be his rejects, but in my hands, they'll yield ten times their worth!

"Heh. Just wait, Qin Jiang. I will have my revenge.

"And Ye Ling'er—betraying me like that. One day, I'll make you beg on your knees..."

He raged for a while, venting his frustration.

When calm finally returned, he looked at the herbs and muttered:

"I need to move fast. Qin Jiang might come back."

The thought of Qin Jiang sent an involuntary shiver through him. Without realizing it, fear had taken root.

He didn't dare linger. He began harvesting immediately.

He worked through most of the night, collecting every last herb. Then he paused at the pool in the chamber's center, frowning. Something felt off—as though something important had been taken from this place.

He crouched and touched the water. Ice cold now. Nothing unusual.

Shaking his head, he slipped away without a trace.

Azure City Town.

Qin Jiang and Ye Ling'er...

Elsewhere, Xiao Fan had put considerable distance between himself and the treasure trove, finding a hidden cave far from the mountain.

He excitedly laid out his herbs. Fire-attribute energy washed over him, and he closed his eyes in satisfaction.

"These herbs are practically made for me."

He murmured, then scowled.

"If not for Qin Jiang, I'd have gotten more. The ones he took must have been far more precious. Damn him!

"This is all Qin Jiang's fault!"

His hatred burned hotter than ever.

After composing himself, he studied the herbs before him. Flames ignited across his body, engulfing a single herb.

Visibly, the herb unfurled, its potency seeming to multiply. Then, at some critical threshold, it dissolved into pure energy that scattered through the flames.

As the herb vanished, Xiao Fan recalled his fire.

"That felt incredible!

"This cultivation method is amazing!"

Joy broke across his face. A single herb had advanced his cultivation by as much as half a month of hard training.

"More. I need more—this kind of power is nothing compared to Qin Jiang!"

He took a deep breath and pulled out ten herbs at once. He didn't care about building a stable foundation right now. He just wanted to surpass Qin Jiang as fast as possible.

"Keep refining!"

All ten herbs were enveloped in flame simultaneously. Xiao Fan's face paled slightly, the firelight giving him a sinister look.

Torrential energy flooded into his body—almost more than it could handle. Cracks appeared on his skin under the onslaught.

But he gritted his teeth and pressed on, refining the power through sheer will.

As more energy was absorbed, he began to relax. But then—

Just when he thought he'd succeeded, an extreme cold erupted inside him. In an instant, it spread through his entire body.

"Cold qi?

"How can there be cold qi inside me?"

Xiao Fan's eyes went wide.

He possessed the Fire Divine Body—a constitution of supreme heat and purity. What kind of cold energy could possibly infiltrate him?

His face went ashen. The invading chill threw his Fire Divine Body into turmoil. Combined with the unrefined energy still rampaging through his body, his internals descended into chaos.

"What the hell is happening?!"

He scrambled to respond. The Fire Divine Body nearly went haywire, but it seemed to detect the threat and began fighting back on its own.

Sensing this, Xiao Fan breathed a partial sigh of relief. He temporarily ignored the cold qi and focused on refining the remaining wild energy, channeling it to fuel his Divine Body's counterattack.

But then he realized—with each herb he refined, the cold qi intensified.

"No... the cold qi..."

Horror dawned on his face.

"It's coming from the herbs!"

"It was Qin Jiang—Qin Jiang did this! He left the herbs on purpose to sabotage me!

"And Ye Ling'er must have helped plan it. Only she would know me well enough to predict I'd come back. This is her doing—that treacherous—!"

Xiao Fan's face contorted, sanity slipping.

The physical agony and the mental anguish were pushing him to the breaking point.

As his condition worsened, the Fire Divine Body erupted at full force, as though attempting a scorched-earth purge. An explosive blaze engulfed Xiao Fan entirely.

Burning away the cold qi.

And burning Xiao Fan along with it.
