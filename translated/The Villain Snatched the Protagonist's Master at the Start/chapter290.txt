The day after Liu Shuwan's arrival, Xue Mei found her way to them as well.

Months apart meant a warm reunion, naturally. Qin Jiang was particularly fond of this mature beauty—just holding her was bliss. When Xue Mei was around, he liked to use her as a living pillow. Soft, warm, and fragrant. Perfect.

That night, he spent the evening with both Liu Shuwan and Xue Mei. Once they were satisfied, the real business began: delivering messages from the women back home.

Liu Shuwan had the most to share, having brought an entire recording crystal from the others. One after another, the women appeared in the projection, making no attempt to hide how much they missed him. This one wanted him, that one was feeling restless...

It was a test of willpower.

An Xihe was in seclusion, though, so Qin Jiang couldn't leave. Otherwise, he'd have flown straight back to the Western Regions. But it wouldn't be much longer.

Looking at all those enticing faces, Qin Jiang licked his lips. When this was over, he was going to push himself to the absolute limit.

After the recording crystal, Xue Mei spoke up. "Yu Lan and Yu Ru miss you too. But they were worried they'd be a burden, so they stayed behind. They sent me to help instead."

Knowing both women were thinking of him warmed his heart. He thought of their faces and smiled. "Once this is over, I'll visit the Demon Domain."

These next few weeks would bring upheaval to Azure Cloud Heaven. At the very least, if any True Immortals interfered with An Xihe's breakthrough, Qin Jiang wouldn't hold back. True Immortals dying would be major news. And even without casualties, once An Xihe reached Immortal King, all of Azure Cloud Heaven would answer to her. An Immortal King could crush True Immortals with ease.

The entire realm might be unified under one banner—with An Xihe as its queen, and Qin Jiang as the man behind the throne. Azure Cloud Heaven's supreme authority.

At that point, the Snake Race would be under his protection, freeing Yu Lan from her responsibilities. Same for Xue Mei and the Celestial Rabbit Tribe. He'd gather every last one of his women at his side. Whichever he fancied on any given day—just thinking about it made him happy.

"When that time comes, I'll go back with you," Xue Mei said, resting her head on his shoulder.

"Deal."

"Oh—how's Xiao Jiu doing?"

Xue Mei tilted her head up. When Qin Jiang had left the Demon Domain, he'd taken Xiao Jiu along. The Celestial Rabbit Tribe's hope—a bloodline reversion prodigy destined for the immortal path.

Qin Jiang blinked. It had been months, and he honestly had no idea how Xiao Jiu was doing. He looked at Liu Shuwan.

She shot him a look. Hmph—doesn't even keep track of his own women.

Turning to Xue Mei, she explained, "Xiao Jiu is still in the Western Regions. Her physique has fully adapted to her bloodline now, and she's been training intensely. All that suppressed potential seems to have erupted at once—her progress has been incredible. She's already broken through to Saint."

"Saint?" Xue Mei's eyes widened. She'd been at the Divine Ability Realm just months ago.

Liu Shuwan nodded, glancing at Qin Jiang with a smile. "This rascal built a Space-Time Temple in the Western Regions where time moves faster. At maximum output, one day outside equals three months inside. That's how Xiao Jiu advanced so quickly."

"A Space-Time Temple?" Xue Mei looked at Qin Jiang. A time-altering treasure was extraordinarily rare—and he could build one?

"What? Don't believe in your man?" He raised an eyebrow, then flicked his wrist. A hazy aura of power enveloped them.

Xue Mei's eyes widened. "Space-time energy?"

"That's right." Qin Jiang preened. "Your man has comprehended the Space-Time Law."

Xue Mei's lips parted in shock. Comprehending a law before even reaching Great Emperor was already extraordinary—but the Space-Time Law? That was on another level entirely. This young man of hers was really something.

Seeing her awestruck expression only inflated his ego further. Showing off for his own women was immensely satisfying.

The space-time energy faded, and Qin Jiang pulled Xue Mei close again, his hand sliding along her waist. "When this is all over, we'll head back to the Demon Domain, pick up everyone, then take you to the Western Regions to experience the Space-Time Temple."

"But the Celestial Rabbit Tribe..."

"Relax. I've got it covered. Those little bunnies will be just fine."

"Mm." She leaned into him, trusting without reservation.

After learning about Xiao Jiu's progress, curiosity got the better of her. "So how did you comprehend the Space-Time Law, anyway?"

"..."

Qin Jiang blinked. Comprehend? He'd just cheated the system. If he'd had to do it on his own, the Space-Time Law would have been way beyond him. The most likely candidate for genuine comprehension would have been the Yin-Yang Law.

That thought stirred something. When he broke through to Great Emperor, should he try for the Yin-Yang Law as well? It was said to have potent synergistic effects—and while he was already formidable, a little extra never hurt. Plus, the Yin-Yang Law could enhance his women's cultivation. Whether he could actually comprehend it was uncertain. Best-case scenario, the system would throw him another freebie.

"Qin Jiang?" Xue Mei tugged at his sleeve. The two Celestial Rabbit pets she'd brought along were hopping about freely, and the sight made Qin Jiang a bit... peckish. He swallowed hard.

"Oh, it was simple, really," he finally answered. "I just decided I wanted to comprehend the Space-Time Law, and then... I did."

"???"

Both Liu Shuwan and Xue Mei stared at him, then rolled their eyes in unison. Making the comprehension of one of the most profound laws in existence sound like eating breakfast. No wonder people thought he was insufferable.

Liu Shuwan, at least, had some insight into the truth. Qin Jiang's actual cultivation time was laughably short. It was entirely possible the Space-Time Law had come to him exactly the way he described—effortlessly. That was simply talent. Enviable, infuriating talent.

But it still grated. Liu Shuwan had spent thousands of years in Sword Valley, enduring unimaginable hardship, and had ultimately needed Qin Jiang's help to achieve Sword Heart. Xue Mei's tireless efforts to strengthen the Celestial Rabbit Tribe were no less grueling. And here was this man, yawning about cosmic laws like they were afternoon naps.

They exchanged a look, jaws set, then turned to Qin Jiang in unison.

And pounced.

If they couldn't match his talent, they'd wring every last drop out of him. A thorough wringing.

Of course, from Qin Jiang's perspective, being wrung out was pure reward. And afterward, they'd make it up to him too—spoiling him like a baby, indulging his every whim.

His only thought: 'More, please. I can handle it!'
