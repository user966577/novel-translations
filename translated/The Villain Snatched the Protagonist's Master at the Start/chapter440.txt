Xue Yue arrived at Qin Jiang's still fuming. The moment she saw him, she threw herself into his arms.

He caught her, sensed something was off, and stroked her hair. "What's wrong? Who upset my Yueyue?"

She nuzzled against his chest, then looked up, arms around his neck, lips pouting. "Kiss me."

"Coming right up." He leaned down and kissed her softly. She kissed back like she wanted to swallow him whole.

When they finally separated, she rested her head on his chest, cheeks flushed. She felt better already. After a moment, she looked up. "Nangong Yun came to see me."

"Oh? He's the one who upset you?"

"Not really." She wrinkled her nose. "He's just disgusting. Truly disgusting." She told him the whole story — the request for her to become Qin Jiang's woman to share Weiwei's "burden," the compensation offer.

Qin Jiang was quietly impressed. 'The Child of Destiny figured out how to lighten Weiwei's load — by sending me another woman. I couldn't have come up with that idea if I'd tried for a lifetime. Genius.'

He kissed her forehead. "So you said yes?"

"I was already your woman! It had nothing to do with him." She squirmed against him petulantly.

He kissed her again. "There, there — I misspoke."

"One more."

He pecked her cheek. She tapped her lips. "Here."

But one kiss led to another, and before long her face was flushed and her gaze was locked on him. All her bad mood had evaporated.

"Husband, I want to... is that okay?"

"Can you handle it?"

She hesitated, then nodded. "I can."

"Then so can I."

She kissed his throat, then her eyes went wide as she felt his response. "Still okay?" she asked shyly.

"Yueyue's quite talented." He grinned.

"Hmph! Obviously!" She raised a fist in front of his face. "Someday when I'm stronger, I'll beat you."

"That confident?"

"Absolutely!"

He chuckled at her bravado. "How about showing me what you've got right now?"

She charged forward without fear — and was thoroughly outmatched. He pinched her cheek and shook his head. "All bark and no bite. Even worse than Weiwei."

"I — my skills will improve!" she protested.

"I look forward to it. Want to keep going?"

She bit her lip, then nodded stubbornly. "I can do this!"

Another two hours. He held her close, kissed her, and whispered, "Like it?"

"Mm. I like it."
