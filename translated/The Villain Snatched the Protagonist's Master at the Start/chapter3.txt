As his words fell, Xiao Fan's face went blank.

The next moment, Black Dragon let out a sinister laugh. A terrifying pressure bore down on everyone in the Xiao family.

The crushing force drove them all to the ground.

Only Xiao Fan remained standing—Black Dragon had deliberately spared him from the pressure.

So he could witness the Xiao family's current state with his own eyes.

"Stop!"

Xiao Fan's eyes nearly split open with rage.

But his body was locked in place, unable to move an inch.

"If you choose the engagement, you'll soar to greatness from this day forward. My Qin family will raise you as one of our own. But the Xiao family will cease to exist. Of course, you can also choose your family—but then this engagement will naturally be void."

Qin Jiang's cold voice reached Xiao Fan's ears.

His whole body trembled. His eyes were bloodshot, filled with a sense of powerlessness.

"Strength... I need strength!"

Xiao Fan roared internally.

In this moment, his desire for power reached unprecedented heights.

"Make your choice."

Xiao Fan raised his head, his eyes filled with hatred. But Qin Jiang acted as if he didn't notice.

An ant in the palm of one's hand—no matter how hard it struggled, it couldn't escape. Qin Jiang simply wanted to squeeze every last drop of value from Xiao Fan.

"Spare the Xiao family. This engagement...

"I'm willing to dissolve it."

Xiao Fan's voice was exhausted.

Those few words seemed to drain all his strength.

Qin Jiang chuckled softly and waved his arm. Black Dragon withdrew his pressure.

Only then did Xiao Fan and the others shakily rise to their feet.

Black Dragon's power had pushed their fear to the extreme.

Under that pressure, their lives had been completely in his hands. It felt like he could snuff them out with a single thought.

Terrifying.

"A wise choice. However..."

Qin Jiang's tone shifted.

"There was still an engagement between us. It has caused no small damage to my sister's reputation. Therefore, the Xiao family must compensate for that reputational harm."

In the original plot, he and Qin Lian'er were supposed to bring treasures to soothe the Xiao family's anger over the broken engagement. But...

Would the Qin family, with their power, care about angering a small family like the Xiaos?

What a joke!

So not only did Qin Jiang have no intention of soothing their anger—he was demanding compensation instead.

Qin Lian'er stood obediently by Qin Jiang's side, letting him handle everything.

The Xiao family members' expressions turned ugly at his words.

Compensation?

The mighty young master of the Qin family had actually come to their tiny clan demanding compensation!

How absurd was that?

Xiao An sighed. Looking at Qin Jiang, he asked respectfully, "What manner of compensation does my lord desire?"

Since Qin Jiang had brought it up, the Xiao family would have to provide something. Besides, the other party probably already knew exactly what he wanted.

Xiao An had already figured it out. No matter what, the most important thing today was to send Qin Jiang away. Only then could the Xiao family survive. Thinking of this, bitterness welled up in his heart.

Who could have imagined that an engagement from years ago would become a death sentence?

That engagement had been purchased with his father's life, along with the lives of the Xiao family's strongest warriors.

But there was nothing to be done. The Xiao family was simply too weak.

When others held the knife, you were just meat on the cutting board.

You could only let yourself be slaughtered.

"I want only two things."

Qin Jiang extended his hand, pointing at Xiao Fan. His gaze locked onto the ring on Xiao Fan's left hand.

"His ring. It's mine now."

"Impossible!"

Xiao Fan immediately roared in fury.

"This ring is the only memento my mother left me! I will never give it to you!"

Qin Jiang sneered. This Xiao Fan still hadn't grasped the situation.

"In that case, how about I kill your father and let him leave you a memento in exchange for your ring?"

Xiao Fan: "..."

Xiao An: "???"

"Again, two choices. Pick one."

Qin Jiang said casually.

Xiao Fan cursed internally. Was this even a choice? Refuse and he'd kill his father. This guy was truly...

"Fan'er..."

Xiao An looked at Xiao Fan. Although the ring had belonged to his wife, surely it wasn't worth more than his own life?

Xiao Fan understood his father's meaning. He slowly removed the ring, his heart full of reluctance. Deep down, he felt this ring was somehow incredibly important to him.

But thinking of his father, Xiao Fan gritted his teeth.

However, just at that moment—

"Wait!"

A sharp cry came from within the Xiao estate. The next instant, a beautiful young girl appeared beside Xiao Fan.

"Brother Xiao Fan, are you alright?"

Her beautiful eyes were filled with concern. Seeing the swelling on Xiao Fan's face, her heart ached.

Xiao Fan forced a smile. "Ling'er, I'm fine."

Xiao Ling'er—Xiao Fan's childhood friend. His talent was abysmal, and no one in the Xiao family wanted anything to do with him. Only Xiao Ling'er had always stayed by his side.

Moreover, Xiao Ling'er had been found and brought back by Xiao An. She had no blood relation to him whatsoever. So deep in his heart, Xiao Fan harbored feelings for Xiao Ling'er that went beyond those of siblings.

It was just that his worthless talent filled him with self-loathing.

Especially since, compared to Xiao Fan, Xiao Ling'er was like a phoenix soaring in the highest heavens. She was the white moonlight in the hearts of all the younger generation in the Xiao family.

Talent, beauty, personality—all exceptional.

Xiao Ling'er looked at Xiao Fan, her pale hands clenching tight. She raised her head and glared at Qin Jiang.

"The Qin family has gone too far!"

Qin Jiang completely ignored her outburst.

"The second thing I want is her—Xiao Ling'er!"

"You!"

Xiao Ling'er's beautiful eyes went wide, her pretty face filled with rage. This bastard was treating her like an object?

Xiao Fan was even more furious.

Xiao Ling'er held an irreplaceable place in his heart. Even his own father might not rank higher than her.

"Impossible! Don't even think about it!"

Xiao Fan bellowed.

Anger flashed through Xiao An's eyes as well. Resources, treasures—he could give those. But a person...

"You don't have a choice."

Qin Jiang smiled faintly.

Xiao Ling'er took a deep breath. Surprisingly, a smile appeared on her pretty face.

"No choice?

"Do you have any idea who I am?"

As she spoke, her voice filled with pride. But inwardly, she sighed softly. After this, she probably wouldn't be able to stay with the Xiao family anymore.

"Of course I do."

Qin Jiang nodded and said calmly, "Xiao Ling'er—or should I call you Ye Ling'er?"

At these words, shock filled Xiao Ling'er's beautiful eyes. Qin Jiang actually knew her true identity!

Even she herself had only learned of it recently.

Qin Jiang continued, "Thirteen years ago, there was a succession of patriarchs in the Ye family. The previous patriarch chose the second son of the Ye family. This enraged the eldest son, leading to internal strife between the two brothers that threw the Ye family into chaos.

"You, Ye Ling'er, were born during that time. Because of the conflict, your parents fell into danger and were forced to abandon you, leading the enemy away themselves in hopes you would survive.

"In the end, after much struggle, your father successfully became patriarch. But you had been picked up by Xiao An. A princess of a great clan, fallen from grace to become an ugly duckling..."
