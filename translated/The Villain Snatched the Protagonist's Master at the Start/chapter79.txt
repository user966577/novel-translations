Bai Jingyun and the others raised their heads in shock.

At first, Liu Shuwan's sudden anger had put them on edge, but then Qin Jiang's pet name for her... They noticed her hand clasped firmly in his, and their pupils contracted.

Being held like that in front of so many people made Liu Shuwan's cheeks flush faintly. The pressure weighing on the group vanished in an instant.

Seeing this, Qin Jiang smiled and addressed Bai Jingyun. "Uncle Bai, Wan'er was the sect's Saintess before—just keep calling her that."

"Oh. Right." They nodded rapidly, their minds a daze, as though they were dreaming.

Still in a fog, they followed Qin Jiang and the others away from Sword Valley.

After settling Liu Shuwan in, Qin Jiang headed out again to find Bai Jingyun. The sect's elders were gathered with him, and the moment Qin Jiang appeared, every pair of eyes locked onto him.

After a moment's hesitation, the Grand Elder couldn't help asking, "Holy Son, what exactly is your relationship with our ancestor?"

"You couldn't tell?" Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

The group fell silent. Of course they could tell—they just couldn't quite believe it.

Before anyone could speak, Qin Jiang continued, "And I told you—call Wan'er 'Saintess' from now on. If she gets upset, don't expect me to bail you out."

Though the elders were puzzled about why Liu Shuwan would be upset, they nodded. She'd clearly been furious when they called her "Ancestor."

"Anyway, Wan'er's situation is none of your concern. I came to talk about Sword Valley." Qin Jiang got straight to the point.

Their eyes lit up. Bai Jingyun couldn't contain himself. "The treasure inside—did you get it?"

"I did." Qin Jiang nodded. "But don't get your hopes up. Wan'er already used it. She's reached Sword Heart."

The room erupted in delight. Regardless of who had used it, the Holy Sword Sect finally had a Sword Emperor! But the joy barely had time to spread before they realized—given the Saintess's relationship with Qin Jiang, could she even be considered a member of the Holy Sword Sect anymore?

Qin Jiang certainly wouldn't stay at the Holy Sword Sect forever. The Saintess would likely follow him, which meant both Sword Emperors would end up with the Qin family. And the Holy Sword Sect would get nothing. In fact, they'd lost a great deal. The room fell silent.

"You're not happy?" Qin Jiang blinked.

Bai Jingyun and the others could only force weak laughs. Happy? How could they be happy? They'd lost a daughter, lost Sword Valley's treasure, and even the ancestor who'd used said treasure had been whisked away.

Of course, the sect had gained some prestige. At least on paper, Qin Jiang was still the Holy Son, and news of the Saintess's Sword Heart breakthrough could be publicized. Even if the Saintess would probably leave eventually...

On reflection, it wasn't a total loss. With that reputation, the Holy Sword Sect could develop rapidly and was already trending toward becoming a true swordsmanship holy land. Once word of the Saintess spread, it would be all but official.

Their expressions improved slightly.

"Oh, one more thing. Sword Valley's power came from that treasure, so now that Wan'er's used it, the valley will gradually... Well, you understand."

Another devastating blow.

Their faces went rigid. The mood that had just recovered plummeted again. Several elders nearly fainted on the spot.

"Sword Valley... is going to disappear?" Bai Jingyun's voice trembled.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Sword Valley was just the remnant of a past Sword Emperor. Trading it for a living, breathing Sword Emperor? The Holy Sword Sect comes out ahead."

'Comes out ahead?' Bai Jingyun stared at him. If the Saintess were staying, sure—that would be a fair trade. But Qin Jiang had stolen her away! The Holy Sword Sect was losing everything down to the floorboards.

Even the mild-tempered Grand Elder was visibly trembling. This was simply too much to bear.

Looking at Qin Jiang's carefree expression, Bai Jingyun felt dizzy. More than a little regretful, too. Why had he brought Qin Jiang to the Holy Sword Sect in the first place? One visit, and the sect had nothing left. His heart ached.

His face had gone pale. Right now, he just wanted Qin Jiang gone as quickly as possible. Otherwise, who knew what else the sect might lose? And speaking of which—his disciple and Qin Jiang didn't get along. If Qin Jiang stayed longer, he might go after Lin Chen. Lin Chen was the Holy Sword Sect's last hope. He couldn't afford any more damage.

Qin Jiang had to leave. Immediately.

With that resolve, Bai Jingyun forced a smile. "Xiao Jiang, you've been at our Holy Sword Sect for over a month now, haven't you?"

"Mm, about that. But I spent all that time in Sword Valley and never got to properly look around the sect, so I was thinking—"

"Ahem, Xiao Jiang, there's really nothing to see here. You've been away from home so long—the Qin family must be worried. Why not head back early?"

Qin Jiang looked at him. Trying to push him out? That wouldn't do. He'd been here all this time and hadn't even had a chance to get reacquainted with his buddy Lin Chen. He couldn't just leave like that.

"I'm planning to stay a while longer," Qin Jiang said flatly.

Bai Jingyun's smile strained, but he couldn't exactly refuse. No matter how you sliced it, Qin Jiang had the upper hand. He sighed inwardly and told himself to warn Lin Chen: don't provoke Qin Jiang.

"Fine. I've said what I needed to say. Handle the Sword Valley situation. I'm heading back."

With that, Qin Jiang turned and left. The elders watched his retreating figure, heartbroken, then turned as one toward Bai Jingyun. Their eyes carried a silent accusation: 'You're the one who brought him here!'

Bai Jingyun laughed bitterly. He'd foreseen that Qin Jiang could reach Sword Valley's depths. He'd anticipated the treasure being given to someone in the sect. He'd even planned to leverage Qin Jiang's fame. Originally, a single move that yielded three gains.

What he hadn't anticipated was Qin Jiang winning over their ancestor—and giving her the treasure.

Three gains had become three losses.

In the end, it was the Grand Elder who spoke. "Let it go. Even if the Holy Son and the Saintess eventually leave, they're technically still our people. We didn't really lose... not really..."

She was comforting the others as much as herself.

"Jingyun, handle the Sword Valley situation. Don't let it affect the disciples' morale. And go ahead and announce the Saintess's breakthrough. She truly is one of us, and her reputation will help us become a true swordsmanship holy land. This must be handled well."
