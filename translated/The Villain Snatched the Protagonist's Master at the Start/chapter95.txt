"Nine Great Emperor Laws!"

This time, the system had actually rewarded him with nine Great Emperor Laws. This was mass-producing Great Emperors. Nine laws meant nine potential Great Emperors.

"It's time to look beyond the Heavenly Mystery Continent," Qin Jiang murmured. With this many powerhouses, a single continent couldn't contain the Qin family's ambitions. Their vision needed to extend far beyond these borders.

"In that case, it's time to deal with Lin Chen, too. His body should be worth at least one Great Emperor Law." Lin Chen's primordial spirit likely contained a Great Emperor Law, and the Myriad Dao Stone from an earlier reward could forcibly extract it. Plus there would be system rewards on top of that—it should be a big haul.

The remaining rewards were middling, nothing to write home about. Qin Jiang felt a pang of regret. "Pity there's nothing from the immortal path."

Above the Nine Heavens, the immortal path surely existed. Without an immortal-level powerhouse anchoring the Qin family, Qin Jiang couldn't shake a nagging sense of vulnerability. His trump cards were still too few.

With a sigh, he checked his Villain Points—only a few million. His goal was ten million, enough to exchange for an immortal-level figure. Still a long way to go.

"Plenty of work ahead," he said to himself.

The simplest way to earn Villain Points was snatching Fortune Heroines. Every one was practically a jackpot.

He opened his eyes and turned to Chu Hanyan, thinking for a moment before asking, "Yan'er, does Chu Yuan have any childhood sweethearts?"

Chu Hanyan looked at him. She hadn't known Qin Jiang long, but she had a decent read on his character by now—enough to guess what he was getting at.

This man was truly shameless.

She shook her head. "No. Yuan'er has always been a loner. He's never been close with any girl."

"Shame."

Qin Jiang shook his head. The system spoilers hadn't revealed any romantic connections for Chu Yuan either. The only woman he regularly interacted with was Chu Hanyan.

Moving freely through the Fire Domain, Qin Jiang encountered nothing but deference. Virtually everyone recognized him, and no one dared show the slightest disrespect. As for Huo Qing'er, many Fire Tribe members felt she looked familiar but couldn't quite place her.

Walking through the Fire Tribe's grounds, Huo Qing'er observed that much of the layout remained as she remembered it, yet everything felt foreign now. Disciples kept bowing respectfully to Qin Jiang as they passed, and she couldn't help but comment: "Why does this place feel more like Qin family territory than actual Qin family territory?"

Back home, most Qin family disciples greeted Qin Jiang politely when they saw him, but if they were busy, it was perfectly normal for them to walk right past without acknowledgment. Qin Jiang was known to be domineering outside the family but easygoing within.

The Fire Tribe was a different story. Even if someone was in the middle of relieving themselves, they'd pinch it off and rush out to bow to Qin Jiang. No one wanted to risk his displeasure. In their eyes, he was the devil incarnate.

At that moment, Huo Lie was in the Fire Tribe's great hall, meeting with the elders, when the doors were kicked open. Fury flashed across every face—until they saw who it was. The anger vanished instantly, replaced by fawning smiles.

"Ah, Young Master Qin!" they greeted him with exaggerated respect.

Huo Lie was about to bow when his eyes fell on the woman at Qin Jiang's side. His pupils contracted. His body went rigid. Fear flickered in his gaze.

Three hundred years had passed, but he still remembered Huo Qing'er's face with perfect clarity.

"So you really didn't die," Huo Lie said through clenched teeth.

He'd scoured the entire Fire Domain without finding a trace of her. The Legacy Flame's backlash should have killed her—that was the most likely outcome. But deep down, he'd always felt she was alive. For three hundred years, he'd never stopped searching.

And indeed, she hadn't died. Worse, the man beside her was Qin Jiang.

It wasn't just Huo Lie. Several elders on the dais—his confidants, all complicit in what had happened—showed fear as well. The remaining elders, hearing Huo Lie's words, looked at Huo Qing'er with dawning recognition. A blurry memory took shape.

Finally, one elder's eyes went wide, his face breaking into joy. "The Saintess! You're the Saintess!"

His exclamation helped the others connect the dots. The shadowy image in their minds crystallized.

"Saintess, it really is you. You..."

Many of the uninvolved elders had once supported Huo Qing'er. After she'd accepted the Legacy Flame and mysteriously vanished, Huo Lie had announced that she'd perished from the flame's backlash, claiming she'd transferred the Legacy Flame to him in her final moments. Most elders had found the story suspicious, but when Huo Lie demonstrated the Legacy Flame, they'd held their tongues. For the sake of stability, they'd accepted him as clan leader.

Now, the Saintess who'd vanished three hundred years ago had returned. Countless thoughts swirled through the elders' minds.

Huo Qing'er ignored them all.

Qin Jiang turned his gaze on Huo Lie. The mighty Nine Tribulations Supreme couldn't suppress a shudder under that stare.

Qin Jiang smiled. "So—do you want to struggle a bit first?"
