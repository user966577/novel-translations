The pressure Chen Qi'er applied to Chen Changsheng was immense. With Qin Jiang watching from the shadows, there was no risk of Chen Changsheng actually dying.

For Children of Destiny, desperation bred potential. That potential might come at the cost of their future, but Qin Jiang couldn't care less. He only needed the Reincarnation Law to mature. Besides, Chen Changsheng wouldn't be around much longer. His future was irrelevant.

Under Chen Qi'er's relentless assault, the origin essences inside Chen Changsheng were being absorbed at an accelerating rate. His strength climbed steadily. But the gap between them was still enormous.

Just as despair set in, a figure stepped between them.

Dao Zhen. The old man had been summoned to play his part.

He deflected Chen Qi'er's attack with a casual wave and glanced back at Chen Changsheng. "Young friend, do you remember me?"

"You..." Chen Changsheng was stunned. This was the old man who'd swindled him at the Human Dao Sect. Back then, the man had been a mere Yin-Yang Realm cultivator. But now—

"You're the Human Dao Sect's ancestor?"

He wasn't stupid. It clicked instantly. Azure Cloud Heaven's True Immortals were a known quantity, and this man had been at the Human Dao Sect—he could only be its ancient ancestor.

Dao Zhen smiled and nodded.

Chen Changsheng's mind raced. He'd stumbled into an acquaintance with the Human Dao Sect's ancestral figure by sheer accident. But Qin Jiang had connections to the Human Dao Sect, didn't he?

Meanwhile, Chen Qi'er was frowning too. He understood Qin Jiang's ties to the Human Dao Sect even better than Chen Changsheng did—with Chen Baizhe as the link, the two sides were practically inseparable. The fact that the Human Dao Sect's ancestor had just rescued Chen Changsheng only reinforced his belief that Chen Changsheng was Qin Jiang's close ally.

More importantly, if the Human Dao Sect's ancestor was here, then Qin Jiang might be nearby too.

Could the upheaval in the Chaos District be Qin Jiang's doing?

If so, any hope of getting a piece of the pie had just dimmed considerably.

Dao Zhen's gaze shifted to Chen Qi'er, eyes flickering. Another individual blessed with extraordinary fortune. He couldn't understand how two such people could be so thoroughly outmaneuvered by Qin Jiang—toyed with like puppets on strings. And Qin Jiang's own fortune...

He shook his head, privately questioning his Fortune-Reading skills. Maybe his eyes were going bad in his old age.

Under Dao Zhen's stare, Chen Qi'er gave a cold snort and withdrew without a word. Fighting a True Immortal would be suicide.

Dao Zhen didn't pursue. Qin Jiang's instructions were to save Chen Changsheng and then manipulate him. Chen Qi'er wasn't part of the assignment.

Once Chen Qi'er departed, Chen Changsheng's body nearly gave out. Dao Zhen steadied him with a burst of energy, supplementing the origin essences that were already working to repair the damage.

Chen Changsheng winced internally. Those precious essences should have been carrying him to the immortal path. Instead, a huge portion had been wasted on emergency repairs. He'd probably stall below the immortal threshold now.

Drawing a deep breath, he turned to Dao Zhen with genuine gratitude. "Thank you for saving my life, Senior."

"Don't mention it. Just pay up." Dao Zhen gave a magnanimous wave.

Chen Changsheng smiled bitterly. Same old swindler—all about the money. He handed over half his savings without complaint. His life was worth more than any treasure.

Dao Zhen's eyes sparkled as he accepted the haul. The fortune-blessed really did have the best stuff. Of course, he owed this windfall to Qin Jiang for orchestrating the whole thing.

"Senior," Chen Changsheng ventured, "would it be possible for me to stay near you for a while? As a temporary refuge?"

What he really wanted was Dao Zhen's protection. In his current state, running into Chen Qi'er again could be fatal.

Dao Zhen agreed readily, leading him to a modest but clean courtyard. Chen Changsheng settled in, and once things were quiet, Dao Zhen produced a roast chicken and asked casually, "That fellow just now—how did you run afoul of him?"

"You know him, Senior?"

"Indeed." Dao Zhen nodded. "Do you remember Qin Jiang?"

"Qin Jiang..." The name was seared into Chen Changsheng's soul. His fists clenched. He nodded.

"Chen Qi'er's sister is Qin Jiang's dao companion."

"So that's it!" Everything clicked. No wonder the man had been hunting him on Qin Jiang's behalf. And the familiar way Chen Qi'er had referred to Qin Jiang—no deference at all. Of course. He was Qin Jiang's brother-in-law.

Every word Dao Zhen spoke was technically the truth. But strung together through Chen Changsheng's lens, those truths painted a picture that perfectly served Qin Jiang's purposes: Chen Qi'er and Qin Jiang were allies. In Chen Qi'er's mind, thanks to Dao Zhen's intervention, Qin Jiang and Chen Changsheng were allies.

Two Children of Destiny, each now viewing the other as the enemy's agent.

All Qin Jiang had to do was sit back and enjoy the show.

"Senior, if I recall correctly, the Human Dao Sect and Qin Jiang are quite close..."

Chen Changsheng tested the waters. Qin Jiang had practically been a VIP at the Human Dao Sect during the entrance examinations. Their relationship seemed solid.

If Dao Zhen was Qin Jiang's ally, then Chen Changsheng would need to leave immediately.

"Qin Jiang? He has no real connection to the Human Dao Sect." Dao Zhen waved dismissively, then peered at Chen Changsheng. "You've had some trouble with him, haven't you? Back at the Human Dao Sect, after Qin Jiang roughed you up, it was this old man who patched you up."

Chen Changsheng startled. That explained why his injuries hadn't been as severe as expected when he'd regained consciousness. He bowed again in thanks.

Dao Zhen continued, "Qin Jiang was representing the Azure Lotus Divine Palace at the time. The entrance exam wasn't particularly important to us, so we let him play examiner as a courtesy to the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. Nothing more."

"I see."
