"That drug of yours..." Dao Zhen stared at the sealed courtyard, his expression complicated. He'd assumed it was some kind of poison. But seeing the state Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng were in, he now understood exactly what Qin Jiang had given them. The man truly had no limits.

Granted, Chen Qi'er was no longer technically a man, but he still thought like one. Once they regained their senses and the memories came flooding back — the two of them would be absolutely destroyed.

Just then, Chen Wuming appeared at the edge of the formation, clawing desperately to get out. "Let me out — please, let me out!" he screamed, face twisted with horror. The scene inside was beyond anything he could stomach. He was retching between pleas, shooting panicked glances back into the courtyard. Chen Qi'er and Chen Changsheng had completely lost their minds. They'd erupted into an all-out brawl, and he'd nearly been caught in the crossfire. If he couldn't escape, the two maddened powerhouses would drag him in.

"Please, I'm begging you — let me out! It's too much, I can't take it..." He was sobbing now. "Sir — Senior — spare me. I barely know Chen Qi'er. Please..."

Qin Jiang didn't spare him a glance. Chen Qi'er was about to be dealt with anyway — this mole had served his purpose. If he died, at least it would drop some loot.

"Sir! I have people behind me — powerful people! If something happens to me, they'll... they'll avenge me!" In his desperation, Chen Wuming played his last card.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, a smile tugging at his lips. He waved a hand into the shadows. A moment later, Black Dragon materialized before him.

"Young Master." Black Dragon bowed, then turned toward Chen Wuming inside the formation with a cheerful wave. "Hey there, kid. Fancy meeting you here."

"Black Dragon... you..." Chen Wuming's jaw dropped. He'd never imagined seeing Black Dragon under these circumstances — and even more critically, Black Dragon had just called Qin Jiang 'Young Master.' Did that mean... Black Dragon's mysterious backer was Qin Jiang?

He'd been following Chen Qi'er around, hearing the man ramble on and on about Qin Jiang, so he knew the name well. He'd never dreamed that the savior he'd been pinning his hopes on was the very same person.

Excitement flooded his face. They were on the same side! "Sir — I'm one of yours! I work with Black Dragon—"

Qin Jiang shook his head and turned to Black Dragon. "Handle it." Then to Dao Zhen: "Brother Dao Zhen, keep an eye on things here. I'll be back tomorrow."

The system-formulated drug was potent. It would be a while before either of them regained consciousness.

Across Azure Cloud Heaven, the spiritual energy was growing thinner by the day thanks to An Xihe's formations. Unrest was spreading in many regions, and numerous Human Immortals had come out of seclusion, their faces grim as they observed the five True Immortals still trying to break free.

Even True Immortals were trapped. Under these circumstances, mere Human Immortals had no business getting involved — one wrong step, and even they could die. So for weeks, they'd sat tight, waiting for events to play out. But as the spiritual energy continued to drain and the very origin power of Azure Cloud Heaven itself began to seep away, they grew restless.

If this continued, the entire realm could be crippled. The losses would be incalculable.

Some of them headed for the Central Regions to investigate, driven by the old adage: fortune favors the bold. Perhaps behind this upheaval lay an extraordinary opportunity. With the True Immortals trapped, perhaps this was their chance.

What none of them noticed was that the subordinates of those five True Immortals hadn't stirred at all. Every one of them sat tight, not daring to make a move. All five True Immortals understood: An Xihe had spent hundreds of thousands of years preparing this. No Human Immortal posed a threat to her. They also wondered why Qing Chan and Dao Zhen hadn't shown themselves. Could they have been killed in secret? None of them suspected defection — after all, hundreds of thousands of years ago, Qing Chan and Dao Zhen had been part of the coalition that disrupted An Xihe's previous breakthrough. They'd effectively destroyed her path. And grudges over a severed dao ran deeper than the murder of one's parents. How could that be forgiven?

In the Chaos District, Qin Jiang received reports that unfamiliar faces had appeared — most of them formidably powerful. "The True Immortals aren't here yet, but I can start harvesting," he mused. Among the arrivals were numerous Great Emperors, Ancient Emperors, and several Human Immortals. Every single one of them carried a dao law inside. Immortal-path laws in particular were extraordinarily precious, and his women still didn't have enough to go around.

He dispatched his subordinates to lead the way and began the hunt. With the Immortal King Killing Formation in play, no Human Immortal had any hope of escape. It was a one-sided slaughter — Great Emperors and Ancient Emperors fell one after another.

Standing in the street, Qin Jiang recalled the Myriad Dao Stone and nodded with satisfaction. The first immortal-path law — a Flame Law. Several of his women had fire affinities, even Lian'er. But Lian'er had the Immortal Fire, so she probably didn't need it.

He continued the harvest while mulling over who should receive the Flame Law. After a while, he shook his head. "Forget it — I'll ask Wan'er when I get back. Let me collect them all first."

He'd been so busy these past days that he wasn't entirely up to speed on his women's progress. But he trusted Liu Shuwan — she always had a thorough understanding of everyone's situation. Resource allocation had always been her department.

He resumed hunting without a shred of mercy. Every one of these people had come to the Chaos District looking to profit off the chaos — making them potential threats to An Xihe. Even if they posed no real danger, Qin Jiang intended to kill them all. No exceptions.

With the Immortal King Killing Formation backing him, the clean-up was swift. In less than a day, the district was clear. Unfortunately, only a handful of immortal-path cultivators had come — the smarter ones knew better.

"One Flame Law, one Water Law, and one Strength Law..." Three immortal-path laws total. The first two were useful, but the Strength Law — that wasn't really suitable for any of his women. The Human Immortal who'd possessed it had been a mountain of muscle, likely a side effect of cultivating that particular path. Qin Jiang had no interest in seeing any of his women end up looking like that.
