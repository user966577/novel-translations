When faced with a superior choice, anyone—man or woman—would find themselves torn. And for Bai Susu, Qin Jiang was unquestionably the superior choice.

That night, Qin Jiang didn't return to his residence. Perhaps it was Lin Chen's arrival that stirred something in Bai Susu, because her response was fiercer than usual. They didn't sleep all night.

By morning, Bai Susu was exhausted. She propped herself up with what little strength she had left and shot Qin Jiang a glare. This man was truly a beast.

Qin Jiang looked at her with a smile. "Get some rest. This afternoon, you're coming with me to see Lin Chen."

"You're a pervert!" Bai Susu grumbled.

She'd finally seen through Qin Jiang's twisted psychology. Still, somewhere deep down, there was a faint flutter of excitement—though she had no right to refuse regardless.

Before long, Bai Susu drifted into a deep sleep. Qin Jiang rested for a while too. These days of indulgence had been plenty enjoyable, but even he was feeling the fatigue.

By afternoon, Bai Susu woke and rubbed her bleary eyes. Beside her, Qin Jiang still had his eyes half-closed. Gazing at his sleeping face, her eyes lit up, and she quietly leaned closer. It was the first time she'd ever seen him asleep.

"He really is handsome," she murmured.

At that exact moment, Qin Jiang's lips curved upward. His eyes opened, meeting hers directly. "Like what you see?"

Bai Susu's face froze, then flushed crimson. She let out a startled yelp and scrambled away, burying her face in her hands. 'Too embarrassing!'

"Why were you awake?!" Her voice carried a hint of tears.

Qin Jiang pried her small hands away from her face and regarded her with amusement. "If I hadn't been awake, would you have done something even bolder?"

"I—" Bai Susu nearly fainted from sheer embarrassment. Why on earth had she leaned in like that?

Qin Jiang smiled faintly but mercifully let the teasing end there. "Alright, get yourself ready. Come watch your husband demolish that so-called Lin Chen."

Shortly after, the two stepped out of the courtyard. Bai Susu felt slightly dazed—since arriving at the Qin estate, this was the very first time she'd left this little courtyard.

Qin Jiang held her hand and led her toward the training grounds. Bai Susu's cheeks reddened, but she didn't pull away. Instead, she looked at him with a serious expression.

"Lin Chen really is strong. You're the Qin family's young patriarch—if you underestimate him and stumble in a ditch, that would be humiliating."

"Am I not strong?" Qin Jiang asked with a meaningful smile that made Bai Susu's body tense.

She shot him an exasperated look. "How would I know about your... other aspects—"

Along the way, under Qin Jiang's relentless innuendo, Bai Susu wisely stopped talking. This bastard never had a single decent thought. All he ever did was bully people.

Meanwhile, Bai Jingyun arrived at the training grounds with Lin Chen.

"Chen'er, this is just a spar. Hold back, and don't injure Qin Jiang," Bai Jingyun cautioned.

Lin Chen nodded. He'd heard this reminder over a dozen times now, and each repetition only fanned the flames of his fury higher. 'Don't injure Qin Jiang? So Qin Jiang gets to injure me instead?'

He sneered inwardly. After all, the Primordial Spirit within him belonged to a Great Emperor. He'd never truly regarded Bai Jingyun as his master—all he needed were the Holy Sword Sect's resources. He'd shown Bai Jingyun some modicum of respect after meeting Bai Susu, but now that she belonged to someone else, even that thin veneer of respect had evaporated, replaced by irritation. If he didn't still need the sect's resources, he'd have turned on Bai Jingyun long ago.

As for Qin Jiang—a mere junior who'd stolen his woman. Unforgivable.

He couldn't kill him today, but at the very least, he'd teach him a brutal lesson. And Bai Susu... though she'd lost her purity, her figure and looks were still top-tier. If she was willing to come back, he could consider forgiving her. Thinking about it made his heart ache. He should have made his move earlier. He'd held back, playing the gentleman, keeping up appearances—and in the end, someone else had plucked the peach before he could even hold her hand. The regret was overwhelming.

Bai Jingyun's group entered the training grounds. The crowd was small—just the Qin family's upper echelon. A group of ancestral elders also watched from the shadows, curious about Qin Jiang's true strength. According to Fourth Ancestor, Qin Jiang had spent his time eating, drinking, gambling, and chasing women, barely cultivating at all. This had raised concerns about the hands-off approach to his development. Today's match would reveal whether he'd made any progress. If the results were underwhelming, it might be time to reconsider their training strategy.

When Lin Chen entered, every pair of eyes turned his way—including the hidden ancestors, who quietly observed him. They'd already gathered intelligence on Lin Chen: an Innate Sword Body. A genuine prodigy.

"Hm? Something's off about this kid." First Ancestor and the other three all detected an unusual aura emanating from Lin Chen.

"Why does he have the aura of an Emperor's Dao?"

"There's something wrong with this Lin Chen!"

"Could he be a threat to Jiang'er?"

Their brows furrowed, and killing intent flickered in their eyes as they studied him.

At that same instant, Lin Chen's body went rigid. A dense wave of mortal danger set every hair on end. He fought to maintain his composure, covertly scanning his surroundings—but found nothing. Yet the sensation of being targeted never faded. In that brief moment, cold sweat had already soaked through his clothes.

'How can I sense mortal danger from the Qin family?' he wondered. Though his current cultivation was only at the Divine Ability Realm, he was a former Great Emperor who still retained certain trump cards—cards powerful enough to slay a half-Emperor. On the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent, there were people who could pressure him, but ones who could make him feel his life was genuinely threatened? He hadn't encountered any. Until now.

'The Qin family isn't simple,' Lin Chen thought, taking a deep breath and steadying himself.

The ancestors continued observing him, weighing whether to simply kill him on the spot. Then Fourth Ancestor spoke casually: "This Lin Chen isn't simple, but Jiang'er is even less simple. Don't worry."

Though he regularly badmouthed Qin Jiang, he had some understanding of his nephew's true strength—and more importantly, of the mysterious means at his disposal. Great Emperor laws and blood essence produced on a whim, the 360 Songstresses, Qin Lian'er's divine body, Emperor weapons... Tallying it all up, while they could at least identify that Lin Chen was no ordinary talent, Qin Jiang was utterly unfathomable.

Fourth Ancestor wasn't worried in the slightest. If someone told him Qin Jiang could slay an Emperor, he wouldn't even be surprised. This younger generation member carried too many secrets—and had delivered too many pleasant shocks.
