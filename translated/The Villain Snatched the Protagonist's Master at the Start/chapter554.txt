Qin Jiang was in no rush to leave Skyreach City. The city lord, meanwhile, had begun reaching out to the other Skyreach Cities, claiming a VIP wished to meet them. He didn't specify exactly how important—only that this person ranked just below the Grand Sovereign and above even the Grand Sovereign's daughter.

The other city lords were instantly intrigued. They were all essentially exiles—posted to the realm's edge to manage transit passages. While the freedom was nice, anyone with ambition dreamed of the true Skyreach City at the heart of the Heavenly Domain. These outposts were glorified rest stops in the cosmic middle of nowhere.

The chance to meet someone of such stature was an honor. Every city lord agreed to come. The host also hinted that meeting someone this important required appropriate tribute—and ordinary gifts wouldn't do. They understood perfectly. Treasures were something they had in abundance—and if those treasures could buy a connection to real power, it was a bargain.

While arrangements were being made, Qin Jiang brought the women back to the ship. The city lord's quarters weren't suited for training—that required the Space-Time Temple.

Mu Lan's first training session. When she entered the temple and saw the absurdly oversized bed, she froze, mouth agape.

"Lan Lan, since it's your first time, want to go in as the vanguard?" Qin Jiang asked with a grin.

She flushed. Over the past two days of recovery, she and Qin Jiang had explored some alternative approaches that had been quite educational. But performing in front of this many people was another matter entirely. Embarrassing—yet thrilling. Part of her wanted to try.

She wavered until Qin Jiang slid an arm around her waist, a wicked gleam in his eye.

"Madam, your husband is my subordinate now. You wouldn't want me to make his life difficult, would you?"

Her body reacted instantly. They'd been playing variations of this scenario for two days, and the trigger was practically Pavlovian.

She was a natural actress. Biting her lip, she slipped into character—eyes glistening, palms pressed against his chest in token resistance, head tilting with vulnerable helplessness.

"My lord, please don't do this~"

Her voice was soft and trembling, her expression panicked and lost.

Qin Jiang's arms tightened, pressing them together. He leaned to her ear. "Madam, you're not cooperating."

"I... I have a husband. My lord, please—I can't betray him~"

She pushed weakly at his chest. Tears spilled down her cheeks—the very image of beauty in distress.

"My lord, I beg you, stop~"

Nearby, the other women watched with quiet admiration. This new sister's acting was seriously impressive—and she'd only just joined.

The scene continued. Qin Jiang escalated. "Madam, since you won't cooperate willingly, I'll have to show your husband what happens."

"What... what are you going to do?"

"Heh. One word from me and he dies."

"No!"

She grabbed his arm, desperation flooding her face. "My lord, please don't hurt him. I'll..."

Her cheeks slowly reddened. She didn't finish, but her resistance melted away.

Qin Jiang tilted her chin up. "Then your performance had better be convincing."

"Just... don't hurt him..."

Her voice broke. She wrapped her arms around his neck. "Can you at least spare... that? I don't want to betray my husband completely."

"What do you think?"

He pulled. She cried out, clutching herself, tears streaming. She kept resisting—weakly—even as he carried her to the bed. She curled up, still protesting.

"Think about your husband. You wouldn't want to watch him die."

She flinched. Tears blurred her vision as she slowly, reluctantly, relaxed.

Qin Jiang's eyes blazed. She could only close hers, trembling.

He kissed her. "Madam, you are exquisite."

She said nothing. Tears rolled silently as she let him have his way. But no amount of acting could suppress her body's honest reactions. The "tears" flowed freely as she began, despite herself, to respond.

She was about to break character.

"Heh. Madam, it seems your body isn't as loyal to your husband as you'd like."

Her face was crimson, eyes glazing over. She pulled him close—a silent plea.

Qin Jiang read the cue and stopped teasing. The moment came, and Mu Lan went rigid. Tears streamed as she whispered, "Darling, I'm sorry."

Still in character. Impressively committed.

Qin Jiang laughed and stroked her cheek. "Okay. You can drop the act now."

The sorrow vanished like a mask being removed. She wiped her eyes and glared at him.

"You jerk. You nearly tormented me to death~"

"Heh. Consider it payment for a great performance, Lan Lan."

She huffed and hooked her arms around his neck, closing her eyes.

Time to collect her reward.
