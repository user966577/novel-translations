Over the following days, with the other women looking after her, Lian'er adapted quickly.

She'd already found her rhythm.

The biggest reason, of course, was that Qin Jiang doted on her. The moment her eyes reddened even slightly, he'd ease up, hold her gently, and whisper reassurances.

Several days passed.

Inside the Space-Time Temple, Lian'er frowned and looked down. She had a belly now.

She'd been eating a little too much lately. To make up for lost time, Qin Jiang had given her nearly all the provisions these past few days.

She pouted, rubbing her stomach.

That's when Qin Jiang appeared before her in a flash. "Hehe, Lian'er. Meal's ready."

Lian'er immediately braced her palm against his chest, face pinkening. "I... I don't want any more!"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow. He caught her hand and pulled her close. "What do you mean, no more? Weren't you just saying you wanted to make up for all the ones you missed?"

"No more~ I'm getting fat!"

Lian'er shook her head, her legs pressing against him to keep distance.

Qin Jiang glanced down, then chuckled. "It's fine. I'll rub it flat."

His palm settled on her belly and began working in slow circles. Before long, Lian'er's cheeks had flushed a deep rose.

The slight swell gradually subsided. Smooth and taut once more.

"See? All better."

He lifted his hand, scooped her up, and glanced back. Lian'er's blush intensified as she saw the evidence of how much she'd consumed.

Setting her down after a quick cleanup, he drew her into his arms and kissed her. "Still want more?"

"Mm~" She rubbed her belly. The massage had somehow left her hungry again.

She nodded, blushing. "Yes~"

"Hehe~"

He'd expected as much. She might have protested just now, but this little glutton was insatiable. She talked big about refusing, but she always came back for more.

Though, the meal had gone a bit cold during the massage. It would need reheating — and that was Lian'er's job. Home-cooked was always best.

In recent days, her skills had improved considerably. The other women had been generous with tips about Qin Jiang's preferences, so reheating a meal was child's play.

Within fifteen minutes, the meal was piping hot. Lian'er dug in with a look of pure bliss.

Qin Jiang massaged her feet while she ate. He swallowed involuntarily. Everything looked so... appetizing.

Lian'er finished her meal and stretched her small feet into his lap, watching his face. Seeing the greedy look in his eyes, she giggled and pressed a dainty toe against his chest, tracing little circles that made his pulse quicken.

"Is Brother hungry too?"

She propped her chin on her hand, leaning forward with breath like warm orchids brushing his face.

He tilted his head to look, then nodded.

With ingredients this exquisite — and fragrant — how could he not be hungry?

"Here, all yours~"

Lian'er offered generously, and Qin Jiang seized the dish without hesitation, diving in with the enthusiasm of a man half-starved.

Lian'er dissolved into giggles. She watched him, feeding him piece by piece, reminding him gently: "Slow down, Brother~"

A good while later, under Lian'er's attentive service, Qin Jiang had eaten his fill — or close to it.

Lian'er curled against his chest, pressing her lips to his neck. "Was it good?"

"Absolutely. Top-tier ingredients."

Hearing his verdict, Lian'er beamed. She looked down at herself — clearly, her brother approved. She'd need to maintain things properly and keep feeding him.

"Are there other dishes you'd like to try?"

Qin Jiang licked his lips. His eyes traced slowly downward, cataloguing options. His throat bobbed. "I'd like to try everything."

Lian'er's eyes went wide. Everything?

Well... that wasn't out of the question.

"Ahem — I'm full, but I'm a bit thirsty now..."

He cleared his throat and gave her a meaningful look, his gaze pointing to—

Lian'er followed his eyes, then shot him a glare, teeth pressing into her lower lip. "You're terrible, Brother~"

She gave him a light smack and bolted from the room.

Qin Jiang blinked. Why had she run? That didn't seem right. It wasn't as if she hadn't done this before — just a few days ago, even.

He was puzzling over it when she came running back, threw her arms around his head, and looked down at him with crimson cheeks.

"All clean now. Go ahead~"

Qin Jiang understood. She'd wanted to freshen up first.

Fastidious little thing.

Well, as long as it quenched his thirst.

Under Lian'er's guidance, Qin Jiang drank like a man dying of thirst, taking nearly everything she had to offer. When he finally came up for air, satisfied, Lian'er's legs gave out and she collapsed against him.

He caught her immediately. "Lian'er? You okay?"

"Mm~"

She pursed her lips, looking a touch fatigued. Like Qin Jiang, she was feeling rather parched.

Recognizing the issue — she was a bit dehydrated — he produced some spirit spring water. "Here, drink."

"You feed me~"

She clung to his neck.

He brought the water to her lips, but she kept them pressed shut, shaking her head, eyes locked on his mouth.

"You little..."

Smiling, he tapped her brow, took a mouthful of spring water, and leaned down to press his lips to hers.

A long moment later, her lips glistened with moisture.

"More~"

Lian'er licked her lips and nuzzled against him.

"Alright, alright."

They spent the better part of the day feeding each other, until both were thoroughly sated. Dessert naturally followed — and by the end, both were deeply content.

Lian'er most of all. After starving for so long, she could finally eat her fill.
