The seven-colored mote was the mark of qualification. With it, she could enter the Heavenly Domain at any time while the passage remained open.

Ye Xuan touched her brow, satisfied. All seven colors—hopefully she hadn't disappointed Young Master Qin.

Back among Huaxia's ranks, the display put everyone at ease. She'd triggered all seven without breaking a sweat. Passing should be no problem for them.

Ye Xuan returned and bowed slightly. "Manor Lord. Mission accomplished."

"Well done." Qin Jiang nodded with a smile.

This trial also served as a demonstration of Huaxia's strength to the world. Ye Xuan had set an excellent precedent.

He rewarded her generously, which drew envious looks from the others. They immediately volunteered to go next.

Qin Jiang raised a hand, and the clamoring stopped. "Don't get overconfident. Ye Xuan lit all seven because her talent is exceptional. If you assume this will be easy, you might fall flat."

He waved them off. "Go ahead—anyone who wants to take the trial, go."

The trial could accommodate many challengers simultaneously, so after Qin Jiang gave the order, his forces surged skyward in droves. The command was relayed across all territories—anyone who wished to enter the Heavenly Domain could attempt the trial.

Instantly, barriers appeared across the sky by the thousands. Light flashed everywhere.

"Are you kidding me? Only two colors?"

"I didn't light up a single one! Is this thing broken?"

"One..."

"Five colors! Hahaha, I passed!"

"Damn it. I gave it everything and only got three. The Heavenly Domain just isn't meant for me."

Only after attempting the trial did they understand what they were up against. Forget seven colors—even five was rare. Some couldn't light a single one. Swarms had gone up brimming with excitement. Most came back dejected. The pass rate was under one percent.

Qin Jiang wasn't surprised. Huaxia Academy's trained prodigies hadn't even gone yet. These were ordinary cultivators who didn't want to be left behind, so he'd given them the chance. Most clearly lacked the ability.

Once they'd finished, Qin Jiang gave the signal, and the real talents stepped up—the first class of Huaxia Academy students. Handpicked and given the finest cultivation resources, they were the elite among elite.

When they struck, the sky blazed brighter than ever.

"I gave it everything and still only got five. I really am that far behind Senior Sister Ye Xuan."

"Five is still a pass."

"Six colors? No—one more try. I refuse to believe I can't hit seven."

Nearly all of them scored five as a baseline. Several reached six, but no one else matched Ye Xuan's seven. Each additional color above five was exponentially harder.

The first class finished quickly. Every single one passed.

Across the sky, more and more people attempted the trial, but qualified challengers remained few.

"Should we go too?" Liu Shuwan spoke up beside Qin Jiang.

They would obviously be going with him, so passing was mandatory.

Qin Jiang nodded. "Go ahead. Don't be nervous—with your abilities, you'll definitely pass. And if someone doesn't make it, I'll take a trip to the Myriad Realms Tower and pull some strings."

The women rolled their eyes. They were plenty confident. Qin Jiang had invested more in them than anyone else. If the academy students could pass, there was no reason they couldn't.

Without another word, they took to the sky.

Qin Jiang watched, already planning contingencies. Surely the Grand Sovereign would give him some face? And if not, well—he'd use the Grand Sovereign's daughter as leverage. Refuse to bend the rules and he'd pursue his daughter. Of course, he was going to pursue her either way.

The women began their trials. Light erupted across the heavens—five colors, six, even seven. The brilliant display drew gasps from everyone watching.

"The sisters' talent really is something," An Xihe remarked. She and Qing Chan and the other Immortal Kings didn't need to take the trial.

Qin Jiang nodded with a smile. Many of his women were naturally gifted—some rivaling Children of Destiny—and his cultivation resources had only amplified that. Even those with more modest talent had scored five colors thanks to years of investment. He'd spent an incalculable number of treasures on them. Their success was expected.

He breathed a sigh of relief. He'd genuinely worried about some of them—the Azure Lotus Divine Palace women, the little foxes, the beauties from Mystic Cloud Heaven. Their raw talent wasn't exceptional. But his cultivation and their hard work had gotten them through.

No need to pull strings after all.

The only surprise was the 360 Songstresses. They'd all scored exactly five—below their actual ability. Clearly holding back. But it didn't matter. For them, the score was irrelevant. All that mattered was qualifying to follow Qin Jiang to the Heavenly Domain.

Soon, everyone returned, beaming. "We all passed! No need for your backdoor connections."

Qin Jiang chuckled. As long as the women were through, nothing else mattered.

He stood, arms spread wide, and pulled the nearest ones into an embrace. "Well then—shouldn't we celebrate?"

"How do you want to celebrate?"

"Actually, there is a back door we could use."

"Mm~ You're terrible~"
