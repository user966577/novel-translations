Xue Yue flinched, then felt the warmth of his hand on her chin and flushed crimson. She stumbled back two steps, dodging his touch, and glared at him with a mix of embarrassment and anger. "What — what do you mean by that?"

"You want to become Huaxia's undercover agent? You'll need a believable identity." He shrugged. "Whatever happens behind the scenes, on the surface everything still has to follow Huaxia's rules."

Her fists tightened as she studied his face. It wasn't entirely unreasonable. And from what he'd implied, it would only be pretend.

"My Blood Tribe status isn't enough?"

He rolled his eyes. "The Blood Tribe has zero connection to Huaxia. What kind of undercover agent would that make? My family does have ties to Huaxia, so you'd need to be linked to us. Besides, I need a reason to convince my family to pull strings for you. Understand?"

She lowered her gaze. His logic was sound. Her hands twisted together nervously. After a hesitation, she looked up. "Could I have a different role?"

"No." He shook his head, then waved dismissively. "Let me be clear — I'm not begging to help you. You're the one asking me. If it weren't for Weiwei, I wouldn't bother."

Her face fell. Without his help, she'd have nothing. She nodded quickly. "I agree. I'll do it."

"Good." He put on an air of indifference. "Then from now on, you follow my arrangements exactly."

"Okay."

"First — cut ties with Nangong Yun. Otherwise, even with your identity switched to undercover agent, you could still be suspected of defecting."

She hesitated, wanting to object, but one look at his cool expression made her swallow her words. She nodded obediently.

"Second — the fact that you're my woman needs to be public knowledge. That's how we cement your cover."

She squirmed. That meant everyone would know — including Nangong Yun. But then she reminded herself that Nangong Yun was the reason the Blood Tribe was in danger, and her fondness for him dimmed a fraction more. She didn't dare argue.

"Third..." His lips curled. He beckoned. "Come here. Let me hold you."

"Oka— huh?" She'd nodded reflexively before catching herself, and her face went scarlet. She retreated a step. "I thought we were just pretending!"

"We are," he said with perfect seriousness. "But in front of others, we need to look real. Basic things like hand-holding and hugging are essential. To avoid being caught out, we'll need to practice."

"But—"

"Are you saying you don't want to save your million clansmen?"

She flushed, eyes conflicted, but the thought of the Blood Tribe's fate tipped the scales. One step at a time, she approached him, feeling his warmth grow closer — until he swept her into his arms.

Her body trembled. She closed her eyes and slowly wrapped her arms around him.

"Relax. Don't be so tense." His chin rested on her shoulder, his voice gentler now. "Think about your clansmen. You don't want them all losing their heads, do you?"

She shivered. Her arms tightened, and her rigid body gradually softened. After a while, she realized with a start that she felt safe in his embrace. The feeling unsettled her. She felt his palm stroking her back, and whispered with pink cheeks, "Can we stop now?"

"Mm."

He released her and said seriously, "You were way too stiff. Anyone with eyes could tell we were faking. You need to relax. We'll practice more."

"Okay," she murmured, head bowed.

He reached out and ruffled her hair, making her flinch — but she didn't pull away. 'For the tribe,' she told herself. 'And besides... it doesn't feel bad.'

"Alright, head back for now. We need to rest." He smiled.

Xue Yue glanced at Weiwei, nodded, and turned to leave. As the courtyard gate closed behind her, she caught the faint sound of laughter from inside — happy, carefree. She didn't know why, but standing outside that gate, she felt a pang of loneliness. She lingered for a moment before walking away.

Inside, Weiwei nestled against Qin Jiang's chest, looking toward where Xue Yue had gone. "You've got her completely bamboozled."

"Bamboozled? I'm trying to save her." He snorted. Though privately, he noted that Xue Yue's body was wonderfully soft. Comfortable to hold. He'd have to deepen things in a few days.

As if reading his thoughts, Weiwei looped her arms around his neck, pressed her face close, and breathed, "Was holding Xue Yue comfortable?"

"Not bad," he admitted.

Her lips brushed his — a single light peck — before she leaned to his ear and purred, "Then tell me... is holding Xue Yue more comfortable, or holding me?"

"Is that even a question?" He grinned, crushed her against him, and kissed her cheek. "My Weiwei, of course."

"What about us?" Liu Shuwan and the others drifted over, smirking.

His eyebrows shot up. He spread his arms wide. "Well, I'll need to hold each of you and compare. Come on — everyone line up."
