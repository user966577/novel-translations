Long Yu's eyes darted. The twisted thoughts in his heart had genuinely spawned the idea of joining the Demon Hall. But reason still held. He let out a cold snort.

"I am of imperial blood. You are traitors and rebels. I would never stoop to your level. This time, I'll let you off—now get lost!"

He swept his arm dismissively.

The Demon Lord let out a strange laugh. He knew Long Yu was tempted. In the past, the prince would have immediately called for a siege. The fact that he hadn't spoke volumes.

"Heh, very well. Then I shall take my leave." The Demon Lord chuckled and vanished, leaving only a parting line: "Ninth Prince, we will meet again."

Alone in the hall, Long Yu's expression shifted between dark and light. His fists clenched.

"The Demon Hall..."

He murmured to himself, a flicker in his eyes. Not yet. He hadn't fallen that far. Not yet.

Taking a steadying breath, he composed himself and called toward the entrance: "Attendants! Prepare for a palace visit."

At the Third Princess's mansion, the sun was already high when Long Xin'er finally woke. Exhaustion lingered between her brows.

She wandered into the courtyard to find Qin Jiang lounging without a care in the world. Long Xin'er couldn't help rolling her eyes. She suffered through grueling days while this man lived in perpetual leisure.

Sipping his tea, Qin Jiang glanced at her with a smile and tossed her a scroll. "Here. Edict from your father."

She caught it, unrolled it, and froze. "This is Father's decision?"

"Mm." Qin Jiang nodded. "He must know I gave you the Dragon Pearl. Your father's got nerve—I'll give him that."

Long Xin'er shook her head slowly. Once, she'd desperately wanted the position of heir. But now it didn't seem to matter much. She had the Dragon Pearl. The odds of reaching the immortal path were enormous. When that happened, would she really need a single empire?

Besides, staying at Qin Jiang's side promised far better prospects. A mere Divine Dragon Empire? She'd already outgrown it.

Still, the title had its uses. At the very least, it would irritate Long Yu.

"Want to visit the palace?" Qin Jiang asked.

Long Xin'er hesitated. Protocol demanded she go—receiving such an honor required a formal show of gratitude. Then again, with Qin Jiang backing her, she didn't strictly need to. After a moment's thought, she decided to go. Whatever else, the Dragon Emperor was still her father. She owed him a measure of respect.

"I'll make the trip."

Qin Jiang nodded. "I'll come with you."

Inside the palace, a crowd of officials had assembled, most of them Long Yu's supporters. Their displeasure with the edict was obvious, and they'd banded together to petition the Dragon Emperor to reverse it.

But the Dragon Emperor's mind was made up. Every petition was rejected. The most stubborn among them were executed on the spot. Under such a brutal display, the rest fell silent, trembling. They remembered, suddenly and viscerally, that this empire belonged to the Dragon Emperor. They were subjects—nothing more. They could not override the will of their sovereign.

Then Long Yu arrived.

"Your son pays his respects, Father."

He bowed with perfect propriety. The Dragon Emperor studied him, a complicated look flickering through his eyes.

"Rise."

Long Yu stood, his face a mask of calm, showing no reaction to the edict. He simply waited, quiet and composed.

The Dragon Emperor sighed. Guilt gnawed at him, but imperial competition was merciless. With Long Xin'er aligned with Qin Jiang, he had to distance himself from Long Yu. Otherwise, internal strife was inevitable.

"Yu'er," he said, "your cultivation is strong enough for a military command, wouldn't you say?"

"Not quite yet."

The Dragon Emperor smiled. "If I say you can be a general, then you can be a general. Here's what we'll do—the frontier suffered some losses recently. Go serve as a general there. Riding into battle, earning glory on the field... every man's dream."

The court went silent. The implications were clear to everyone: this was exile, pure and simple.

For an ordinary person, war merit was an enticing prospect. But for a prince, being posted to the frontier meant being marginalized. And while military achievements could theoretically give Long Yu leverage over the army, the Divine Dragon Empire was currently at peace. No wars to fight meant no glory to earn.

This was a life sentence to the wasteland.

Long Yu's heart sank. The capital was the center of power. The desolate frontier offered nothing—no influence, no authority. The longer he stayed, the more his carefully cultivated network in the capital would unravel.

From most favored prince to frontier exile, all in a single day.

Just then, Qin Jiang and Long Xin'er entered the hall. Nearly every eye turned to him. These officials had all received the Dragon Emperor's warnings, but most were seeing Qin Jiang for the first time. The connection was obvious—the Third Princess's elevation was Qin Jiang's doing.

"Greetings, Father." Long Xin'er offered a small bow. Beside her, Qin Jiang simply nodded at the Dragon Emperor. A casual hello.

"Ha ha, Xin'er, no need for formalities." The Dragon Emperor's warmth was palpable. He lifted her gently with a wave of his hand.

"Thank you, Father."

His treatment of Long Xin'er was warmer than Long Yu had ever received at his best. Standing to the side watching, Long Yu burned with fury. That tenderness had once been reserved solely for him. And now he was being shipped off to the frontier.

After a few words of concern for Long Xin'er, the Dragon Emperor turned to Qin Jiang with a knowing smile and a nod—a silent message that everything he'd done was for Qin Jiang's benefit.

Then Long Yu stepped forward. "Father, I am willing to go to the frontier!"

The sight of Qin Jiang had crystallized his resolve. With Qin Jiang in the capital, Long Yu's life here would be miserable no matter what. Better to put distance between them. Perhaps he could carve out something of his own in the borderlands.

And once at the frontier, far from the Dragon Emperor's watchful eye, he could act more freely. For instance—joining the Demon Hall.

His mind was made up.

The Dragon Emperor blinked, surprised. A moment ago the prince had been reluctant; now he was volunteering?

He nodded. "Good. Take a couple of days to prepare, then—"

"I wish to depart immediately!"

"Hm?" The Dragon Emperor frowned, hesitated, then relented. "Very well. I won't keep you. At the frontier, you can still prove yourself. I hope one day to hear of your accomplishments there."
