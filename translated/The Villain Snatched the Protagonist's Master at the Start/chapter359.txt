The water battlefield did indeed provide a boost — just not for Chen Ningbing. Poor girl had it rough.

Fortunately, this was her childhood home, and Qin Jiang didn't push things too far.

The next morning, Chen Ningbing woke in Qin Jiang's arms, looking thoroughly languid. She glanced up at him once, then closed her eyes again, wrapping her arms around him and nestling her head against his chest. Her lips smacked sleepily a few times as she nuzzled against him, half-asleep and utterly adorable.

Qin Jiang pinched her cheek, kissed the top of her head, and wrapped his arm around her waist, rocking her gently like a child.

After a good while, Chen Ningbing finally opened her eyes again. She raised a small hand to rub them, pressed closer to him, then lifted her chin and pointed at her own lips. "Qin Jiang, I want a kiss~"

She tilted her face up, lips pursed, waiting. Qin Jiang smiled, cupped her face in both hands, and kissed her firmly.

When they parted, she giggled. "Qin Jiang, you smell so nice~"

"Bing'er smells nicer."

"Mm~ Then Bing'er will let you have a taste~"

She grabbed his face in both hands, leaned in, and peppered his lips with quick little kisses. "Hehe, yummy?"

"Delicious."

Qin Jiang licked his lips, gazing at her. A girl who'd just woken up — there was something impossibly cute about it. They lay tangled together for a good while longer before finally leaving the room.

Chen Ningbing clung to his arm as they walked. "Let's go see my parents."

They'd arrived yesterday but had barely exchanged a word with Chen Lie, and she hadn't seen her mother at all. Qin Jiang agreed, and the two strolled out of the courtyard. Chen Ningbing kept sneaking glances up at him, and before long, they reached her parents' courtyard. She lowered her voice. "Qin Jiang, my parents might have a surprise for you."

"A surprise?" He raised an eyebrow. Given the Chen family's resources, what kind of surprise could they possibly offer him?

She didn't elaborate, just tugged him along. She'd already been in touch with her parents since returning to Qin Domain — they'd mentioned preparing something. Something that would, in all likelihood, benefit Qin Jiang more than her.

She knocked. "Father, Mother..."

The door swung open immediately. Chen Lie's beaming face appeared. "My dear son-in-law is here!"

He stepped aside at once, ushering Qin Jiang in with all the enthusiasm of a maitre d' at a five-star restaurant. Chen Ningbing stared. The old man's eyes had gone straight to his son-in-law — she might as well have been invisible.

Qin Jiang chuckled. Among all his fathers-in-law, this little old man was by far the most sensible. Easy on the eyes, too.

Inside the courtyard, beside Chen Lie, stood a beautiful woman — Chen Ningbing's mother. She looked to be in her mid-thirties, quite attractive. The old man had done well for himself. But what truly caught Qin Jiang's attention was the porcelain-doll of a little girl in the woman's arms. Three or four years old, with wide, curious eyes that stared right back at him.

Chen Ningbing's gaze also landed on the little girl. Back when she'd first gotten together with Qin Jiang, she'd made an offhand remark — and apparently, her father had actually followed through. He'd given her a little sister.

"Son-in-law, this is Bing'er's little sister," Chen Lie said. "She's three years old. Her name is Chen Ningshuang."

Chen Ningbing walked over. This was her first time meeting her sister. The little girl wasn't the least bit shy — her bright eyes studied Chen Ningbing as she asked in a clear, piping voice, "Are you my big sister?"

A smile spread across Chen Ningbing's face. She reached out and took the girl from her mother's arms. "That's right, I'm your big sister." She poked the little girl's cheek, then grinned at Qin Jiang. "What do you think of my little sister?"

"Adorable."

Qin Jiang leaned down and poked the girl's other cheek. Chen Ningshuang pouted, shaking her head. "Don't poke my face!"

"Heh, little one — do you know who I am?"

She studied him, her tiny brow furrowing in thought. After a moment, her expression cleared. "You're the handsome big brother~"

"Oh? Good eye." He couldn't help but grin, shooting Chen Ningbing a smug look. His good looks could charm even a three-year-old.

Chen Ningbing rolled her eyes and introduced him properly. "This handsome big brother is your sister's husband. You should call him brother-in-law."

"Huh? Big sister's husband?" The little girl understood the concept despite her age. "Then... can he be my husband too?"

Silence.

"Big sister's father is my father, and big sister's mother is my mother. So big sister's husband should also be my husband!" She delivered this logic with complete earnestness.

Qin Jiang laughed and nodded approvingly. "Little Shuang'er makes an excellent point."

"She's barely three years old..." Chen Ningbing was at a loss. Sure, her sister only existed because of Qin Jiang in the first place, but this was a toddler.

"Being little is no good?" the girl asked.

This time, even Qin Jiang conceded. "Being this little really is no good."

"Oh~" She looked genuinely disappointed.

Chen Ningbing pinched her cheek. "This young, and you already want a husband?"

"Because the handsome big brother is really handsome! Shuang'er likes him!" The girl gazed at Qin Jiang with starry eyes.

Chen Ningbing's gaze followed her sister's to Qin Jiang. That face of his really was devastatingly effective. No woman alive would find him unappealing. She'd never doubted that her sister would eventually fall for him — she just hadn't expected it to happen at age three.

"You're too young for this kind of talk," she said. "These things are for when you grow up."

Privately, she calculated. Her sister was three. In another dozen years or so, she'd be old enough. A dozen years was nothing to Qin Jiang.

"Actually, if we put her in the Space-Time Temple, she'd grow up in no time..." Qin Jiang muttered.

Chen Ningbing shot him a look and swatted his arm. "The Space-Time Temple is fine for cultivation retreats, but not for normal growth."

"Right, right. I know." He scratched his head. Growing up properly required companionship and real-world experience. Toss her in the Space-Time Temple and her body would age, but her mind wouldn't keep pace. Without someone by her side, it would only create problems.
