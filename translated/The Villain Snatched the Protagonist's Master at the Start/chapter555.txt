After the training session, Mu Lan finally experienced Qin Jiang's true capabilities.

She'd gone in as the vanguard. The opening roleplay had been gentle enough. But once the curtain fell on the performance, the real training began—and Qin Jiang held nothing back.

She lasted less than half a day before being utterly overwhelmed. The others rushed in to relieve her, saving her from total collapse.

Afterward, she watched wave after wave of her sisters take the field—individually, in pairs, in coordinated teams—only to fall one after another. Qin Jiang never showed a hint of fatigue.

Inside the Space-Time Temple, the session lasted over six months. Qin Jiang didn't rest once. Mu Lan ventured back several times but was defeated every time.

At the end, still defiant, she challenged Qin Jiang one-on-one. She lost again—and was thoroughly disciplined for her audacity. Her sisters were too spent to rescue her. She had to beg for a long time before he finally relented.

"Jerk. It's all swollen," she complained.

Qin Jiang tilted her chin and kissed her. "Whose fault is that? I said we were done and you insisted on coming back for more. If I don't put you in your place, you'll go around saying I can't keep up."

"I didn't expect you to be this good."

She pouted. He laughed.

"Now you know?"

"Mm~"

"Going to be cocky again?"

"Yes!"

"Oh?"

His eyebrow shot up. Clearly one lesson wasn't enough.

Mu Lan threw herself into his arms, clinging tight. Her eyes sparkled with mischief as a blush crept up her cheeks.

"It actually felt... really good. Next time, when I beg you to stop—don't. Don't hold back on my account, okay?"

"???"

Qin Jiang blinked. He stared at her earnest expression and swallowed. "You're serious?"

"Mm~"

She nodded, blushing but resolute, swaying against him. "Please?"

"Okay."

He took a deep breath, nodded firmly, then scooped her up and deposited her on the bed.

She squeaked. "No~"

"Heh. You just said begging doesn't work anymore, Lan Lan."

Her face went pale with mock terror, but her eyes glittered with excitement. It hurt—but she wanted it anyway. What she hadn't anticipated was how quickly Qin Jiang would act on her request. The moment she asked, he delivered.

She loved it.

Afterward, seeing the damage, Qin Jiang hesitated. He'd always been gentle with his women. But the look in her eyes told him everything. He steeled himself and obliged.

Her brow furrowed, nails digging into his back. Fortunately, his body was tougher than steel—she couldn't break the skin.

Before long, she was begging again. But she'd already told him not to stop, and she liked it this way. So he didn't.

Still, watching her face contort made his heart ache—even though the excitement in her eyes was undeniable. Bordering on wild.

After the better part of a day, he finally stopped. She collapsed against him, hair disheveled, breathing ragged, eyes unfocused.

It took a while for her to recover. Her hand came to rest on his chest, her cheek against his heartbeat. She nuzzled closer, then looked up.

"Darling... that was amazing~ Again next time~"

"Again?"

"Mm~"

It had hurt. She'd begged, she'd cried. But she'd loved every second. Strange. She hadn't even known she was like this before.

Would Qin Jiang be put off? She looked at him anxiously. But he only held her tighter.

"Want to go again right now?"

"Huh?" Her face blanched. She shook her head frantically. "I think I'm okay~"

Even as she said it, a spark of anticipation lit her eyes.

He just smiled. "Next time, then. Rest up."

"Oh~"

A touch of disappointment. He flicked her forehead. "Too much and it'll start to show."

"Show?"

"And things will get... roomier..."

"!!!"

"So—still want more, Lan Lan?"

She shook her head vehemently. That was genuinely alarming. "No more! Not ever!"

But Qin Jiang wasn't having that. "In moderation, it's perfectly fine."

She kept shaking her head. "No!"

"Ahem. Lan Lan, as long as you take care of yourself properly, there won't be any problems. Ask the other girls—they maintain themselves just fine."

"Really?"

"Mm." He nodded. "Liu Shuwan and the others can give you tips."

"Okay~"

Then her eyes brightened. "So if I take care of things properly... we can go as hard as we want?"

"Maintenance doesn't mean unlimited."

"Oh. Fine."

She looked deflated. Qin Jiang sighed and rolled on top of her. She yelped and clung to him, understanding immediately what was about to happen. She looked up at him, teeth pressed into her lower lip, eyes smoldering.

"I really can't help myself with you. One more time."

She giggled and wrapped her arms around his neck.

"Darling, come on~"
