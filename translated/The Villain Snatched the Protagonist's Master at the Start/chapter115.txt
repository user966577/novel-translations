The Fourth Patron was a well-read man!

The classic story: a marginalized princess gets bullied, finds a powerful backer in the wider world, and returns to take revenge—either destroying the empire outright or overthrowing the emperor and becoming an empress herself.

Was that what Third Princess was doing?

He shuddered.

Fiction becoming reality?

What do I do? I'm panicking!

Following standard revenge-novel logic, this kind of story always succeeded. He looked at Long Xin'er, and a thought flickered through his mind.

What if he... defected?

Joined the Third Princess's side?

Not a bad option, actually.

"Third Princess, I'll help you overthrow the tyranny and build a new empire!"

Qin Jiang: "???"

Long Xin'er: "???"

They both stared at the Fourth Patron in bewilderment. Qin Jiang's brow furrowed. "Is your Dragon Emperor a tyrant?"

"No—I mean, yes! An absolute tyrant! A monster despised by gods and men alike! If you want to overthrow him, I can help!"

The Fourth Patron's face was the picture of earnestness.

Long Xin'er's delicate brows drew together. She wasn't exactly her father's favorite, but a tyrant? Despised by gods and men? That seemed excessive.

"So you're saying your people live in misery?" Qin Jiang said with a sympathetic sigh.

He studied the Fourth Patron with clear amusement. This man could really spin a tale. If not for the spoilers, Qin Jiang might have actually believed him.

The Fourth Patron nodded vigorously. "Absolute misery! A fate worse than death!"

"Then shall I put you out of your misery?"

"Huh?"

Panic flashed across his face, and he scrambled to recover. "I can help you! With me on your side, overthrowing the tyrant is guaranteed! I'm close with the First Patron and the others—I can convince them to surrender! I'm useful!"

To survive, the Fourth Patron was prepared to become a complete and utter traitor.

Qin Jiang pondered for a moment. "A traitor can never be trusted."

The Fourth Patron opened his mouth to swear a Dao oath, but Qin Jiang spoke first: "A Dao oath? Meaningless for someone with no real future. What's the point?"

The Fourth Patron's eye twitched.

Then Qin Jiang produced a small black sphere in his palm.

"Swallow this, and I'll believe you."

The Fourth Patron gulped. "What is that?"

"Swallow it."

With six Great Emperors glaring daggers at him, the Fourth Patron choked back his protests and swallowed the sphere.

Qin Jiang grinned. "Feel anything?"

The Fourth Patron probed carefully, then shook his head. Nothing.

"Good. From now on, you're one of us."

"That pill..."

The Fourth Patron's unease remained. With six Emperor bodyguards, this young man's background was clearly extraordinary, and anything he produced would be equally formidable. Worse, the Fourth Patron couldn't detect the pill's effects at all.

"Relax. As long as you don't betray me, it'll never activate."

"And if I do?"

"Then it sets you free, of course. You said life was worse than death, right? This pill can end that suffering."

The Fourth Patron went rigid. Poison. Emperor-killing poison. Terrifying.

He shuffled off after the ancestors, his face a mask of gloom.

With this addition, Qin Jiang now commanded eight Great Emperors—matching the Divine Dragon Continent's remaining eight. A perfectly even playing field.

"Qin Jiang, what did you give the Fourth Patron?" Long Xin'er asked.

"A lethal poison. A blend of ninety-five percent of all known toxins in existence. It could kill a Great Emperor—possibly even an immortal-path cultivator."

"Then the Fourth Patron..."

"He's fine. It only activates on my command. As long as he stays loyal, he lives."

In truth, the pill was nothing more than a botched alchemic experiment—a complete dud with zero effects. If you ate enough of them, they might fill your stomach. But as long as Qin Jiang never said otherwise, everyone would believe the Fourth Patron had swallowed an Emperor-killing poison.

With the Fourth Patron clearing the way, they proceeded unhindered straight to the imperial city.

When the colossal airship loomed over the city walls, every citizen froze. How had something this massive made it here? It was an act of supreme disrespect.

Before anyone could intercept, the Fourth Patron burst from the ship, his Emperor aura blasting in all directions. The palace guards scrambled to greet him, bowing respectfully—

"Out of my way!"

He sent them flying.

Everyone stared. The Fourth Patron was famously the most approachable of the Emperor-level Patrons. What had gotten into him?

Did he forget his medication?

The Fourth Patron swept his gaze over the crowd, took a deep breath, then roared toward the palace:

"Tyrant! Today, this old man shall carry out Heaven's will and overthrow your tyranny! The old heaven is dead—a new heaven shall rise! Your mandate has ended, tyrant! Bare your neck and accept your fate, or don't blame me for showing no mercy!"

His thunderous declaration echoed across the entire city.

Everyone froze solid.

The Fourth Patron had rebelled?

He wanted to overthrow the Divine Dragon Empire?

This... was rather sudden.

His secrecy had been remarkable, they thought—not a whisper until this final moment, when he bared his fangs. Clearly, he'd prepared thoroughly.

Was the Divine Dragon Continent about to descend into chaos?

The crowd stared at the Fourth Patron. Nobody had expected the most gentle and personable of the four Patrons to choose the path of revolution.

Inside the palace, the Dragon Emperor had been reviewing memorials. Hearing the shout, he paused mid-stroke.

"The Fourth Patron wants to overthrow my... tyranny?"

He blinked in confusion, set down his brush, and walked outside, gazing toward the city gates.

The three remaining Patrons materialized beside him, equally bewildered.

What was their Fourth Brother doing?

Had he lost his mind?

The Dragon Emperor looked at the Fourth Patron posturing in mid-air, then turned to the First Patron.

"What's going on?"

The four Patrons had always been close as brothers. If the Fourth was rebelling, the other three surely knew—and might even be in on it.

"Well..." The First Patron's expression was complicated. After a moment's thought, he offered: "Is it possible he's... joking?"

"Joking?"

The Dragon Emperor's face went black. He let out a cold snort.

"It had better be."

The three Patrons laughed awkwardly.

"Your Majesty, shall we go have a look?"

"Are you sure the Fourth Patron won't ask me to bare my neck?"

The First Patron had no answer for that.
