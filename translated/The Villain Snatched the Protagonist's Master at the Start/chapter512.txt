Over the course of the lesson, Qin Jiang helped Yun Bao unlock several new techniques. After most of a day, she finally encountered the "treasure" he'd promised.

Almost instinctively, she swallowed it.

Then her face went crimson.

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow, tilting her chin up with a grin. "Like it?"

"It's... it's okay~"

Yun Bao answered, thoroughly flustered.

Qin Jiang chuckled, hoisted her up by her hips, and cradled her against him. "Want more?"

"Mm~ I'm a little tired~"

She draped her arms around his neck, her entire body pressed against him. Her cultivation was modest—she didn't have endless stamina.

Qin Jiang was nothing if not considerate. He carried Yun Bao to the Void Divine Temple, picked out a room for her, tidied it up, and set her on the bed.

"Rest up. But your lessons aren't over—once you've recovered, we're continuing."

"Okay~"

Yun Bao nodded obediently.

Qin Jiang ruffled her hair, kissed her forehead, and smiled. "Sleep well."

"Mm~"

With that, Qin Jiang left the room. Yun Bao alone was nowhere near enough. Unfortunately, the other women were still recovering from the group session.

His eyes roamed and landed on a particular door. There was one person who hadn't participated in the last training session.

His lovely mother-in-law.

A smile crept across Qin Jiang's face. It had been days since he'd visited her. Surely she missed him.

Without hesitation, he headed for Murong Qing's room and knocked.

"Mother-in-law, are you in?"

Silence. Not a sound from inside. Qin Jiang blinked. Had days of neglect made her angry?

He cleared his throat, about to call out something more saccharine, when the door swung open. To his surprise, it was Xue Yue who answered.

'Ah. She's been keeping her mother company.'

Her back to Murong Qing, Xue Yue shot Qin Jiang a flat look. "Come in."

"Uh... sure."

Qin Jiang scratched his head. Past Xue Yue, he caught Murong Qing's eye—she glared at him and quickly looked away, clearly warning him to behave.

Inside, an awkward silence settled over the room. It was Murong Qing who broke it, turning to Qin Jiang with a composed expression.

"Did you need something?"

"A small matter."

Qin Jiang nodded, sneaking her a suggestive eyebrow-raise that left nothing to the imagination.

Murong Qing's nose wrinkled, but she recovered in an instant. "What matter?"

"It's... a bit delicate to discuss."

Qin Jiang said with a meaningful blink.

Xue Yue pursed her lips. As if she didn't know why he was here. He'd come to carry on the affair. And judging by his coyness, he clearly wasn't planning to come clean.

Sneaking around had become a fetish at this point.

Murong Qing, naturally, understood his intentions too. But with Xue Yue present, she couldn't indulge him. She silently willed him to say nothing compromising while searching for a way to send her daughter elsewhere.

"What's so delicate?" she asked with studied casualness, sneaking glances at Xue Yue—partly to check whether her daughter had caught on, partly to see if she might leave of her own accord.

Xue Yue showed no signs of departing.

"Yes, what's so hard to say?"

Xue Yue chimed in. Murong Qing's heart seized. She prayed Qin Jiang wouldn't do something reckless and blurt out the truth. She fixed him with a death stare, fists clenched in warning.

Qin Jiang glanced at Xue Yue and smiled easily. "Actually, it's nothing too sensitive. I heard Auntie Qing'er has hit a cultivation bottleneck. I happened to be free, so I thought I'd see if I could help."

"That's right—I have hit a bottleneck."

Murong Qing seized the excuse gratefully. It was... passable. At least better than the truth.

Xue Yue, meanwhile, thought to herself that only an idiot would buy this. But she played along with an innocent expression. If Qin Jiang wanted his little game, she'd oblige. Besides, her mother clearly wasn't ready to face reality.

"Qin Jiang does have plenty of rare treasures. He should have something to help Mother break through."

"Of course I do." Qin Jiang nodded with supreme confidence. "Whatever Auntie Qing'er needs, I have."

Under the table, his hand crept over and gave Murong Qing's thigh a sly squeeze. The three of them sat around a small round table—Qin Jiang and Xue Yue side by side, Murong Qing slightly farther away, but still within arm's reach. With the table providing cover, subtle movements went unseen.

Murong Qing stiffened at his touch. Her hand slipped beneath the table to push him away, but Qin Jiang caught it and held on.

"What does Auntie Qing'er need?" he asked with an impish smile.

His boldness was outrageous—brazenly flirting while his hand worked mischief below the table, all of it right under Xue Yue's nose. Murong Qing felt her composure crumbling. She stole a guilty look at Xue Yue, and finding no suspicious reaction, managed a breath of relief.

"I need some Blood Crystal Stones. Premium-grade ones, ideally. They might help me break through."

Blood Crystal Stones were a legitimate high-tier resource for the Blood Tribe, commonly used during bottleneck breakthroughs. The excuse held water.

"Blood Crystal Stones? I have those. But I've got something even better suited for Auntie Qing'er." Qin Jiang gave her a suggestive smirk. "Unfortunately, it hasn't matured yet. I can't give it to you just now."

"That's fine."

Murong Qing's face burned. The scoundrel was propositioning her in broad daylight—and his hidden hand hadn't stopped its wandering. Right in front of Xue Yue!

She felt herself reaching her limit, her gaze on Qin Jiang tinged with reproach.

"Tell you what—once it's ready, I'll deliver it personally. How's that?"

"That works."

"Well then, I'll take my leave. Yue-yue, walk with me?"

"Sure."

Xue Yue agreed, turning to Murong Qing. "I'm heading out, Mother."

"All right~"

Qin Jiang's hand had already withdrawn. Even so, Murong Qing stayed seated, watching them go.

Only when the door clicked shut did her body sag. Hands braced against the table, she stared at the closed door, teeth sinking into her lip.

"Scoundrel~"
