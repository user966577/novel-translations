"Whew — that was one realistic illusion."

In the mist, students were waking up, shaken but intact. The illusion had shown each of them their worst fears. Fortunately, most had strong enough dao hearts to endure. They'd been rattled, not broken.

Those who'd already recovered looked around at their peers — many were still trapped, faces contorted in pain, some screaming aloud.

Ye Xuan had woken early. She drew a steadying breath and glanced at Li Yang, who was thrashing and howling beside her, tears streaming down his face.

'Pathetic,' she thought.

She looked ahead. They had to be close to the academy by now. She'd finally get to see Qin Jiang. The thought brought a flutter of excitement — immediately followed by a wave of melancholy.

'If only I'd always been born female. Then I wouldn't be... tainted. Maybe I'd have had a chance with him.'

She sighed. Fate was cruel.

Li Yang was still drowning in the illusion. In his eyes, Qin Jiang had grown more savage by the second. After Li Yang's desperate shout, the villain had pulled Ye Xuan into his arms. His hands moved with a predator's precision — every action magnified, every detail searing itself into Li Yang's vision.

"Let her go!" Li Yang screamed, thrashing uselessly. He'd been kicked down and couldn't rise — could only watch as the girl who'd shown him kindness was violated before his eyes.

Qin Jiang laughed. He kissed Ye Xuan roughly, his hands tearing at her clothes. Pale skin emerged inch by inch. She cried and strained against him, her tearful gaze fixed on Li Yang, as though he were her last hope.

But he was powerless.

"Hahaha! Worthless! Does it sting? Does it make you rage?" Qin Jiang's voice boomed with malicious glee. "Watch closely — every woman you care about, I'll take from you!"

"Now open your eyes and see exactly how I ruin her."

"No! Please — stop! Don't touch her, please, I'm begging you—"

Li Yang wept and begged, but nothing changed. Qin Jiang continued his assault while Li Yang's vision blurred with tears. He could barely see anymore, but the sounds were inescapable — Qin Jiang's triumphant laughter, Ye Xuan's desperate cries for help.

He was inches from collapse.

Meanwhile, in reality, Ye Xuan frowned. Whatever this fool was experiencing, it involved her name — he kept shouting "Let her go!" and "Don't touch her!" Just from those two phrases, she could piece together the picture.

She wrinkled her nose. 'This creep's subconscious has me being assaulted? The illusion reflects his inner fears, so somewhere deep down, he imagines me getting—'

She was disgusted. Then she noticed something: blood was seeping from his eyes. Two crimson trails ran down his cheeks.

'He's actually breaking down? Over an illusion?'

Unbelievable. Among all the students, Li Yang was the first to suffer a genuine mental collapse. Others who hadn't woken yet were nowhere near this bad.

Inside the Chaos Sword, the three ancient sword spirits sensed the crisis. Li Yang's psyche was crumbling, his spiritual energy in total disarray. If this continued, his meridians would suffer permanent damage — and worse, he might become trapped in the illusion forever. A devastating blow to his dao heart.

They didn't hesitate. Concentrating their power, they drove a spike of pain directly into his Primordial Spirit.

Li Yang screamed and crumpled, clutching his skull, rolling across the ice. The agony was blinding — but effective. His eyes cracked open.

He stared blankly at his surroundings. He was still on the ice staircase. And Ye Xuan was right beside him — whole, unharmed, untouched.

"Li Yang, what happened in your illusion? You looked like you were in terrible pain." She knelt and helped him sit up, straightening his disheveled clothes with gentle hands.

"Illusion? That was all an illusion?"

She nodded. 'This idiot still doesn't realize it was fake? How did he even wake up?'

"I..." He opened his mouth, looked at her, and felt a rush of embarrassment. He could hardly tell her what he'd seen. "It was... nothing."

He managed a strained smile. But warmth kindled in his chest — in the illusion, when he'd been trampled, Ye Xuan was the one who helped him up. And in reality... the same.

Here she was: lifting him, tidying his clothes, genuine concern in her eyes. Even more caring than her illusion counterpart.

He gazed at her, eyes soft with tenderness. But then the illusion's horrors crashed back, and fear gripped him. Qin Jiang was actually here, at Huaxia Academy. What if those nightmarish scenes played out for real?

He looked toward the campus and, for the first time, felt dread.

Ye Xuan was radiant now — poised and lovely. But in his mind, he kept seeing the version that had been brutalized.

"The illusion was probably the last test," Ye Xuan said. "Once everyone wakes up, we should be able to enter the academy."

She gazed ahead, eyes bright with anticipation. 'Finally — I get to see Qin Jiang.'

Watching her expression, Li Yang blurted out: "We should be careful inside the academy. There might be... dangers."

Ye Xuan shook her head and gave him a look. "There won't be. Huaxia Academy was founded by the lord of Huaxia — he's from our Qin Domain. He's a good man. He built this place for our benefit. Why would there be danger? You're overthinking it."

She couldn't reveal that she already knew Qin Jiang personally, but hearing Li Yang cast aspersions on him — she couldn't help defending him. A worthless nobody like Li Yang, slandering Qin Jiang?

She wanted to slap him.
