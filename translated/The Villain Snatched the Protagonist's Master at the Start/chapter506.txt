The middle-aged man had no interest in inviting trouble. Since Wu Tian wasn't dead, there was no point using him as fertilizer. Better to just send him on his way and pretend they'd never met.

Wu Tian, however, was reluctant to leave. His condition was terrible. He might be conscious now, but if he left, he'd probably collapse again before he got very far, and who knew where he'd end up then. At least this place seemed safe.

Looking at the father and daughter, he spoke up sheepishly. "Could I... stay here for a while?"

"..."

The pair exchanged glances. The nerve of this man!

Wu Tian could read their reluctance. He hurried to press his case. "Don't worry. The moment my injuries heal, I'll leave immediately. And I'll repay you handsomely afterward—I promise you'll be satisfied. I'm from the Wu family."

The Wu family, as a True Immortal clan, still carried some reputation in Mystic Cloud Heaven.

"The Wu family?"

Both father and daughter looked surprised. The Wu family was no small power. Surely they were wealthy.

But then they studied Wu Tian with skeptical eyes. "You're really from the Wu family?"

In truth, the middle-aged man had already searched Wu Tian's body while burying him. He'd gone through everything and found nothing of value.

Flat broke.

Could someone this poor really be from the Wu family?

Hearing the man's question, Wu Tian suddenly recalled his ordeal at the Huaxia branch office. Were they going to make him prove his identity again?

The thought alone gave him a headache. His mind swam, his body swayed, and he promptly passed out.

"..."

The father and daughter stared as Wu Tian crumpled. The middle-aged man walked over and gave him a kick. No response.

The girl blinked her pretty eyes and pointed at the nearby hole. "Should we bury him again?"

"He's not dead yet."

The man rolled his eyes. He crouched beside Wu Tian and examined him, then said in surprise, "His injuries have actually improved a little. Could it be that being buried in the soil helps him recover?"

He looked at the pit, a thoughtful expression on his face. If this man really was from the Wu family, saving his life should be a worthwhile investment. There'd surely be some reward.

After a moment's consideration, the man slapped his thigh decisively. Save first, profit later.

With a gentle shove, he rolled Wu Tian back into the hole and filled it in.

Patting the earth flat, he nodded in satisfaction. "There. His injuries should recover faster this way."

"Will that really work?"

The girl eyed the freshly packed soil doubtfully.

The middle-aged man answered with conviction. "Of course it will! Before, he was practically dead, but after being buried for less than half a day, his injuries improved. It has to be because of his special constitution. My theory is that he can absorb energy from the earth. Burying him speeds up his healing."

"I see. That is a pretty unusual constitution."

The girl nodded along.

The man chuckled. "The world is full of wonders. Look at us—we're not exactly normal either."

"Don't remind me. Always hiding, always running," she pouted.

The man laughed awkwardly and scratched his head. "Well, I'm just not strong enough yet. Once I break through to True Immortal, we won't have to hide anymore. If this Wu family man really can give us some treasures, maybe I'll be able to make an attempt at True Immortal."

"But there are Immortal Kings in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands now," the girl said with a sigh.

This father-daughter pair truly were unusual—unusual enough to attract dangerous attention, which forced them into a life of constant concealment. The girl's observation left her father with nothing to say. He could only shake his head.

"Getting stronger is always better."

He waved a hand and looked at the freshly filled hole. "All right. Go get some rest. I'll keep watch here."

"Okay."

The girl nodded and headed back to the cottage.

The middle-aged man took a deep breath, his smile fading, fist clenching slightly. "I need to get stronger," he murmured.

Time passed. This time, Wu Tian was out much longer—a full three days before consciousness returned. That same oppressive, suffocating sensation immediately closed in around him.

"..."

Wu Tian opened his mouth with difficulty and was instantly hit by the taste of raw earth.

Buried again?

Were these two idiots?

Had they assumed he was dead again?

He tried to take a deep breath and inhaled a mouthful of dirt, nearly choking to death. Frantically, he began struggling to free himself. But this time, the man had packed the soil much more tightly, and Wu Tian's injuries had actually worsened rather than improved. He was utterly drained.

After a long, exhausting fight, he finally broke through the surface.

Shaking off the dirt, he opened his eyes to find the father and daughter staring directly at him. Their gazes locked.

The middle-aged man broke into a smile and spoke up cheerfully. "You're awake! How are your injuries? Feeling better?"

"???"

Wu Tian was speechless. You buried me alive, and you're asking about my recovery?

If they'd simply left him lying around, he could have absorbed moonlight to heal. But buried underground with no moonlight reaching him—what was he supposed to recover with?

Not a damn thing!

Wu Tian's emotions flared and his head spun, nearly blacking out again. But he forced himself to stay conscious, terrified that if he passed out, they'd bury him a third time.

After several deep breaths, he looked at the man and asked, "Why did you bury me?"

"???"

The man blinked, genuinely confused. "Doesn't being in the ground help you recover faster?"

"Who told you that?"

"Before, you were practically... ahem, you were dead. But after I buried you, you came back to life. Isn't that because the soil has a special healing effect on you?"

The man looked utterly innocent.

Wu Tian's face went black. Looking at their guileless expressions, the frustration threatened to boil over. But he swallowed it. They'd meant well, after all. And in his current state, antagonizing them would be unwise.

Pushing down his emotions, Wu Tian spoke evenly. "I wasn't dead before. And being buried doesn't have any special healing effect on me."

"Oh..."

Hearing this, the man's face flushed with embarrassment. He coughed awkwardly and rubbed his hands together. "Sorry about that. I really thought burying you would help you heal faster. So, uh... are you okay now?"
