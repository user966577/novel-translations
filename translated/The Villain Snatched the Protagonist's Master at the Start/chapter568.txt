Five days.

Under Qin Jiang's diligent care, the Merfolk Empress's poison was finally and completely purged.

She lay draped across his chest, face flushed. In truth, her clarity had returned two days ago, but with the poison still active, she'd gone along with things—half-willing, half-helpless. She'd nearly lost herself in it.

Now she was fully lucid, and the reality of the past five days settled over her. She looked up at Qin Jiang, wanting to say something but unsure how to begin.

Five days of uninterrupted intimacy, and they'd never actually talked. She didn't know what came next. One thing was certain, though—he was her man now.

"Something on your mind?"

He noticed her hesitation and prompted gently.

The Empress blushed and lowered her gaze. "Thank you," she said softly.

"Please. It was nothing."

He smiled. "Besides, you've already repaid me. We're even."

"???"

She blinked. When had she repaid him?

He grinned, and his hand found its way to its favorite resting place. "I quite enjoyed the payment."

She felt his touch and turned scarlet. Now she understood. That kind of repayment.

But it had all been part of saving her—did that really count?

Lost in thought, she didn't pull away. If anything, she subtly pressed closer. If he liked it, then this was how she'd thank him.

She liked it too.

Before long, her eyes had gone hazy again. He leaned down, lips brushing her ear. "Your Majesty... you're so wet."

"Mm~"

She murmured a soft affirmation, lost in sensation, responding to him on autopilot.

"You said you wanted to thank me?"

"Mm~"

"Would you give yourself to me?"

"Mm~"

Whatever he said, she agreed. Qin Jiang smiled. "I'm keeping track of everything you just promised."

"Mm~"

She kept agreeing, eyes half-lidded, enjoying his attention. Then her hands found his neck and she pulled him down into a kiss—initiating for the first time.

Her brow creased and her arms tightened as she breathed against his lips, "You saved me... let me repay you."

She exhaled long and slow, then collapsed against his chest, needing several minutes to recover. When she finally opened her eyes, shyness colored her features.

Qin Jiang looked down, teasing. "Your Majesty, that's quite the generous repayment."

"Mm~ I didn't expect to have so much to give."

She was mortified. Then, tentatively: "Did you like it?"

"I'm a bit thirsty."

"Huh?"

She searched his face and caught the distinctly predatory gleam in his eyes. Understanding dawned.

Head bowed, voice small: "Then... shall I pour you some water?"

"Please."
