As for her mother's feelings, Xue Yue wasn't worried. She trusted Qin Jiang. If he wanted to, it would take him about five minutes.

While Xue Yue's mind wandered, Murong Qing was weighing her options. Truthfully, she wanted to stay with her daughter. Her original family had cut ties over the political marriage. The Blood Tribe chief was a husband in name only -- they'd never had real feelings, and Xue Yue's expulsion had severed the last thread. Add in the fact that she'd had Qin Jiang kill a Blood Tribe elder, and the entire tribe was hostile territory.

Xue Yue was the only person she had left. But being with Xue Yue meant being around Qin Jiang...

"Would it be... awkward?" she asked, embarrassed.

She didn't know Qin Jiang well, but she knew he was surrounded by beautiful women -- and they were with him constantly. If she lived with them, she'd be right in the middle of it. What if she accidentally saw something?

She glanced at Qin Jiang. Actually, accidentally seeing something wouldn't be the worst thing. Easy on the eyes, if nothing else. Leagues above the Blood Tribe chief. And with that many women, his stamina was probably impressive. Xue Yue's complexion alone was proof of that.

The thought turned her cheeks crimson. What was she thinking? She couldn't have those feelings about her daughter's man.

She took a deep breath and steadied herself.

"It won't be awkward at all," Qin Jiang said. "Our place is enormous. More than enough room for one more."

"He's right," Xue Yue chimed in. "You'll love it with us."

Between the two of them, Murong Qing's hesitation crumbled. "Alright. I'll come with you."

"Great." Qin Jiang pointed to the airship nearby. "Pack your things tonight. I'll take you back tomorrow."

Murong Qing agreed. It was getting late, the sky already darkening. Qin Jiang didn't return to the airship. He and Xue Yue stayed at Murong Qing's residence, in the room she'd always kept for her daughter. Naturally, Qin Jiang shared that room with Xue Yue.

Deep into the night, Murong Qing lay in her own bed, blankets pulled up to her chin, face burning. The sounds coming from Xue Yue's room were unmistakable. And loud.

'That girl has no restraint at all. Does she have to be that loud?'

She was starting to regret agreeing to come along. If Xue Yue was anything to go by, this kind of disturbance would be constant -- and probably worse. A day or two was manageable, but over time, she'd never last.

Listening to the sounds, Qin Jiang's image surfaced in her mind. Her hand crept downward before she could stop it.

"Mm~"

A soft moan escaped her lips. She immediately clamped both hands over her mouth, terrified of being heard. Eyes half-shut, brow furrowed, she lay rigid, both hands pressed tight over her lips.

It took a full hour before she could open her eyes again.

She let out a long, shaky breath. Her hair was disheveled, her forehead damp with sweat.

After resting for a moment, she pulled the blanket over her face. 'I can't believe I just -- while thinking about my own--'

She cursed herself silently.

Once she'd calmed down, she peeked out again. The sounds from Xue Yue's room hadn't stopped.

'That long?'

She swallowed. Suddenly she felt warm again. Her hands found their way back before she could stop them.

The entire night, the sounds never ceased. And Murong Qing never stopped listening.

By dawn, she was exhausted. She forced herself upright and hastily cleaned the room. If Xue Yue came in and noticed anything, the smell alone would give her away.

She tidied up quickly and stepped outside. Xue Yue's door was still closed, the sounds finally silent. Murong Qing sat on a stone bench in the courtyard.

Soon, the door opened and Qin Jiang walked out.

"Morning."

His smile made her avert her eyes, cheeks flaring. She'd been thinking about him all night. "Morning."

He sat across from her and studied her face. "You look a bit worn out."

"Huh? Do I?"

He nodded. "Did something tire you out?"

Her heart skipped. She was tired, yes -- but she could hardly explain why. She'd lost count of how many times. And it had been her first time going that far. All because of the sounds, and the thought of him.

She nodded silently.

Qin Jiang stood and moved behind her, placing his warm palm on her head. She jolted, cheeks reddening.

"What are you--"

"Heh, I happen to know a technique for relieving fatigue. Let me give you a massage."

"Oh." She shifted slightly. Something felt off, but she didn't say anything.

After a while, he spoke. "By the way -- can I call you Qing'er?"

Her heart lurched. That name resonated somewhere deep. But it wasn't appropriate. At all.

"No! Don't just give me nicknames. I'm Yueyue's--"

There was a petulant edge to her protest.

Qin Jiang chuckled, leaning down until his head nearly rested on her shoulder. "Then... how about Auntie Qing'er?"

Adding "auntie" made it... acceptable. Barely.

She nodded. "Fine."
