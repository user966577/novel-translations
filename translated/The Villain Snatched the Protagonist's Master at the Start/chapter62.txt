Inside Qin Lian'er's residence, intense flames roared. Phoenix cries rang out in succession, and overhead, flocks of birds circled the estate in a frenzy of awed screeching.

Qin Jiang and Qin Lian'er stood before the Phoenix Egg, which reached up to their waists. Cracks had already begun to spread across its surface, extreme heat bleeding through the fissures as flames erupted from within.

"The temperature is incredible." Qin Jiang let out a low whistle and erected a barrier to keep the heat at bay.

Beside him, Qin Lian'er watched the egg with barely contained excitement. She'd been incubating it all this time, and now it was finally ready to hatch. The cracks multiplied and the surrounding temperature continued to climb.

"Fitting for a divine beast. It hasn't even been born yet and this heat could already kill a Golden Body Realm cultivator," Qin Jiang estimated aloud.

Qin Lian'er giggled. "Brother, Little Red is already at Heavenly Soul Realm. With her divine beast physique, she could burn a Divine Ability Realm cultivator to death."

"Little Red?"

"Yeah! That's the baby phoenix. I named her, hehe. Cute, right?"

Qin Jiang's lips twitched. Cute or not aside, the name certainly had that "easy to raise" quality to it. "How do you know she's at Heavenly Soul Realm?" he asked.

"I can communicate with her! Incubating an egg is so boring—if I couldn't talk to Little Red, I would've given up ages ago." Without someone to chat with, the daily routine of feeding spiritual energy into an egg would have driven her mad.

As they spoke, a bright cry rang out from within the egg—clear and melodious, instantly drawing their attention. With a sharp crack, a tiny beak began pecking at the shell from inside. In moments, a sizable chunk had broken away.

Then a streak of red light shot out and appeared before Qin Lian'er in the blink of an eye.

"Big Sis Lian'er! I can finally see you!" The crisp little voice brimmed with delight.

Qin Lian'er stared in astonishment. "You... you're Little Red?"

"Yep, yep!" Little Red flapped her tiny wings and nodded vigorously.

Qin Jiang looked at the phoenix, then back at the egg. That enormous thing—half as tall as a person—had produced a phoenix the size of... a fist. He held his fist up next to Little Red for comparison. His lips twitched. The phoenix was actually smaller than his hand.

Qin Lian'er was equally dumbfounded. Such a massive egg, and this was what came out? That didn't add up at all. "You're... so tiny," she said blankly.

She'd been imagining riding a majestic phoenix mount. At this rate, she'd end up being the mount.

Little Red looked down at herself. "I was just born! I'll grow bigger!"

With that, she fluttered back to the broken eggshell and began pecking at it with astonishing speed, devouring nearly half in just a few breaths. Her little belly was noticeably rounder as she wobbled back to Qin Lian'er's shoulder.

"Big Sis Lian'er, can you save the rest of the shell for me? I'll eat it later."

"The shell is useful to you?"

"Yeah! Look, haven't I already gotten a little bigger?"

Qin Lian'er examined her closely, then said with deadpan sincerity, "I think you got fatter."

Little Red: "..."

"I'm not fatter, I grew!" she protested.

Qin Jiang couldn't help but laugh. "She really did grow a bit. She was smaller than my fist before—now she's about the same size."

Qin Lian'er relented and collected the remaining shell fragments. The temperature inside the residence began dropping, and the birds that had been circling overhead edged closer, drawn by the presence of their sovereign.

Phoenix—king of all birds. These common birds were compelled to pay homage to their ruler.

The incessant chirping was getting annoying, though. Qin Lian'er tapped Little Red on the head. "Can you make these birds leave?"

"Of course!" Little Red lifted her head proudly and let out a single commanding cry. The birds responded in kind, then reluctantly dispersed.

"Impressive," Qin Jiang remarked.

Little Red preened, puffing herself up with pride. "We phoenixes are the kings of all birds! Every winged creature must obey us!"

"Really?" Qin Jiang's curiosity got the better of him. "I've heard there's something called a Kunpeng that's incredibly powerful. Do they obey phoenixes too?"

Little Red: "..."

"And Golden Crows. And Luan Birds. Oh, and I've heard Vermilion Birds are even stronger than phoenixes."

Little Red: "..."

She shot Qin Jiang a glare, turned her head away, and refused to acknowledge him. This person just had to go poking at sore spots.

Qin Lian'er stifled a laugh and stroked Little Red's feathers. "Brother, stop teasing her."

Qin Jiang spread his hands. He'd only been curious, but it seemed that even among birds, there were quite a few species that could challenge the phoenix's authority. A bit disappointing, frankly. Divine beasts weren't as supreme as he'd imagined.

At least Little Red was well-suited to Qin Lian'er. That was something.

The commotion naturally didn't escape the Qin family's notice. Before long, word of a phoenix's birth had spread to every high-ranking member of the clan. Given the family's current strength, they didn't bother keeping it secret—with four Great Emperors, they could protect virtually anything short of Immortal Fire. A phoenix's emergence only further demonstrated the Qin family's might.

"Is that a phoenix?"

"Why is it so small? Was it premature?"

"Heh, the little thing's got quite the temper—she just glared at me."

"Born at Heavenly Soul Realm. Worthy of a divine beast. Once she matures, she'll be at least a Supreme, and reaching Great Emperor wouldn't be difficult."

"A phoenix paired with Little Lian'er's Nirvana Divine Body—a perfect match."

A gaggle of ancestral elders crowded around Qin Lian'er, peering at the tiny phoenix. Little Red glared right back. These old codgers had no manners. One of them had even called her premature. 'You're the premature one!'

Though the ones who complimented her were at least tolerable. That particular elderly gentleman had decent taste.

The ancestral elders didn't linger long. With four Great Emperors in the family, a baby phoenix was a novelty at best—hardly earth-shattering. They'd come for a peek, nothing more.

Within days, discussion of Little Red had faded within the Qin family. What the outside world made of it, however, was none of their concern.
