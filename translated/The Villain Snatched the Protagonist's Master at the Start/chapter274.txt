The Chaos District.

Deep underground, layers upon layers of seals blanketed an array of formation runes. Through the wards, one could just make out an elegant silhouette sitting in quiet meditation.

A slender hand moved, formation runes flashed, and she appeared outside the seal—clearly not her first time. This was a woman of breathtaking beauty.

She stretched languidly, her fitted robes tracing every curve with understated precision. A lazy smile played at the corner of her lips.

One step, and she vanished—reappearing in a dim, cavernous hall filled with standing figures. The instant she materialized, every person dropped to their knees in perfect unison.

She ascended the dais with an unhurried stride and sank into a cushioned chair, curling up like a cat. A delicate yawn escaped her, one hand rising to cover her mouth. Her gaze swept the assembled crowd.

"How are the preparations?"

"All is in order, my lady. The plan can be executed at your command."

She nodded. But then her subordinate hesitated.

"However... the River Dragon Gang that appeared recently may pose an issue."

"The River Dragon Gang?" Her eyes narrowed. She had some recollection of the upstart gang that had been making a ruckus on her turf. After teaching them a small lesson, she'd put them out of her mind.

"What about them?"

"Our investigation revealed that the River Dragon Gang's leader is the husband of Immortal Qing Chan from the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. Further inquiry uncovered that the gang's leader is far more than he appears."

She recalled sensing Qing Chan's aura in the Chaos District not long ago but hadn't thought much of it. So the woman had found a man—and he ran the River Dragon Gang. Interesting.

As she considered this, a subordinate produced a painted portrait and presented it with both hands. She unrolled it, and her lips curved.

"No wonder. Qing Chan always was shallow—looks are all she cares about. But this gang leader is genuinely the most beautiful man I've ever seen. I can't blame her for being taken."

At her gesture, the subordinate delivered a detailed briefing on Qin Jiang—from Qin Family City to Pill City to the Demon Domain—meticulous and thorough. Apart from certain secrets, they'd turned his life inside out.

By the end, even she was mildly impressed. This man was something out of the ordinary.

"My lady, we're concerned he may interfere with the plan."

She studied the portrait, a faint crease between her brows. An uncontrollable variable.

"Can you determine his true identity?"

The subordinate shook his head. "We only know he's not from Azure Cloud Heaven. He first appeared at the Myriad Pill Assembly with two Human Immortals in attendance. Tracing backward, we located Qin Family City. His precise origins remain unknown, but they are certainly not insignificant."

A Supreme with two Human Immortals willingly serving as escorts—even as wives and concubines. Even she couldn't compel that kind of loyalty.

Her gaze returned to the portrait. "That bearing... no ordinary faction could produce someone like this."

Silence settled over the hall, broken only by the soft sound of her fingers tracing the edge of the painting. A plan tens of thousands of years in the making could not afford disruption, and now an unknown had appeared.

At length, she addressed her subordinates. "Go bring him to me."

"Pardon?"

They exchanged nervous glances.

"Is that a problem?"

Her tone cooled. Beads of sweat formed on every brow.

"My lady, Immortal Qing Chan is almost always at his side. Beyond her, he has at least five Human Immortals in his retinue. We... we simply cannot."

Given the firepower around Qin Jiang, attempting a capture was indistinguishable from suicide. She frowned. Put that way, even if she went personally, success wasn't guaranteed.

"Ahem..." One subordinate cleared his throat and ventured carefully, "My lady, our intelligence indicates that this Qin Jiang is... exceptionally fond of beautiful women. Perhaps..."

"Oh?"

"Perhaps you might handle this personally." The man spoke with utmost delicacy. "Not through force, but through charm. Tame him into an obedient lapdog who answers only to you."

"???"

Her eyes narrowed to dangerous slits. She leaned forward, pinning the speaker with her gaze. She was half-convinced this man was a plant—suggesting she offer herself up?

"That's not what I meant!" he blurted, feeling her aura press down on him. He dropped to his knees. "I meant seduce and control, my lady—not... not actually give yourself to him. Make him heel. A puppet on your string."

She eased off, a contemplative look stealing across her features. The man gulped with relief and pressed his advantage.

"Given Qin Jiang's weakness for beauty, my lady's personal involvement would guarantee success."

She glanced at him, then back at the portrait, her lips curving into something between a smirk and genuine interest.

Taming a man. She'd never tried that before. And this particular man happened to be Qing Chan's husband. If she actually managed to turn him into her personal lapdog...

The mental image pleased her immensely.

But how, exactly, did one go about taming a man? She chewed her lip. Her experience with men was essentially nil.

After a moment's deliberation, she tossed her hair impatiently and addressed the room.

"Draft me a plan. Call it the Taming of Jiang Initiative. Objective: bend this Qin Jiang to my will until he's an obedient little dog who does exactly as I say."

"Uh..."

The assembled subordinates—men and women alike—stared. They'd devoted their lives to their mistress's grand scheme, with no time for romance or seduction. "Taming" was well outside their area of expertise.

But under her withering gaze, they could only swallow hard and agree. At least it beat trying to kidnap Qin Jiang by force. And while they personally knew nothing about the subject, they could find experts. Consult books and manuals. With this many people working on it, surely they could cobble together a plan.

...Right?
