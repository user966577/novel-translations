"Auntie Qing'er, you know -- I've lacked motherly love since I was little."

Qin Jiang gazed up at her with those earnest eyes. Murong Qing clenched her fist, fighting the urge to punch him.

She took a deep breath. Looking at his face, she noticed her own lips felt dry. Maybe he could help with that? His lips looked rather moist. And what if he really had been deprived of maternal love? As a mother figure, letting him experience affection was perfectly reasonable. Nothing wrong with that at all.

"Close your eyes first," she murmured.

"Okay."

He shut them immediately. Murong Qing waved a hand in front of his face to make sure, bit her lip, leaned down, and brushed a light kiss against his cheek. Before he could open his eyes, her lips drifted to his mouth for the briefest of touches.

Resting against her chest, Qin Jiang could hear her heartbeat racing. She was nervous.

He opened his eyes, mouth curving into a smile. "Thank you, Auntie Qing'er."

"You gave me a massage. Consider it a thank-you gift."

She shook her head, and he said nothing more. But she was still looking at him, clearly waiting for him to get up. He simply closed his eyes again, ignoring her completely.

Her eye twitched. Shameless! But trying to make him get up would only trigger another round of "motherly love." So she sat there, half-cradling him, occasionally glancing toward Xue Yue's door. She felt a twinge of guilt. Qin Jiang was her daughter's man, and here they were, undeniably flirting.

"Don't bother looking. Yueyue won't be up until evening," he said, opening his eyes.

Until evening? Well, given that the sounds hadn't stopped all night, it made sense.

"A whole night... can her body handle that?" Murong Qing asked, a touch worried.

"Oh?" He raised an eyebrow, a knowing look in his eyes. "When Auntie Qing'er says 'a whole night,' what exactly do you mean?"

She flushed. She couldn't very well admit she'd been listening all night. It wasn't eavesdropping, exactly -- Xue Yue had just been that loud. She simply hadn't blocked out the sound.

"You know perfectly well what I mean," she shot back.

"I do. But I'm curious how Auntie Qing'er found out. Were you listening all night? Or perhaps watching?"

"I was not!" Her voice rose, but she immediately lowered it, worried about waking Xue Yue. "I just... happened to hear."

"Happened to?"

"Yes!"

"Ah. Quite the coincidence."

His expression said everything. Murong Qing looked away, unable to hold his gaze. To change the subject, she jostled him lightly. "Are you going to get up?"

"No."

"You--"

"I've lacked mother--"

"Stop! Stop, stop!"

She cut him off instantly. That phrase was giving her a migraine.

She looked down at him, shaking her head helplessly. He was impossible. It was strange, having him in her arms like this, but with Xue Yue asleep, she felt herself relaxing.

Then he shifted in her embrace, nose twitching. She tapped his head lightly. "Hold still."

Knowing Xue Yue wouldn't emerge anytime soon had made her bolder. Qin Jiang sniffed a few times. "There's an odd smell."

The color drained from her face, then returned as a deep crimson. She bit her lip. "There's no smell. You're imagining things."

"There really is!"

He began actively searching, nose tracking the scent to its source. Murong Qing shoved at him in a panic. If he figured out where it was coming from, she'd die of humiliation.

"You -- get off!"

She pushed and protested, her tone leaving no room for argument. But he was immovable. After sniffing around for a while, he stopped. "Must have been my imagination."

She exhaled in relief and gave him a gentle push. "Told you."

She stopped fighting and gathered him back into her arms. It did feel nice, holding him like this. If she could actually explore a little more -- get her hands on the real thing -- it would feel even better.

She looked down at Qin Jiang. Even through his clothes, she could feel it. He was in excellent shape. Abs, chest, and the most important muscle of all. She wanted to touch everything.

Her hand moved on its own. A tentative brush at first. When Qin Jiang didn't react, she let her fingers rest on his abdomen.

They were real.

Her eyes lit up. She pressed gently. The firmness beneath her fingertips was intoxicating. Too bad she could only touch and not see.

A flicker of regret crossed her face. Then she noticed Qin Jiang staring straight at her.

She froze, snatching her hand back. "I -- there was a bug. I was brushing it off."

"Oh."

"There really was!"

"Mm-hm."

"I'm serious. Believe me!"

"I believe you."

He blinked innocently. Murong Qing wanted to crawl into a hole. What had possessed her to actually act on it? This was her son-in-law. The mortification was unbearable.

But she couldn't blame herself entirely. She hadn't touched a man in years, and here was this impossibly attractive specimen burrowing into her arms, practically begging to be felt up. Who could resist? If he weren't already Xue Yue's man, she'd have jumped him ages ago.
