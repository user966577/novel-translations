What followed was the most enthusiastic beauty pageant Mystic Cloud Heaven had ever seen. With only ten days and Huaxia's sword hanging overhead, the factions were desperate to please.

They understood that the "lost wife" story was a pretext. Fail to provide a satisfactory answer, and the next step would be invasion. Many had already decided to submit—the holdouts were simply afraid of what submission would cost them individually.

Every senior clan member threw their own daughters and granddaughters into the running. If their blood relative caught Qin Jiang's eye, their personal safety would be guaranteed—their status might even rise.

Those without presentable heirs cast a wider net, scouring all of Mystic Cloud Heaven for beauties. If necessary, they'd adopt someone on the spot. A foster daughter was still a connection. A foster mother, even.

In ten short days, tens of thousands of women were assembled and brought to the airship.

Qin Jiang surveyed the crowd from the deck. It was the most women he'd ever seen in one place.

"You're not going to take all of them, are you?" the women beside him asked nervously.

His eye twitched. "Obviously not."

He couldn't handle tens of thousands—and more importantly, 99 percent didn't meet his standards. But there were undeniably some exceptional beauties in the crowd.

He scanned them carefully, made his selections, then descended from the airship. Liu Shuwan and An Xihe flanked him. The clan leaders bowed deeply.

He pointed to several women in turn. "These ones stay. The rest can go."

Those not chosen were disappointed but knew better than to protest. The masses departed. Thirteen remained—the most breathtaking of the lot, every one elegant and composed.

All except one.

She flinched when Qin Jiang looked at her, averting her gaze. He approached with a smile and reached for her hand. She instinctively pulled away.

"Are you afraid of me?"

She was visibly nervous, fidgeting. "No."

"What's your name?"

"Yingtao."

"Sounds delicious."

Her head dipped, cheeks coloring, heart pounding.

"Come with me?" he said.

He hadn't expected much from this exercise—just casting a wide net on the off chance something turned up. But the system had already chimed in. This girl was a fortune heroine. He just hadn't had time to read the details.

Wu Yingtao was overwhelmed. She'd only come because her family asked and promised cultivation resources in return. Out of tens of thousands, she'd never imagined being chosen.

She was from the Wu family, a nobody from a minor branch. She had an older brother who'd recently undergone a dramatic transformation—suddenly mature, hardworking, progressing at an absurd rate. But he hid his abilities, insisting that concealing one's strength was the best protection. He was always short on cultivation resources, so Yingtao had been sharing hers.

When the family offered generous resources for participating in the pageant, she and her brother agreed it was worth the trip. Surely she wouldn't be picked from among so many.

And yet here she was.

She looked at Qin Jiang timidly. Her brother had warned her—this man's reputation was colorful, to say the least.

"Can I... say no?" she asked in a small voice.

Nearby, the Wu family representative's smile froze into a grimace of terror. He stared at Wu Yingtao, silently begging her not to provoke this man. The Wu family couldn't afford it.

Qin Jiang's smile didn't waver. "No."

She stood there helplessly, stealing glances at him. He wasn't as frightening as the rumors suggested. But follow him? Really?

While she deliberated, he simply took her hand. She flinched but couldn't pull free. Her cheeks reddened.

He drew her to his side, then addressed the assembled clan leaders. "I'll be taking this one."

"Of course! She's Wu family through and through, and she's long admired Manor Lord Qin. She's just shy—please don't hold it against her."

Qin Jiang nodded, then turned to the remaining twelve women. Only the one fortune heroine among them. The rest were beautiful, certainly, but held no strategic value.

No matter. One was enough.
