Deep in the Demon Domain.

Within a range of dark, brooding mountains, birds startled into flight at irregular intervals. Powerful figures flickered through the peaks, and occasionally the spectral silhouettes of enormous serpents materialized around them.

Every one of them belonged to the Snake Race. As one of the three great powers, they were nothing if not arrogant.

"Damn, that fox hid herself well. This many brothers searching and not a single trace."

"She is our Snake Race's empress. Naturally she has her methods. But watch your mouth—she's the one the prince has his eye on. If he hears you talking like that, you're a dead man."

"Heh, we're all brothers here, right? Besides, you've seen her too—tell me you didn't feel something. Before, nobody dared try anything, but she's wounded now. Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky..."

"You want to die? I'll do it myself—don't drag me into it! Wounded or not, she's still out of our league. Either she turns things around and becomes clan chief, or the prince makes her the chief's consort. Us? We're nothing. Is your skull packed with garbage? One more word and I'll put you down before the prince even has to bother!"

The mouthy one shrank back and went silent.

"Now move. Keep searching. She's definitely hiding somewhere in these mountains. Find her, and the prince will reward us handsomely."

The patrol moved on. Moments later, a shadow in the undergrowth rippled, and a figure tumbled out of concealment. Her face was deathly pale, a thread of blood tracing from the corner of her lips. She watched the Snake Race squad disappear into the distance, her beautiful eyes gleaming with cold fury.

She drew a steadying breath, regulated her breathing until her aura stabilized somewhat, then melted back into the shadows and vanished.

This was Yu Lan—the Snake Race Empress.

"Qin Jiang, this is Snake Race territory. Those people are incredibly aggressive. If we run into them..."

On a mountain peak overlooking the range, Qin Jiang surveyed the sprawling landscape. Beside him stood Xue Mei and Mo Mo. Jian Yao had stayed behind—Liu Shuwan was absorbing the Sword Dao Law, and having Jian Yao present would ease the process.

Xue Mei's lovely eyes were tinged with worry. The Snake Race was in an entirely different league from the Celestial Rabbit Tribe, and with all the current turmoil, one wrong step could put them at odds with an extremely dangerous enemy.

"Relax. We're not here to make enemies of the Snake Race," Qin Jiang said with a smile. "Who knows—we might even end up in-laws."

Xue Mei: "???"

Mo Mo pursed her lips. "Haven't figured it out yet? He's got his eyes on the Snake Race Empress. She's in a bad spot right now, and this one here—" she jabbed a thumb at Qin Jiang, "—is going to play the hero so he can steal her heart."

She knew him too well by now.

Qin Jiang smiled placidly. "The Snake Race Empress's beauty is famous even among humans. Coming all the way to the Demon Domain and not meeting her? What a waste."

"And what about me?" Xue Mei fixed him with a resentful stare. She didn't consider herself inferior to the empress, and in terms of strength, she was an Immortal—the empress was merely a fresh Ancient Emperor.

Sensing the jealousy, Qin Jiang swept an arm around Xue Mei's waist and murmured, "My little Mei is just low-key, that's all. In my heart, you're every bit her equal. And besides, don't you know just how much I adore you..."

"Hey—you scoundrel!"

Before he could finish, Xue Mei cut him off, face blazing. He hadn't even done anything yet, but his words alone conjured memories of... things. She took several deep breaths, suppressing the flutter in her chest, snuck a glance at Mo Mo, and pushed him away, cheeks burning.

Mo Mo pouted. What was there to be embarrassed about? The things she and Qin Jiang had done were far more outrageous. Though she had to admit, the early days still lingered in her memory. In hindsight, she shouldn't have given in so quickly.

Two hours later, Qin Jiang led the two women deep into the mountain range. With two Immortals flanking him, the Snake Race patrols didn't even register their presence.

"There doesn't seem to be anything special about this place," Xue Mei said, scanning their surroundings. Endless peaks, identical and unremarkable.

Qin Jiang smirked, shook his head, and drove a fist into the ground.

Mo Mo and Xue Mei blinked. The punch barely raised a cloud of dust—by rights, it should have cratered the earth.

Both women crouched down and rapped their knuckles against the stone.

"It's strangely hard."

"No—it's a formation. A concealment layer. You wouldn't notice unless you were actively probing."

Their eyes brightened. A formation meant someone had built this deliberately. Something was down there.

"I've heard that after the empress was sabotaged, everyone in her faction vanished without a trace," Qin Jiang said casually.

Both women looked at the ground. "You think they're hiding underground?"

Qin Jiang nodded. His eyes shimmered with inner light. In his vision, a vast formation blanketed the area, sealing away everything beneath it. Without his guidance, no one would have even found this place. An Immortal could force their way in with enough effort, but subtlety was impossible.

"Should we break the formation and go in?" Mo Mo asked, clenching her small fists. She didn't know formations, but brute force could handle this.

"We can't use force," Qin Jiang waved the suggestion off. Breaking it violently would draw every Snake Race soldier in the mountains.

"Then what? None of us know formations."

Mo Mo frowned.

Qin Jiang grinned, turning to face the great formation. "Formations? I know a little. Just a teensy bit."

The system's rewards had included formation mastery long ago—he'd simply never had a chance to use it. Until now.

Showtime.

He knelt and began tracing arrays. Runes blossomed around him as he worked. "Getting inside shouldn't be too hard. Come on—let's go. Guard the formation, wait for the snake."
