The next morning.

Nangong Yun woke, disoriented. He blinked at his surroundings, and as clarity returned, so did the memories of last night. He struggled upright. His entire body was soaked through with morning dew.

He'd been hit by that palm strike, then consumed by fury — and blacked out. But looking around now... Senior Sister hadn't even moved him? She'd left him lying on the ground all night?

Bitterness crept across his face. He'd given her everything — every treasure he found, she was always the first person he thought of. And she'd left him unconscious in the dirt without a second glance. At this rate, he could have died and no one would have noticed until he started to smell.

Comparing the treatment to his devotion, the unfairness of it cut even deeper. He stood there, sighing miserably.

Then a door opened.

Yue Weiwei emerged on Qin Jiang's arm, her face radiant with happiness. When she spotted Nangong Yun, she paused. She'd completely forgotten — her junior brother had come to rescue her last night, and she'd left him passed out in the courtyard.

She'd meant to arrange a room for him, really. But then Qin Jiang had kissed her, and the thought evaporated. After that, she'd joined the others for a firsthand experience of Qin Jiang's bold claims, and... well, Nangong Yun had simply ceased to exist in her mind.

A flicker of guilt crossed her face. He was her junior brother, after all.

But he was up now, and he looked alright, so the guilt faded.

Nangong Yun had been watching from the moment the door opened. The intimate way Qin Jiang and Yue Weiwei held each other dimmed his eyes. But sharp as ever, he caught that fleeting flash of guilt.

Was that for him?

Hope stirred. Maybe she hadn't abandoned him on purpose. Maybe she'd been forced.

This was the devotee's eternal logic — the capacity to find an excuse for anything. Even if she went to another man's bed, the faithful believer would convince himself she was only doing it for his sake. Learning new skills. All for him.

And so Nangong Yun began rationalizing.

"Junior Brother, are you alright?"

Yue Weiwei's voice held a note of concern.

His spirits lifted. She was worried about him! She must have been threatened last night — that was why she couldn't help him.

His gaze shifted to Qin Jiang. This man had to be coercing her. He was probably in league with her captors. And last night, when she'd played along with the performance, she'd been protecting him.

Everything clicked. The self-deception was complete. Senior Sister had endured so much — for him.

He felt a rush of emotion, then turned it inward as guilt. She'd suffered, and he'd doubted her? Despicable.

"I'm fine, Senior Sister."

He sniffed, looking at her with eyes full of contrition for his own faithlessness.

Yue Weiwei barely registered his gaze. She glanced up at Qin Jiang — who still wanted his little field trip to the anti-Huaxia alliance. She had no choice but to play along.

Sorry, Junior Brother.

When Qin Jiang nodded, she turned to Nangong Yun. He caught the apologetic look in her eyes — and added it to his theory. She needed this man's permission before she could even speak. She was definitely being coerced.

"Junior Brother, my husband commands some forces of his own. When he heard about our anti-Huaxia alliance, he wanted to help — and join."

"Join the alliance?"

Nangong Yun's eyes shifted to Qin Jiang, who was nodding with a smile while rubbing Yue Weiwei's head. "Huaxia isn't simple. Your current strength against Huaxia is like a fly trying to shake a tree. For Weiwei's safety, I'll lend you my support."

For Senior Sister. Of course.

Nangong Yun watched Yue Weiwei swat Qin Jiang's wandering hand away with an annoyed pout. To him, the gesture screamed rejection. She clearly detested this man — but for her junior brother's sake, she was enduring it all. She'd even given herself to him to secure help for their cause.

He wanted to cry. Senior Sister was truly selfless.

He drew a steadying breath and nodded. "Senior Sister, I'll follow your lead."

"Good." She turned to Qin Jiang, who flashed his signature grin.

"And I'll follow Weiwei's lead."

"Oh, stop." She batted his chest lightly, then addressed Nangong Yun. "Then from now on, you're also a member of the anti-Huaxia alliance."

Her expression turned slightly odd. The Lord of Huaxia, a card-carrying member of the anti-Huaxia alliance. The absurdity was almost too much.

Nangong Yun, watching his senior sister grimace through her "revulsion" while securing him a powerful ally, silently renewed his vows. Once Huaxia falls, I will take her back. I'll make her the happiest woman alive.

For now — endurance. He lacked the power to act. He couldn't waste Senior Sister's sacrifice.

Besides, the way he saw it, she was just... scouting the path ahead. Learning the terrain. When it was his turn to walk that road, everything would be smoother.

"You've put yourself on the line against Huaxia for my sake," Qin Jiang said, tilting Weiwei's chin up with a roguish grin. "Shouldn't you show some gratitude?"

She flushed, glancing at Nangong Yun. There was company. And this man was already getting handsy.

She hesitated — she didn't want to show her tender side in front of others. When she let go, the sight was... quite something. For Qin Jiang's eyes only.

"Husband, can we go inside first?"

Nangong Yun's heart ached. But it also warmed — because he knew Senior Sister wanted privacy for his sake. She didn't want him to suffer watching.

Senior Sister... so thoughtful. Always putting him first. Deeply moving.
