The Central Regions.

It had taken Chen Changsheng nearly a month to travel from the Demon Domain, and he'd finally arrived. This was the heart of Azure Cloud Heaven—a cultivator's holy land, a cradle of geniuses, a paradise for the strong. Every moment, countless cultivators set foot on this soil, and every moment, blood was spilled upon it.

Stepping inside, Chen Changsheng sighed with nostalgia. That familiar feeling. He'd been to the Central Regions more than once and had left his mark here, famous for a time. "I wonder if anyone still remembers me," he murmured, then shook his head with a bitter smile. He'd changed faces through reincarnation—his appearance, strength, even his aura were different. Unless he announced himself, no one would recognize him.

He took a deep breath and spoke to himself. "This life, I'll start fresh. Write a new story." He was confident that with his abilities, even in the Central Regions where the strong gathered like clouds, he could carve out his place.

Back at the Qin estate, Qin Jiang had talked Zi Fu into letting him pull her into the Space-Time Temple. His mansion was empty now—the others were gone, though a lingering chaos of scents made Zi Fu wrinkle her nose. Her small hand was clasped in his, and seeing that enormous bed, her cheeks flushed pink. At this rate, she'd end up on that bed sooner or later. As for right now...

"We agreed—just cultivating feelings for now," she reminded him.

Without an Immortal Path Law, Qin Jiang had proposed starting with emotional groundwork. Zi Fu had agreed. Her plan had always been to build feelings first—once they were close enough, how could he not give her an Immortal Path Law?

"Of course." He nodded with a smile, drawing her closer. "But feelings are mutual. If you want to build something, you have to invest something. Understand?"

"I know."

He drew her closer still, pulling her against him. She stiffened, unaccustomed to the contact. "We're building feelings—don't resist," he murmured.

She shifted uncertainly. Was this how feelings were built? Shouldn't it be gradual? This seemed awfully fast. The physical closeness fogged her thoughts, and before she could process what was happening, his head dipped toward her.

Her eyes went wide. Warmth bloomed on her lips.

Her first kiss—gone.

In his arms, Zi Fu went rigid. Every nerve converged on the press of their lips.

She tried to resist, but found she had no strength to.

Slowly, her body softened. Her hands rose of their own accord to hook around his neck. Eyes fluttering shut, she responded clumsily. And somewhere in the tightening of his embrace, she felt as if he were trying to fold her into himself. The sensation made her heart skip—not entirely unpleasant.

When he finally lifted his head and loosened his hold, she nearly crumpled, the mighty Ancient Emperor, weak-kneed from a kiss. He caught her easily.

Her face was flushed, her eyes shimmering with new emotion. He smiled and leaned in again. Her heart jumped, and she closed her eyes, lifting her chin—expectant. But his kiss didn't land on her lips. Instead, it traced along her cheek, grazed her earlobe, and settled on her neck.

She shivered. The teasing, feather-light touch set her skin tingling, spreading warmth through her entire body. Something in her wished he'd be rougher about it. A spark had been lit in her chest, growing into a flame.

Was this what feelings were? How could they develop this fast—from just one kiss? If she gave him everything, would that flame consume her whole heart?

The thought sent her pulse racing. She pressed closer, cheek against his chest, eyes closed to better absorb his warmth.

"Feel something?" he whispered in her ear.

She nodded, face burning. "Mm."

"Now you know how to cultivate feelings?"

He lifted her gently. She clung to his neck, head resting on his shoulder. The soft bed received her earlier than she'd imagined.

Four hours later, Zi Fu's hazy consciousness cleared. She blinked and glanced at Qin Jiang beside her, silently kicking herself. What was wrong with her? One kiss and she'd surrendered? Regret! She'd given in way too fast. Would he still value her? Would he still give her an Immortal Path Law?

She was furious with herself. As if she'd never seen a man before. Well—she hadn't, technically. Turns out men had their uses.

Her emotions churned—shy, then frustrated, then reminiscent, then glum—until Qin Jiang pulled her into his arms again and every expression collapsed into anticipation.

Holding her, noting that she was still full of energy, he remarked, "You yao have significantly better constitutions."

"Hm?"

He smiled, reading her anticipation, and obliged. Four more hours, and Zi Fu finally understood what he'd meant. Extended sessions, it turned out, could be exhausting. For the first time in her life, she felt this level of fatigue—yet simultaneously, a secret thrill. Like breaking through a cultivation bottleneck. A little addictive.

They stayed in the Space-Time Temple for days. Zi Fu kept finding excuses not to leave. Only when the other women began emerging from training and sneaking into the temple did she realize just how fierce the competition was. No wonder they'd all pretended to be cultivating diligently only to beeline for Qin Jiang's room. Without a few tricks up your sleeve, you really would go thirsty. Fortunately, as the newest addition, the sisters were kind to her, several times voluntarily yielding their time with Qin Jiang.

Though she blushed, she accepted with only token resistance.

When they finally left the Space-Time Temple, less than a day had passed outside. But for Zi Fu, it felt like a lifetime. Standing beside Qin Jiang, she looked down and frowned. Her clothes didn't quite fit anymore. Before, she could see her toes. Now, she couldn't. All thanks to Qin Jiang.

The extra weight wasn't unwelcome—she was rather pleased, and so was he.

Tugging at her outfit, she looked at him. "You owe me new clothes!"

"Done. Shopping it is!" He glanced appreciatively and nodded with a grin.
