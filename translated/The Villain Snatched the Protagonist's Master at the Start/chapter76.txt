"Liar!" Liu Shuwan didn't believe him for a second.

But Qin Jiang definitely had other women—that much was certain. His... expertise made that obvious. The thought brought a pang of worry. She was still sensitive about her age. Qin Jiang's other women were undoubtedly young and beautiful, while she was over six thousand. She couldn't compete with youth.

Her fists clenched subtly, and she burrowed deeper into his arms. She didn't know what awaited her outside—whether she'd be sidelined, whether his attention would scatter. Her world was no longer just the sword. It now included a certain little rogue.

Sensing her unease, Qin Jiang held her tighter. He didn't say anything, but Liu Shuwan understood the gesture.

"Your other women... they won't bully me, will they?" She looked up at him with doleful eyes.

The expression made Qin Jiang's mouth twitch. It was practically... green tea behavior. But damn if it wasn't effective.

He pinched her cheek. "With your strength? Who could bully you?"

Soft and delicate in Qin Jiang's presence she might be, but Liu Shuwan was a genuine half-Emperor at the peak of Sword Force. Aside from the Qin family's Great Emperor ancestors, few could match her. Six thousand years ago, she'd been a prodigy of her generation.

Her lips pushed into a pout. "You can't solve problems between women with strength. I don't care—if they bully me, you have to take my side."

"Done." Qin Jiang shook his head with a smile. His harem was rock-solid—nothing like the scenario Liu Shuwan feared. His women needed to band together just to handle him; they had no energy left over for infighting.

Reassured, Liu Shuwan brightened and took his hand. "Then I'll go with you."

"Before we leave, there's one more thing." Qin Jiang opened his palm, and the Sword Heart materialized. "Remember what I promised before I went down?"

"This is..." Liu Shuwan stared at it. The dense sword comprehension emanating from it was identical to Sword Valley's ambient energy—only more refined, more potent.

"A Sword Heart. The sect's founder left it behind. It can push you to Sword Heart." He placed it in her hands. "Wifey, I told you I'd help you break through."

Holding the Sword Heart, Liu Shuwan could feel its potential—Sword Heart, the realm she'd chased for millennia. She looked up at him with sparkling eyes. "After I achieve Sword Heart... I won't be under your pressure in Sword Valley anymore, right?"

"Oh?" His eyebrow rose. "Planning a mutiny, little Wan'er?"

His Sword Heart had made him the absolute authority in Sword Valley—able to suppress everything.

Liu Shuwan humphed. "You've been bullying me nonstop." Her eyes danced with excitement. She'd already decided: the first thing she'd do after achieving Sword Heart was pin Qin Jiang down.

He smiled knowingly. "After you break through, you'll see my real strength."

Previously, he'd merely possessed Sword Heart. But now, with the Way of the Sword Emperor, he was a true Sword Emperor. Even against another Sword Heart master, he reigned supreme.

"Stop trying to scare me." Liu Shuwan didn't buy it.

She looked at the Sword Heart in her hands, thought for a moment, then stood on tiptoe and kissed him. "A little down payment."

"That's all?" He grabbed her and refused to let go, thoroughly dissatisfied with such a meager reward.

Liu Shuwan's brows creased. "What do you want?"

"Ahem... Actually, forget the reward. How about I... give you a foot massage?"

His eyes gleamed as they traveled downward. Liu Shuwan's toes instinctively curled, and her face went scarlet. "Why are you so weird?!"

She couldn't fathom his fixation. Her feet weren't special. Unable to comprehend it, she chalked it up to him being a pervert. After a moment's hesitation, she nodded shyly. "Fine... you can."

Qin Jiang's face lit up. He pulled her onto the stone bed, removed her shoes to reveal her pale, delicate feet, and set to work with the diligence of a masseur. Though his technique was amateur, the gentle pressure pleased Liu Shuwan well enough. She gradually relaxed—and neither of them had anticipated the massage lasting an entire day.

The next morning, Liu Shuwan blushed. The foot massage had been the opening act. The finale... had been decidedly unprofessional.

Feeling slightly drained, she glanced at Qin Jiang, then scooted closer to find a comfortable position before closing her eyes again.

Several days later.

"Qin Jiang, I need to start cultivating!" Frustration laced Liu Shuwan's voice.

She'd planned to indulge him for one day before beginning her Sword Heart refinement. But one day had become two, then three... His requests were impossible to refuse, and the deadline kept sliding.

"Tomorrow." Qin Jiang held her hand. "One more day won't matter."

Liu Shuwan nearly laughed in exasperation. She shook free. "You said the same thing yesterday!"

"Did I?" He scratched his head. "I promise—this is really the last day."

"Really?"

"Look at these sincere eyes!"

'Those shifty eyes you call sincere?' She was unimpressed. Still, seeing his hopeful expression, she relented. "Fine. Last day. If you interrupt my refinement tomorrow, I'm getting angry."

"Absolutely the last day!" He beamed.

Liu Shuwan sighed. He made this same promise daily, yet she always gave in. "Little rascal," she murmured, then let him have his way.

Perhaps she didn't really want to start refining yet either. Once the Sword Heart was absorbed, they'd have to leave. Out there, Qin Jiang wouldn't belong to her alone. If she could, she'd trap him in Sword Valley forever—just the two of them.

But that was selfish. Qin Jiang's talent shouldn't be wasted on her account. His future held infinite possibilities. These days in Sword Valley—she wanted to fill them with as many memories as possible.
