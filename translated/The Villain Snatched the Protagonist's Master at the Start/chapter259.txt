Chen Qi'er continued observing the young beggar. He was genuinely impressed—the boy reminded him so much of himself at that age.

That evening, back at the temple, the young man gazed at Chen Qi'er with undisguised admiration. "Big Brother Chen, you're amazing! You begged all of this in one day? You must have the Innate Beggar Divine Body!"

Chen Qi'er's mouth twitched, his expression souring. This kid really needed to work on his compliments. He shook his head and dumped the day's haul in front of the young man. "Go through it. See if there's anything you need."

The young man dove in eagerly, claiming the food first and stuffing his face while sorting through the rest. Chen Qi'er watched quietly. He'd planted a few specific items among the pile.

"Huh?" The young man fished out a small dagger. "Big Brother Chen, why is there a knife in here?"

"Found it."

"Found it?" He nodded, accepting this without question—who would give a weapon to a beggar on purpose? He waved the dagger around experimentally, then looked at Chen Qi'er with hopeful eyes. "Can I keep it?"

"What would you do with it?"

The young man's eyes flashed with fire. He gripped the dagger tighter. "With this, I can protect myself! The people who bully me won't dare anymore!"

There was a thread of viciousness in his voice as he slashed the air a few times, as if swinging at his tormentors. Good—the boy had fight in him. Chen Qi'er nodded inwardly. That kind of edge could carry a person far, as long as it didn't get them killed first.

"It's yours."

"Thank you, Big Brother Chen!"

The young man continued rummaging. He grew increasingly awed by the sheer volume—Big Brother Chen really was a natural-born beggar prodigy. One day's work exceeded half a month of his own efforts. When he reached the bottom, his excitement dimmed.

"Too bad. It's all mundane stuff. None of it can be traded for spirit stones."

"Take it slow."

The young man nodded firmly. "I'll get a spirit stone someday."

His dream was as simple as Chen Qi'er's had been—one spirit stone. Perhaps just the starting point of something much larger.

"Big Brother Chen, I heard some cultivators hunt yao beasts for spirit stones..." He eyed the dagger, a gleam in his eye.

"If you want to die, go hunt yao beasts."

With zero cultivation and a tiny dagger, even regular animals would be a challenge. A yao beast would swallow him without noticing the extra calories.

The young man scratched his head sheepishly, then cradled the dagger to his chest and turned his eyes skyward, watching the stars.

On the other side of the sect, Qin Jiang let himself into Chen Baizhe's courtyard without waiting for an invitation. He'd been there before; formalities seemed redundant.

She was still seated before where her guqin had been. Her spirit seemed... diminished. For a Human Immortal, going without sleep for a year meant nothing. Her haggard appearance told a different story—this was psychological damage.

She barely reacted to his arrival.

"Just one day apart, and Baizhe Immortal looks so worn. What happened?"

At the sound of his voice, she glanced up, then lowered her gaze again without a word. The reason she looked like this was entirely because of him. A few sentences had demolished the beliefs she'd held for tens of thousands of years. She'd been mulling over his words ever since, and the more she thought, the more sense they made. And the more sense they made, the harder they hit.

Whether her brother was dead or simply didn't care—either possibility devastated her.

Qin Jiang sat across from her with an easy smile, picked up the guqin, and casually tossed it aside.

"You—" Her eyes flared. Her treasured instrument, discarded like garbage.

"You know what helps when you're feeling low?" he asked. "Where I come from, there's an old saying: 'What dissolves all sorrow? Only fine wine.' Du Kang was a legendary brew."

With a wave of his arm, jars of wine materialized on the table. He'd gotten them from Qing Chan specifically for this occasion.

"Wine?" Chen Baizhe's eyes flickered. She knew people drowned their sorrows in drink. She'd never tried it herself. But right now, with her mind in turmoil, she was tempted.

She reached for a jar, ready to chug.

"Wait."

Qin Jiang stopped her. She frowned, confused. He tapped a few points on his own body and explained, "When drinking, you should seal your cultivation first. Otherwise, the wine's wasted."

"Seal my cultivation?"

He grabbed a jar, took a long swig, and exhaled in satisfaction. "At your level, if you don't seal yourself, drinking wine is no different from drinking water. Do it like me—let the alcohol actually work."

He took another deep gulp. Chen Baizhe licked her lips, took a tentative sip, and felt nothing. She hesitated, watching his example. Then she steeled herself and sealed her own cultivation.

Qin Jiang had sealed his too. Even if she sealed hers, he couldn't do anything to her—they'd be on equal footing. At least, that was her reasoning. Seeing this, a smile ghosted across Qin Jiang's lips.

He raised his jar. "Cheers."

"Ch-cheers..."

Their jars met with a soft clink. He drained his in one go. She managed a few swallows before her cheeks flushed pink—several shades more adorable.

"That's no way to drink. Wine should be drunk in big gulps."

She nodded and tried again. The burn of strong liquor hit her throat and she coughed, wine trickling down her slender neck—a sight in its own right.

Qin Jiang reached over and wiped the wine from the corner of her mouth. "First time drinking?"

"Mm." She shied away from his hand with a small nod.

He pulled his hand back, glanced at the wine on his finger, and brought it to his lips. "Sweet."

"You—" Her blush deepened. Whether from the alcohol or embarrassment, she couldn't tell. She glared at him, seized her jar, and drank deeply. Her eyes began to glaze.

Still, a Human Immortal's constitution—even sealed—couldn't be toppled by a single jar.
