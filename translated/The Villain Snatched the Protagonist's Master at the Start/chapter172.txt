On the third day, the counterattack arrived.

A Great Emperor led the charge, accompanied by dozens of Supreme Realm cultivators, and they encircled the recently captured city in a show of overwhelming force. Fourth Ancestor quickly learned who they were.

The Tang family.

The man he'd slapped to death had been the grandson of one of their Great Emperors, and now the family had come calling.

Faced with a top-tier clan, Fourth Ancestor treated the matter with appropriate gravity and immediately sent word to Qin Jiang.

Then the battle erupted. The Tang family had brought only a single Great Emperor, nowhere near enough to threaten Fourth Ancestor and his allies. With support from the other ancestral elders, the Qin forces tore through the Tang family's ranks. Nearly all their cultivators were slaughtered—only one Great Emperor managed to flee in a panic.

---

That same day, inside Qin Family City, the Qin elders gathered—six Great Emperors in total.

In the Western Regions, that was an absolutely top-tier lineup. Beyond the six, they also commanded a host of Supremes, some brought from the Qin family on the Heavenly Mystery Continent and others recruited since arriving in Azure Cloud Heaven. The fact that these newcomers were kept close meant Fourth Ancestor had already secured their full loyalty.

"This Tang family is no pushover," someone said.

Over the past few days, they'd investigated the Tang clan thoroughly. They were a Western Regions power ranked in the top five, specialists in hidden weapons and poisons—the kind of underhanded arts that could allegedly kill even a Great Emperor. Nobody wanted to provoke them, for fear of dying without ever knowing how.

"On paper alone, they have nine Great Emperors and an Ancient Emperor. Without Xiao Jiang back, we can't match them."

"Azure Cloud Heaven really is something else. One of the Nine Heavens, and even the weakest corner of it has this many powerhouses. I can't imagine the full strength of the entire realm."

Back on the Heavenly Mystery Continent, their understanding of the Nine Heavens had been superficial at best—just a vague notion that it was slightly stronger than the Ten Lands. Now that they were here, the gap was staggering. In this supposedly barren frontier, even an unremarkable little clan might have a half-Emperor guarding it. Across just a few hundred thousand miles, they'd encountered seven half-Emperors—killed three, recruited four.

"Xiao Jiang should be back soon. Once he's here, a petty little Tang family won't last long." Fourth Ancestor smiled.

Qin Jiang had two Immortals at his side, and word from the Myriad Pill Assembly was that he'd personally slain one as well. With Qin Jiang around, the Tang family was a joke.

The words had barely left his mouth when a familiar chuckle rang out.

"Heh, miss me already, Fourth Ancestor?"

The room stiffened, then erupted in delight. All eyes turned to the source—sure enough, it was Qin Jiang and his entourage.

"Just got back. Brought you all a little gift."

Qin Jiang was carrying several people by their collars. He tossed them unceremoniously at Fourth Ancestor's feet.

"These are..."

Fourth Ancestor's group was stunned. They could sense it—every single one of these captives was a Great Emperor.

Qin Jiang strolled forward, a casual smile on his lips. "Tang family people. Ran into them on the way here, so I grabbed a few."

He'd encountered eight Great Emperors en route. He'd intended to catch them all, but they'd proven slippery—three had escaped even with Mo Mo intervening. Only five captured.

That little failure had given Jian Yao ammunition, and she'd mocked Mo Mo the entire way back. An Immortal, and she'd let Great Emperors get away? How embarrassing.

Qin Jiang glanced at the unfamiliar faces among Fourth Ancestor's people—cultivators recruited during his absence. Their eyes held no particular respect when they looked at him.

He shifted his gaze to the five unconscious Tang family Great Emperors. They were still alive, but barely. The Myriad Dao Stone materialized in Qin Jiang's palm, and an invisible force surged outward, enveloping all five.

"AHHH!!!"

All five jolted awake at once. The searing pain forced their eyes wide as their bodies convulsed violently.
