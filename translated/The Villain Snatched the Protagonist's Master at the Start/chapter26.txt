The gambling continued.

But Blood Rose knew she had no chance of winning. In a way, Qin Jiang truly deserved the title King of Gamblers—undefeated in every wager.

Because no one dared beat him.

After all, no amount of gambling skill could overcome absolute power.

After losing another round, Qin Jiang said softly:

"One trillion—"

"Wait!"

Before he could finish, Blood Rose cut in:

"Young Lord Qin, you win."

Across the table, Ye Xuan stared in bewilderment. He was the one winning here.

"Miss, we won!

He's about to gamble away his entire family!"

Ye Xuan couldn't help but protest.

Blood Rose's brow furrowed. This fool—skilled at the dice cup but utterly brainless.

Someone like that, no matter how talented, was a liability waiting to happen.

She decided that once Qin Jiang left, Ye Xuan would be dismissed.

Hearing Ye Xuan's clueless outburst, Qin Jiang chuckled and looked at him:

"In that case, I'll bet my family's Fourth Ancestor's head. Still calling small!"

Blood Rose: "..."

Black Dragon: "..."

"You little bastard—I've been busting my ass protecting you, and you're betting my life?!"

The Fourth Ancestor made a rare appearance, smacking the back of Qin Jiang's head.

Having said his piece, he turned a murderous glare on Ye Xuan:

"You—shake! Let's see if you've got the balls to take my head!"

Ye Xuan's body went rigid.

The Fourth Ancestor? The Qin family's Fourth Ancestor?

Good heavens!

He nearly fainted. As Ye Qingtian's son, Ye Xuan had some knowledge of the world. He knew about the major ancient clans.

This Fourth Ancestor was one of the most powerful beings on the entire Heavenly Mystery Continent.

Those who could match him could be counted on one hand.

In fact, he alone could annihilate the Ye family.

Take his head?

Ye Xuan wouldn't dare dream of it.

"Senior, surely you're joking..."

"Cut the nonsense—shake!"

The Fourth Ancestor's voice was ice.

Ye Xuan's face crumbled. He was using a false identity, but with the Fourth Ancestor's power, uncovering his true name would be child's play.

If he won...

The one who died wouldn't be the Fourth Ancestor. It would be him—and possibly his father too.

He drew a deep breath, picked up the dice cup, and began shaking with absolute focus. This single roll could determine the fate of his entire family.

No mistakes!

The cup slammed onto the table. Ye Xuan exhaled, wiped the cold sweat from his brow. Good—no slip-ups.

He lifted the cup.

One, two, three. Small.

"Oh? I won!"

A smile spread across Qin Jiang's face.

Blood Rose: "..."

Ye Xuan: "..."

The Fourth Ancestor glanced at Qin Jiang, his face twitching. 'This brat is really something.'

He took a deep breath, snorted, and vanished.

Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief.

Though the Fourth Ancestor hadn't released his aura, his mere presence had been suffocating.

Qin Jiang looked down at Blood Rose:

"Miss Yan, I win."

Blood Rose—real name Yan Yun. Qin Jiang had learned this from his spoilers.

Yan Yun closed her beautiful eyes briefly. When they reopened, the bewitching allure was back in full force. One didn't earn the name Blood Rose without exceptional composure.

She gazed at Qin Jiang, placed a delicate hand on his chest, and said with pitiful charm:

"Young Lord Qin, from now on, this humble woman is yours~"

Since resistance was futile, she might as well go with the flow.

Besides, latching onto the Qin family wasn't exactly a bad deal.

Looking at Yan Yun, Qin Jiang nodded in satisfaction.

He tilted her chin up with one hand and smiled:

"You can drop the fragile act. Now that you're with me, I won't let you suffer.

Now then—take me to meet your aunt."

A flash of coyness crossed Yan Yun's eyes:

"So the Young Lord had us investigated all along. All of this was for my aunt..."

"Oh? Not even through the door and you're already competing for my attention?"

Qin Jiang raised an eyebrow.

Yan Yun gave a bewitching smile. By now, she'd completely let her guard down. She nestled against Qin Jiang, her eyes full of playful provocation:

"The Young Lord is worth competing for~"

"Little minx!"

Qin Jiang took a deep breath and scooped her up in his arms:

"Second floor—your room, right?"

"Mm~"

Yan Yun nodded, her cheeks flushed.

Carrying Yan Yun toward the stairs, Qin Jiang didn't forget to issue an order:

"Black Dragon—clear the floor. No one comes upstairs."

"Yes, sir."

The woman countless men had only dared dream of had finally descended from her pedestal.

The second floor of Rose Casino was Yan Yun's private quarters. Apart from a few attendants, no man had ever set foot here. Qin Jiang was the first.

Several hours passed.

Yan Yun looked at Qin Jiang, exhaustion written across her face:

"Young Lord, my aunt is almost here."

"When does she arrive?"

"Let me check."

Yan Yun produced a jade pendant. Before she could send a message, she noticed several notifications already waiting:

"Um...

It seems my aunt is already here."

"Already here?"

"Yes, but... it seems your people stopped her at the door."

Yan Yun blinked.

Qin Jiang was in no rush. He turned to Yan Yun:

"In that case, making her wait a little longer shouldn't be a problem, right?"

"Huh? What are you—"

"Heh. You did try to trick me earlier..."

Qin Jiang's gaze drifted meaningfully.

Before long, Yan Yun had completely forgotten about her aunt.

About two hours later.

Qin Jiang sent word for Yan Yun's aunt to come upstairs.

The scene that greeted this ice-cold assassin made her eyes go wide.

"Stop messing around—my aunt's here."

Yan Yun whispered.

Qin Jiang looked up:

"Yan Shiya. Creator of the Shadow Pavilion. I didn't expect you'd be such a beauty."
