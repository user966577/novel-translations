The ancestors surveyed their ranks. They'd never imagined a day when there would be fewer candidates than Great Emperor Laws.

"Give the extras to Nine Tribulations Supremes?" First Ancestor suggested, looking to Qin Jiang.

A half-Emperor could advance to Great Emperor immediately upon absorbing a law. A Nine Tribulations Supreme still needed time—roughly a year, even with a law's assistance.

Qin Jiang nodded. "I'll keep one."

"You need one too?" Fourth Ancestor asked, surprised.

Any cultivator who absorbed a Great Emperor Law would eventually reach Great Emperor regardless of current level, with no bottlenecks along the way—plus a boost to cultivation speed. But Qin Jiang didn't need any of that.

He shook his head and pocketed a law. "It's for my father."

Fourth Ancestor raised an eyebrow with a grin. "How filial. Should we save one for your mother too?"

"No need. Mom's a natural genius. She doesn't need this. Dad's the one who's hopeless—without a Great Emperor Law, he'll probably never reach Emperor in his lifetime."

Fourth Ancestor winced. Good thing Qin Hao wasn't here. If he'd heard his own son call him hopeless, the belt would have come off.

With the Great Emperor Laws distributed, the ancestors rushed back to cultivate and break through as quickly as possible. Qin Jiang, meanwhile, maintained his leisurely pace. It took him a full half-month to arrive home.

He sent Huo Qing'er to take Huo Ying'er and Chu Hanyan to the Void Divine Temple, then went with Qin Lian'er to visit their parents. A brief account of their travels followed. Li Xueyi was supportive and full of praise for everything the siblings had done. Qin Hao sat with a dark expression—his own genes, and these two hadn't inherited a shred of his temperament.

After chatting for a while, Qin Jiang produced the Great Emperor Law and presented it to his father. But instead of the expected delight, Qin Hao's face actually hardened.

"Your Fourth Ancestor told me. You gave me a law because I'm 'too hopeless' to reach Emperor on my own?"

Qin Jiang blinked. That old snitch was still tattling on him?

Li Xueyi, on the other hand, laughed with delight. According to Fourth Ancestor, her son had called her a "natural genius." The boy had taste!

With that thought, she swatted Qin Hao. "Don't you dare touch my son."

Qin Hao felt genuinely aggrieved. Sure, he liked to bluster at Qin Jiang, but he'd never actually laid a hand on the boy. Was the warning really necessary? As if he'd ever actually hit his firstborn.

"Heh heh, see you later, Mom." Qin Jiang beat a hasty retreat. Before leaving, he added: "Dad, don't forget to use the law."

Thousand Year Mountain had been in the Qin Domain for half a month now, and the Great Emperor Ruins had long since opened. Qin family disciples had been exploring it for ten days already, and with the family's blessing, several affiliated clans had been allowed to send people in as well—including the Ye family and the Holy Sword Sect.

Given their connections to Qin Jiang, the Qin family let them in without difficulty. The greatest treasures had already been claimed; what remained was beneath the Qin family's notice. Letting others pick through the scraps was an excellent way to win goodwill—and it worked. Even the Ye family and the Holy Sword Sect were extremely satisfied with their gains.

Watching the outsiders marvel at items the Qin family considered worthless, the Qin disciples could only smile. Not every family had a young lord like theirs. Being born into the Qin family was a blessing.

At the same time, in a hidden pocket of space near the Qin Domain, representatives of the major ancient clans had gathered in secret.

"Is everyone ready?"

"Our eighteen ancient clans have committed over seventy percent of our reserves. Combined, we can ambush and annihilate the Qin family's Great Emperors in one strike."

"Seven Great Emperors is nothing. Even eight or nine—we'd still crush them. Every one of our clans had Great Emperors ten thousand years ago. They may be gone, but the trump cards they left behind aren't something the Qin family can shrug off. Dominating the continent won't be that easy."

"Then let's begin."

"Our disciples are in position. We can strike at any time."

They exchanged determined looks, ready to give the order—

When space itself shuddered violently.

"What's happening?"

Before they could react, an overwhelming Emperor aura flooded the area, shaking the entire spatial pocket.

They fled the collapsing space immediately.

"Emperor aura! That's Emperor aura!"

The signature pressure was unmistakable—they'd felt it often enough from the Qin family's Emperors.

A cold dread settled over them.

The moment they emerged, they turned toward the Qin family compound. Sure enough, the aura emanated from there. A titanic figure materialized above the Qin estate, its imperious gaze making all who beheld it look away in instinctive submission.

The ancient clan representatives stood frozen.

"A new Emperor. That makes eight for the Qin family."

"Eight. We can still handle eight—"

The heavens shuddered again. A second Emperor aura erupted from the Qin family, no weaker than the first.

Another stunned silence.

"Nine."

"Can we still win?"

"Probably... maybe?"

BOOM!

A third detonation rocked the sky. The representatives stared at the Qin estate in despair.

They looked at each other, voices trembling: "Ten..."

"Are we still fighting?"

"Fight? Be my guest. I'm going home."

"I'm out too. The Qin family ruling the continent isn't so bad, honestly. We're all one big Heavenly Mystery family. Why fight among ourselves?"

"Right, right. No more fighting. We're all family here."

Several clans were already backing down. Others refused to accept it: "It's only ten. We might still—"

BOOM!

Another explosion. They reflexively looked toward the Qin estate, then at the speaker.

"You were saying?"

"I... was saying we should send the Qin family some gifts."

From start to finish, seven new Great Emperors emerged. Combined with the previous seven, the Qin family now had fourteen Great Emperors.

The silence was absolute.

"Gifts, then? Shall we go together?"

"Got yours ready?"

"What's to prepare? All those reserves we were going to use against them—just send those."

"Seventy percent of our reserves... that's a lot..."

"We were going to waste them fighting the Qin family anyway. And with this many new Emperors appearing, the Qin family probably knows about our scheme already. These aren't gifts—they're apology offerings!"

The color drained from every face. The Qin family's ruthlessness was well documented. If their plans had truly been discovered...

Fear flickered in every eye.

"Let's go home. Discuss it with our elders. Going forward, we need to be on good terms with the Qin family. They've moved beyond our league."

Nods all around. With bitter expressions and heavy sighs, they dispersed one by one.
