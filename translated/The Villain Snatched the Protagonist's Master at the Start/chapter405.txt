"Elite student roster — thirty names."

The regular list complete, all that remained were the top 30.

"Zhao Juncai, Du Yushan, Jiang Ke'er, Zhou Jitong... Qin Wencheng, Sun Gao, Lin Yu, Ye Xuan!"

Thirty names, read in an instant. Every student on the list wore an unmistakable look of pride — elite at Huaxia Academy meant they were the geniuses among geniuses.

"That's everyone, Manor Lord," the teacher said, stepping back deferentially.

Qin Jiang nodded, swept one last look across the crowd, and waved a hand. "Take them to their quarters."

"Yes, sir."

The teaching staff fanned out, corralling students by tier. "All thirty elites, follow me. You'll each receive a private residence — the best locations on campus. Consider it a perk."

Other teachers shepherded the regulars toward their dormitories. The remedials were shown to an empty lot and told to build their own housing.

No pretense of equality. The difference in treatment was on full display — and that was the point. Ambition ignited across the student body. Every remedial and regular student silently vowed: one day, they'd earn elite status.

Watching the crowd disperse, Qin Jiang headed back to the estate with his women.

The day had been productive. Tormenting Li Yang had generated a healthy haul of Villain Points, and with the boy now living on campus, Qin Jiang could torment him whenever he pleased. Ye Xuan was in play, too — a useful tool for toying with Li Yang's emotions on demand. Sustainable farming. He just had to be careful not to break the boy entirely.

At the estate, the women had already emerged from the master suite and were selecting individual rooms for themselves.

"All done?" Liu Shuwan greeted him.

He nodded. "Quick entrance exam, then straight to enrollment."

"Spot any promising students?"

He thought back, then answered with perfect seriousness: "Definitely some good-looking ones."

"Excuse me?"

An Xihe smacked his chest. "She asked if you'd found promising students, not pretty ones."

"Oh — promising." He laughed sheepishly, reconsidered, and shook his head. "No one stood out."

He could only remember the female students who'd locked eyes with him — faces flushing, gazes darting away. Quite adorable.

Liu Shuwan read him like a book. This man was absolutely going to poach his own student body.

"Restrain yourself," she warned. "If word gets out, the academy won't be able to recruit."

"Not a chance! If I serve as the academy's promotional ambassador, this face alone would turn us into a women's college."

She wanted to argue, but he wasn't wrong. That face could sink ships.

"Don't get cocky," Qing Chan cut in. "You still haven't dealt with my Divine Palace girls."

She maintained contact with the Azure Lotus Divine Palace. Every conversation, nine out of ten sentences involved Qin Jiang.

Worse — the women had collectively sworn off marriage. They'd even shuttered the Matchmaking Temple, the sect's most iconic institution. All of them were waiting for Qin Jiang.

"How many are left?" he asked.

Every woman in the Divine Palace was a certified beauty — Qing Chan was a looks-obsessed founder who'd set attractiveness as the primary admission criterion above even talent. Qin Jiang had visited once and nearly hadn't made it back out alive. They'd swarmed him — fighting to serve him, hiding him under their skirts during games of hide-and-seek, and insisting on "keeping him hydrated" with personally delivered refreshments.

He felt a twinge of nostalgia. Those playful girls must miss him.

"Take a guess~" Qing Chan's eyes gleamed with competitive fire.

Her Divine Palace had quite the roster. And unlike the young White Fox Tribe girls — many of whom were still maturing — the Divine Palace women were all battle-ready. They only lacked real experience. With Qin Jiang, they'd gain that very quickly.

He rubbed his chin, thinking. The Divine Palace wasn't that large a sect, and members frequently married out. The remainder...

"A hundred?"

Qing Chan waggled a finger. "More~"

He sucked in a breath. At those numbers, there was a genuine chance of defeat.

'This is a crisis.'

"They say you still owe them a meal," Qing Chan said, blinking innocently. "A seafood banquet."

He coughed. During his stay at the Divine Palace, he'd teased them — said he loved seafood. They'd apparently remembered.

They also probably knew by now that "seafood" didn't actually require any fish.

"Oh, and they want congee. Homemade — by you."

So they'd decoded the full menu. These weren't the innocent flowers he'd left behind.

"I'll make time," he said with a strained grin. "Congee is my specialty, after all."

He was a world-class chef. Congee was his signature. And the women were equally talented — their seafood banquets were legendary. The two sides' culinary skills were evenly matched, with rave reviews all around.

"Don't forget," Qing Chan warned. "Those girls pester me constantly. Handle them soon."

"You got it."

"A hundred and fifty-six, total. I'll send you a roster."

A hundred and fifty-six. Qin Jiang took a slow breath.

That was a lot.

Even now, he couldn't reliably overpower his existing sisterhood. Adding 156 more combatants to the mix...

Maybe defeat really was on the table.
