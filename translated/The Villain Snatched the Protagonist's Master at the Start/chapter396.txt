Under the weight of Qin Jiang's thinly veiled threat, the teachers nodded fervently, swearing that no one would so much as touch the monument.

Satisfied, Qin Jiang followed them inside. The staff hailed from sects and factions across the land — experienced cultivators who'd seen much and built accordingly. The academy was equipped with every facility a prodigy could need.

They walked him through a detailed training curriculum, explaining how they planned to develop each student after enrollment. The sheer volume of logistics made Qin Jiang's head spin, but he couldn't deny it — every one of these people was a qualified educator.

He nodded along, offering steady approval. The tour left him satisfied overall. The only drawback was size — it was a bit small. Future expansion would be necessary.

"Not bad. Students arrive in half a month. I'll leave it in your capable hands." He smiled.

They waved off the praise. "Not at all — you're the one with the grand vision, Manor Lord. We're just executing."

"Enough with the flattery. Do I have somewhere to rest? Take us there."

"Of course! Right this way."

The teachers led Qin Jiang's group to a secluded estate — an elegant compound nestled apart from the main campus. "This area was set aside specifically for the dean and vice deans," they explained.

Qin Jiang surveyed the grounds. Flowers and shrubs framed the paths, lush trees filtered the light, and a small creek wound around the estate's perimeter. The environment was exquisite — quiet, far from the classrooms, and saturated with spiritual qi. Easily the best spot on the entire campus.

He smiled and turned to An Xihe, Qing Chan, and Mo Mo. "What do you think? Like it? This is your office from now on."

'Office?' The three women rolled their eyes. They were figureheads — did he actually expect them to stay here and teach? Not a chance. The estate was nice enough for the occasional visit, though. Provided Qin Jiang was there. For official business, of course.

"It'll do," An Xihe said with a nod.

The teachers exhaled in relief. As long as the Immortal King was happy.

Qin Jiang dismissed them, and his group headed inside. The compound was spacious — hundreds of rooms, all told. Clearly, this had been built with Qin Jiang specifically in mind.

He nodded to himself. These teachers really did know what they were doing.

An Xihe and the others were less amused. Wasn't this supposed to be their office? The sheer number of rooms made the real purpose obvious — they were worried he wouldn't have enough bedrooms for all his women.

"Ahem." Qin Jiang coughed. "Should we assign rooms?"

An Xihe shot him a look and pointed at the largest suite. "Assign what? Judging by how well these people read the room, that one can fit all of us."

She wasn't wrong. The master suite was enormous — comparable to his quarters in the Space-Time Temple. It could absolutely accommodate everyone.

Qin Jiang blinked and scanned the women. "So... all together?"

They brushed past him without a word, heading straight for the suite.

"Come on, big brother~" Lian'er grinned and hooked his arm, pulling him along.

Inside, the women who'd arrived first stood frozen. Qin Jiang pushed through to see what had stopped them — and froze himself.

These teachers had gone above and beyond.

The room held an enormous bed, naturally. But arranged around it was an eclectic collection of... equipment. Specialty chairs in various configurations, padded benches — and dangling from the ceiling, row upon row of crimson silk ribbons.

Every pair of eyes in the room locked onto Qin Jiang.

"Like master, like servants. Your subordinates really outdid themselves," someone said flatly.

Qin Jiang's mouth twitched.

The women wandered over to inspect. Most of the furniture was familiar territory by now. But the ribbons...

"Qin Jiang, what are these ribbons for?" Liu Shuwan tugged on one, genuinely curious.

He licked his lips. "You hold onto them and spin through the air."

"Spin through the air? What's the point of that?"

"Well, while you're up there, I can be underneath and—"

He didn't need to finish. A vivid image bloomed in every woman's mind. Cheeks reddened across the board.

"Shameless!" they spat in unison.

Qin Jiang spread his hands, the picture of innocence. Not his fault. Who knew the academy's teaching staff had such creative imaginations? Even he was impressed.

"You didn't order them to do this, did you?" An Xihe eyed him suspiciously. The others turned to stare. Her theory wasn't impossible.

"You wound me." He rolled his eyes. "If I'd ordered this, why would I hide it from you? It's not like you'd say no."

That landed. The women paused, then grudgingly nodded. Fair point — Qin Jiang had no reason to be sneaky about it. This was clearly the staff's own initiative, an attempt to curry favor.

Then Qin Jiang rubbed his palms together, eyes gleaming. "So... want to give the ribbons a try?"

Every woman in the room flushed. No one agreed outright — but no one refused, either. Silence was consent.

He grinned, waved an arm, and the door slammed shut.

"Who's first?"

The women glanced at one another, bashful.

"We don't know how," someone offered.

"I'll teach you."

He grabbed a ribbon and gave it a firm tug. Sturdy. No risk of snapping.

His gaze swept the room and landed on Lian'er. "Lian'er. Come try it out."

"I..." She hesitated, then nodded. A spark of anticipation glimmered in her eyes.

The others watched intently. Research purposes.

Under their collective gaze, Qin Jiang was perfectly at ease, ready to instruct. Lian'er, on the other hand, was too self-conscious to let go.

Seeing her discomfort, Qin Jiang turned to the audience. "How about... I record a demonstration with Lian'er, and you can study it afterward?"

Recording crystals could capture the entire process in high definition. Not quite as effective as a live demonstration, but Lian'er was shy — her comfort came first.
