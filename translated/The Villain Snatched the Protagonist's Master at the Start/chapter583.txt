The battlefield paused for a beat, then the fighting resumed. As far as everyone was concerned, diving into the blood pool was suicide. Not worth thinking about.

But moments later, the blood pool erupted violently. A tremendous aura burst from within, commanding instant attention. And there was Zhao Sheng—intact, standing atop the pool, radiating power that hadn't been there before. Shock rippled through the crowd.

Then someone yelled: "He got the legacy!"

Every eye turned predatory.

By the blood pool, the two Huaxia operatives exchanged uncertain glances. The energy in the pool hadn't diminished—technically, Zhao Sheng shouldn't have obtained the legacy. But his aura was now stronger than theirs, bordering on Immortal King territory.

Standing on the blood pool, Zhao Sheng lowered his gaze, a flicker of gratitude in his eyes. The earlier blast hadn't destroyed the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor after all—but it had stripped him of all remaining power, forcing him to hide within the blood pool. Just now, the Great Emperor had secretly transmitted a message, telling Zhao Sheng to enter the pool, where he could temporarily gain immense power to deal with the situation.

And the Great Emperor hadn't lied. The streak of light in Zhao Sheng's consciousness contained extraordinary power—left behind by his ancestor, an Immortal King. According to the Great Emperor, that ancestor had been his closest friend. After the Great Emperor's death, the ancestor had preserved the legacy in the form of the blood-red stone—the Zhao family's heirloom. The blood pool was that stone's true form.

Activating the legacy required the Immortal Emperor's secret realm. And the ancestor had embedded his own power in the stone, hoping a descendant would follow its guidance and claim the legacy. The Great Emperor, remembering old bonds, had given Zhao Sheng every advantage. He simply hadn't anticipated this chaos.

Fortunately, the Great Emperor had sensed the ancestor's safeguard and secretly helped Zhao Sheng activate it. The cost was the Great Emperor's permanent annihilation.

Zhao Sheng bowed toward the blood pool in respect. Then he stepped off it, surveying the field. With this power behind him, confidence surged through him. No one here could match him.

The two Huaxia operatives approached. "Did you get the legacy?" they asked quietly.

"No." Zhao Sheng smiled. Then his gaze swept toward the blood pool. "But now I have the strength to take it."

Near-Immortal King power made him effectively unbeatable in this space. But though his aura was formidable, the allure of an Immortal Emperor's legacy overrode fear. Most of the cultivators still eyed him hungrily, convinced he'd already obtained the legacy. Take him down, claim the prize—simple.

Zhao Sheng was unfazed. He intended to suppress everyone regardless. This borrowed power was burning through fast, and if it ran out before he'd dealt with the opposition, his Human Immortal-level strength wouldn't be enough to compete. And beyond the practical concerns, he wanted revenge—for the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor, for Liu Xing, for himself.

He smirked at the restless crowd. "What's the matter? Nobody wants the legacy anymore?"

Pure provocation. The crowd, already on the verge of acting, snapped. One person charged, and the rest followed—a full-scale assault on Zhao Sheng. It didn't matter. He swept a hand and obliterated most of the incoming attacks, then went on the offensive.

Near-Immortal King power was overwhelming. In the immortal cultivation hierarchy, each realm represented a staggering gulf. Zhao Sheng had touched Immortal King territory—True Immortals were simply outclassed. A casual strike was enough to critically wound one. But he held back from killing. He incapacitated—heavy wounds, sealing techniques—stripping everyone of their fighting ability without taking lives.

This restraint, paradoxically, made his opponents more reckless. If they wouldn't die, why not go all in? They also noticed his power gradually weakening. This wasn't his own strength—it would run out. So they threw everything they had at him, trying to drain him faster.

Zhao Sheng frowned. The energy was depleting rapidly, even more so because he was pulling his punches. But killing them would bring trouble from their factions down on the Zhao family, and his family couldn't withstand that kind of retaliation. So he held back—but struck harder.

In less than an hour, every combatant had been suppressed. All except Black Dragon's group.

He turned toward them, fists clenched, power still surging—diminished but well above True Immortal level. More than enough to handle them, he figured. And these ones he wouldn't feel guilty about killing.

Black Dragon's group stared back, unafraid—eager, even. Under Qin Jiang's banner, they had plenty of hidden cards. In a real life-or-death situation, their combined trump cards might be enough to slay an actual Immortal King, let alone someone who wasn't quite there. Even without those cards, they weren't afraid.

Black Dragon smiled. "Coming for us next?"

"I'm going to avenge the Heavenly Waters Great Emperor!"

"Oh? So the old relic really is dead, then." Black Dragon raised an eyebrow and breathed a sigh of relief. The Great Emperor had been his biggest concern in this realm. But now that was settled.
