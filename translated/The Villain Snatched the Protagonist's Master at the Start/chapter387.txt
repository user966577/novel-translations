In the end, Mo Mo used the demon spirit forged from the Human Immortal to exterminate every last soul in his faction.

"Done! Next one!"

She clapped her hands and beamed at Li Qingqiu, gesturing for her to lead on.

Looking down at the devastation — the ruined compound, the silence where screams had been — Li Qingqiu's brow furrowed. It sat uneasily with her. From start to finish, the dead faction hadn't done anything wrong.

Qin Jiang took her hand. "Let's go."

She pulled her gaze away, glanced at him, and nodded quietly. They moved toward the next target.

They arrived quickly. Mo Mo charged in with glee. Qin Jiang stood beside Li Qingqiu, studying her expression. "What's wrong? Uncomfortable?"

"Mm." She nodded. She'd spent her entire life in secluded cultivation. She'd never killed anyone, let alone witnessed anything like this.

And this was indiscriminate slaughter. As for "revenge" — the truth was, the victims had more right to that word than Mo Mo did. Mo Mo was the one who'd committed atrocities first. The people hunting her had been driven by legitimate grudges — murdered families, destroyed clans. They were, by any reasonable measure, innocent.

That was what made Li Qingqiu's stomach turn.

Qin Jiang gazed at the carnage below. Mo Mo was in full swing. "Survival of the fittest," he said quietly. Then he pointed down and smiled. "Don't you think those blooming flowers of blood are beautiful in their own way?"

Li Qingqiu was silent. She looked at An Xihe, Qing Chan, and Jian Yao. They wore identical expressions of boredom — the massacre below held no interest for them whatsoever. As for Mo Mo... no need to look. She was having the time of her life.

To them, slaughter was just a game. Mo Mo relished it. Qin Jiang could appreciate the aesthetics. The rest simply didn't care.

Li Qingqiu's lashes lowered. Now she understood why the Li Family Ancestor had been so servile in Qin Jiang's presence. He was a devil. He treated human lives like blades of grass.

She looked at him with complicated eyes. Back at the Li compound, aside from his... appetites, he'd been nothing more than a cheerful young man. But now...

Just then, his gaze came back to her. Their eyes met, and he smiled. He turned her to face him, drew her into his arms, and rested his chin on her shoulder.

"Don't watch if it upsets you."

His hand patted her back gently, guiding her face into his chest.

An Xihe and the others glanced over. A girl who'd never seen blood — of course this would shake her. Qin Jiang had brought her along specifically to acclimate her. He wasn't a good man. Exterminating sects and factions wasn't new to him, and it wouldn't be the last time. She needed to understand exactly who he was. Qin Jiang never bothered with pretense.

Mo Mo returned shortly, having erased the faction from existence. She noticed Li Qingqiu buried in Qin Jiang's chest. "What happened to Qingqiu?"

"Scared."

"Scared?" Mo Mo blinked, looked down at the rivers of blood and the fields of corpses, and winced. "Did I frighten her? Should I... tone it down?"

Qin Jiang shook his head. "No need. Just don't make her watch."

"Alright."

Mo Mo patted Li Qingqiu's shoulder and offered a few gentle words of comfort. Li Qingqiu heard every word of their exchange. She wanted to protest — she wasn't scared. But protesting meant saying she disapproved of Mo Mo's methods, and Mo Mo had been nothing but kind to her. Even now, the girl was offering to restrain herself.

She couldn't bring herself to argue. So she stayed in Qin Jiang's arms, playing the frightened maiden, and secretly pinched him.

"Since Qingqiu's scared, she doesn't need to lead the way. The map's clear enough." Mo Mo unfolded it and located the next target.

Qin Jiang nodded. He scooped Li Qingqiu up, hands under her thighs, and she wrapped her arms around his neck.

She clung to him like that as they traveled.

At the next stop, he set her down. "Still scared?"

"I was never scared." She shot him a look, then stood at his side, watching Mo Mo tear into another faction.

Qin Jiang watched her, holding her hand. "Qingqiu, I don't have a single enemy in this world. Do you know why?"

"Why?"

"Because every enemy I've ever had, I've killed. Every one of them. Along with everyone connected to them. Just like Mo Mo is doing now. Soon, her enemies will cease to exist entirely."

Li Qingqiu was quiet for a moment. "Does it have to be so thorough?"

"Yes."

He pinched her cheek. "Because I have you. I have all of you. I have people I care about. A single enemy might never be able to touch me personally, but they could strike at you. At the people I love. I will never allow that — not even a one-in-ten-thousand chance. The only way to eliminate that possibility is to pull up every last root."

He looked at her. "Think I'm too cautious? Too ruthless?"

She said nothing.

"I am cautious. I don't want any of you to be hurt. As long as you're all safe, I'll carry whatever sins are necessary. Alone."

Li Qingqiu gazed at him. Her lips parted but no words came. For the first time, genuine tenderness surfaced in her eyes. The hand clasped in his squeezed gently — a small, silent comfort.

Qin Jiang lifted his chin, the corners of his mouth curling into a private smirk.

'Wrapped around my finger.'
