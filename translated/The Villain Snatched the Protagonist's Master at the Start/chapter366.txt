They spent a few more days at the Holy Sword Sect, leaving behind some cultivation opportunities before departing.

The other women had no family homes to visit. Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er had lost their parents long ago and had relinquished all ties to the Fire Tribe. Chu Hanyan had only her younger brother — the one Qin Jiang had secretly eliminated. She'd already severed ties with him. Perhaps she still thought of him somewhere in her heart, but Qin Jiang mattered far more. Since returning to Qin Domain, she'd never once looked for him.

Still, Qin Jiang was nothing if not fair. Before heading to Grey Cloud Heaven, he spent time with each of them individually — strolling through Qin Domain, revisiting old haunts, giving Yan Yun and Yan Shiya their share of attention too. These were the women who'd been with him since the Heavenly Mystery Continent.

Half a month later, he assembled his Grey Cloud Heaven team: An Xihe, Qing Chan, Mo Mo, and Jian Yao. One Immortal King, two True Immortals, and two Human Immortals — five people, more than enough to dominate any realm.

Of course, departure required a proper send-off. Three days in the Void Divine Temple with the remaining wives. Emerging afterward, Qin Jiang stretched and sighed. "It's just a short trip. Why did everyone go so hard?"

The farewell had been more intense than any actual battle. He'd nearly been overwhelmed.

Liu Shuwan followed him out, straightened his clothes, and fixed him with a serious look. "Be careful in Grey Cloud Heaven. Stay close to Sister Xihe."

"I know. You know how much I value my own life."

"I'm serious!" She smacked his arm. "Grey Cloud Heaven is one of the Nine Heavens — deep foundations, powerful forces. You're settling scores for Mo Mo and Yao Yao, and their enemies aren't weak. A direct fight is fine, but what if someone plays dirty? Stay near Sister Xihe at all times. And finish quickly — we'll all miss you..."

She rose on tiptoe, wrapped her arms around his neck, and kissed him. "Hurry home, husband~"

He kissed her deeply, then pressed his lips to her forehead and flicked the tip of her nose. "I'll be back before you know it." A month at most, by his estimate.

They departed Qin Domain and stepped into the Chaos. At their power level, no airship was necessary.

"I think I still have those Chaos Marauders floating around out here somewhere," Qin Jiang mused, remembering the bandits he'd commandeered — originally Mo Mo's subordinates. They'd been dutifully paying tribute to the Qin family for years.

"I can sense them through the demonic qi I gave them," Mo Mo said. "They're pretty far off. Want to check on them?"

"Nah, just crossed my mind. Let's go."

Mo Mo cracked her knuckles eagerly, and they set a course for Grey Cloud Heaven. Three days later, they arrived. The spiritual energy density was comparable to Azure Cloud Heaven before An Xihe had wrecked it.

"Alright," Qin Jiang addressed the two natives. "Who's leading?"

Mo Mo shrugged. "I've been gone for over a million years. Don't look at me."

"Sword Sect first?" Jian Yao suggested.

Everyone agreed. Mo Mo nodded. "My enemy list is long, and I need to figure out who's still alive. Help Yao Yao first, then we'll investigate mine. I'll start writing things down."

An Xihe seized Qin Jiang's hand. "Stay with me."

"And me!" Qing Chan grabbed the other, beaming.

Mo Mo pouted — she'd been too busy plotting revenge. She hopped onto Qin Jiang's back. "I'll protect you too!"

That covered three sides. Qin Jiang eyed Jian Yao. What about the front? Want to hang there?

She shot him a look. If she were in front, she could guess exactly what he'd use to hold her in place.

"Just go." She waved and took the lead.

The other four followed in a cluster, Qin Jiang sandwiched between three women. About four hours later, they reached the Sword Sect. Jian Yao gazed at it with mixed feelings. Tens of thousands of years, and it was still just as feeble.

"Only one Human Immortal," Qing Chan observed. "With that kind of protector, a sect shouldn't be this pitiful."

"Ha. In my day, the Sword Sect was the strongest in all of Grey Cloud Heaven," Mo Mo said. "Rumor has it they possess an Immortal King's secret treasure. I'd bet that's what brought them to this sorry state."

Jian Yao sighed and nodded. "The rumor drew everyone's greed. A million years ago, a massive war broke the Sword Sect's dominance. Supposedly, no one found the treasure, and legend says only a Sword Sect heir can unlock it — which is the only reason the sect survived at all."
