Lian'er was whisked away by the women, and Qin Jiang was promptly ignored.

It was obvious who the real favorite was.

He shrugged and followed after them. Applying medicine to Lian'er? He felt that, as her brother, he was the most qualified person for the job.

So he muscled the medicine right out of Liu Shuwan's hands.

"Hehe, Lian'er, relax."

He grinned. Lian'er's face was scarlet — having Qin Jiang do it was one thing, and having just one of the sisters present was manageable, but right now everyone was watching.

Sensing her tension, Qin Jiang glanced back at the crowd. He coughed. "Could you all give us a moment? I'll handle this."

"I'll stay," Liu Shuwan said. "You don't know what you're doing, and you definitely don't know anything about maintenance. I'll supervise."

The other women could see Lian'er's discomfort — they'd feel the same way with an audience — so they nodded and filed out. Before leaving, they reminded Lian'er to come find them when she was ready to learn the maintenance routine. They'd hold nothing back.

Once the room cleared, Lian'er exhaled with relief.

Liu Shuwan's presence still made her a little self-conscious, but the thought of proper maintenance steeled her resolve. She couldn't let things go south. She had to take care of herself.

She braced herself and bared the area that needed attention.

Qin Jiang licked his lips and swallowed. He looked at Liu Shuwan. "Do I just apply it directly?"

"Of course not." Liu Shuwan rolled her eyes and began walking him through the process.

There were several different ointments, each with a different purpose, and they had to be applied in a specific order. She guided Qin Jiang through each step while simultaneously explaining to Lian'er.

Not that Lian'er absorbed much. Her face was burning so hot she could barely think. She bit down on her lip, her misty eyes locked on Qin Jiang.

After a while, Qin Jiang scratched his head. "So, uh... does the medicine still work if it gets... washed away?"

Liu Shuwan shot him a withering look, then gazed at Lian'er with sympathy. The poor girl was so embarrassed she looked like she wanted to burrow underground.

She sighed. It wasn't Lian'er's fault. If it were her under Qin Jiang's hands, she'd react the same way. It was precisely for this reason that none of the women ever let Qin Jiang help with their maintenance — his mere touch reduced the medicine's effectiveness by at least half.

They simply couldn't help it. It was physical, instinctive. Their bodies responded to him beyond their control.

"Out," Liu Shuwan said, shoving him toward the door. "I'll do it."

Qin Jiang protested, and shamelessly tried again, but... the medicine washed away a second time.

He sighed, looking at Lian'er. "Can you hold back just a little?"

"I can't help it~" Lian'er whimpered.

Was that something she could control?

"Fine, fine. Out you go. You want to look? There'll be plenty of time for that later."

Liu Shuwan pushed him out and shut the door. Left standing in the hallway, Qin Jiang muttered: "I can do more than look, you know."

Shortly, Liu Shuwan and Lian'er emerged. Lian'er's cheeks still held a rosy tint.

Liu Shuwan held her hand, smiling. "I'll teach you the maintenance routine over the next few days. After that, you can do it yourself."

"Okay~"

Qin Jiang swooped in, taking both their hands. "All done?"

Liu Shuwan nodded and shot him a look. "Would've been done ages ago if you hadn't interfered."

"I was being very thorough," Qin Jiang said with an innocent air. He'd been laser-focused during the application, eyes perfectly round with concentration. And to make sure he was applying it in the right spot, he'd practically pressed his face against it, double- and triple-checking with Liu Shuwan.

That was interfering?

He was being conscientious.

He pulled Lian'er into his arms, dropped a kiss on her lips, and smiled. "I'll keep helping you with the medicine, okay?"

"Mm~ no!"

Lian'er shook her head, face red. If he helped, none of the medicine would take effect.

So much for maintenance.

Qin Jiang smacked his lips, putting on a thoughtful expression. "The thing is, when you girls apply the medicine yourselves, it only stays on the surface. But I'm different — with my help, the medicine can go... deeper. Much more effective that way."

Lian'er blinked, considering this. That kind of made sense...

Liu Shuwan snorted. "That kind of medicine is meant for the surface. The deeper kind — you already give us that every day."

Qin Jiang paused, then laughed and nodded. "Fair point. But tell me, Wan'er — which works better? The surface kind, or mine?"

"They're completely different medicines. How can you even compare?"

Liu Shuwan's cheeks colored slightly. But under his expectant gaze, she mumbled: "...Yours is better."

"Hehe, I knew it."

Qin Jiang beamed. Liu Shuwan rolled her eyes, then turned to Lian'er. After a moment's hesitation, she asked with concern: "What about your parents...?"

"Oh, that? They said Lian'er popped out of a rock."

Liu Shuwan: "..."

Lian'er: "..."

Liu Shuwan was briefly stunned, but she understood the implication — their parents had given their blessing. The excuse, though, was certainly... creative.

She looked at Lian'er and couldn't help but laugh. "Our adorable Lian'er — who knew she had such an exotic origin? Born from a rock."

"Wan'er, stop..."

Lian'er groaned, face burning. She was starting to feel like she needed her mother to come up with a better cover story. "Popped out of a rock" was genuinely impossible to say with a straight face.

"It's fine, no matter where you popped out from, you're still our beloved little sister."

Liu Shuwan smiled warmly.

Lian'er drooped, then shot Qin Jiang a reproachful look. She'd been planning to use a different excuse, but this idiot had blurted out the rock story.

Was she going to be "the girl who popped out of a rock" to all the sisters forever?

Her face crumpled into a pitiful little frown, looking utterly helpless. Absolutely adorable.
