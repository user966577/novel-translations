Walking down the street, Chen Baizhe's brow furrowed slightly. The hand looped through Qin Jiang's arm gave him a surreptitious pinch.

She was still sore.

Qin Jiang winced and looked down, noticing the slight awkwardness in her gait.

"Stop staring—it's your fault!" she murmured reproachfully.

He grinned and slid his arm around her waist. "Want me to carry you?"

"No!" She glanced around. There were people everywhere—it would be embarrassing.

Qin Jiang's arm tightened, and before she could react, he hoisted her onto his shoulders in one smooth motion.

"Hold on tight."

His hand landed firmly on her backside for emphasis. Chen Baizhe's cheeks burned, but she grabbed onto his head, shifting until she found a comfortable perch. His broad shoulders made a surprisingly good seat, especially with his arm for support.

Passersby averted their eyes the moment they recognized who it was. The First Boss and his wife in the middle of a tender moment was not something they wanted to be caught staring at.

Perched up high, Chen Baizhe found the novelty delightful. She looked down just as Qin Jiang looked up, and he tilted his head to press a kiss to the inside of her thigh. She swatted his head lightly, scolding him, then carefully smoothed down his disheveled hair. Only when she was satisfied did she give an approving nod.

Qin Jiang was going to see Chen Qi'er. He had to look his best!

She knew her husband—petty to the bone. This wasn't just a visit; it was a victory lap. Running her fingers through his hair, she asked, "Are we killing Chen Qi'er today?"

"No need." Qin Jiang shook his head, hand wandering along her waist. "Just help me get under his skin."

"Okay."

She nodded, tilting her head as she pondered how exactly to provoke Chen Qi'er. She wasn't particularly experienced in that department.

Then a wave of killing intent slammed into them.

Chen Baizhe reacted instantly. She slid off Qin Jiang's shoulders and landed in front of him, posture sharp, eyes scanning for the source. Two figures. And one of them—

"Chen Qi'er?"

Her voice carried a note of shock. What had happened to him? And that outfit—women's clothing that looked utterly wrong on him.

Qin Jiang stepped up behind her, arms wrapping around her waist, chin resting on her shoulder. His gaze drifted to Chen Qi'er, and he grinned. "Baizhe, you remember—a while back, he was peeping at An Xihe and Qing Chan caught him. She... removed the equipment."

Comprehension dawned. Chen Qi'er wasn't a man anymore. But that wasn't important right now. She still needed to provoke him for Qin Jiang. She just hadn't figured out how.

Across the way, Chen Qi'er's face was black with fury. His fists were clenched white-knuckled, every detail of their intimacy burning into his eyes. And the moment he'd released his killing intent, Chen Baizhe had immediately shielded Qin Jiang. Was that man really so important to her?

His chest ached with something words couldn't describe. He still had feelings for Chen Baizhe. Even after losing his manhood, he'd harbored fantasies of reclaiming her someday.

But reality kept shoving the truth in his face—over and over, he watched the woman he cared about cling to his enemy.

Chen Wuming shrank beside him, remembering all too well the man responsible for his own loss. That man's woman had been the one to crush him. He hid his hatred deep.

Chen Qi'er steadied himself. With only Qin Jiang and Chen Baizhe present, he had nothing to fear. He strode forward. "Qin Jiang. We meet again."

His voice dripped with killing intent. Chen Baizhe's eyes hardened—she could feel the threat against Qin Jiang pouring off him. She positioned herself protectively, her own killing intent surfacing without restraint.

Chen Qi'er stared at her, pain lancing through him. "You'd kill me?"

"If you threaten Qin Jiang, I will."

Qin Jiang smiled from behind her, still holding her close. He winked at Chen Qi'er. "My wife protecting me—perfectly normal, right?"

"Hmph! Hiding behind a woman. Pathetic."

"I protect my husband because I want to," Chen Baizhe cut in before Qin Jiang could respond. "That's none of your concern. If you've got a problem, find a woman to protect you. Oh wait—" Her eyes widened with mock realization. "I forgot. You are a woman now. Can't really find a woman when you are one."

A direct hit.

Chen Qi'er went rigid. His eyes bored into Chen Baizhe in disbelief. The girl he remembered had been gentle. Kind. Even after joining the Human Dao Sect, the "Baizhe Immortal" was known for her cool elegance.

But this—dripping with mockery—was this the same person?

Clearly, Qin Jiang's influence ran deep. She'd become a mirror of that man.

Chen Qi'er trembled, devastated. "You've been corrupted! Look at yourself, Chen Baizhe—where's the woman you used to be?"

"None of your damn business."

Her first-ever curse word. It felt... exciting, actually. She'd picked it up from Qin Jiang, though she'd never used it before. Even in their most intimate moments, she hadn't sworn.

Qin Jiang's eyebrows shot up. Since when did Baizhe curse?

She looked up and saw his surprise. Color rushed to her cheeks, and she rose on tiptoe to kiss him. "How was that? Did I do good?"

With Qin Jiang versus Chen Qi'er, Chen Baizhe was two completely different people. This tender, seeking-approval version—Chen Qi'er had never seen it. Not even during his beggar days had she shown him such warmth.

His heart shattered.
