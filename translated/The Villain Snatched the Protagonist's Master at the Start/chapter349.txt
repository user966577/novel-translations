Inside the Qin family compound stood a newly built residence — commissioned by Li Xueyi herself. It could be described in one word: enormous.

She knew that when Qin Jiang came home, he'd be bringing quite a few women. So she'd had a residence constructed large enough to house all of them, with room to spare.

Li Xueyi surveyed the parade of stunning beauties filling the courtyard, a broad smile on her face. Her son certainly had his talents.

The women, in turn, studied Li Xueyi. Though most of them were older than her — and stronger, too — they couldn't help feeling nervous.

Qin Jiang began introductions, and with each one, the women presented a carefully chosen gift. Li Xueyi was almost embarrassed by the generosity. She was the mother-in-law; she should be the one giving gifts. But Qin Jiang had returned without warning, and she'd had nothing prepared.

Before coming over, she'd dispatched Qin Hao to find suitable gifts — nothing too extravagant, but there had to be something, and it had to be equal for everyone. No favoritism. This had put Qin Hao in a bind.

By the time Qin Jiang finished his introductions, Qin Hao still hadn't returned. Just as Li Xueyi started to worry, Qin Jiang discreetly slipped her a storage ring. Inside: a pile of identical bracelets.

Li Xueyi stared.

"Mom, these are our family heirlooms," Qin Jiang whispered.

Li Xueyi's eye twitched. She examined the ring's contents — rows upon rows of perfectly identical bracelets, all clearly brand new without a trace of wear. Family heirlooms? Since when did a family have this many heirlooms? And who was he kidding — they were obviously fresh from the jeweler.

She was starting to suspect that every one of these daughters-in-law had been swindled.

But she played along, presenting the bracelets as treasured heirlooms passed down through generations. The women could tell it was a ruse, of course — but they were thrilled nonetheless. The bracelets represented Li Xueyi's acceptance of them.

As Li Xueyi finished distributing the gifts, a small hand sneaked toward the storage ring and plucked out a bracelet. Li Xueyi caught it immediately.

"Hey — Lian'er, those are for your sisters-in-law."

She'd kept extras in reserve, anticipating future additions to Qin Jiang's collection.

Lian'er pouted. "It's a family heirloom. Why can't I wear one too?"

"That's different."

Li Xueyi rolled her eyes but didn't take the bracelet back. If Lian'er wanted it, she could have it. Making more in the same style would be trivial.

After the gifts were distributed, Li Xueyi excused herself, reminding Qin Jiang to bring Lian'er to visit when he had time. Years apart — she wanted to catch up with her children privately.

Back at her own residence, she found Qin Hao still fumbling with gift preparations. She waved him off. "Forget it. Jiang'er already handled it."

"Oh," Qin Hao said, visibly relieved. He'd been worried his selections wouldn't measure up. Then, rubbing his hands together, he sidled up to her. "So, where's Jiang'er and Lian'er? Didn't they come by?"

"Jiang'er's busy with his wives. Lian'er's over there too. I told them to come when they're free."

The old father missed his children, though he calculated that with this many daughters-in-law, it'd be days before Qin Jiang made the rounds.

"There is one small issue, though." Li Xueyi's brow creased, her expression conflicted and uncertain.

"What is it?"

"I think something's off with Lian'er."

"What? Did something happen to her?" Qin Hao's expression darkened with worry.

Li Xueyi shook her head. "Nothing happened. It's just..." She paused, then said carefully, "The way Lian'er looks at Jiang'er — it's not right."

Qin Hao froze, his face going stiff. "Wh... what do you mean?"

"The way she looks at him — like she wants to devour him whole. It's intense. Before they left, there were signs, but it wasn't this obvious. Now..." Li Xueyi frowned deeply.

Back then, Lian'er's attachment to Qin Jiang had already been unusually strong. Now it was brazen. The heat in her eyes was completely unconcealed — or perhaps, impossible to conceal. Her feelings for Qin Jiang burned too fiercely.

Qin Hao was stunned. He understood what Li Xueyi was implying and stood frozen, at a loss for words.

Seeing him stand there like a confused goose, Li Xueyi rolled her eyes. After a moment's thought, she said, "When Jiang'er and Lian'er come visit, we'll observe more closely. If Lian'er really is..."

Li Xueyi's personality was bold and direct — the kind of woman who loved fiercely and acted decisively. She'd once knocked Qin Hao unconscious to claim him. Qin Jiang and Lian'er had inherited at least some of that temperament.

"Should we discipline them?" Qin Hao asked.

Li Xueyi glared at him. "You lay a finger on them and I'll discipline you."

"Then what do we do?"

Qin Hao shrank back, looking aggrieved.

Li Xueyi snorted. "Then we let them be together. I'd worry about Lian'er with anyone else. At least with Jiang'er, I know he'll take care of her."

Qin Hao's expression was complicated, but his wife's word was law. And she had a point — he wouldn't trust Lian'er to anyone else either. Better to have Jiang'er looking after her.

Jiang'er would never mistreat Lian'er.

With a sigh, he nodded. "That works."

While they were still discussing, Qin Jiang arrived with Lian'er. A few years apart, and he wanted to spend time with his parents first.

Stepping inside, Qin Jiang immediately noticed that his parents' expressions seemed... off. Their eyes kept darting between him and Lian'er.

"Dad, Mom — what are you staring at?"

Lian'er was clinging to his arm, beaming as she called out her greetings.

Li Xueyi checked that no one else had followed, then shut the door. She exchanged a look with Qin Hao, and they nodded to each other.

Qin Hao had clearly noticed it too — Lian'er was being excessively clingy. Far more than a sister should be.
