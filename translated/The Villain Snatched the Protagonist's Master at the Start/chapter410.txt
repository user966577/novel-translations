Inside the room, Qin Jiang was like a desert traveler, begging for water wherever he could find it. No matter how much he drank, it was never enough.

In the end, the women kicked him out. If they let him keep drinking, they'd all be drained dry — dehydrated beyond recovery, possibly even wrung out completely.

Qin Jiang spread his hands innocently. He was genuinely parched. And compared to plain water, he much preferred the sweet, nourishing "nectar" his women produced. Combined, their output was considerable — they were just too stingy to let him drink his fill.

He pouted, then retreated to the room and called for Li Qingqiu to join him for a stroll.

The moment he summoned her, Li Qingqiu's eyes went wary. The others hadn't satisfied his thirst, and now he was singling her out. Was she about to become his personal snack?

"Qingqiu, let's go for a walk." He took her hand with a smile.

She huffed. "A walk is fine, but I'm not cooking you a private meal. And if you try to force me, I'll tell your mother the second we get home."

Qin Jiang's eyebrow twitched. He hadn't actually been thinking about a private meal — but this girl had just threatened him. And he was not the type to be intimidated.

He swept her into his arms with a grin. "Thanks for the reminder, dear. Your husband happens to be famished. Shouldn't a good wife feed her man?"

Li Qingqiu shuddered. Satisfying a quick craving was one thing — a full meal was beyond even the entire sisterhood's collective capacity.

Panic flashed in her eyes. She tried to call for help, but his lips sealed hers before a sound could escape. He lifted her, kissed her deeply, and vanished from the manor in a blur.

Moments later, they appeared in a small grove. Beneath Qin Jiang's relentless kiss, Li Qingqiu's resistance melted. Her body went soft against his, and all thoughts of rescue sank to the back of her mind. Sneaking off with this scoundrel counted as cheating, sure — but she wasn't the one losing out.

She tilted her head up, bit her lip, draped her arms around his neck, and whispered in a voice like silk and sin: "Husband, don't be greedy. I can't take too much."

Then she pressed her lips to his. Qin Jiang reciprocated eagerly — though privately, he was plotting. This girl had threatened him. She needed to be taught a lesson.

After a long, thorough kiss, they finally parted. Li Qingqiu's eyes were soft with affection. But Qin Jiang tilted her chin up and teased, "Now, who was it that said she wouldn't cook me a private meal?"

"Mm..." She pouted, arms locked around his neck, head shaking vigorously. "Don't know. Wasn't me!"

She would never admit it. Sure, she'd said it — but as long as her skin was thick enough, she could argue that her past self wasn't her present self. Take it up with the her from five minutes ago. She'd learned this particular art from Qin Jiang himself. Deny everything.

He laughed at her stubbornness. This version of Li Qingqiu was genuinely adorable.

"Not you?"

"Not me!"

"I also recall someone threatening to run to my mother. That wasn't you either?"

"Nope! Absolutely not!"

Qin Jiang pinched her cheek and smiled. "Ah, so it wasn't my Qingqiu after all. Must have misremembered."

"Exactly. Must have been your memory." She nodded seriously, then said with perfect sincerity, "People say poor memory comes from poor nutrition. Your memory is terrible, husband — you should take something for it."

"Oh? Like what?"

She locked eyes with him, rose on tiptoe, and kissed him firmly. After a long moment, she pulled back, breathing heavily. "That's the mild treatment."

"Mild?"

"Mhm. There's also the strong treatment. Want to try?"

"Absolutely!"

"But... right here?"

She looked around. It was broad daylight, in a grove that offered questionable cover. If someone walked by, they'd see everything. A thrill ran through her — her heart pounded.

"Maybe... we should find somewhere else?"

The thrill was real, but Li Qingqiu had no interest in an audience. The most intimate version of herself was for Qin Jiang's eyes only.

Qin Jiang shook his head with a wicked grin. "Right here."

"But what if someone sees?"

"Relax. Nothing escapes my senses. No one will see."

"Then... keep your guard up." Her face burned, but she'd yielded.

He nodded. "When have I ever been careless? Not a soul will see."

She relaxed slightly. Perverted as he was, Qin Jiang was nothing if not possessive. He'd sooner lock them all away than let anyone catch a glimpse. Since he wanted to stay, no one would find them.

Even knowing that, the open air still felt dangerously exciting.

"Ready when you are, Qingqiu."

She nodded, produced a length of silk, and spread it on the ground. "Lie down."

He obeyed. The next instant, his vision was engulfed in warm darkness.

Li Qingqiu's shy voice drifted to his ears: "This is the strong treatment."

He could only manage a muffled grunt.

It was strong, all right. Even just the scent alone sent his blood surging. And what he was tasting — that was beyond potent.

About an hour later, daylight returned. Li Qingqiu was watching him, her gaze heavy with desire. They'd only gone this far — a taste, nothing more. Not nearly enough to satisfy.

She draped herself against him, voice dripping honey. "Husband... I want more."
