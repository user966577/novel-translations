The Dragon Emperor led his three remaining Patrons skyward. In a single blink, they stood at the city gates, a hundred yards from the Fourth Patron.

The Dragon Emperor's expression was stern. The three Patrons wore looks that hovered between bewildered and amused as they stared at their wayward brother.

The Fourth Patron's eyes flashed. Then his jaw set with iron resolve.

"Tyrant—your end has come!"

The Dragon Emperor said nothing.

The First Patron covered his face with one hand. Despite the Fourth Patron's righteous posture, the First Patron had an inexplicable urge to laugh.

"Fourth Brother, enough. Come back."

The Fourth Patron turned to him, his brow creased with betrayal. "First Brother, we had an agreement! Attack from within and without—overthrow the tyrant together! Don't tell me you've turned traitor!"

The First Patron's face locked up.

The Dragon Emperor's head swiveled toward him. The First Patron's expression was a masterpiece of exasperation.

"Fourth Brother, what are you talking about?"

"Hmph. As I feared—you've betrayed the cause!" The Fourth Patron's gaze shifted to the other two. "Second Brother, Third Brother—what are you waiting for? Strike now! Topple this tyrant's rule!"

The Second Patron said nothing.

The Third Patron said nothing.

Both instinctively glanced at the Dragon Emperor, whose mouth twitched.

"What? Planning to topple me too?"

They laughed nervously and shook their heads. Strong as they were, the Dragon Emperor was stronger—and the Empire had been good to all four Patrons. Loyalty wasn't optional.

More importantly, the Dragon Emperor had certain... leverage over them.

"So you've all betrayed the revolution!"

The Fourth Patron's voice rang with sorrow and the sting of comrades forsaken.

The other three Patrons' faces contorted. They looked at the Fourth Patron the way one looked at a lunatic.

The citizens of the imperial city had long since gone slack-jawed.

The Fourth Patron drew a deep breath. His resolve hardened once more, and Emperor aura surged outward.

"Then if I must stand alone, so be it! This empire—I shall set it right myself! Tyrant, prepare to die!"

He roared, his aura cresting—but made absolutely no move to attack.

Finally...

"Cut!"

From the airship, a voice called out, followed by Qin Jiang's grinning emergence. He landed beside the Fourth Patron and clapped him on the shoulder.

"Excellent performance!"

The Fourth Patron's face crumbled. Before arriving, Qin Jiang had said he wanted to "put on a show." The Fourth Patron had assumed they were genuinely overthrowing the Dragon Emperor. Turned out it was literally a show.

Meanwhile, the Dragon Emperor and his Patrons turned their attention to Qin Jiang. The Fourth Patron's deference to this youth was obvious—and tinged with fear.

Qin Jiang looked up at the Dragon Emperor. This was, technically, another father-in-law. And the strongest one yet.

Decent-looking man. Dignified, imposing. His name, though—what was it again? Long Aotian. Qin Jiang had to fight the urge to smirk. A name straight out of a protagonist's playbook, yet the man wasn't even a Child of Destiny.

Their eyes met. The Dragon Emperor frowned; he had the distinct feeling this youth's gaze lacked proper respect.

Then a graceful figure emerged from the airship, landing at Qin Jiang's side. Long Xin'er bowed toward the Dragon Emperor.

"Father."

She took Qin Jiang's arm.

The Dragon Emperor's eyelid jumped. Third Princess. His own daughter. Not his favorite, but he recognized her. And now she was clinging to this boy like—

His cabbage had been stolen by a pig.

Imperial families were cold by nature, but seeing his daughter so intimate with this stranger stirred an uncomfortable feeling. She was a princess, for heaven's sake. Unfavored or not, she deserved a proper match.

One look at Qin Jiang, and the Dragon Emperor knew: this boy was no proper anything.

And that stunt with the Fourth Patron? Almost certainly this brat's idea.

He composed himself, preparing the standard father-in-law interrogation—but Qin Jiang beat him to it.

"Dragon Emperor, right? I've taken Xin'er as my wife. How much dowry can you offer?"

The Dragon Emperor's mind went blank.

The audacity.

He took a steadying breath. "My daughter is an imperial princess. Her dowry would naturally be generous. But what qualifications do you possess to marry into my family?"

"Qualifications?"

Qin Jiang rubbed his chin, then shouted: "Fourth Ancestor!"

When in doubt—Fourth Ancestor Summoning Technique.

Figures erupted from the ship, encircling the Dragon Emperor and his retinue in an instant. To Qin Jiang's surprise, Liu Shuwan had come out too.

She stood with sword drawn, its tip aimed at the Dragon Emperor.

"I am here to take a concubine for my husband. You object?"

The Dragon Emperor's pupils contracted. Not counting the Fourth Patron, seven Great Emperors surrounded him.

The three Patrons wasted no time.

"Your Majesty, this young man is clearly talented and distinguished—a perfect match for the princess!"

"Indeed! Let's go prepare the dowry immediately."

"Mm, and it should be substantial. If I recall correctly, Your Majesty possesses an Ancient Emperor's sword. Perhaps that could serve as the dowry?"

The Dragon Emperor's expression blackened. Internally, he was reeling. Seven Great Emperors, all following that young man's every command without hesitation. The female Emperor was apparently his wife? With a force like that, his background was beyond imagination.

Even the Dragon Emperor himself, with eight Emperors ostensibly under his banner, couldn't command this kind of absolute obedience. The four Patrons each had their own agendas, and the four independent Emperors barely acknowledged his authority at all.

Envy gnawed at him.

"Are these qualifications satisfactory?" Qin Jiang asked with a grin.

The Dragon Emperor felt a vein throb in his temple. It was hard to shake the feeling that his daughter had been forcibly abducted rather than courted. But with seven Emperors staring him down—and one of his own Patrons already turned—he had no choice.

"Satisfactory."

"Don't force yourself. I hate pressuring people."

"Not forced at all."

A rigid smile appeared on the Dragon Emperor's face. "Xin'er is fortunate to have found you. From this moment, you are the Divine Dragon Empire's honored son-in-law." His eyes slid meaningfully toward the ancestors. "Now, perhaps these esteemed friends might..."

He blinked hopefully at the wall of Great Emperors surrounding him. Having seven of them at his throat wasn't exactly comfortable.
