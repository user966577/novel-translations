Thanks to Qin Jiang's efforts to loosen things up, the two sides finally began to talk.

Ye Ling'er's mother was misty-eyed, clutching her daughter's hands. Ye Lingtian stood to the side, watching the tearful reunion between mother and daughter, slightly at a loss.

All he could do was stare at Qin Jiang. Qin Jiang stared right back.

After a while, Ye Ling'er's mother wiped her tears, her face breaking into a radiant smile. She kept hold of Ye Ling'er's hand—leaving Qin Jiang with nothing to grab.

"Ling'er, Mother will take you home."

Her voice was tender, warm.

Ye Ling'er sniffled and gave a soft hum. Just like that, the mother and daughter ignored everyone else and headed off toward the Ye estate.

Qin Jiang scratched his head and hurried after them.

Ye Lingtian glared. 'This kid—does he not understand the concept of being an outsider?'

He was about to follow when he noticed the assembled elders staring at him. He waved them off impatiently.

"That's enough. Go back to your duties."

Then he chased after Qin Jiang.

In a small courtyard, Ye Ling'er's mother and daughter sat together. Blood was blood—they warmed to each other quickly, chatting and laughing between gentle peals of girlish laughter.

Qin Jiang and Ye Lingtian stood off to the side, both thoroughly bored. They had no way into the women's conversation and could only eye each other awkwardly.

"Uncle Ye, should we... do something?"

"Do what?"

Qin Jiang: "..."

Ye Lingtian: "..."

The atmosphere between them was excruciating.

After another stretch of silence, Ye Lingtian broke first.

"Chat for a bit?"

"About what?"

Ye Lingtian: "..."

Qin Jiang: "..."

Ye Lingtian raised an eyebrow. Qin Jiang met his gaze without flinching. What had started as mere awkwardness was rapidly sharpening into something confrontational.

Soon, tendrils of pressure began radiating from Ye Lingtian, pressing down on Qin Jiang.

Not that it mattered. A mere Unity Realm cultivator's pressure couldn't so much as ruffle Qin Jiang's composure.

Qin Jiang's interest was piqued.

"How about a spar?"

Ye Lingtian's eyes lit up. He'd been itching to teach this boy a lesson but hadn't found a proper excuse. Now that Qin Jiang was offering—how could he refuse?

"Let's go—the training grounds!"

And so the two slipped away from the courtyard, heading for the training grounds. To "preserve Qin Jiang's dignity," Ye Lingtian was even thoughtful enough to seal off the arena.

They took their positions on the platform, facing each other.

"Now, Xiao Jiang—your uncle here is at the Unity Realm. If it gets to be too much, you can always concede."

Ye Lingtian's smile was all warmth and concern.

Qin Jiang smiled right back.

"If I'm not mistaken, Uncle Ye, you only recently broke through to the Unity Realm.

"Early stage, if I had to guess. My father's generation is the same as yours, and he's already at Unity Realm Perfection, pushing for the Saint Realm. He and I spar together regularly."

Ye Lingtian's face darkened, but he swallowed his annoyance and forced a smile.

"Well then, uncle won't have to worry about you."

He dropped the pleasantries. His aura surged like crashing waves, rolling toward Qin Jiang in relentless sheets. But against Qin Jiang, that towering pressure felt like nothing more than a light breeze.

"Uncle Ye, you can stop fanning me—I'm not hot."

Ye Lingtian: "..."

He snorted and unleashed his true power. He'd seen through Qin Jiang's cultivation at a glance—Divine Ability Realm, middle stage. At that age, it was extraordinary. A once-in-a-generation talent.

At the same age, Ye Lingtian himself hadn't even reached the Heavenly Soul Realm.

He sighed inwardly.

'The Qin family truly lives up to its reputation. One prodigy after another.'

Qin Jiang's father, Qin Hao, was of the same generation as Ye Lingtian and had been one of the top geniuses among the ancient clans. Qin Jiang's grandfather, admittedly, had been rather mediocre—the weakest link in the family line.

But Qin Jiang was even more gifted than his father.

"Here I come—brace yourself!"

Ye Lingtian called out the warning.

Then he launched a devastating strike. The blow carried fearsome power, but he was clearly holding back.

Qin Jiang chuckled, flicked his palm, and the attack dissolved into nothing.

"You'll have to take this seriously if you want to even scratch me, Uncle Ye."

Ye Lingtian blinked, genuinely startled.

"Impressive, boy!"

That strike had been strong enough to threaten a cultivator at Divine Ability Realm Great Perfection. He'd thought he was already overestimating Qin Jiang, but the blow hadn't fazed him at all.

He hadn't even seen how Qin Jiang deflected it.

"Very well—no more holding back."

"Bring it!"

Qin Jiang grinned.

He wasn't even sure of his own full capabilities, but Ye Lingtian registered as precisely zero threat. If he went all out, the family head probably couldn't beat him.

Ye Lingtian attacked again—still not at full force. Qin Jiang didn't bother pointing it out. He darted forward and engaged, trading blows at escalating intensity. As the power behind each exchange climbed, Ye Lingtian grew increasingly alarmed.

'I can't hold back anymore.'

The thought came unbidden.

If he continued pulling his punches, this wouldn't be him disciplining Qin Jiang—it would be Qin Jiang disciplining him.

He inhaled deeply and finally unleashed the full might of the Unity Realm.

In response, Qin Jiang quietly activated his Taotie Divine Body. Most of Ye Lingtian's power was simply devoured and nullified—some of it even converted into counterattacks.

Without the Taotie Divine Body, Ye Lingtian posed no threat whatsoever.

"This is boring."

Qin Jiang muttered.

With a flash of his eyes, he deactivated the Taotie Divine Body. Now, at least, he could feel some resistance.

"Crank it up, Uncle Ye!"

Ye Lingtian: "..."

'Crank up what?!'

He was already at his limit. Short of fighting with killing intent, there was nothing left to give—and what would be the point of that?

Qin Jiang grew more excited with every exchange, gradually pushing Ye Lingtian back.

BOOM!!!

A single blow sent Ye Lingtian flying. The family head cursed the entire way through the air.

'Damn it all—he really is disciplining me.'

"Ha! Uncle Ye, I just figured out a new move. Allow me to demonstrate!"

Qin Jiang laughed.

The sky split with thunder and lightning. Spiritual qi roiled. Qin Jiang hovered in midair, looking for all the world like a sovereign of heaven and earth.

He murmured a single phrase:

"Firmament—Quake."

BOOM!!!

The entire sky seemed to crack apart. Ye Lingtian found himself at the epicenter, as though the heavens themselves had declared him an enemy. Terror consumed his face.

The cold certainty of death settled over him like a shroud.

"Hey—kid—STOP! STOP!!!"

He screamed in panic.

'Why did I agree to this? I could actually die here!'

As Qin Jiang's palm fell, the full force of Firmament Quake erupted.

Savage energy ravaged the training grounds. The earth shook violently. Every member of the Ye family felt the tremor. Powerful cultivators turned in alarm toward the source of the blast.
