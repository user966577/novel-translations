Qin Jiang and Little Red emerged from the Space-Time Temple. Outside, barely any time had passed.

Not far away, Lian'er had already struck up a lively conversation with An Xihe and the others, apparently getting along swimmingly.

He brought Little Red over. The women greeted them with warm smiles, acknowledging Little Red with gracious nods.

Lian'er's eyes brightened immediately. She darted to Little Red's side, hooked their arms together, and blinked at her meaningfully.

Little Red blinked back.

Lian'er frowned. What did that mean? She didn't get the signal? That couldn't be right. Judging by the way Little Red was walking, mission accomplished. So what was with the blinking?

Qin Jiang watched the two women fluttering their eyelashes at each other. "Something wrong? Eye trouble?"

They snapped to attention and shook their heads vigorously. This conversation needed to happen without him around.

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes but didn't press. They weren't going to harm him. At worst, they had some little scheme cooking — nothing he couldn't handle.

He pulled Lian'er to his side and ruffled her hair, then smiled at An Xihe and the rest. "Everyone's met my little sister?"

"I already introduced myself to all the sisters-in-law!" Lian'er shook off his hand, swatting at his arm. "All you ever think about is that one thing. By the time you got around to introductions, the sisters-in-law and I would already be family!"

The women smiled. Lian'er was well-mannered and endearing — everyone adored her. And as Qin Jiang's sister, she was their sister too.

Those who'd known her longer exchanged knowing glances. This girl wanted to be a different kind of sister. Her intentions were getting less subtle by the day. At this rate, she'd just announce it outright.

As for Qin Jiang... he'd probably put up token resistance, then cave and let Lian'er have her way.

With introductions settled, Lian'er chatted with the group a while longer, making sure Little Red had a chance to get comfortable with everyone. Then she found an excuse, grabbed Little Red, and pulled her into a private room.

Inside, Lian'er checked that Qin Jiang wasn't nearby, shut the door, and raised a barrier with the Immortal Fire to prevent eavesdropping.

"Well? You two are together now, right?"

Little Red nodded. She knew what Lian'er was really asking — the bigger plan had more steps to go.

"And the rehearsal?"

"We did rehearse, but..."

"Oh?" Lian'er's eyes sparkled. "How'd it go? Was he cooperative?"

"Very cooperative."

"Hehe, I knew it. That pervert definitely loves that kind of game."

Little Red's cheeks colored at the memory. He'd been enthusiastic, all right. She was the one who'd paid the price.

Oblivious to her expression, Lian'er continued: "I asked Xihe-jiejie — she's got rope that can actually bind a Human Immortal. So you keep practicing with him, get him comfortable with the routine, and then when the time comes, I make my move. Hehe..."

Her grin was pure mischief — the exact same expression Qin Jiang wore when plotting something nefarious.

"When the time comes, Brother won't be able to escape even if he screams himself hoarse. Mwahaha..."

Little Red rolled her eyes at her unhinged friend. Truly, these two were siblings. The resemblance was uncanny.

But Lian'er's fantasy needed a reality check. "Actually, the rehearsal hit a snag."

"What?" Lian'er's grin froze. Her expression went deadly serious. A plan of this magnitude couldn't afford a single misstep.

"What kind of snag?"

"Well..." Little Red fidgeted, face flushing. "We did the tying thing. Except... I was the one who got tied up."

Lian'er's face went blank.

A small snag? The entire plan had imploded! If the real operation went the same way, she'd burst in to find Little Red bound up — and then what? Tie herself up too?

Wait. Actually, that idea had some merit...

While Lian'er spiraled into increasingly creative fantasies, Little Red's mind drifted back to the experience itself, and she found herself looking forward to next time.

After a long silence, Lian'er sighed. "So there's no way to tie him down?"

"Not necessarily." Little Red shook her head. "He's always in control. He ties me when he wants, and he'd let me tie him if it suited him."

"I see." Lian'er considered. If that was the case, the plan wasn't unsalvageable. She just needed the right moment — once he was bound, Little Red would signal her.

Simple enough. Crisis averted.

Her smile returned, and she leaned in close. "So, Red — what was it like? Being with my brother?"

"...Which aspect?"

"Which aspect do you think? The bedroom stuff! Hehe... tell me everything."

Little Red wanted to crawl into a hole. But under Lian'er's relentless needling, she eventually murmured: "It was... really nice."

"Really nice? How nice?"

"Very nice. Comfortable. Also a little tiring."

Lian'er nodded thoughtfully, a spark of longing in her eyes. She indulged in a private fantasy for a moment, then pressed on:

"Tell me more. What exactly did you two do?"

Little Red shot her a look. Sharing feelings was embarrassing enough — sharing details was next-level mortifying. "No!"

"Come on, Red, please? I need to be prepared for when the plan goes live. I'll need some experience, you know."

She had a point. When the plan went live, Qin Jiang would presumably be restrained, meaning Lian'er would have to take charge. Some baseline knowledge was... practical.

Little Red's face was crimson, but she reluctantly nodded. "Fine. But honestly, I don't have much experience either. He was in control most of the time..."

She spoke quietly, reliving the memories as she went, her blush deepening steadily. Somewhere in the middle of her account, she realized she was starting to miss him.

Lian'er listened with scholarly intensity, nodding, thinking, occasionally asking a clarifying question.

All in the name of preparation.
