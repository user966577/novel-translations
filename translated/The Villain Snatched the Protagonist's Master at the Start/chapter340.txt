With Huaxia Manor established, Qin Jiang's diligent "efforts" kept every one of his women in excellent spirits, which translated directly into efficient governance. The manor ran like a well-oiled machine.

The Merit Hall went live, stocked with an eye-watering array of treasures. The spoils Qing Chan had plundered from the obliterated hegemon factions filled the lower tiers, supplemented by items Qin Jiang purchased from the system — including Immortal Path Laws.

The first time the various faction leaders browsed the Merit Hall's treasury, their eyes practically glowed green.

Huaxia Manor's reserves were this deep? And they were actually willing to put treasures like these up for exchange? Granted, the high-end items demanded a staggering amount of Merit Points — daily missions alone wouldn't earn enough in a hundred years.

Just as despair was settling in, a wave of special missions appeared: expand territory, discover talented disciples, bring unaffiliated factions into the fold...

These special missions carried enormous point rewards. The subordinate factions dove in headfirst, fielding their best cultivators to bring independent powers into Huaxia Manor's embrace.

In short order, sect after sect pledged fealty. Most didn't even need to be pressured — they surrendered voluntarily. Which presented a problem: voluntary submissions didn't count toward the mission rewards. The established factions panicked. If everyone surrendered on their own, where were they supposed to earn points?

They accelerated their campaigns, racing to conquer every holdout before it capitulated on its own.

Half a year later.

Qin Jiang reviewed the completed-mission ledgers in Qin Family City, a satisfied smile on his face. "They're starting to buy in."

"You dangled too big a carrot," Liu Shuwan said, smiling as well. "No one could resist those treasures."

Huaxia Manor was hitting its stride, on track to become a true empire. But the easy gains were drying up.

"Almost every faction in Azure Cloud Heaven has submitted," Qin Jiang said. "Time to look outward — the other Eight Heavens."

"Agreed. Huaxia Manor's rapid growth is burning through resources fast, and Azure Cloud Heaven was already depleted when Xihe-jiejie extracted its origin. At this rate, the entire realm will be drained dry within a few decades."

Meanwhile, the Qin family back on the Heavenly Mystery Continent had been quietly expanding. In partnership with the Divine Dragon Empire, they now covertly controlled six of the Ten Lands, with the remaining four on borrowed time. The Nine Heavens, however, had been off-limits — to the Qin family. But not to Qin Jiang. Huaxia Manor's intelligence network had spent months mapping the other Eight Heavens. Each was roughly as powerful as Azure Cloud Heaven — no Immortal Kings, but plenty of True Immortals.

Azure Cloud Heaven, by contrast, was nearly cleaned out of True Immortals. They couldn't send An Xihe on errands to every heaven — that would exhaust even her.

"We still don't have enough firepower," Qin Jiang muttered. Direct conquest of the Nine Heavens was premature. Even if they seized them by force, their grip would be too weak to hold. Better to wait — but the resources couldn't wait.

He turned to Liu Shuwan. "Post a new mission in the Merit Hall: venture into the other Eight Heavens and bring back cultivation resources. Any resources, any quantity — all exchangeable for Merit Points. More resources, more points."

"On it." She polished his wording and published the task as an official manor mission, pushed directly to every faction leader.

The timing was perfect. The leaders had been fretting over depleted point-earning opportunities when the notification arrived. Their eyes lit up. The treasury treasures were spectacular — and spectacularly expensive. They were all broke.

But now, a new revenue stream: raid the other Eight Heavens for resources. Easy enough.

Factions began rallying their forces, preparing expeditions into the neighboring heavens — already calculating whether conquering foreign factions along the way might also earn them points.

While the manor's forces mobilized for the heavens, inside the Space-Time Temple, the women who'd been in seclusion finally began emerging.

Zi Fu broke through first — Human Immortal. Her realm stabilized instantly upon breakthrough, the culmination of long-accumulated potential.

Next came Linglong, who attained the Immortal Alchemy Path, crossing into the immortal realm. Her pill-refining abilities surged to a new level, and the Heavenly Pill Palace's alchemists benefited in kind — higher-quality pills for Huaxia Manor.

After Linglong: Hu Xian'er, Yu Lan, and Yu Ru, all reaching Human Immortal in quick succession.

Then Huo Qing'er and Huo Ying'er.

Followed by Ye Ling'er, Bai Susu, Chu Hanyan, Long Xin'er, and Xia Qianling.

Last was Yan Yun, who under Qin Jiang's exhaustive personal guidance had mastered the Yin-Yang Law. After his tireless day-and-night "tutelage," she'd endured a grueling period of seclusion before finally crossing the immortal threshold.

That left only Dan Yu and Xiao Jiu still below the immortal path — but they wouldn't be far behind.

As for Qin Jiang himself, under Liu Shuwan's watchful supervision, he'd been working hard as well. He broke through to Human Immortal.

The moment he did, his power surged, and he immediately issued a challenge: one man against all his wives, simultaneously.

Wheel tactics, group offensives — Qin Jiang faced them all without flinching, a single warrior holding the pass against a tidal wave.

Three months. Qin Jiang stood undefeated.

When the last of them finally retreated, he allowed himself a deep breath. It had been legitimately exhausting. But before he could rest, four figures appeared before him, skulking like thieves.

"You lot..."

It was the Divine Palace's Four Immortals — Wu Qi, Jiang Rou, Mu Xiyue, and Xu Yuxuan.

They exchanged a glance. Then Wu Qi lunged forward with a battle cry: "Sisters, we're the straw that breaks the camel's back! Charge!"

Qin Jiang smiled ruefully. The war was over, and here were four latecomers who'd missed the bus. What could he do? He was a softhearted man. He'd just have to start the engine up again for a private tour.

Less than a day and all four waved the white flag. First-timers, every one of them — their stamina was simply nonexistent. They tried to flee. But Qin Jiang, having just found his rhythm, wasn't about to let them escape.

And so the Great Demon King emerged once more, cackling villainously amid a chorus of shrieks.
