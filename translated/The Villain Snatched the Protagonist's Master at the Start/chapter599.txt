His doubt was, naturally, detected immediately. He went flying again.

When he was dragged back, Qin Jiang wore a look of pure resignation. He was getting used to this.

'That temper, though—'

The thought had barely formed when he saw her hand rising again.

"So you're saying I'm going to die too?" he blurted out, cutting off the beating before it landed.

"More or less." She lowered her hand and nodded, then added, "But you're far too weak right now. You're probably safe for the time being."

"..."

"After all, when they died, they'd all reached the absolute peak."

The naked condescension made Qin Jiang's lip curl. "I'm plenty strong, you know."

"You?"

"I'm an Immortal King!" he declared proudly.

The woman let out an involuntary snort of laughter. "An Immortal King... I can barely even remember how weak Immortal Kings are."

Qin Jiang rolled his eyes. Weak? In the Heavenly Domain, an Immortal King was a regional hegemon. But compared to this woman, the title did sound rather feeble. He studied her curiously. "So what realm are you?"

"Guess."

"Holy Sovereign?"

Above Immortal Emperor came Holy Sovereign, and above that, Divine Sovereign. Divine Sovereign was supposedly the absolute peak—beyond the power of heaven to destroy, beyond the power of earth to bury. Truly transcendent above all creation.

The woman smiled faintly and shook her head. Qin Jiang sucked in a sharp breath, eyes widening. "Then—Divine Sovereign?"

"No."

She shook her head again.

Qin Jiang faltered. Not Holy Sovereign, not Divine Sovereign—then what, Immortal Emperor? Impossible. A mere Immortal Emperor couldn't possess this kind of power. He fought Immortal Emperors regularly enough to know their limits.

His eyes flickered. "Is there a realm above Divine Sovereign?"

"There is." She nodded. "Most living beings believe Divine Sovereign is the highest realm, but above it lies one more. We call it the Pinnacle."

"The Pinnacle?" His eyebrow rose. Did the name mean the absolute limit had been reached?

"You're at the Pinnacle?"

"I am."

He smacked his lips and pressed on. "And the Grand Sovereign?"

"He's also at the Pinnacle. But within that realm, he's traveled very, very far..."

"So the Pinnacle is the highest realm?"

She shook her head. "The Dao has no end. Originally, everyone believed Divine Sovereign was the ceiling. But he forced open another realm beyond it—the Pinnacle."

"The Grand Sovereign?"

"He was the first Pinnacle-realm powerhouse." She paused, hesitating briefly before continuing. "Though I suspect he may have already touched the threshold of the next realm beyond that."

"What realm?"

"Unknown. When he breaks through, he'll probably name it himself."

"..."

"Oh—and those eight Myriad Realms Tower champions? Every single one of them was also at the Pinnacle."

Qin Jiang's cheek twitched. The Pinnacle—beings of that caliber, and they'd still been killed. Terrifying.

"Is the Grand Sovereign really that powerful? Strong enough to slay Pinnacle-realm cultivators?"

A flicker of emotion crossed her face—something like resignation. After a pause, she said quietly, "Against him, I wouldn't last ten moves."

Qin Jiang felt a chill. They were both at the Pinnacle, yet she couldn't survive ten moves against the Grand Sovereign. And she was his daughter—he might well have been holding back. In a real fight, it could be over in three.

"What are you imagining? There's no way I'd go down in three moves! I'm a Pinnacle-realm cultivator, not some paper doll!"

Her voice sharpened with irritation.

Qin Jiang offered a sheepish grin, then couldn't resist pressing, "Could you please stop reading my thoughts?"

"No." She crossed her arms and huffed. "If I don't keep watch, who knows what you'll start thinking about."

"Monitoring me won't change anything. Some thoughts are involuntary."

He rolled his eyes. Case in point: with her arms crossed like that, the resulting emphasis on her figure was making restraint physically impossible.

Sure enough, the thought had barely registered before her expression froze. She dropped her arms, glared daggers at him, and took a steadying breath.

"So—do you want to live or not?"

"Yes." His answer was instant and sincere. His gaze, however, continued drifting southward of its own accord.

"If you want to live, stop looking and stop thinking!"

He cleared his throat, shrugged with exaggerated innocence. "It's not my fault."

"Not your fault? Whose fault is it, then?"

"Yours, actually."

She blinked.

Qin Jiang nodded with conviction. Seeing anger building on her face, he added quickly, "If you weren't so perfect, I wouldn't be unable to stop myself from looking and thinking..."

The fury drained from her expression in an instant. She gave a light huff. "Regardless of how I look, you are not permitted to stare."

"I'll try my best."

His eyes continued their unauthorized reconnaissance without the slightest change in behavior. But the woman didn't seem truly angry anymore. He had a point—she was that perfect, and it would be unreasonable to expect total restraint. She'd let it slide.

Setting aside his wandering gaze, she looked at him directly. "If you want to survive, you need to do as I say."

"You're that certain I'll die?"

"Their deaths weren't coincidence." Her tone was absolute.

Qin Jiang nodded slowly. Eight number-one ranked cultivators, all at the Pinnacle, all dead. That was hard to write off as chance.

Still, studying her face, he couldn't help but ask, "You seem to have quite a grudge against the Grand Sovereign..."

"It's not a grudge."

"Hmm?"

"That's none of your concern. Just know that from now on, you answer to me." She waved a dismissive hand, her gaze fixed on his.

Under her intense stare, Qin Jiang spread his hands in surrender. "Do I have a choice?"

"No." She raised a finger and wagged it in front of his face.

He stared at the pale, slender digit, fighting the primal urge to bite it. But the likely consequence—being ground to powder—kept his teeth in check. He licked his lips and sighed. "Fine. I'll listen to you."

There was no choice. The power gap was insurmountable—he had zero ability to resist. All he could do was compromise.

Besides, taking orders from a beauty like this wasn't exactly a hardship. Even if she harbored some unconventional preferences, Qin Jiang felt he could be accommodating. Like, say, if those delicate little feet were to step on him...
