Having babies was definitely not happening. The last thing Qin Jiang needed was to bring a little troublemaker into the world — one with his personality. That would be an absolute nightmare. After all, he knew himself. Way too chaotic.

That said, while actual babies were off the table, the baby-making process certainly was not. Think of it as... clearing the path for future generations.

Several days passed.

Nangong Yun came by again, and after making him wait for half the day, Qin Jiang finally opened the gate.

This time, there was no need for acting. Weiwei and Xue Yue clung to Qin Jiang's sides, radiant smiles on their faces. But the moment their eyes landed on Nangong Yun, their expressions curdled into open disgust. They spared him a single glance before looking away — no sense dirtying their eyes.

Nangong Yun didn't notice the shift. His gaze drifted to the women's midsections, where their snug dresses revealed a subtle but unmistakable swell.

'They're really pregnant?'

His face went white. It had only been a few days — even if they were pregnant, it shouldn't show this soon. But cultivators weren't like ordinary people. And in this world, there were treasures that could manipulate the flow of time. What had been mere days might have been months or even years with a time-acceleration artifact. Huaxia was rumored to possess exactly such a treasure — that was how the organization had grown so explosively powerful, dominating the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. This man probably had one too. Otherwise, none of it made sense.

Nangong Yun swayed on his feet. The nightmare he'd been having every night had come true. Both his senior sister and Xue Yue were pregnant. He clutched his head, face twisted in agony, barely able to accept reality. It felt like the nightmare hadn't ended at all.

"Nangong Yun, where do you think you're looking?" Xue Yue snapped, eyes cold. "Keep staring and I'll gouge your eyes out!"

"Xue Yue..." He opened his mouth but found nothing to say.

The sheer revulsion on her face was unmistakable — and clearly not an act. With her temper, the threat to blind him was probably genuine. She'd already pulverized his manhood, and it still hadn't healed. The Anti-Huaxia Alliance was too poor to afford the medicine he needed.

He quickly averted his gaze, not keen on losing his eyesight too. Xue Yue snorted in satisfaction and flashed Qin Jiang a cheeky wink.

He smiled and ruffled her hair, then glanced down at both women's bellies. He shook his head — of course they weren't pregnant. They'd just been a bit too enthusiastic about their "porridge." Over the past few days, they'd consumed more servings than he could count, and it had added just a touch of softness to their lower stomachs.

He'd offered to rub their bellies and help them digest, but they'd refused. Said they wanted to keep the warmth a little longer.

Well, he was a generous man. He'd indulge them. He'd even topped them off with an extra serving. They'd devoured that too — impressive appetites, really.

Now, arms around their waists, Qin Jiang gave a mischievous squeeze. Both women gasped and swatted his hands away, faces burning. "Stop it, you scoundrel~"

Their rooms were packed to the brim — they could barely get the doors shut as it was. If he added any more pressure, something was going to burst. And the one who'd feel bad about it would be him.

He chuckled and relented, then turned to Nangong Yun. "What do you want?"

Nangong Yun snapped back to reality and hurriedly composed himself.

'Endure. Keep enduring!'

Even if his senior sister and Xue Yue bore this man's children, he would never resent them. They were doing it all for his sake. He'd even raise the children alongside them if he had to.

He took a deep breath and felt a glow radiating from his entire being.

Holy light.

Emotions reined in, he managed a smile. "Senior brother, Master has come out of seclusion. She sent a message saying she couldn't reach senior sister, so I came to check."

"Master is out of seclusion?" Weiwei's face lit up.

Her relationship with Nangong Yun was shallow, but the bond with her master ran deep. Her master had raised her from childhood — she was a mother in everything but name, and Weiwei treated her as such.

She pulled out her message stone. Sure enough, there were messages from her master. She'd simply been too busy with Qin Jiang to notice — busy from morning till night, every single day, without a moment's rest.

After reading the messages, Weiwei looked up at Qin Jiang. "Master wants me to come home."

"Home?" He smiled and nodded. "Alright. I'll come with you."

"Really~?" Her face brightened. Then, a touch shyly: "My master raised me since I was little. She took care of me like a daughter. When you meet her... could you be nice to her?"

She knew Qin Jiang well enough by now. He was a scoundrel through and through. If she didn't say something ahead of time, there was no telling what he'd do to her master.

He pinched her cheek. "Relax. You think of your master as a mother, so I'll naturally treat her as a mother-in-law. I'll be on my best behavior."

"Yay! Thank you, husband~" She pecked his cheek, then suddenly stiffened, her face going crimson. She pressed her legs together and clung to him. "I... the door just burst open."

"We'd better get you back," Qin Jiang said, scooping her up. One hand held her; the other reached down to help plug the breach.

He glanced back at Xue Yue. "Yueyue, let's go."

"Mm~" She nodded and padded after them on quick little steps, disappearing back through the courtyard gate.

Nangong Yun stood alone outside, expression complicated. He reached into his robes and produced a barrel of spirit liquid, setting it down by the gate.

He'd heard that women were prone to dehydration and needed to replenish their fluids. So he'd gone out of his way to acquire this spiritual water for Weiwei and Xue Yue. But from the look of things, he couldn't deliver it in person. He'd just leave it here and hope they'd find it.
