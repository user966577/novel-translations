Before long, Qin Jiang walked into the training grounds holding Bai Susu's hand, instantly drawing every gaze in the arena.

Qin Jiang swept a casual glance around and waved at the crowd, but most eyes weren't on him—they were on Bai Susu. Everyone present understood the relationship between Qin Jiang, Bai Susu, and Lin Chen. None of them had expected Qin Jiang to actually bring Bai Susu along. It felt like rubbing salt in the wound—twisting the knife after the cut. The Qin family members exchanged knowing looks and turned sympathetic gazes toward Lin Chen.

Bai Jingyun glanced at Lin Chen, his expression slightly awkward. He coughed twice and said, "Chen'er, wait here for a moment. I'll go check on Susu."

He hurried over to Qin Jiang and whispered, "Why did you bring Susu here?"

The challenge itself was already a provocation. Now bringing Bai Susu along was practically designed to humiliate Lin Chen.

Bai Susu didn't speak. She kept her head slightly lowered, one hand held by Qin Jiang, the other clutching her hem, seemingly nervous. Qin Jiang gently squeezed her hand and smiled. "Susu was worried about me. She insisted on coming to watch."

Bai Jingyun's cheek twitched. He looked at his daughter, who offered no denial. Then Qin Jiang turned his gaze toward Lin Chen and said, "Let's not waste time. We'll start now—Susu didn't get much rest."

Bai Jingyun: "..."

Watching his precious daughter get endlessly bullied by Qin Jiang, he ground his teeth in frustration. He shot Qin Jiang an irritated look. "Lin Chen has been ready for a while. If you're good to go, we can start anytime."

"Then let's begin." Qin Jiang nodded, led Bai Susu to the spectator area, and said softly, "Watch from here."

Bai Susu nodded. As Qin Jiang turned to walk toward the arena, she hesitated for a moment, then couldn't help calling out, "Qin Jiang..."

"Hm?"

"Be careful. I... don't forget what I told you." Her face was flushed.

Bai Jingyun, standing nearby, overheard and asked, "What did you tell Qin Jiang?"

"N-nothing. I just reminded him not to underestimate his opponent," Bai Susu said quietly.

Bai Jingyun paused, recalling that Qin Jiang seemed to know a suspicious amount about Lin Chen. "You didn't tell Qin Jiang everything about Lin Chen's abilities, did you?"

"Just... just a tiny bit..."

Hearing her sheepish tone, Bai Jingyun rolled his eyes. He had the distinct feeling that his daughter was capable of selling out the entire Holy Sword Sect to Qin Jiang.

Qin Jiang stepped onto the arena. On the opposite side, Lin Chen was already waiting, his expression dark. He glanced at Bai Susu in the spectator area—she seemed even more alluring than before. Only that allure had been given to her by Qin Jiang.

"Lin Chen. Heh, you really do live up to your name—as dusty as they come. Quite the homely face you've got there."

Qin Jiang's chuckle and voice carried across the entire arena. Everyone's lips twitched. The gunpowder was already thick before the first move?

Lin Chen's face spasmed, murderous intent surging beneath his gloomy eyes. In his previous life, his greatest sore spot had been his appearance. His current body was decent enough, but he still wouldn't tolerate anyone insulting his looks.

"Hmph. Is the mighty Qin family's young patriarch only capable of running his mouth?" Lin Chen sneered.

Qin Jiang grinned. "If the truth alone is enough to set you off, I don't mind saying more. Like—short, fat, round..."

"Shut up!" Lin Chen roared, eyes blazing with fury mixed with a flash of shock. Those words described his previous life's features exactly. Could Qin Jiang see through to his soul?

In the spectator area, the onlookers found Lin Chen's reaction baffling. Sure, Qin Jiang's words were insulting, but none of them applied to Lin Chen's current body. Why was he losing his composure so badly?

But Bai Susu's beautiful eyes flickered. She recalled the portrait Qin Jiang had given her—the one showing Lin Chen's true appearance. Short, fat, round... with a dark, pudgy face that was ugly beyond measure. She hadn't believed it before, assuming Qin Jiang was just trying to disgust her. But seeing Lin Chen's reaction now, she was starting to think Qin Jiang might not have been lying after all.

Bai Susu swallowed hard, fighting a wave of nausea. If that portrait was accurate, the thought that she'd once admired this man... She couldn't help but dry-heave.

Beside her, Bai Jingyun startled. "Susu, are you alright?"

"I'm fine." Bai Susu took a deep breath and shook her head.

Bai Jingyun didn't worry too much—he assumed it was just morning sickness. Perfectly normal. But he silently cursed: 'That bastard Qin Jiang. Susu is already pregnant and he's dragging her out here. If something happens, let's see how you handle it!'

On the arena, three words had been enough to shatter Lin Chen's composure. With a furious roar, he drew his sword and slashed. A razor-sharp sword beam infused with Sword Intent surged toward Qin Jiang's face.

In the face of that terrifying strike, Qin Jiang simply extended one finger and tapped lightly. The devastating attack dissipated like a gentle breeze, vanishing without a trace.

Lin Chen's eyes went wide with disbelief. That strike had carried Sword Intent—at his Divine Ability Realm cultivation, it was powerful enough to wound a Yin-Yang Realm cultivator. And Qin Jiang had neutralized it with a single finger.

"How is that possible?" Lin Chen muttered.

In the spectator area, the Qin family members nodded approvingly. 'As expected of our young patriarch. Not only is he powerful, he's got style...'

Bai Susu blinked in confusion. Her own cultivation was too low to read the flow of battle—all she could see was that Qin Jiang had tapped his finger and Lin Chen's attack vanished. "Is Lin Chen playing around?" She remembered watching his fights at the Holy Sword Sect—every strike had been thrilling, brimming with devastating power. Like a war god. Unrivaled. Now it looked like children playing house.

Bai Jingyun's expression was grave. From that single exchange alone, the gap between the two was obvious. "Lin Chen can't beat Qin Jiang."

"Hm?" Bai Susu looked at her father questioningly.

"Before, you thought Lin Chen was powerful because of who he was being compared against. But replace his opponent with Qin Jiang, and the dynamic completely flips," Bai Jingyun explained.

Bai Susu's lips parted in shock. "Qin Jiang is... that strong?"

"Sigh. Worthy of being the Qin family's young patriarch. In front of him, Lin Chen looks like a child—no ability to fight back whatsoever. The gap is simply too vast." Bai Jingyun shook his head, a note of resignation in his voice. After all, Lin Chen represented the pinnacle of the Holy Sword Sect's younger generation. To see him so thoroughly outclassed was hard to accept.
