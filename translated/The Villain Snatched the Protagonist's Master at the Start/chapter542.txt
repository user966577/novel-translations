Wu Tian's respectful demeanor surprised Qin Jiang slightly. Blown to pieces and still this composed—not bad for a reincarnated Immortal Emperor. Excellent temperament.

But temperament wouldn't save him. Today, he was a dead man.

Qin Jiang swept his arm through the air. Space tore open, and a figure stepped through the rift—Wu Yingtao.

He took her hand, pulled her to his side, and ruffled her hair. "Yingtao, today you can avenge your brother."

"Mm~" She nodded.

Her gaze locked onto Wu Tian, killing intent surging. She'd waited so long for this.

Wu Tian, hearing Qin Jiang's words, blinked in confusion. Avenge? Avenge what?

At least his sister was here now. Old Yun should be safe—

Even now, Wu Tian's first thought was the middle-aged man.

He looked at Wu Yingtao and started to smile, about to greet her. But she spoke first, voice cold as ice. "I don't know who you are, but you stole my brother's body. Today, I'm avenging him."

Wu Tian's expression froze. An unpleasant suspicion crept in. They were all here for him? To avenge her brother?

Wait—there was nothing to avenge! He hadn't been possessed! This was a misunderstanding!

He didn't doubt that Wu Yingtao had been misled. The gap between his old self and his current self was dramatic enough to make anyone think "possession."

Feeling the weight of her killing intent, he rushed to explain. "Yingtao, you've got it wrong. I wasn't possessed. It's just—"

He trailed off. His situation was, technically, not very different from possession. Even if he tried to explain, he couldn't make it sound convincing.

He stood there, tongue-tied, then managed, "I'm really not a possessor."

"Not a possessor?" Wu Yingtao laughed coldly. "Then explain to me how my talentless, gloomy brother became you."

Silence.

"And while you're at it, explain why you called yourself 'this emperor.'"

More silence. He opened and closed his mouth, at a loss. He genuinely couldn't explain. But how did Yingtao know about the "this emperor" thing? He'd never used that title in front of her. And after being severely wounded years ago, he'd mostly dropped the habit—only slipping into it occasionally.

She shouldn't have known. But he couldn't dwell on that now. The priority was making her believe he wasn't a possessor. Otherwise, given the current lineup, his fate would be grim.

His eyes fell on the middle-aged man, and they lit up. They'd been together over twenty years—the man knew him inside and out. He could vouch for him!

"He can prove I'm not a possessor," Wu Tian said, pointing at the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man blinked. Vouch for him? Was this fool delusional?

Didn't he realize he'd been played for twenty years?

Hearing Wu Tian, both Qin Jiang and Wu Yingtao looked at the middle-aged man. Wu Yingtao knew perfectly well this was Yun Bao's father—Qin Jiang's spy, embedded at Wu Tian's side to monitor him and pave the way for her revenge.

Asking a spy to vouch for him? This man was an idiot. Her actual brother, while unremarkable, hadn't been this stupid. That alone confirmed the possession.

"Old Yun, hurry up and explain for me!" Wu Tian urged.

The man's face was a mask of bewilderment. Explain? Explain what exactly?

He looked at Wu Tian, then at Qin Jiang.

Explain? Like hell.

You are a possessor!

Outside of Qin Jiang, no one knew the truth. Even the middle-aged man had always assumed Wu Tian was a body-snatcher.

After a brief hesitation, he spoke. "I've been with him for years. Based on what I've observed... he's almost certainly a possessor."

"???"

Wu Tian's face went rigid, eyes bulging in disbelief. What a familiar scene. At the critical moment, he'd been backstabbed—again.

"Old Yun, you..." He pointed at the man, teeth grinding, voice shaking with rage.

In his previous life, a betrayal at the crucial moment had killed him. Heaven had given him a second chance, and now—at another life-or-death juncture—he was being betrayed again.

"Old Yun, twenty years! Twenty years of friendship!"

The man shrugged. Friendship? It was all an act. This fool had actually believed it. Must have fried his brain during the possession.

"His temperament doesn't match his age. His knowledge is beyond the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. When we first met, he constantly called himself 'this emperor' and talked about going back for revenge. In sum—this isn't the original Wu Tian. It's someone else wearing his body."

Wu Tian was devastated. Now he really couldn't explain his way out of this.

He turned to Wu Yingtao, voice bleak. "Yingtao, do you believe me?"

"Heh."

The evidence was overwhelming. And this creature was still trying to lie his way out. Clearly, he was afraid—afraid because he knew that if he couldn't explain, death was certain.

Seeing her expression, Wu Tian's heart sank. No one was going to help him. He'd have to find his own way out.

But against one Immortal Emperor and eight Immortal Kings—depleted, grievously wounded—it felt exactly like his previous life.

Despair crept in. Was history going to repeat itself?
