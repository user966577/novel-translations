Li Hongyang and the rest of the team were stupefied.

'Yep. Classic rich-kid entrepreneurship—pure improv.'

Purchase price? Unknown. Quantity? Unknown. Selling price? Unknown. A trifecta of ignorance.

Still, Li Hongyang had no intention of pointing any of this out. Before he'd left, Su Zhenguo had given him explicit instructions: follow Su Lin's lead, don't interfere.

Clearly, Su Zhenguo was testing his son—measuring the boy's mettle.

While the crew was whispering among themselves, Su Lin's phone rang.

Chen Yang had already parted ways with Ye Feng.

He hadn't spared a single thought for his 300 yuan day-labor fee. Instead, he'd called Su Lin the moment they'd separated.

"Hey, Boss."

"Yang, talk to me. I've got people and money ready on my end. Give me the details."

"Right. So I followed Ye Feng to Donghai, and that's when I found out there's a wholesale herb market there. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but they deal in bulk—serious volume."

"Ye Feng used his 8,000 yuan to buy about 150 pounds of gastrodia. It sold in under a minute—280 yuan a pound."

"Oh? And the purchase price?"

"About 60 yuan a pound in the countryside."

Su Lin could hear Chen Yang fighting to contain his excitement.

Understandable. With his 20,000 yuan invested, the return would be close to 100,000 yuan.

"How's the demand?"

"Massive. Ye Feng's batch got swarmed—buyers didn't even haggle. He told me afterward he thinks he sold too cheap."

"Good. Get back as fast as you can, Yang. I'm sending people out to buy door-to-door right now."

---

Armed with the intel he needed, Su Lin dispatched Li Hongyang immediately.

"Brother Yang, I'll set the purchase price at 50 yuan a pound. If you can negotiate lower, the difference is yours."

Li Hongyang held up his hands. "No, no—I can't do that. Young Master Su, I may be here to help, but I'm still on the company payroll. If the boss found out I was double-dipping, I'd be fired on the spot."

Su Lin smiled. "Don't worry about my dad. I'll talk to him. By my estimate, if we sweep Zhongjiang and the surrounding counties, we're looking at around 20 tons—roughly 50,000 pounds. Are you sure you don't want the bonus?"

Li Hongyang's eyes widened. He'd assumed Su Lin was buying a few hundred pounds at most. Hearing "50,000 pounds" changed the calculation entirely.

It was just a few days' work driving around the countryside.

At 50,000 pounds, even one yuan per pound knocked off the purchase price meant 50,000 yuan in his pocket.

"And that's a conservative estimate. This is a bumper year for gastrodia in Zhongjiang—the tubers are enormous. Add in what the farmers have stockpiled from previous years, and Brother Yang... if you don't want the opportunity, I can find someone else to make the trip."

"I want it. Why wouldn't I?" Li Hongyang pushed his glasses up, his expression turning serious. "Young Master Su, just watch. I'll clean out every last tuber in every household."

Su Lin nodded. This was exactly the effect he'd been going for.

Offering Li Hongyang a cut gave the man skin in the game—aligned their incentives perfectly.

Smart people didn't need things spelled out. A single hint was enough.

"Alright, Brother Yang. I won't keep you. Head out now—time is of the essence."

Li Hongyang nodded. He had no desire to linger either. Every yuan per pound he negotiated down meant another 50,000 yuan in earnings. That was real money.

Su Lin fronted 2 million yuan for the operation.

He'd have given more, but Zhongjiang was only so big, and gastrodia production had its limits. Extra cash wouldn't help if there was nothing left to buy.

As for whether the gastrodia would sell—Su Lin wasn't worried in the slightest.

A wholesale market was called "wholesale" because it dealt in tons.

And yet Ye Feng had shown up with a mere 150 pounds and been mobbed. That told you everything about how desperately short the supply was.

Monday rolled around in the blink of an eye.

Su Lin arrived at school as usual and had barely sat down when Xia Shiyu appeared, accompanied by Lin Xiaowan.

Lin Xiaowan was giving Su Lin an odd look, while Xia Shiyu was positively radiant.

Xia Shiyu was carrying a thermal lunch box.

She walked straight up to Su Lin. "You didn't tell me what you like to eat, so I just made whatever."

Lin Xiaowan eyed Su Lin. "Su Lin, your life just keeps getting cushier. Shiyu tells me she's got your breakfasts covered for the next three months."

Su Lin nodded with a grin. "That's right. I'm her biggest creditor now, so naturally she has to keep me happy."

"You lent out that much money—won't your father have something to say about it?" Lin Xiaowan asked with a hint of concern.

Su Lin chuckled. "Xiaowan, I lent Shiyu my own money. What's my dad going to say about that?"

"Your own?"

"That's right. Who says only my dad gets to make money?"

Lin Xiaowan blinked, then stared at him with undisguised surprise. "I didn't realize you were already earning money as a high schooler."

"There's a lot about me you haven't realized. How well do you actually know me?" Su Lin raised an eyebrow.

Lin Xiaowan went quiet. She was discovering that she didn't know Su Lin very well at all.

She'd always thought he was merely hiding his true personality. Now it was becoming clear he'd also been hiding his talents.

Su Lin noticed Lin Xiaowan's contemplative silence and discreetly cast Appraisal on her.

**[Lin Xiaowan: Age 17, 5'6", 106 lbs. Current Affinity: 60 (rising).]**

Already at "budding interest"—and climbing.

Su Lin was genuinely surprised.

Of all the heroines in the novel, Lin Xiaowan was the hardest to win over.

She seemed easygoing on the surface, but underneath she was fiercely proud. Even exceptional people rarely caught her eye.

Yet in just a few days, her affinity was already this high.

What Su Lin didn't realize was the impact his recent behavior had made on a teenage girl's worldview.

The quiet resilience—enduring mockery and dismissal with an unbothered smile, playing the long game while everyone else played checkers—all of it had left a deep impression on Lin Xiaowan.

Add Xia Shiyu constantly singing his praises until Lin Xiaowan's ears were ringing, and the affinity numbers practically climbed themselves.

"Xiaowan, have you had breakfast? Want to share?"

Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "I already ate. I'll pass—wouldn't want you going hungry."

"Tch. Suit yourself, but don't drool."

Su Lin opened the thermal box, and the moment the lid came off, Lin Xiaowan's eyes locked onto it like a heat-seeking missile.

Xia Shiyu had put real artistry into the presentation—fruits and vegetables arranged into adorable bear shapes, flower patterns, and other delicate designs.

The box had three tiers: cold dishes on top, hot dishes in the middle, rice on the bottom.

Lin Xiaowan had to admit that seeing this breakfast made her realize she could eat a little more after all.

Su Lin looked at the lovingly arranged contents and shook his head with a wry smile. "Shiyu, why'd you make it so pretty? Now I feel bad eating it."

"Hehe, I just threw it together. Hurry and eat—morning study period starts soon."

"Fine. Here goes."

Despite the early hour, the three of them chatting openly had drawn the attention of every student in the classroom. The male students in particular—seeing Xia Shiyu bringing Su Lin breakfast—looked ready to commit murder and take his seat.

"Mmm! Amazing."

"Shiyu, your cooking is restaurant-quality. You could open a place and it'd be packed." Su Lin gave her a thumbs-up.

Lin Xiaowan scoffed. "What kind of comparison is that? Restaurant chefs are all overweight middle-aged men. Shiyu would never end up like them."

"I... that was just a figure of speech."

"A bad one. At least pick a flattering comparison."

"Fine. You win."
