"Hm? What's wrong? Why are you so worked up?" Wang Xiaoqian eyed him curiously.

"What do you think? Our daughter's got a boyfriend." Lin Guoqiang said, sounding like he'd aged several years.

"A boyfriend? That's impossible! Our daughter isn't some ordinary girl. She spends every New Year in Beijing—who in Zhongjiang could possibly catch her eye?"

Then something clicked. Wang Xiaoqian's eyes went wide. "Don't tell me it's that Su Lin?"

Lin Guoqiang sighed. "That's the one."

"I finished up at the office today and happened to pass by the school on my way back. Figured I'd have Awei swing by and pick up Xiaowan. And then..."

He recounted everything he'd witnessed.

Once Wang Xiaoqian had processed it all, she said, "So why didn't you bring her home? You came back alone?"

"I... I figured she'd come home after she finished up. I didn't expect her to still be out at nine."

"Ha, have you forgotten how long it's been since anyone cooked in this house?" Wang Xiaoqian shot him a look.

"That's... that's not my fault. We're both busy. Who has time to cook?"

"So she's probably out having dinner with that boy right now. Just wait—she'll come home after they eat." Wang Xiaoqian said calmly.

"Wang Xiaoqian, how are you not worried?!" Lin Guoqiang said, exasperated.

Wang Xiaoqian gave him a withering glance. "Of course I'm worried. But what good does worrying do right now?"

"We don't even know the full picture. All we can do is wait until she gets home and ask."

"Ugh... why did I come back alone?"

...

Outside the family compound, Su Lin's car pulled up and he checked the time—nearly nine-thirty. He felt a twinge of guilt. "Didn't expect the restaurant to have a waiting list. It's so late now. Xiaowan, are your parents going to give you a hard time?"

Lin Xiaowan smiled. "My parents probably aren't even home from work yet. They're always busy—they usually get home late."

"And even if they were home, they wouldn't say anything."

Su Lin nodded. "Good. Get going then. See you at school tomorrow."

"Okay! I'm definitely going to beat your score this time." Lin Xiaowan pumped her little fist.

"Heh, confidence is good. We'll see the results tomorrow."

Looking at that smug grin on Su Lin's face, Lin Xiaowan wanted nothing more than to punch it. But given the vast gap in their combat abilities, she settled for getting out of the car with a huff.

Su Lin watched her retreating figure and thought: 'That silhouette alone is lethal.'

One more month. Then they'd make it official.

Su Lin drove away with a smile.

...

Lin Xiaowan walked through the front gate. Seeing both cars in the garage, she knew her parents were home.

She didn't think much of it—she'd come home late before.

The moment she opened the door, she found Lin Guoqiang and Wang Xiaoqian in a staring contest. Had they been arguing?

Lin Xiaowan's eyes darted between them. "Dad, Mom, I'm home."

Then she tried to make a swift escape toward her bedroom.

But Wang Xiaoqian wasn't about to let her slip away. "Xiaowan, why the rush? It's so late—where were you?"

"Mom, I was out having dinner with friends." Lin Xiaowan replied.

"Dinner? Where?"

"A barbecue place on Happiness Avenue. It was packed tonight—we had to take a number and wait, so I'm late. What's wrong? Is something the matter?" Lin Xiaowan looked at Wang Xiaoqian quizzically.

Something about her parents seemed off. The way they were both staring at her—it was strange.

Wang Xiaoqian relaxed slightly hearing it was just dinner. That was fine. What she feared was post-dinner activities.

"Just dinner? By yourself?"

"No, who goes that far to eat alone? I was with friends."

"Which friends?"

"Mom, what's with the interrogation today? You're acting like I'm a suspect." Lin Xiaowan frowned.

She was no fool—far from it. Her mind was sharp, and Wang Xiaoqian's line of questioning told her exactly what this was about.

"We're just worried about you dating." Wang Xiaoqian sighed.

"D-dating? That's impossible! I would never date." Lin Xiaowan fidgeted with the hem of her shirt, her face turning pink.

Lin Guoqiang and Wang Xiaoqian exchanged a glance, both feeling their hearts sink in unison.

That blush was as good as a confession.

Wang Xiaoqian stepped closer and looked at Lin Xiaowan seriously. "Xiaowan, are you really not dating anyone at school?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "Really, Mom. I'm not."

Privately, she reasoned that the bet with Su Lin hadn't taken effect yet, so it technically couldn't count as dating. Once the bet kicked in—that would be the official start.

Wang Xiaoqian could tell that Lin Xiaowan might not be dating now, but give it time and things would be different.

And she was fairly certain Lin Xiaowan had fallen for a boy. That boy was almost certainly Su Lin.

"Sweetheart, your father and I aren't saying you can never date. But high school and college are the most important stages of your life. You should be focused on studying. Understand?"

"Mom, I'm already second in the entire school. How much more focused on studying can I get?"

"Second? You've always been first. How did you drop to second?" Lin Guoqiang jumped in.

"Because Su Lin is inhuman! Out of 750 total points, he scored 746. Perfect in everything except Chinese. So yeah, he passed me." Lin Xiaowan stomped her foot.

Though her expression held no trace of actual frustration—if anything, she looked proud. Happy, even.

Lin Guoqiang felt another wave of irritation. Someone else scores well and 'you're' the one beaming with pride?

"746? Su Lin's grades are that good?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "After the exam today, I compared answers with him. I got some wrong again. He's probably hitting 740-something. So I'm second place. Again."

"Xiaowan, the parent-teacher conference is after midterms, right?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "Dad, you're so busy—you're not actually thinking of coming to the conference?"

Lin Guoqiang declared with righteous conviction, "So what if I'm busy? Nothing is more important than my daughter's education. I'll be at this one."

Lin Xiaowan stared at him as if she'd seen a ghost. From elementary school onward, Lin Guoqiang had never once attended a parent-teacher conference.

Every time, Lin Xiaowan had gone alone. Fortunately, her grades were always stellar enough that the teachers didn't push the issue.

When you're top of the school, you get certain privileges.

"Dad, you're not messing with me? You're really going to come?"

Lin Guoqiang nodded. "Of course. Honestly, it's shameful that I've never been to one. Xiaowan, I promise—once the school sends out the notice, let me know, and I'll make time."

"Great! Thanks, Dad."

Seeing Lin Xiaowan's radiant smile, Lin Guoqiang was at a loss for words. He hadn't expected something as simple as attending a conference to make her this happy.

At the same time, he wanted to size up Su Lin in person. They'd eaten together once before, but Su Lin hadn't said a word—the adults had dominated the conversation. This time, Lin Guoqiang wanted to see what the boy was really made of.

He shot Wang Xiaoqian a look. She took the cue and led Lin Xiaowan to her bedroom for another round of gentle probing.

An hour later, the couple reconvened in their own room to discuss what they'd learned.

"Xiaowan didn't say it outright, but I can tell—she's really fallen for that Su Lin. She's been well-behaved and independent, so she probably hasn't officially started dating. But make no mistake, old Lin—what's your take?"

Lin Guoqiang looked at Wang Xiaoqian. "Let me have a cigarette."

"Don't you dare!"

"I can't think without one."

"Fine, fine. Smoke, smoke—you'll smoke yourself into an early grave. One. That's it."

Who would have thought that the decisive, commanding Lin Guoqiang was so thoroughly domesticated at home? He lit up, and with the nicotine, clarity returned. "If we try to force them apart, it'll backfire."

"But letting things develop naturally won't work either. Xiaowan is no match for that kid. It's been barely a month and she's already smitten. An ordinary teenager doesn't pull that off."

"So we need a solution that addresses both sides."

"What solution? Spit it out."

"If brute force won't work, we go soft. Starting tomorrow, we both make an effort to come home earlier. Xiaowan eating out every night isn't sustainable."

Wang Xiaoqian nodded. "What else?"

"We drive her to and from school. That way, the only time she's around him is during school hours. A campus full of people—even Su Lin wouldn't be brazen enough to try anything too obvious."
