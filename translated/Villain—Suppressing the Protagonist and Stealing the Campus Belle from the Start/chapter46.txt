The building ahead bore four large characters: "Escape Room."

"Escape Room? This is what you're having me do today?" Lin Xiaowan's interest was piqued.

Su Lin nodded. "That's right. Escape rooms don't even exist in Donghai yet—only in Shanghai, Beijing, and Chengdu. I didn't expect Zhongjiang to have one. Supposedly it was designed by the same team that built the one in Shanghai. Should be interesting."

"Oh? Have you done one before?"

Su Lin shook his head. "No, but I've read online that they're really fun. Thrilling. Great for building friendships and connections. And you get to see people's true character. Something this fun—I had to try it."

"Now you've got me curious. Su Lin, do you know how it works?"

"Mm. The gameplay seems pretty simple. More interesting than a haunted house." Su Lin smiled.

"H-haunted house? Are we doing that too?" Lin Xiaowan's voice trembled slightly, though she didn't notice it herself.

Su Lin shook his head. "After escape rooms, haunted houses just don't have the same appeal."

"Uh... why does this sound kind of scary?"

"Not scary at all. It's like an intellectual obstacle course."

"Really?"

Just as Lin Xiaowan looked skeptical, a couple emerged from the exit.

The girl was fair-skinned and pretty, but she was sobbing hysterically, barely able to walk straight. Her boyfriend was supporting her, trying to comfort her.

"Them...?"

"They probably failed the challenge. She seems upset about it." Su Lin kept his voice neutral.

"Failed the challenge?"

Su Lin nodded. This world's escape rooms were more intense and immersive than Earth's. He didn't want to scare Lin Xiaowan off before they even started.

He still wanted to try it.

Just then, several more people exited. Every single girl was crying or looked shell-shocked—traumatized and pitiful.

Lin Xiaowan felt a chill run down her spine. "Su Lin, how about we do something else? I've been to this amusement park before—there are some fun attractions."

Su Lin waved her off. "Bumper cars, log flumes—those are boring. Done them all. Today, we're doing the escape room. Xiaowan, you promised—whatever I want to do, you'd do."

Lin Xiaowan's voice came out dry. "Fine..."

Su Lin smiled. "Look at this line. So many people are willing to try it. If they're not scared, why would you be?"

"I-I'm not scared."

Despite her words, Lin Xiaowan's small hand had already found Su Lin's sleeve and was gripping it tightly.

Su Lin found this amusing. So she did have weaknesses after all.

---

Watching girl after girl emerge in tears, the line somehow grew even longer. Most of the guys were clearly there to accompany their girlfriends.

Clearly, women were a paradoxical species—no accurate self-assessment, yet always seeking thrills.

Su Lin looked at Lin Xiaowan, whose face had gone pale. His heart softened. "If you're really scared, we don't have to do this. We can do the other stuff you mentioned."

Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "This many girls are trying it. Obviously it's fun—they just couldn't handle it. I want to see for myself."

'She's asking for it.'

Apparently, no woman could escape the trap of her own pride.

"Xiaowan, I did warn you. When we're in there, don't start crying and make people think I bullied you." Su Lin teased.

Lin Xiaowan rolled her eyes at him, looking alluring despite her annoyance. "I'm not like them."

After an hour-long wait, it was finally their turn.

Lin Xiaowan studied the rules posted on the wall.

Su Lin tugged her arm, and they approached the front together.

"Are you two doing a couples challenge or individual?"

Su Lin glanced at Lin Xiaowan. "Couples."

The staff member nodded, unsurprised. "Go ahead. And remember—no running around inside."

He looked at Su Lin. "Keep an eye on your girlfriend. If it gets too much, shout and someone will come get you."

Su Lin nodded.

The two entered.

As the door closed behind them, everything went pitch black.

Lin Xiaowan grabbed Su Lin's wrist in the darkness. "Su Lin, why is it so dark in here?"

"I've never been here before—how would I know? Hold onto me. I'll lead."

Su Lin's physically enhanced body gave him excellent night vision.

After a brief adjustment period, he could see the layout clearly.

They walked down two corridors and arrived at an ancient-looking wooden door.

The door was battered and worn—the kind you'd never see in modern Zhongjiang. Two tattered lanterns hung from it.

"Xiaowan... Xiaowan?"

"Huh? Where are we, Su Lin?"

"At the entrance to the escape room. Xiaowan, don't tell me you've had your eyes closed this whole time?" Su Lin asked, incredulous.

"It was so bright outside and so dark in here—I couldn't adjust."

"Heh. It's brighter now. You can open your eyes."

"Oh! Okay!"

Lin Xiaowan slowly opened her eyes. "Ah! Where is this? How did everything change so suddenly?"

Before Su Lin could answer, the challenge instructions came through the speakers.

"Welcome, players, to Escape Room. You must find three clues within the time limit. Use those clues to locate the key. Only with the key can you escape the room."

"Your first task: enter the chamber and find a missing ancestral tablet. Place it on the shrine."

Su Lin put his arm around Lin Xiaowan's shoulders and gently patted her head.

Mm...

Very comfortable.

He'd wanted to do this for a while. Lin Xiaowan reminded him of a proud Persian cat—before, he could only look. Now, he could finally pet her.

"Xiaowan, don't be nervous. Let's complete the mission first."

"S-Su Lin, why is this place scarier than a haunted house?"

"Heh. Why else would they call it an 'escape room'? Come on!"

Su Lin took Lin Xiaowan's hand and led her inside.

The room's décor was elaborate—distinctly Qing Dynasty style.

Tables and chairs on either side, a larger set at the front. Teapots and cups on the tables, though empty.

Su Lin scanned the room with his titanium-grade vision, confirmed there was nothing of interest, and pulled Lin Xiaowan deeper inside. "Let's go. Further in."

"Okay!"

Given the space constraints, the corridors were quite narrow—Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan could only just walk side by side.

They passed through several rooms before finally spotting the missing tablet.

Su Lin looked around but didn't notice anything suspicious.

"Su Lin, I see the tablet!" Lin Xiaowan said excitedly.

She let go of his hand and started toward it.

Su Lin mused that this girl was sometimes timid as a mouse and other times surprisingly bold—like right now, charging ahead alone.

He was willing to bet that tablet wouldn't be easy to retrieve.

Lin Xiaowan picked it up. Just then, Su Lin heard a soft click, and a figure sprang up behind her.

She was about to return to Su Lin when she found herself face-to-face with a ghastly pale figure staring at her.

"What... are you doing with my tablet?"

"AHHH! GHOST!"

Lin Xiaowan hurled the tablet and bolted.

Su Lin caught her in mid-flight. "It's fake! It's fake! That's not real!"

"GHOST! Su Lin—there's a ghost!"

Su Lin patted her back and called out, "It's fake. That's a mannequin."

He carried her over to the figure. "Look again."

"No no no... I'm not looking."
