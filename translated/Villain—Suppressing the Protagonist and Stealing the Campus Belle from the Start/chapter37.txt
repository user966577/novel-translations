In the end, Lin Xiaowan was defeated by Su Lin's brazenly intense gaze.

She cursed inwardly—the way he looked at her was getting more and more shameless. And Xia Shiyu was right there egging him on from the sidelines.

With only Su Lin and Xia Shiyu as her friends, and spending every day around them, Lin Xiaowan found herself increasingly unable to hold Su Lin's gaze. Those deep eyes of his were like a whirlpool, drawing her in.

"Fine. I'll think about it."

Su Lin's grin widened.

Coming from Lin Xiaowan, "I'll think about it" was essentially a yes. The only reason she'd hedged was that she needed time to get her parents on board.

But Su Lin suspected she wouldn't succeed on that front. Her father would almost certainly shut it down.

Which actually worked in his favor. With Lin Xiaowan's personality, parental opposition would only harden her resolve to join him.

Back in the classroom after lunch, Su Lin had barely sat down when Chen Yang pulled him aside.

"Yang, what's the rush? The stock hasn't sold yet—relax."

Chen Yang shook his head. "Boss, I'm not here about the money."

Su Lin raised an eyebrow. "Then what?"

"Remember when you asked me what I wanted to do with my life?"

Su Lin nodded. "Yeah. What about it?"

"I figured it out." Chen Yang could barely contain his excitement.

"Oh? Let's hear it."

Su Lin was genuinely surprised. Chen Yang was an excellent manager, but he'd never shown much aptitude for entrepreneurial vision. The fact that he'd come up with something was unexpected.

Chen Yang took a deep breath. "I want to open a chain of supermarkets."

Now Su Lin was truly taken aback. He studied Chen Yang carefully. "Supermarkets?"

Chen Yang, worried that Su Lin would dismiss the idea, launched into his pitch. "Boss, chain supermarkets are already huge overseas, and there are some in China too. But they're mostly in major cities—Walmart, Carrefour, places like that. Zhongjiang's a county-level city, so there aren't any here."

"Mm-hmm. Go on."

"The concept is to put everything people need under one roof—rice, vegetables, snacks, household items..."

As Chen Yang laid out his vision with growing eloquence, Su Lin's surprise deepened. This wasn't the kind of analysis a high school student could produce on his own.

Chen Yang had clearly done serious research—looking into international models, studying the economics of scale.

"Yang, where did this supermarket idea come from?"

"I..."

Chen Yang froze. The concept had originally come from Ye Feng, who'd mentioned it offhandedly during their countryside trip. Chen Yang hadn't thought much of it at the time, but curiosity got the better of him and he'd spent an entire evening researching the topic.

The more he dug, the more impressed he became with the business model.

He'd refined and expanded the idea considerably, but the seed had been Ye Feng's.

"Boss, actually the idea came from—"

Su Lin waved a hand. "I don't care who came up with it. If it makes money, that's what matters."

He continued, "If we were to build a supermarket in the Jiangning district—your Carrefour-level vision—how much would it cost?"

Chen Yang answered without hesitation. "Small scale, about $28,000. Large scale, $70,000."

"What about buying the building outright instead of renting? Full Carrefour spec."

"If we're buying property and going all-in, at least $140,000. The real estate is the biggest expense."

Su Lin nodded. "Here's what we'll do. Take some time to put together a detailed proposal—costs, locations, projections, everything. I want to see the numbers."

"Boss, you mean you're actually on board with this?" Chen Yang's eyes lit up.

Su Lin nodded. "I think it has real potential. Let's start with one location in Jiangning as a test run. If it works, we expand—one in every district of Zhongjiang, then grow from there."

Were Walmart and Costco not proof enough? Retail empires built on supermarkets were some of the most valuable companies in the world.

The margins were enormous.

Hearing Su Lin's vision, Chen Yang felt his blood pumping.

A supermarket in every district of Zhongjiang—that was an empire in the making.

And he'd have a stake in it.

Su Lin's expression turned serious. "Yang, think carefully. Once we commit, there's no turning back. If we want to have the supermarket running before college entrance exams, the timeline pressure on your grades—"

Chen Yang waved it off. "No problem, Boss. I barely study at home anyway—there's always family stuff to deal with. My grades haven't suffered."

"Alright. Then go for it."

"One more thing—keep chatting with Ye Feng when you get the chance, but don't mention the business."

"Huh?" Chen Yang stared at Su Lin, bewildered by how his boss had guessed the idea's origin.

The logic was simple enough: the vision hadn't come from Chen Yang, and the only other person he'd been spending time with was Ye Feng.

Su Lin wanted Chen Yang to maintain his relationship with Ye Feng for one reason: intelligence. He needed to keep tabs on the protagonist's moves. One slip-up, and Ye Feng might stumble onto his first fortune—which would make him much harder to contain.

Su Lin clapped Chen Yang on the shoulder. He didn't explain the real reason, opting for a simpler one. "He's been bothering Shiyu and the girls lately. Keep an eye on him for me."

"Ah, that makes sense." Chen Yang nodded, relieved.

Su Lin added, "When we set up the company, I'll probably bring Shiyu in too. Just so you know."

Chen Yang looked slightly disappointed. "You're not running it yourself, Boss?"

Su Lin smiled. "I'll be involved, but not on the ground floor. Shiyu needs the training."

"Boss, are you and Xia Shiyu..."

"Exactly what you think."

"And Lin Xiaowan?"

"Also exactly what you think."

Chen Yang: "..."
