Xia Shiyu's situation didn't simply blow over.

After walking her back to her seat, Lin Xiaowan came to find Su Lin again.

"Why are you back?" Su Lin looked at her, mildly surprised.

Lin Xiaowan's expression was grave. "Su Lin, I think Shiyu's change has something to do with Ye Feng."

"Uh..."

Su Lin was genuinely impressed. This girl was terrifyingly sharp—she'd pieced it together this quickly.

He was suddenly grateful he'd planned his trap so carefully. With Lin Xiaowan's intellect, a sloppy scheme would've been spotted in a heartbeat.

"What makes you think that?" Su Lin put on his own serious face.

"Shiyu's mood shifted right after our hospital visit. But she was fine on the way there—chatting and laughing with us. You remember how quiet she was on the ride back?"

Su Lin nodded. By that point, Xia Shiyu had already handed the money to Ye Feng. Of course she'd been anxious.

"True. She barely said a word on the way back. But we'd just seen her dad in that condition—nobody was in a chatty mood."

Lin Xiaowan continued. "But these past few days, Ye Feng's been seeking Shiyu out constantly. Every time he leaves, she looks pale and dazed."

"Xiaowan, you're paying awfully close attention to Shiyu."

"Growing up, I had lots of so-called friends, but very few real ones. Shiyu is someone I genuinely care about. Of course I'm going to pay attention."

Su Lin nodded. "But she won't talk. What can you do?"

"I could confront Ye Feng directly."

Su Lin scoffed. "Confront him about what? If Ye Feng were willing to spill, Shiyu wouldn't be keeping secrets."

"Then what am I supposed to do? I can't just stand by and do nothing."

Su Lin's tone softened. "It hasn't reached that point yet. Trust me—if Shiyu's under this much pressure, holding it all in, she's going to need a release valve. And that moment is coming. I give it a few days before she cracks and tells us everything. Don't go stirring things up in the meantime."

"Fine. I'll wait a few more days."

Su Lin nodded, satisfied.

The protagonist was an existence that defied explanation—that defied logic itself.

Su Lin figured that until Ye Feng's credibility collapsed, it was better to keep Lin Xiaowan away from him. Not that she'd ever fall for the guy—but Su Lin always preferred to leave nothing to chance.

...

Back home, Su Lin checked the trading platform. His necklaces had sold out.

At 3,500 each, minus transaction fees, that was roughly 600,000 yuan in the bank.

"This is more profitable than highway robbery."

That night, three world bosses spawned. They were all dead within two hours.

The Destiny Necklace fever hit a new peak. Su Lin listed his remaining 2,000 necklaces without hesitation.

He couldn't be sure when the developers would patch the bug, so waiting for the price to hit 5,000 or 6,000 was out of the question.

Cash in hand, sleep well at night. That was the only strategy that mattered.

The wealthy players of this world never ceased to amaze him. Two thousand necklaces—sold out in under two hours.

He didn't finish processing deliveries until eleven that night.

Once his necklaces were gone from the market, the Destiny Necklace entered a phase of explosive price growth.

By midnight, someone had listed a batch at 4,000 each—over a hundred at once.

Su Lin chuckled. "Scalpers are the same in every world. Too bad these guys are all secondhand dealers. They can sip the broth, but that's all they'll get. And they'd better drink fast, or they'll choke on it."

A smile played across his face—one that was hard to read.

Some of his bulk buyers had purchased hundreds at a time. Obviously not regular players.

But Su Lin didn't care. Those speculators could do whatever they pleased. His money was already in the bank.

Whether they ended up eating their inventory wasn't his concern. Professional item traders won some and lost some—that was the business.

Meanwhile, in the old district of Zhongjiang City, at the Happiness Community housing complex...

Ye Feng was also tracking the Destiny Necklace price.

His family couldn't afford a computer, so he relied on his phone to check forum posts.

"3,500 now. Five times profit already. Don't rush... wait a little longer. I'll sell at 5,000. Sell everything at 5,000."

Because of Su Lin's price manipulation—driving costs higher before Ye Feng even entered the market—Ye Feng had been forced to raise his target. At 700 per necklace, he needed a much higher exit price to cover Xia Shiyu's father's transplant costs.

He had no idea that a colossal trap was already closing around him.

At that very moment, Su Lin was composing an email.

**Subject: [City of Angels] Epic-Level BUG—Destiny Necklace Infinite Splash Stacking!!!**

'Sorry about this, Ye Feng. And sorry to all you speculators in the City of Angels marketplace. I know this is a bit of an "eat the meal, then flip the table" move. But what can I say? I'm the villain. And you and I were never meant to coexist. So don't blame me for playing rough.'

Su Lin didn't know whether the developers had already discovered the Destiny Necklace bug. If they had—great. If not, he'd give them a nudge.

A bug this severe would get emergency-patched the instant it was confirmed.

And to prevent Ye Feng from getting lucky and cashing out early, Su Lin needed the developers to find it 'now'.

After all, Ye Feng was the protagonist. Protagonists were unreasonable by nature. What if the guy had a sudden flash of inspiration and sold everything before the crash?

Su Lin finished the email, created a burner account, and sent it anonymously to the game's official support address.

"Done."

He snapped his fingers and shut down the computer.

"Sorry, Shiyu. But your brother Su Lin had to be cruel to be kind."

"Don't worry—I'll cover every cent of your dad's treatment."

He genuinely cared about Xia Shiyu. She was no longer just a character in a novel. She was a real person standing in front of him, and that changed everything.
