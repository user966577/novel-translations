The Destiny Necklace's price exploded that night. The world chat was flooded with buy orders—1,000 each, then 1,500, then 2,000 by the early morning hours.

Su Lin held over 4,000 necklaces. A quick mental calculation told him that selling at an average of 3,000 apiece would net roughly 1.5 million yuan.

Chen Yang was losing his mind too.

Even at 2,000 per necklace, Su Lin's haul would be worth over a million yuan.

In the internet cafe, Chen Yang sat frozen at his station, staring into space.

"He bought them for under 100 each on average. Selling at 2,000... Boss just made millions off this one play. So this is what it means to be out of your league."

Suddenly, the 2,000 yuan he'd earned over three days of work didn't feel so impressive anymore.

But he rallied quickly. His feelings toward Su Lin were nothing but admiration and awe.

"Boss played this perfectly from the start. No wonder he had me posting on forums—it was all about building hype for the Destiny Necklace before the explosion. Now the fuse has been lit."

"Absolutely brilliant."

Chen Yang harbored no jealousy whatsoever. If anything, he genuinely wanted Su Lin to succeed.

Seeing Su Lin's plan pay off brought him real joy.

Su Lin didn't overthink it. He listed 500 necklaces on the trading platform at 3,000 each, with a minimum purchase of 10, and went to bed.

*City of Angels* was a juggernaut—on par with the biggest MMOs out there. He wasn't worried about finding buyers.

The next morning, Su Lin woke to find that over 400 had already sold.

Thanks to his advance marketing campaign, the moment the patch dropped and the bug went live, the Destiny Necklace became an instant sensation.

It took him a solid hour to process all the deliveries. Then he listed another 2,000 necklaces.

"Made over 150,000 yuan before breakfast. Even my old man can't print money this fast."

At school, Chen Yang pulled Su Lin aside.

"Boss, the Destiny Necklace is unreal. I checked this morning—the price is already at 3,300."

Su Lin chuckled. "This is just the beginning. It'll keep climbing."

"Boss, you knew all along it would spike?"

Su Lin put on his most serious expression. "I didn't know for sure. But I was betting on it. A few tens of thousands of yuan—I can afford to lose that. Win the bet, and it's a killing. Lose it, and it's pocket change."

"Yang, start thinking about what kind of businesses we could launch over the summer. I'll have a serious chunk of capital sitting idle. If you find a solid opportunity, I'll put you in charge."

"Wait—you'd trust me with all that?"

Chen Yang's jaw hit the floor.

Su Lin laughed. "Who said all of it? I'm just telling you to scout for opportunities. Investing is a step-by-step process. I'll give you some seed money to test the waters."

"I've never run a business before, Boss."

"And I have?"

"Uh..."

"Forget the business talk for now. I'll wire you some funds soon—your first priority is building out the online team. Your current guys need an upgrade. Find people who are reliable and can get things done. Understood?"

"Understood, Boss."

"Good. Work hard. I've got plenty more for you to handle going forward."

"Heh..."

In the original novel, Ye Feng had used Chen Yang exclusively for dirty work and grunt tasks.

Su Lin thought that was a criminal waste of talent. Chen Yang wasn't the most creative entrepreneur, but his management skills were genuinely impressive. His execution was extraordinary—give him a task, no matter how difficult, and he'd find a way to get it done.

Using someone like that as a mere attack dog? Pure waste.

After a few more instructions, Su Lin headed back toward the classroom.

On the way, he spotted Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu in the hallway.

Xia Shiyu looked distracted and troubled. Lin Xiaowan was talking to her softly—clearly trying to cheer her up.

"Shiyu, Xiaowan—what are you two discussing?"

Lin Xiaowan looked pained. "Shiyu's still worrying about her dad. I'm trying to help her feel better."

"Oh? Shiyu, your dad's on dialysis now, the donor matching is underway—you should be relieved, not stressed. What's wrong?"

Xia Shiyu looked at Su Lin. She tried to smile. What came out was worse than a grimace.

"Come on, Shiyu, if you can't smile, don't force it. You're breaking my heart. Tell us what's going on. Maybe Xiaowan and I can help."

"That's right, Shiyu. What is it? Ever since we visited your dad, you've been acting weird—spacing out, barely listening when people talk to you."

"I..."

"Xiaowan, Su Lin, please stop asking. I can't tell you."

The moment those words left Xia Shiyu's mouth, Lin Xiaowan's expression changed.

"Shiyu, what happened? You're scaring me."

"I'm sorry, Xiaowan... please don't ask. I really can't say."

Seeing Xia Shiyu on the verge of tears, Lin Xiaowan backed off reluctantly. "Okay, okay. I won't ask. But Shiyu, whatever's going on, remember—you've got me. And Su Lin. We're here for you."

Su Lin nodded. "Xiaowan's right. We'll absolutely help. Shiyu, don't stress too much about the transplant costs. We'll figure something out."

Xia Shiyu looked at both of them, and all she could manage was a sigh.

She regretted lending Ye Feng the money.

His plan to stockpile game equipment—she knew about it. But days had passed with no progress, and her confidence had crumbled.

What tormented her wasn't the potential loss of 8,000 yuan. It was not knowing how to face Lin Xiaowan and Su Lin when the truth came out.

Especially Su Lin. He'd donated so generously to help her family, and she'd let someone take that money and gamble it on virtual items.

Xia Shiyu wanted to slap herself. How could she have been so stupid? And now the anxiety was eating her alive.

At his desk, Ye Feng stared out at the three of them through the window, muttering under his breath. "Almost time. The price is still climbing. Shiyu, just hang in there. A little more, and I'll sell everything. Then your dad will get his treatment."

"Su Lin... hmph. You'll never get your hands on my Shiyu. Stick to being a playboy."
