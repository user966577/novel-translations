Seeing that Su Lin wasn't going to elaborate, Chen Yang didn't push further. If Su Lin wanted to share, he would. If not, Chen Yang wouldn't pry.

Su Lin clapped him on the shoulder. "I know you can't afford to lose. But you've got me to back you up, don't you? I'll cover any losses."

Chen Yang's heart stirred, but ultimately he shook his head. "Boss, this is your play. I don't know how you know these necklaces will go up, but if you're this confident, they probably will."

"You've already done so much for me. I can't take a cut of your business on top of everything else. So I'll pass."

Su Lin chuckled. He'd figured Chen Yang would decline—just not for this reason.

"Alright. Get your buyers lined up and head home. Your family's waiting for dinner."

"Yeah."

Su Lin patted Chen Yang's shoulder once more, then walked out of the private room.
