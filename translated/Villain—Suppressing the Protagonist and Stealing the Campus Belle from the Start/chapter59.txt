On Monday, Chen Yang took a leave of absence—and it was a three-day leave.

Su Lin had tried to dissuade him, but Chen Yang wouldn't listen, so Su Lin didn't push further.

The path was his to choose. Su Lin could offer guidance, but not dictate.

Besides, he had high hopes for Chen Yang. Even if Chen Yang dropped out right now, he could still manage the company well.

The talent was there. Nothing to be done about it.

So Su Lin let things take their natural course and let Chen Yang go about his business.

That morning, Su Lin arrived at school. He'd just reached the stairwell when he saw Lin Xiaowan being called out by Ye Feng.

Su Lin was somewhat surprised. Lin Xiaowan was the type who despised evil as if it were her enemy. Her opinion of Ye Feng was already terrible—she practically loathed him. Yet here she was, following Ye Feng outside.

Su Lin quietly followed. He wanted to hear what schemes Ye Feng was cooking up now.

The two came to a corner of another stairwell. Lin Xiaowan looked at Ye Feng impatiently. "Ye Feng, you said you wanted to tell me about Su Lin's evil intentions. Go ahead. Let's see what you come up with."

Ye Feng looked at Lin Xiaowan, his heart stinging.

Why? Why did Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu both protect Su Lin so fiercely?

One was his childhood sweetheart. The other was his dream girl.

But no one would give him an answer.

Seeing Ye Feng stay silent, Lin Xiaowan turned to leave.

Ye Feng hurried to speak. "Lin Xiaowan, Su Lin's evil intentions are simple. He wants to have his cake and eat it too."

"He tells you he likes you, but he's also flirting with Xiaoyu. A few nights ago, in the middle of the night, he even lured Xiaoyu to his house."

From around the corner, Su Lin silently cursed, 'Damn!'

That dog Ye Feng had no honor—going straight for the jugular.

He was the one with evil intentions!

Lin Xiaowan stopped and turned to face Ye Feng. "You're saying Su Lin wants both of us. Did you see this yourself?"

Ye Feng shook his head. "That's why I said it's his intentions. That's what he's planning."

"Heh, what man doesn't want to have it all? Don't you?"

"This..."

"See, you want that too. The difference is, you don't have the chance, while Su Lin might. So you're jealous."

Su Lin nearly applauded out loud.

He hadn't expected Lin Xiaowan to be so fierce in a confrontation—it was making him fall for her all over again.

"Ye Feng, you don't understand Su Lin at all. You're just measuring a gentleman by your own petty standards. His reputation in class might not be great, and to you he might seem unapproachable. But only those who truly get close to him can see his noble qualities."

"Xiaoyu's dad's surgery was paid for by Su Lin. Just a few days ago, Xiaoyu's dad had surgery, and that day happened to be Xiaoyu's birthday. Su Lin just celebrated her birthday with her. You think I don't know?"

"I'm guessing you called Xiaoyu and harassed her, and she coldly rejected you."

Su Lin, from his hiding spot, gave Xia Shiyu a silent thumbs up. Really had taken her out for a big meal—double portion!

Lin Xiaowan looked regretful. "Such a shame. I didn't even know."

Then she walked up to Su Lin and glared at him. "This is all your fault. You insisted on taking me home so early. If you'd waited until the surgery was done, I could have celebrated with Xiaoyu."

"You have no way to compare to someone like Su Lin. Xiaoyu liking him is perfectly normal."

"You... you know Xiaoyu likes Su Lin too?"

Lin Xiaowan laughed lightly. "What's so strange about that? Su Lin is outstanding—Xiaoyu and I have both seen it. We both like Su Lin. We just haven't said it out loud."

"So you're both okay with Su Lin having you both?"

Lin Xiaowan laughed again. "That's impossible. Xiaoyu and I will compete fairly. As for Su Lin, he's not as bad as you think."

"That silly girl Xiaoyu—if Su Lin so much as beckoned, she'd probably fall for it. But the three of us have been together for so long, and he's never done anything inappropriate."

"Sometimes I really like how gentlemanly Su Lin is. Sometimes I hate that he's too much of a gentleman—so gentlemanly he doesn't even pick up on hints. You understand?"

Hearing this, Su Lin's face flushed. He thought frantically: 'That's too much! That's too much praise! I can't handle it!'

He'd never imagined he was this perfect in Lin Xiaowan's eyes.

Meanwhile, just a few days ago, he'd been thoroughly "bullying" Xia Shiyu.

"Ye Feng, I used to think that while your character wasn't great, you at least had some sense of responsibility. But today I realize I was wrong. You're nothing but a petty man. You pursued Yan Huan, failed, and tried to destroy her by betting against her. You made her a laughingstock."

"Then you immediately went after Xiaoyu, used your relationship to con her out of money—money for her dad's life-saving treatment. When you couldn't have her, you came here to drive a wedge between us. You're a completely worthless person."

"Xiaoyu and I never want to speak to you again. Please stay away from us."

"I'm doing this for your own good." Ye Feng felt like the whole world had turned against him. Xia Shiyu was like this, and Lin Xiaowan was even more bewitched.

"Heh, your version of 'good' is destroying what you can't have? Ye Feng, you're shameless."

Clap, clap, clap!

"Well said, Xiaowan!"

Su Lin walked out from around the corner with a grin. "Xiaowan, I had no idea I was this great in your eyes."

Lin Xiaowan's pretty face flushed instantly—not from shyness, but from anger.

She hadn't expected Su Lin to be eavesdropping and had heard everything she'd said.

"Su Lin, you were listening the whole time?"

Su Lin shook his head. "No... I started listening from the 'gentleman' part."

"You..."

Su Lin chuckled. "Xiaowan, I really didn't expect you to say things like that."

"Hmph, I'll deal with you later." Lin Xiaowan kicked Su Lin, then ran off.

Once she was gone, Su Lin finally turned to Ye Feng. His gaze turned cold. "Ye Feng, have I been too nice to you lately? Is that why you think no matter how much trouble you stir up, I won't get mad?"

"Hmph, Su Lin, you know exactly what you're thinking," Ye Feng snorted, showing no fear of Su Lin.

Su Lin might look tall and strong, but he'd never been in a fight. Ye Feng was different—he'd been fighting since he was a kid. He had plenty of experience.

He was actually looking for a chance to teach Su Lin a lesson.

All the frustration he'd been holding in—he was ready to unleash it on someone.

Su Lin nodded. "That's right. Just like you said, that's exactly what I'm thinking. So what? Can you stop me?"

"I'll stop your—"

Ye Feng swung a fist straight at Su Lin's nose.

His malicious intent was obvious—he wanted to ruin Su Lin's face.

Seeing this, Su Lin's eyes grew even colder. He'd hoped to resolve things with words, but it had come to blows anyway.

Su Lin's hand shot out, caught Ye Feng's wrist, pulled him forward, then drove his knee up.

"Ugh..."

Ye Feng doubled over like a shrimp, his face turning liver-colored.

Su Lin hadn't held back. This would keep Ye Feng down for a while.

Su Lin released Ye Feng. Ye Feng tried to say something tough, but his stomach spasmed, and he couldn't get a word out.

Su Lin looked down at him with contempt. "Thought you were good at fighting? One hit and you're playing dead?"

Ye Feng stared at Su Lin, despair in his eyes. He realized Su Lin had completely crushed him in every way.

Now he couldn't even win a fight.

Su Lin dusted off his hands and looked at Ye Feng. "Ye Feng, considering you and Xiaoyu grew up together, I don't want to use underhanded methods against you. But remember—that doesn't mean I won't."

"In this society, a life can be worth a lot or worth nothing. If you keep picking fights with me, be prepared for payback."

"When that time comes, I won't be this easy to talk to."

Ye Feng listened to Su Lin speak as casually as if discussing the weather, and fear gripped him. He knew Su Lin could really do it.

Rich people—whose hands were truly clean?

Every tycoon's original fortune was built on blood.

"This is my first and last warning to you. I advise you—take care of yourself!"

With that, Su Lin turned and left.

He'd said his piece. If Ye Feng still wanted to make trouble, then Su Lin wouldn't mind taking action.
