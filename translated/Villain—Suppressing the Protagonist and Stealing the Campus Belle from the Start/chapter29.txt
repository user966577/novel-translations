Xia Shiyu took the contract and signed it without so much as glancing at the contents.

"You're not going to read what's in it? This is a work contract—your entire job description is in there. What if I'm selling you off?" Su Lin raised an eyebrow.

"Selling me off? I doubt I'd even fetch 600,000 yuan."

"As for the job description, you can just tell me later." Xia Shiyu smiled sweetly.

The moment Su Lin had pulled out the IOU—preserving her dignity rather than simply handing her money like charity—she knew she'd never be able to leave this man's side again.

"Heh. What if this is an indentured servitude contract? The kind where you have to warm my bed every night?"

"Hehe! Then I'll warm your bed every night."

"Uh..."

Su Lin ruffled her hair. "Silly girl."

"I'm not silly! You're the silly one." Xia Shiyu pouted.

"You say you're not silly, but you just lost 80,000 yuan on a bad investment." Su Lin teased.

"That will be my one and only bad investment for the rest of my life," Xia Shiyu said with absolute seriousness.

Thinking about how Ye Feng had sworn up and down that it was a sure thing, that she'd definitely make money—

Xia Shiyu wanted to slap herself.

She still couldn't figure out what had possessed her to believe his nonsense.

Su Lin nodded. "I believe you. Once bitten, twice shy. I'm sure the next time you invest, you won't end up in this kind of situation again."

"Heh, invest in what? From now on I'll just work for you."

Su Lin smiled but said nothing. This girl would have plenty of investments in her future.

He knew exactly how formidable her business talent was.

One person running a billion-dollar conglomerate, single-handedly? No problem at all.

That was just how absurdly capable the novel's female leads were.

"Alright, all done."

Su Lin picked up the contract. "One copy each. Starting today, you officially work for me."

"So, boss—what should I do now?" Xia Shiyu gazed at him with a radiant smile.

With her father's surgery funded, it felt like a thousand-pound weight had been lifted from her shoulders. Her whole body felt lighter.

She'd never truly let herself relax before. Her life had been nothing but pressure.

Despair, even.

Especially when Ye Feng told her the investment money was gone—she'd genuinely wanted to die.

Only the thought of her father lying in that hospital bed had kept her going.

Then Su Lin appeared and did some things that "accidentally" involved his hands—and she snapped back to reality.

So there was more to the world than just family. There was also love.

And her love had already arrived, sometime when she wasn't looking.

"Now that Uncle Xia's surgery is taken care of, how about we celebrate?" Su Lin suggested.

Xia Shiyu nodded eagerly. "Sure! We don't have school tomorrow anyway. Let's celebrate."

"But... it's so late. How are we going to celebrate?"

Su Lin grinned. "The one thing this house is never short on is booze. Wait here—I'll grab some."

Watching him dash off with boyish enthusiasm, Xia Shiyu felt a spark of excitement kindle inside her too.

Having been in the villa for a while now, she finally had the presence of mind to take in the decor.

Su Lin's place was a classic split-level villa with a courtyard and a garage out front.

The living room featured a sofa and an old-looking scroll painting mounted on the wall.

Xia Shiyu didn't know much about art, but she could tell it was no ordinary piece.

Probably the work of some ancient master.

The interior design leaned traditional—cool tones throughout—but rather than feeling oppressive, Xia Shiyu found it refreshingly retro, with its own distinctive flair.

Her gaze soon drifted to the coffee table nearby.

Beneath its glass surface were tucked several photographs, most of them from Su Lin's childhood.

Absolutely adorable.

"Shiyu..."

"Shiyu, what are you so absorbed in?"

"Hehe, Su Lin, I had no idea you were this cute as a kid."

Su Lin followed her eyes to the photos and spotted one of himself at about five or six years old, perched atop a rocking horse, wearing a cape and brandishing a wooden sword like a little general marching off to war.

"Uh... that was taken at a photo studio."

"Hehe, so cute."

She reached over and pinched his cheek. "Too bad—your face used to be so chubby and squishy. Now it's all angular."

"Getting thinner is normal," Su Lin said, catching her hand before she could squeeze again.

"Let me pinch a little more! You pinched my face earlier and I let you."

"Ahem..."

---

Inside the villa.

Su Lin was now deeply regretting his suggestion to celebrate.

Xia Shiyu was clutching a wine bottle, her face flushed crimson, eyes half-lidded, swaying like she might topple over at any second. Su Lin felt a headache coming on.

He hadn't expected her to be this much of a lightweight.

*She was knocking them back like a pro earlier—glass after glass in one go. I thought she could actually hold her liquor. Now look at her. She's one step away from doing drunken boxing.*

Xia Shiyu waved her little fists in the air and called out gleefully, "Su Lin, Su Lin! Come drink with me! Why are you just standing there?"

Su Lin shook his head. "Shiyu, you're already drunk. Let's call it a night—you should get some rest."

Xia Shiyu hugged the wine bottle to her chest like a puppy guarding its food. "No! Su Lin, we agreed—you have to drink with me until I'm happy tonight!"

"You don't even know—I almost jumped in the river today. I almost died."

"If it weren't for you, I probably wouldn't want to be alive right now."

Looking at her like this, Su Lin reflected that her current state was largely his doing.

But he didn't regret it.

Truthfully, he and Ye Feng had no personal grudge.

It was simply a matter of opposing positions. Nothing to do with grievances—just the fact that they stood on different sides. He had to suppress Ye Feng, and if push came to shove down the line, he might even have to destroy him.

"Su Lin, drink with me!"

Looking at Xia Shiyu's bleary eyes and endearingly clumsy demeanor, Su Lin's heart softened. "Alright, alright. I'll drink with you. Let's make tonight a good one."

"Yay! Su Lin, you're the best. Love you."

"Mwah!"

"Hehe! Drink up."

Su Lin touched the spot on his cheek where she'd planted a tipsy kiss. It still carried a faint trace of alcohol.

*This girl has no idea how embarrassed she's going to be when she remembers this tomorrow morning.*

"Come on, Su Lin, drink up!"

"Okay, okay. I'm drinking."

He accepted the glass she thrust at him and took a deep swig.

*This damn physical enhancement. Great—now I can't even get drunk.*

Su Lin drank glass after glass alongside Xia Shiyu, all of them downed fast, but he didn't feel the slightest buzz.

Which made things extremely difficult for him. Xia Shiyu was getting increasingly rowdy, constantly rubbing against him, and he was very much still a red-blooded teenage boy.

"Hehe, Su Lin, drink up!"

"Okay, okay! Drink."

He kept her company through her antics until midnight, when the show finally came to an end.

Xia Shiyu hung from him like a sloth, arms locked around his neck, legs wrapped around his waist.

Su Lin supported her with one arm and headed for the stairs.
