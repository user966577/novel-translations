Ye Feng decided he couldn't keep going like this. He needed to strike back at Su Lin.

---

Su Lin had no idea that Ye Feng's feelings toward him had already curdled from jealousy into outright hatred.

Even if he had known, he wouldn't have cared. He and Ye Feng were destined to be on opposite sides.

Given that inevitability, what did the protagonist's hatred matter?

Thursday arrived in the blink of an eye. Monthly exams.

Early that morning, every student in Senior Class 1 was buried in their textbooks, cramming in last-minute review.

Even Xu Jie—who normally thought about nothing but video games—was clutching a Chinese literature textbook and pretending to study.

Only Su Lin sat leisurely flipping through his copy of the textbook.

The curriculum in this world was nearly identical to Earth's, with only one or two chapters that differed. Su Lin hadn't bothered worrying about those.

Every single piece of knowledge was already locked in his memory.

*Ding-dong!*

The bell rang, and the classroom erupted in nervous whispers.

Feng Yifei's group was the loudest, his every other sentence a jab at Ye Feng.

His sycophants fell over themselves agreeing.

After a couple of minutes, Feng Yifei stood up. "Everyone, quiet down for a second."

The class fell silent, all eyes on him.

Feng Yifei cleared his throat. "As you all know, Ye Feng had the audacity to bet my girlfriend Yan Huan that he'd outscore her on this exam. The deal is: if he loses, he runs laps around the track after school tomorrow, shouting 'I'm a pig' the whole time."

"So I'm giving you all a heads-up—don't rush off after school tomorrow. Come to the track and enjoy the show. Sound good?"

"Deal!" the class chorused.

Feng Yifei basked in the response. This would humiliate Ye Feng in front of the entire grade—exactly what he wanted.

Ye Feng sneered. "Don't count your chickens yet, Feng Yifei. When the time comes, you and Yan Huan better not welsh on the bet."

Yan Huan fired back. "Who's welshing? With your grades, you actually think you can beat me? Delusional."

"Heh. I don't feel like arguing right now. Just don't back out when you lose."

"Hmph. Start practicing your pig impressions."

Su Lin watched the exchange between Feng Yifei and Ye Feng with amusement.

Feng Yifei was the first minor antagonist the original novel's protagonist would publicly humiliate.

He could already picture Yan Huan running laps around the track tomorrow.

He turned to Lin Xiaowan. "Aren't you going to step in and stop them?"

Lin Xiaowan smiled. "Let Ye Feng embarrass himself. His grades are awful and his confidence is absurd. I'd love to know where he gets it."

Su Lin chuckled. "You think Ye Feng's going to lose?"

Lin Xiaowan answered as if stating the obvious. "Beating Feng Yifei? Maybe. Beating Yan Huan? No chance."

Su Lin snapped his fingers. "I think Ye Feng wins."

"Oh?"

Her curiosity was piqued. "Based on what?"

"Gut feeling."

"Heh. Exams aren't decided by gut feelings. They're decided by ability."

"Then how about a side bet between us?"

Interest flickered in Lin Xiaowan's eyes. "What kind of bet?"

"Simple. We each pick a side. I've got Ye Feng. If I win, you spend next Sunday with me. I pick the activity, and whatever I choose, you go along with it."

A faint blush crept up Lin Xiaowan's cheeks.

The whole class knew Su Lin had a thing for her. But he'd always been respectful about it—they'd interacted more like friends than anything romantic.

She'd almost forgotten about his feelings.

Now he was essentially asking her on a date. The implication couldn't have been clearer.

When she didn't respond, Su Lin pressed. "Scared you'll lose? Or you just don't want to go out with me?"

"Hmph. You think you've already won?"

"Nobody can be sure until results are in. But I'm backing Ye Feng."

"Fine. Then I'm backing Huanhuan. And if I win?"

Su Lin spread his hands. "Your call. Anything I can do, nothing illegal—name it."

That tender, indulgent look in his eyes made Lin Xiaowan's heart skip.

Those eyes were too warm. Dangerously so. The kind you could drown in.

She looked away. "Fine. It's a deal."

Then she turned back. "Su Lin, you're going to lose."

"Heh. We'll see."

Test papers were distributed. Wang Yi delivered his standard pre-exam speech, and the room fell silent.

Su Lin glanced at the Chinese literature exam. With the system's complete knowledge package, the questions might as well have been written in crayon.

His pen flew across the page. While other students were still agonizing over fill-in-the-blank questions, he was already on the reading comprehension section.

His seatmate watched Su Lin's blistering pace in slack-jawed disbelief.

But knowing Su Lin's track record, all the poor guy could do was sigh and accept the gap.

An hour in, Su Lin had finished the essay. The rest of the class was still struggling with the classical Chinese passage.

Lin Xiaowan, beside him, had just started her essay.

Su Lin set down his pen, leaned back, and closed his eyes.

Before long, he sensed a shadow looming over him. He opened his eyes to find Wang Yi glaring down at him, face like thunder.

"What's going on? You're sleeping during an exam?"

"I'm done."

"Done doesn't mean you can't double-check. A 120-something in Chinese and you're already resting on your laurels?"

Su Lin didn't argue. He simply handed over his test paper.

Wang Yi began reading, fully expecting to find careless errors.

But as he progressed from the first section through the classical Chinese analysis, he couldn't find a single mistake.

The handwriting wasn't calligraphy, but it was clean and consistent—not a single correction in sight. There was nothing to deduct points for.

Then he read the essay.

Su Lin's composition took his breath away.

Wang Yi stared at Su Lin with an expression that was half-disbelief, half-awe. Then he quietly returned the paper. "Don't disturb the other students. You can rest your eyes, but don't actually fall asleep."

Su Lin nodded, placed his paper on the desk, and closed his eyes again.

Lin Xiaowan, who'd overheard the exchange, was stunned.

*Since when does Su Lin write Chinese papers this fast? And he got Wang Yi's approval?*

She shook her head and refocused on her essay. She'd nearly lost her train of thought.

Wang Yi continued his patrol and soon reached the back rows.

Passing Ye Feng's desk, he stopped in surprise.

Normally, Ye Feng would have been asleep by now. Today, he was writing an essay.

Wang Yi silently moved behind him to read over his shoulder.

Ye Feng's pen was a blur, words pouring out as if channeled from some higher source. And the quality was remarkable.

Wang Yi was floored. This was Ye Feng?

The same Ye Feng whose essays about family always devolved into "I got sick and Mom carried me to the hospital."

Whose nature descriptions peaked at "what a tall mountain, what a big tree, what a pretty flower."

Whose essays about the future consisted entirely of "I want to be a policeman and catch thieves."

And now? Polished prose. Crisp vocabulary. Elegant phrasing with a mature, almost literary sensibility.

Wang Yi was genuinely shocked.

*This has to be plagiarized.*

But when? The exam was supervised, and the prompts hadn't been leaked.

The most likely explanation was that Ye Feng had memorized an essay he'd read before and was now adapting it to fit the prompt.

Wang Yi seethed internally but held his tongue. Everyone else was still testing. He'd deal with this after the results came in.

He'd summon Ye Feng's parents for a serious conversation.

Oblivious to Wang Yi's suspicions, Ye Feng kept writing, head down, laser-focused.

He had to win this bet.

If he couldn't even handle small fry like Feng Yifei and Yan Huan, what hope did he have against Su Lin?

These people had never been on his radar. His real target was to surpass Su Lin, then dethrone Lin Xiaowan.
