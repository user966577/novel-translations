Two tense days of exams ended with the final science comprehensive paper. Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu immediately crowded around Su Lin with their answer sheets.

"Su Lin, let me see your answers!"

Su Lin grimaced. "The official results will be posted in an hour. What's the rush?"

Lin Xiaowan bit her lip. "I already lost to you in math and English. I want to see if your science scores are just as ridiculous."

Xia Shiyu nodded earnestly. "Yeah, Su Lin—you got a perfect score in math! Xiaowan and I both missed questions. You might actually take first place this time."

Su Lin shrugged. "First place. Big deal. Xiaowan's been first for three years straight."

"Three years of first place is nothing compared to this. I've been studying every day for three years, and you? You zone out in class half the time and still score this well."

"Heh. I'll give you the studying part, but most of those 'study' hours were spent on extracurricular reading."

Lin Xiaowan pursed her lips, conceding the point. She snatched Su Lin's answer sheet and began checking it against her own at breakneck speed.

The easy questions matched. She quickly moved to the free-response section.

Her frown deepened. "I got the last physics problem wrong again. Su Lin, how did you—you finished the whole science section in under an hour and still got everything right?"

"Biology too! All correct. I missed two." Xia Shiyu was equally deflated.

"Chemistry! Let me check chemistry."

Su Lin sighed and handed over the rest.

Both girls quickly discovered more errors in their own work—and more perfect answers from Su Lin.

Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan exchanged looks of shock.

Math, physics, chemistry, biology—Su Lin hadn't missed a single question across all four subjects.

"Su Lin, this is..."

Su Lin pressed a calming hand downward. "Low profile. Low profile. Just lucky, that's all."

Lin Xiaowan kicked his shin lightly. "Lucky? You tell me what kind of luck lets you ace the hardest problems on the exam."

"The last physics question wasn't even meant for humans. Shiyu and I both got it wrong."

Xia Shiyu nodded in agreement.

Su Lin could only shrug helplessly.

Just then, Wang Yi appeared at the classroom door. He scanned the noisy room and called out, "Ye Feng? Where's Ye Feng?"

"Here, sir."

Wang Yi beckoned. "Come to my office."

"Oh."

As Ye Feng followed Wang Yi out, the classroom fell momentarily silent—then erupted into even louder speculation.

"I heard Ye Feng actually did well on the Chinese exam. Over a hundred points."

"Heh. Someone from the next class told me he's the dark horse of our grade. Supposedly scored over 130 in math."

"Wang Yi dragged him to the office—what do you think that's about?"

"What else? Cheating. Bet he's getting interrogated."

The gossip swirled. Most students had already convicted Ye Feng in the court of public opinion.

Su Lin's trio caught every word.

Xia Shiyu's face betrayed nothing—complete indifference.

Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan exchanged a glance, something flickering in both their eyes.

They still had their private bet riding on this.

Lin Xiaowan whispered, "If Ye Feng cheated, you still lose."

Su Lin nodded. "Of course."

"Xiaowan, what are you two whispering about?" Xia Shiyu asked curiously.

Lin Xiaowan thought about the stakes of Su Lin's bet—the date—and her cheeks flushed. "Nothing."

"Ohh..."

Fifteen minutes later, Ye Feng returned with Wang Yi, who was carrying a stack of graded papers.

Ye Feng shot Feng Yifei a look, then took his seat.

"Everyone, quiet."

"All subjects have been graded. Science comprehensive scores will be finalized by the end of the day."

"This exam produced some surprises—dark horses and dropoffs both. I'll call names to come collect your math papers."

The room fell silent. Results day was always the most nerve-wracking part.

"Su Lin... 150."

"Holy—! A perfect score? Su Lin's insane!"

"Full marks in math? Is he even human?"

Su Lin ignored the commotion and walked up to retrieve his paper.

"Lin Xiaowan... 145."

"Xia Shiyu... 132."

"..."

"Ye Feng... 130."

The classroom went berserk.

"No way. Ye Feng scored 130? He's never even passed math before!"

"Has to be fake. Absolutely fake."

Feng Yifei shot to his feet. "Impossible! I don't buy it. Ye Feng must have cheated. Sir, I'm lodging a formal complaint."

The room went quiet, every pair of eyes turning to Wang Yi.

Wang Yi cleared his throat. "Ye Feng did not cheat. At least not in mathematics. I personally questioned him in my office just now, and I'm satisfied his results are legitimate."

"Come on! From failing to 130? Sir, would you believe it?"

Ye Feng stood up. Seeing the entire class question him, a secret thrill ran through him. His inner show-off was roaring to life.

"These are my answers. I didn't copy anyone."

"Heh. Does a thief admit he's a thief? Does a crazy person admit he's crazy?" Feng Yifei sneered.

Wang Yi hesitated. This was getting out of hand.

Then Lin Xiaowan rose from her seat. "Sir, there's a simple way to verify this. Give Ye Feng a problem right now—same difficulty level as the exam. If he solves it, his score stands. If he can't, then there's reason for doubt."

"Exactly! Do what the class president said!"

"Yeah! Live problem-solving or it's cheating!"

Su Lin glanced at Lin Xiaowan. She returned his look with a bright smile.

He shook his head with a faint grin. "Xiaowan, you really aren't giving up."

She whispered back, "It is suspicious, isn't it? Going from failing to 130 overnight?"

Su Lin nodded. "I believe him."

"Why?"

Su Lin smiled. "Because the power of love is extraordinary."

His gaze held hers, warm and unwavering.

Lin Xiaowan's heart stuttered.

She understood what he meant. And combined with that look in his eyes...

If Su Lin's sudden academic dominance was motivated by love—was it because of 'her'?

His grades had always been good, but never this absurdly perfect. The only new variable was... her.

No wonder he kept insisting that "the power of love" explained everything. Lin Xiaowan's mind reeled.

'Was love really that powerful?'

'If she fell in love too, would her grades get even better?'

The instant she realized what she was thinking, Lin Xiaowan's face turned scarlet. She banished the thought and shot Su Lin a fierce glare.

Su Lin: "????"

'Women. Absolutely inexplicable.'

---

Once Lin Xiaowan connected Su Lin's academic explosion to the "power of love," she couldn't sit still anymore.

On one hand, she'd promised her parents not to date before graduating from college.

On the other, she was dying to know if love could really supercharge someone's performance like that.

And if she were to test the theory... the only candidate who made sense was Su Lin.

Lin Xiaowan was honest with herself. Her feelings for Su Lin were different from what she felt for anyone else. She couldn't say for certain it was love, but the thought of being his girlfriend didn't repel her.

Realizing this, she felt a jolt of panic. Without her noticing, Su Lin had quietly staked a claim in her heart.

It wasn't the most important place—not yet. But like a seedling taking root, who could say when it might grow into something towering?

"This problem is completely correct. Can we now agree that Ye Feng earned his score?"

"Some students should stop seeing their classmates through prejudiced eyes."
