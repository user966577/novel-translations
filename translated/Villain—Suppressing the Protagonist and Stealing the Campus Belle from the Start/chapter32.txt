"Dude, why'd you stop?"

Chen Yang followed Ye Feng's gaze and saw Xia Shiyu chatting happily with Su Lin.

He was a bit surprised himself—he'd literally just gotten off the phone with Su Lin.

"Hey, isn't that Su Lin and Xia Shiyu? Want to go say hi?"

Ye Feng shook his head. "Better not. Shiyu probably doesn't want to see me right now."

"Huh? What'd you do to her?"

Ye Feng shook his head again without explaining, but his eyes lingered on Xia Shiyu's beaming face with an inscrutable expression.

It seemed like, ever since his rebirth, things weren't going according to plan at all.

In his view, Su Lin must have used some kind of strategy to win Xia Shiyu over. It almost certainly had to do with her father's illness.

He'd missed his window, and Su Lin had slipped right in.

'Wait for me, Shiyu. I'll have the money soon. Su Lin... I didn't think you had designs on Shiyu back in high school. And here I thought you were some kind of lovesick romantic who only had eyes for Lin Xiaowan. Turns out you're nothing but a two-timing scumbag.'

The thought only fueled his anger. He had to stop Su Lin from getting closer to her.

He had to make Xia Shiyu see Su Lin's true colors.

But the thought that he couldn't even face her right now left Ye Feng trudging toward the bus station with his head down.

Chen Yang walked behind him, watching his expression with perfect clarity.

Privately, he was calling Ye Feng a scumbag too.

Just days ago, the guy had been jealous over Yan Huan and nearly gotten into a fistfight with Feng Yifei, turning the whole school into a soap opera.

Now he was getting jealous over Xia Shiyu.

The guy wasn't handsome and his grades were terrible, but his ambitions sure ran high.

One Yan Huan, one Xia Shiyu. Unbelievable.

He couldn't even hold on to Yan Huan, and now he was setting his sights on Xia Shiyu?

Xia Shiyu was spending her time with someone like Su Lin. Why would she ever look at Ye Feng?

"Su Lin, what are you looking at?"

Su Lin blinked. "I thought I saw two familiar people. Looked like Ye Feng and them."

Xia Shiyu's eyes went flat—completely devoid of emotion. She only softened when she turned back to Su Lin. "Su Lin, please don't mention him around me anymore. He has nothing to do with me. I don't ever want to see him again."

Su Lin ruffled her hair and nodded. "Okay."

Seeing Xia Shiyu like this, Su Lin felt a deep satisfaction. He'd spent his entire time since transmigrating into this world setting traps for Ye Feng, and this was exactly the result he'd been aiming for.

He knew Xia Shiyu's personality. When she said she never wanted to deal with Ye Feng again, she meant it.

Ye Feng would never guess that just days after his rebirth, Su Lin had already severed one of his most important lifelines.

Xia Shiyu looped her arm through Su Lin's. "Let's go."

"Let's."
