After school, Su Lin had planned to offer Xia Shiyu a ride to the hospital, but when he reached the gate, Liu Yong was nowhere in sight. Li Hongyang had come in his place.

Su Lin waved goodbye to the two girls and walked over. "Brother Yang, what brings you here? Where's Uncle Liu?"

Li Hongyang smiled. "I gave Old Liu the day off. I wanted to discuss something with you and figured I'd pick you up while I was at it."

Seeing the eagerness in Li Hongyang's expression, Su Lin already had a good idea what this was about.

He nodded. "Let's talk in the car."

"Sure."

Once inside, Su Lin cut straight to the point. "You want to handle the gastrodia sales too?"

Li Hongyang nodded. "Young Master Su, I have to say—your instincts are impressive. I'd never have thought to buy up gastrodia in my wildest dreams. How did you even think of it?"

Su Lin deflected with a smile. "A classmate mentioned it. I just followed the lead."

"Here's the thing—I'd barely finished buying this morning when someone called wanting to purchase the entire stock. They didn't even ask the price—just told me to name my number and they'd take everything."

Su Lin's eyes narrowed. "No wonder you came in person."

"Heh. I don't know much about the herb trade, so I hung up and came to you instead."

"So you want to handle the sales side as well?" Su Lin raised an eyebrow.

It was obvious. Li Hongyang had made over $28,000 in a single day on the purchasing end—he'd tasted blood and wanted more.

Su Lin quietly cast Appraisal.

**[Li Hongyang: Age 27, 5'9", 148 lbs. Current Loyalty: 70 (rising).]**

A loyalty score of 70—already in the "reliable" range.

Su Lin couldn't figure out why Li Hongyang's loyalty was so high given their brief acquaintance. He suspected Su Zhenguo had something to do with it—some prior arrangement or debt of gratitude.

"Brother Yang, have you ever considered working for me instead of my dad?"

"Huh? What was that?"

"I said quit my dad's company and come work for me."

Li Hongyang shook his head. "Unless the boss transfers me himself, I can't leave."

"Fair enough."

So it was loyalty to Su Zhenguo—probably a debt of some kind.

"Since you won't come over, I won't push it. The gastrodia is yours to sell. Target price: $43 a pound. Same deal as before—anything above that is your bonus. If you can get $57, you're looking at hundreds of thousands."

Li Hongyang gave a rueful laugh. "Young Master Su, you have a real talent for this. You manage to be generous enough to motivate me without giving away so much that it becomes unreasonable. The margin is always just right."

Su Lin chuckled. "I did my research. I'm not about to play games with hundreds of thousands of dollars."

Li Hongyang nodded. By now, he'd thoroughly revised his assessment of Su Lin. This was no spoiled dilettante playing at business.

There was a saying: the only thing scarier than a rich kid who wastes money is a rich kid who knows how to make it.

And Su Lin was decidedly the latter.

Meanwhile, Ye Feng sprinted home, certain that his father had executed the plan. By now, their house should be stocked with hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of gastrodia. One more day of selling and everything would change.

He burst through the door to find Ye Weimin hunched at the kitchen table, chain-smoking, brow deeply furrowed.

"Dad! What's wrong? The house reeks of smoke."

Ye Weimin looked up at his son, and his frustration boiled over. "This is all your doing."

"What did I do? I told you to go buy gastrodia. I didn't do anything wrong!"

"Hmph. You told me to quit my job and focus on herb trading. Well, I drove to three townships and eight villages today. Not a single root of gastrodia to be found."

Ye Weimin sighed heavily.

He knew it wasn't really Ye Feng's fault, but with no job and no inventory, he had to vent somewhere.

Ye Feng's brow creased. "That's impossible. This is a peak production year for gastrodia."

"Impossible or not, that's what happened. When I got to the villages, they told me someone came yesterday with a truck—paid cash on the spot, bought everything in sight. Every household was cleaned out. I was one step too late."

"One step too late..."

Ye Feng tried to recall the details of how the gastrodia trade had played out in his past life, but the memories were getting murkier by the day.

He could only vaguely remember that big buyers had swept through around this time.

But the exact day? Gone.

"Yeah. Those damn herb dealers are ruthless—driving around Zhongjiang in circles, buying up everything that isn't nailed down."

"What about what we had? Did you sell it?"

Ye Weimin's expression brightened slightly. "Sold it. Made about $28,000."

Ye Feng's eyes landed on the two newspaper-wrapped bundles of cash on the table.

He reached for one. "Dad, I need half of this."

Ye Weimin slapped his hand away. "Put it down."

"Dad, I need it."

"Need it for what?"
