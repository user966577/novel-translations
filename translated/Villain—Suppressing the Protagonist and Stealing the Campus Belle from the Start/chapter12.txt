"Hello, Teacher Wang? How has Xiaowan been doing at school lately? Has anyone been bullying her, or has she been acting unusual?"

"Mrs. Lin, your daughter's doing wonderfully! Great grades, great rapport with her classmates."

"Actually, I was just about to call and thank you."

Wang Xiaoqian frowned, unsure what Wang Yi meant by that.

But her instincts told her this was connected to whatever had Lin Xiaowan so preoccupied. She kept quiet and let him continue.

"Lin Xiaowan really is a wonderful girl. You and the mayor have set an excellent example."

"On behalf of Xia Shiyu, I'd like to thank your family for so generously donating 220,000 yuan toward her father's medical treatment."

"The school would like to hold this up as a model of community spirit. Would you be able to come in sometime to discuss it?"

"220,000?" Wang Xiaoqian repeated, eyes going round. When had she donated anything close to that?

"That's right. You might not be aware of the details, but Xia Shiyu's father has kidney failure and needs a transplant. They couldn't even afford the deposit for tissue matching..."

After Wang Yi finished his lengthy explanation, Wang Xiaoqian finally understood the full picture.

Lin Xiaowan had mentioned the fundraiser when she came home yesterday.

But her parents had only given her 10,000 yuan.

So Lin Xiaowan had donated 220,000. Where had the extra 210,000 come from?

Hanging up, Wang Xiaoqian paced to Lin Guoqiang's study and laid everything out.

"Do you think our daughter accepted money from someone?"

Lin Guoqiang mulled it over, then shook his head. "We know our daughter. She'd never accept money under the table. She may only be seventeen, but she's understood the implications since she was little. Have you ever seen her accept anything from anyone?"

"Besides, we've never stinted on her allowance precisely to make sure she'd never be in a position to be taken advantage of."

"So no—accepting money is off the table."

"But Teacher Wang specifically said our daughter donated 220,000 yuan. That's not a small sum."

Lin Guoqiang's brow creased. "I drove her to school this morning. She stopped at the bank, but she only withdrew about 20,000 yuan. So the remaining 200,000..."

"I'm going to get to the bottom of this." Wang Xiaoqian stood up.

"Go ahead and ask, but gently. Don't go in guns blazing." Lin Guoqiang cautioned.

Wang Xiaoqian nodded. "I know how to handle my own daughter. She's getting older and she's got a temper now."

"Ha."

Wang Xiaoqian returned to Lin Xiaowan's room, where her daughter was—surprisingly—texting Su Lin.

After school, Su Lin had hung back saying he had something to do. Lin Xiaowan didn't know what possessed her, but she'd impulsively sent him a message.

*"Su Lin, are you home yet?"*

*"Not yet. Just about to head out. What's up, Xiaowan?"*

*"Oh, nothing. Just wondering—the monthly exam's coming up. How's your review going?"*

Sitting in his taxi, Su Lin smiled at the screen. *"No matter how hard I study, I'll never beat you. You're first in the whole school."*

*"Hehe, you could always try harder! Our total scores are only like twenty points apart. A little effort and you could catch up."*

*"Ha. Catch you? I'll settle for catching up to Xia Shiyu first."*

*"Hehe, I believe in you! You can do it."*

*"Yeah? That confident in me?"*

*"Of course! Your only weak spot is English. If you'd just buckle down and memorize vocabulary, listen to some tapes, your score would shoot up."*

*"Easy for you to say. If English were that simple, nobody would score low and everyone would ace it."*

Wang Xiaoqian caught the youthful smile lighting up her daughter's face and felt every alarm bell ring.

That was the smile of a girl with a crush. As a woman who'd been there herself, she recognized it instantly.

She'd worn the exact same smile when she and Lin Guoqiang had been secretly dating.

"Sweetie, who are you chatting with? You look happy."

"Ah!"

Lin Xiaowan frantically closed the QQ window and spun around, flustered. "Mom! Can you knock before coming in?"

"Honey, your door was wide open. What was I supposed to knock on?"

"Oh... fine. But knock next time."

"Okay, okay, okay. I promise."

"Mm." Lin Xiaowan broke into a sweet grin.

Wang Xiaoqian pulled up a chair and sat beside her. "Sweetie, Teacher Wang just called me."

"Um..."

Lin Xiaowan tensed instantly, watching her mother with wary eyes. "Mom, what did Teacher Wang say?"

Wang Xiaoqian gave her shoulder a reassuring pat. "Don't be so nervous. He was calling to thank us."

"But about this donation—I think you owe me an explanation. This is 200,000 yuan. Not pocket change."

Lin Xiaowan's face fell. "Mom, can we please not talk about this?"

"Why? Is there really something going on?"

Wang Xiaoqian's tone sharpened. "Sweetie, you know our family's situation. When it comes to money from unknown sources, even if it's a hundred yuan, we have to get to the bottom of it—let alone 200,000. You understand how serious this is."

"I... I... I don't know how to explain."

A mental hurricane was tearing through Lin Xiaowan's head.

Seeing her daughter's anguish, Wang Xiaoqian softened. She smiled gently. "Did you make a promise to someone? Is that why you can't talk about it?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "I promised I wouldn't tell. If word gets out, the consequences would be really bad."

"What, you're worried your mother would go around gossiping?"

"That's not what I mean."

"Your words say one thing, but I know what you're thinking."

Wang Xiaoqian took Lin Xiaowan's hand. "You promised not to say anything in front of classmates. But you didn't promise not to tell your parents. If you explain it now, your father and I will have peace of mind and we'll drop it. If you don't? Tomorrow I'm going to the school to investigate."

"Mom! Please stop pressuring me!"

"Fine, I'll talk."

Lin Xiaowan knew that dragging this out was pointless. When her mother made a threat, she followed through.

If Wang Xiaoqian actually showed up at school asking questions, *that* would truly ruin everything.

"Okay. But you have to promise—as long as the money's from a legitimate source, you and Dad won't tell anyone."

"Deal."

Lin Xiaowan organized her thoughts, then began explaining how the 200,000 yuan had ended up in the donation box.
