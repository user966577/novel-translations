Hearing the system's voice, Su Lin looked at Xia Shiyu in surprise.

He had no idea what she'd said to Ye Feng, but whatever it was had shattered the protagonist's mental defenses.

And not just cracked them—obliterated them.

All the better. Another 10% gone from Ye Feng's past-life memories. The older, more distant memories were becoming genuinely blurry now. A few more hits like this, and Ye Feng would be effectively neutralized.

Without his foreknowledge, even stellar grades wouldn't save him.

And his memory enhancement was degrading too. Soon enough, he'd be back to baseline—just another ordinary person.

"Su Lin, what were you guys talking about over there? Ye Feng looked like he'd seen a ghost."

Su Lin glanced at Lin Xiaowan, who was barely suppressing a grin. "Xiaowan, since when are you the schadenfreude type?"

"Hehe, is it that obvious?" Lin Xiaowan touched her cheek self-consciously.

Su Lin nodded. "Written all over your face."

Lin Xiaowan nudged his shoulder. "Come on, tell me what happened."

"Nothing much, really. Ye Feng was saying I'm a bad person, and I told him to pay up."

"Ugh, I wish I'd been there. I would've given him a piece of my mind too."

Su Lin smiled. "No need for regrets. I said your piece for you."

"Hehe!"

"Hey, Shiyu doesn't look too happy either."

Su Lin nodded. "She grew up with Ye Feng. Of course she feels bad about it. Why don't you go talk to her?"

Lin Xiaowan was already on her way. "You don't have to tell me."

"Heh."

After chatting with Lin Xiaowan, Su Lin turned his attention to the Emperor's Lucky Draw.

In essence, it was a random loot box. Anything could come out.

His enthusiasm died immediately. He knew exactly how these gacha odds worked.

'Draw.'

A mental command, and a battered treasure chest materialized in his mind, tumbling end over end.

Then a flash of gold.

**[Wow! Golden Legendary! Congratulations, Host. You have received: Complete Knowledge of the Nine-Year Compulsory Education Curriculum.]**

Su Lin felt no change in his brain—just that everything he already knew felt more firmly cemented.

'Are you kidding me?!'

He mentally flipped the system the bird.

His grades already ranked among the top in the entire Jiangnan Province. The "complete knowledge" package was utterly useless to him.

'Whatever. Better than nothing. At least this monthly exam I can blow past both Shiyu and Xiaowan—that should be fun.'

After all, Lin Xiaowan had held the #1 spot at Jiangning First High for three straight years. Knocking her off her throne out of nowhere would be quite the spectacle.

Meanwhile, Ye Feng was back at his desk, sensing that his memories had grown murkier once again. He grabbed his notebook—filled with symbols only he could decipher—and squinted at the entries, trying to jog his recall.

He rubbed his temples. 'My enhanced memory is stronger than ever, so why do my past-life memories keep getting fuzzier? What's happening to me?'

'Damn it. I can't catch a break. I finally get reborn, thinking I can fix all my past regrets, and instead the butterfly effect has turned everything into chaos.'

He stole a glance at Xia Shiyu and felt another stab of pain.

Were they really going to drift apart like this?

That wasn't the outcome he wanted. He had to pay the money back quickly, then raise enough for her father's surgery on his own.

'Dad should be making moves by now. After today, we'll have hundreds of thousands in gastrodia. Tomorrow we sell, and everything changes. Su Lin, your days of lording it over me are numbered.'

What Ye Feng didn't know was that at this very moment, his father had taken 200,000 yuan to the countryside to buy gastrodia—and found nothing left to buy.

Li Hongyang was brutally efficient. He'd descended on the countryside like a plague of locusts, sweeping every household clean. In a single day, he'd already cleared out Zhongjiang and its surrounding townships.

At lunch, while Su Lin was eating with Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan, Li Hongyang called to report.

The news exceeded even Su Lin's expectations. This time, Li Hongyang had secured 24 tons of gastrodia—nearly 53,000 pounds. At 300 yuan per pound wholesale, that was close to 15 million yuan in revenue.

Combined with what Su Lin already had, this one deal would put him over 20 million yuan.

Less than a month in, and he'd earned over 20 million yuan. The money was almost too easy.

Riding high, Su Lin found that even looking at Ye Feng didn't irritate him as much.

"What's got you so happy? That phone call must've been good news." Lin Xiaowan's curiosity was piqued.

Xia Shiyu had stopped eating too, watching him expectantly.

Su Lin nodded. "Same rules—this stays between us three. Not a word to anyone else."

The two girls exchanged an excited look and nodded eagerly.

Everyone loved being in on a secret, and Lin Xiaowan—increasingly driven to understand Su Lin—was even more curious than usual.

Su Lin figured he'd be bringing Xia Shiyu into his business empire soon anyway. Getting her up to speed now couldn't hurt.

"Here's the deal. Recently, there was severe flooding up in Hubei and southern Anhui, which tanked their gastrodia production. The shortage rippled across the region, and now everyone in Jiangnan Province is scrambling to buy. Meanwhile, Zhongjiang had perfect weather this year—our wild gastrodia came in huge."

Xia Shiyu's mind was already racing. "So you bought up all the gastrodia?"

Su Lin snapped his fingers. "Exactly. I had people sweep Zhongjiang clean. Cost was about 50 yuan a pound. The wholesale market in Donghai is paying 300 yuan and climbing. My people just called—24 tons secured. You do the math."

Both girls inhaled sharply.

Lin Xiaowan ran the numbers in her head, then stared at him. "So you just made over 15 million yuan on one deal?"

Su Lin waved a hand. "Haven't sold yet, but it shouldn't be a problem."

Lin Xiaowan looked at him like he'd grown a second head. "I've been sitting here preening about being top of the school, and you're out here building a business empire. Su Lin, how does your brain even work?"

Su Lin grinned. "Business opportunities are everywhere, Xiaowan. If you ever want to make some money, we could start a company together."

"Ah... I'll pass. My family doesn't want me going into business."

'Doesn't want her going into business?'

Su Lin nearly laughed. In the original novel, Lin Xiaowan—influenced by Ye Feng—had ultimately abandoned her political career path for commerce.

And she'd been spectacularly successful at it.

"Your family doesn't want you in business? Let me guess—your dad."

Lin Xiaowan blinked. "How'd you know?"

Su Lin smirked. "It's obvious. Your dad's a traditional man—he doesn't respect merchants. But who do you think drives the economy? It's people like us."

"What about you personally, Xiaowan? What do you actually want?"

"I don't want to spend my whole life sitting in an office with the air conditioning on."

Su Lin smiled. "There you go. So come start a business with me. Even if you end up in government, that's four years of college away. In the meantime, shouldn't you get to be yourself?"

"Su Lin, I'm starting to feel like you're trying to recruit me." Lin Xiaowan eyed him suspiciously.

Su Lin spread his hands. "I've never hidden my intentions."
