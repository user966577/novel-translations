Meanwhile, Ye Feng returned home to find the living room filled with cigarette smoke. His mother Liu Mei was sitting at the dining table, wiping away tears. His father Ye Weimin sat nearby, chain-smoking with a deep furrow in his brow.

Ye Feng was confused. It had been less than a day—everything had been fine when he'd left that morning. How had things deteriorated so quickly?

"Mom! I'm home." Ye Feng greeted her cheerfully, hoping to lift her spirits.

The moment Liu Mei saw him, she grabbed his collar. Her eyes were red as she demanded, "Xiaofeng, what on earth did you do at school to hurt people like this?"

Ye Feng was bewildered. "Mom! I've been doing great at school. The monthly exam results came out today—I ranked in the top ten of my class."

"Never mind that. Tell me what you did to that girl from the Yan family."

"Huh?"

"Yan Huan went and told on you?"

Ye Weimin slapped the table. "Still not going to come clean?"

Ye Feng: "??? We just made a bet. She lost. That's it."

"A bet? What kind of bet?" Ye Weimin pressed.

Seeing no way out, Ye Feng explained the whole situation with Yan Huan. He hadn't expected her to be so shameless—losing a bet and then running to their parents.

But he quickly realized this was far more than just tattling.

After hearing the full story, both Ye Weimin and Liu Mei let out long sighs.

"Xiaofeng, you really didn't do anything else? She didn't actually run those laps?"

Ye Feng shook his head.

Ye Weimin exhaled slowly. "Twenty minutes ago, your mother was laid off from the factory."

"Oh! Is that all? I thought it was something serious. That crappy food factory hasn't paid wages in three months. Getting laid off is a good thing. Now she can start her own business." Ye Feng felt relieved.

He'd been racking his brain trying to figure out how to convince Liu Mei to go into business. Now, someone had delivered the opportunity right to his doorstep.

This way, he'd save himself a lot of trouble. He could just bring her along on his entrepreneurial journey.

Because of college prep, Ye Feng didn't have much time for business matters. But now that both his parents were unemployed, he could convince them to start something together.

Ye Weimin raised his voice. "You don't understand anything! We're both out of work now. Do you know what people will say about our family?"

"And you've got college in a few months. You think college is free? Don't assume just because we've saved a little money that we can actually afford it."

Ye Feng spoke confidently. "Mom, Dad—don't worry about college. I'll handle tuition and living expenses myself."

"Get out of here. You're barely old enough to talk, but your mouth sure is big."

Ye Feng smiled bitterly. He knew it was pointless to discuss this now. He'd have to wait until they actually started the business and saw results. Then they'd believe him.

"Fine. You just focus on your studies. Don't worry about family matters."

Ye Feng quickly interjected, "Wait, Dad—hear me out. I know a drink that's really profitable. It's called milk tea. The costs are super low—just 10,000 to 20,000 yuan to get started."

"Heh. If something that cheap was really profitable, there'd be milk tea shops on every corner." Ye Weimin was skeptical.

"That's because milk tea came over from Taiwan. There are already plenty of shops in Donghai, but Zhongjiang is just a county-level city, so it hasn't spread here yet. Mom, Dad—now is the perfect time. It's only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan of investment. Why don't I try it first? If it works, you can join in."

Ye Feng's pitch gave both his parents pause.

Regardless of whether this milk tea thing was actually profitable, they were both unemployed now. No job meant no income.

Whether Ye Feng was right or not, they had to try something. They weren't looking to get rich—just to have some income.

Sensing their hesitation, Ye Feng pressed on. "Mom, Dad, money won't fall from the sky while you're sitting at home. But if you do something, maybe you'll actually make some. Right?"

"Fine. You've got money, don't you? Go ahead and try it out with your mother."

"Dad, you're finally seeing sense! Mom, go buy some equipment and supplies tomorrow. I'll tell you how to make it tonight. The day after tomorrow, we can set up a stall and test the waters."

Seeing Ye Feng's enthusiasm, Liu Mei felt a spark of motivation. "Okay! Let's try it."
