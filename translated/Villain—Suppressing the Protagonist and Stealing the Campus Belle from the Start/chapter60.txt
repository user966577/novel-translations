"Ye Feng, someone like you can never compare to Su Lin. Xiaoyu liking him is completely natural."

"You... you know Xiaoyu likes Su Lin too?"

Lin Xiaowan smiled lightly. "What's strange about that? Su Lin is exceptional. Xiaoyu and I can both see it. We both like Su Lin—we just haven't said it outright."

"So you're both fine with letting Su Lin have you both?"

Lin Xiaowan chuckled. "That's impossible. Xiaoyu and I will compete fairly. And Su Lin isn't as bad as you think."

"Xiaoyu is such a simple girl—Su Lin could have her wrapped around his finger with just a crook of his finger. But we've been together this long, and he's never crossed any lines."

"Sometimes I love how gentlemanly Su Lin is. Other times I hate that he's too gentlemanly—so gentlemanly he doesn't catch any hints. Get it?"

Su Lin, listening from around the corner, felt his face flush. 'Too much! This is too much praise! I really can't accept this!'

He never imagined he'd be this perfect in Lin Xiaowan's eyes.

Yet just a few days ago, he'd been thoroughly having his way with Xia Shiyu.

"Ye Feng, before I thought that despite your questionable character, you at least had some backbone. Today I see I was wrong. You're nothing but a petty person. You chased Yan Huan, failed, then tried to ruin her with that bet. You turned her into the whole school's joke."

"Then you immediately went after Xiaoyu. You used your old friendship to scam her money—money meant to save her father's life. When that didn't work out, you came here to sow discord. You're a thoroughly despicable person."

"From now on, Xiaoyu and I don't want anything to do with you. Please keep your distance."

"I was trying to help you." Ye Feng felt like the whole world misunderstood him. First Xia Shiyu, and now Lin Xiaowan had completely lost her mind.

"Heh. Your idea of 'help' is destroying what you can't have? Ye Feng, you have no shame."

Clap clap clap!

"Beautifully said, Xiaowan!"

Su Lin emerged from around the corner with a broad smile. "Xiaowan, I never knew I was this wonderful in your eyes."

Lin Xiaowan's face flushed red immediately—not from shyness, but from anger.

She hadn't realized Su Lin was eavesdropping and had heard everything.

"Su Lin, you were listening the whole time?"

Su Lin shook his head. "Not exactly... I started at the 'gentleman' part."

"You..."

Su Lin laughed. "Xiaowan, I really didn't expect you to say those things."

"Hmph. I'll settle this with you later." Lin Xiaowan kicked Su Lin before storming off.

With Lin Xiaowan gone, Su Lin finally turned his attention to Ye Feng. His expression turned icy. "Ye Feng, have I been too soft on you lately? Is that why you think you can stir up trouble and I won't get angry?"

"Hmph. Su Lin, you know exactly what schemes you're running." Ye Feng snorted, completely unafraid.

Su Lin might look imposing, but he'd never been in a real fight. Ye Feng was different—he'd been scrapping since childhood. Plenty of experience.

He'd been looking for a chance to teach Su Lin a lesson.

All that pent-up frustration—he was ready to let it out.

Su Lin nodded. "You're right. That's exactly what I'm thinking. So what? You think you can stop me?"

"I'll stop your—"

Ye Feng threw a punch directly at Su Lin's nose.

His vicious intent was clear—he wanted Su Lin's face ruined.

Seeing this, Su Lin's eyes turned even colder. He'd hoped to settle this with words, but they'd ended up here anyway.

Su Lin reacted instantly—catching Ye Feng's wrist, yanking him forward, and driving his knee upward.

"Urgh..."

Ye Feng immediately crumpled like a prawn, his face turning the color of liver.

Su Lin had put real force behind that blow. Ye Feng would be feeling it for a while.

Releasing Ye Feng, Su Lin watched as the other tried to muster some tough words. But with his stomach cramping, he couldn't get anything out.

Su Lin looked down at him with disdain. "Weren't you supposed to be good at fighting? One hit and you're playing possum?"

Ye Feng stared up at Su Lin, despair in his eyes. He realized he'd been completely outclassed in every single way.

Even in fighting, he couldn't win.

Su Lin dusted off his hands. "Ye Feng, given that you and Xiaoyu grew up together, I'd rather not resort to dirty tricks with you. But remember—that doesn't mean I can't."

"In this world, a person's life can be priceless or worthless. Keep coming at me, and you'd better be ready for what comes back."

"When that happens, I won't be this cordial."

Listening to Su Lin speak so casually, as if chatting about the weather, Ye Feng felt real fear. He knew Su Lin meant every word.

Rich people—whose hands were really clean?

Every mogul's first fortune was stained with blood.

"This is my first and final warning. I suggest you take care of yourself."

Su Lin turned and left.

He'd said what needed to be said. If Ye Feng still wanted to cause trouble, Su Lin wouldn't hesitate to act.
