Seeing Su Lin's calm, confident smile, Lin Xiaowan couldn't help asking, "You really that sure about Ye Feng? What's your reasoning?"

Su Lin obviously couldn't tell her the truth—that the current Ye Feng was basically a cheat code with enhanced memory, a walking anomaly.

Nobody would believe him even if he did. So he made something up. "The power of love, of course."

"Sure, Ye Feng and Yan Huan never officially dated. But his feelings for her were real. Now imagine someone you genuinely cared about treating you like dirt. Wouldn't that light a fire under you?"

Lin Xiaowan considered this. "Fair point. I've never been in a relationship, but if that happened to me, I'd want to prove them wrong too."

"But Su Lin, you're overlooking something. The monthly exam is less than a week away. Even if Ye Feng studies around the clock, there's no way he can close that gap in time."

Su Lin shrugged. "You'd be surprised. Human potential is limitless."

"Heh. I'm already planning what I'll make you do when you lose."

Su Lin stroked his chin thoughtfully. "And I'm thinking about where to take you. I heard there's a new amusement park at the border between Jiangning and Changning districts. Xiaowan—how do you feel about haunted houses?"

"W-what?!"

Lin Xiaowan went stiff.

She was fearless in virtually every way. But ghosts, zombies, anything in that category? Absolutely terrified.

She knew they were fake. That didn't help. She was still scared.

The thought of Su Lin dragging her through a haunted house—if Ye Feng actually won—made her blood run cold.

Su Lin gave her a mischievous grin but didn't push further.

He could read the room.

The news of Ye Feng and Yan Huan's bet spread through the entire senior class within half a day.

Almost nobody gave Ye Feng a chance.

His reputation as a poor student was too deeply entrenched. And Yan Huan was genuinely strong academically.

The gap was too wide.

...

School let out that afternoon.

Su Lin didn't wait for Chen Yang—they'd switched to communicating through QQ.

Thanks to his family's driver, Su Lin was home well before most of his classmates.

He booted up his computer and logged into the game.

**[Update required...]**

**[Dear Player, due to abnormal game data...]**

"Well, well. Looks like the developers patched it. Ye Feng, my friend, how are you going to play this one?"

Su Lin didn't know exactly how much Ye Feng had borrowed from Xia Shiyu, but he estimated it was at least 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.

With the bug patched, the Destiny Necklace was worthless.

No infinite stacking. Fixed values nerfed. Forget dropping back to 50 yuan—at 20 yuan a necklace, there'd be no buyers.

"Ye Feng, oh Ye Feng. I wonder what expression you're wearing right now."

At that very moment, Ye Feng was walking into an internet cafe with Xia Shiyu.

It was her first time in a place like this.

The cafe attendant did a double take when he saw her. A girl this pretty was a rare sight in internet cafes.

"Shiyu, let me get a station set up. Just wait a few minutes—we'll be collecting our payday."

Xia Shiyu nodded. "Okay."

Seeing Ye Feng's infectious confidence, a fragile hope rekindled in her chest.

She waited, expectant.

A few minutes later, Ye Feng's computer was up and running.

The cafe's systems had already auto-updated, so Ye Feng didn't see the maintenance notification. He went straight into the game and opened his inventory to show Xia Shiyu.

"See these, Shiyu? This is what I stockpiled—Destiny Necklaces."

"Because of a version update that changed their stats, the price skyrocketed. I bought them at 700 each, and now they're worth 5,000 to 6,000 apiece."

Xia Shiyu covered her mouth. "That much? Xiaofeng, you have over a thousand of them! That's... that's several million yuan!"

Ye Feng nodded. "If we sell them all, it comes out to roughly 600,000 yuan. Not a fortune, but more than enough for your dad's treatment."

"More than enough! Definitely enough!"

"Great—let me start listing them right now."

"Okay!"

Ye Feng opened the game's trading platform to post his necklaces.

The moment the webpage loaded, the color drained from his face.

The marketplace was flooded with Destiny Necklaces.

Prices were in free fall. The lowest listing? A bulk lot of 200 necklaces at 40 yuan each.

"This... this can't be right."

"What happened, Xiaofeng? What's wrong?" Xia Shiyu's stomach dropped. She looked at Ye Feng with growing dread.

'Please. Not another curveball.'

Ye Feng raised a hand. "I'm not sure yet. Give me a minute."

"Oh..."

He pulled up the game forums and started scanning posts.

The top thread—pinned in red—hit him like a freight train.

**[Destiny Necklace BUG Fixed—WarGod Guild Emerges as Biggest Winner]**

**[Destiny Necklace Epic BUG Patched by Developers]**

**[Destiny Necklace BUG Resolved—Secondhand Speculators Left Holding the Bag]**

**[Destiny Necklace...]**

Ye Feng slumped back in his chair like a puppet with its strings cut. "How... how is this possible?"

"Xiaofeng, what happened? Please tell me."

Ye Feng turned to her, eyes bloodshot. "Shiyu, the Destiny Necklace bug was patched. The items are worthless now."

"Worthless? What do you mean, worthless?"

Ye Feng laughed bitterly. "I mean my thousand-plus necklaces are now worth maybe a few thousand yuan total."

"No!"

"Shiyu, listen to me—I still have other options—"

Tears streamed down Xia Shiyu's face. She crumbled. "Xiaofeng, you lied to me! You said this was a sure thing!"

"I—"

"Shiyu, I can still—I can trade other items—"

"Stop. Just stop. Ye Feng, please stop talking."

"Shiyu..."

"How much of the 80,000 yuan is left?" Xia Shiyu forced herself to be calm.

"If we'd cashed out earlier, we could've recovered a few thousand. But with the bug fixed and this much volume... it'll take a while to sell at any price." Another bitter laugh.

Xia Shiyu's face was ashen. "Xiaofeng, sell them when you can. I... my dad's still in the hospital. I need to go take care of him."

She stumbled out of the internet cafe.

Ye Feng chased after her, trying to explain, to offer some reassurance—but she shook his hand off. "Ye Feng. Please. Just let me be alone."

"I..."

Looking at Xia Shiyu's expression—like all the light had gone out of her world—Ye Feng had a dozen things he wanted to say. But she wouldn't hear any of them.

All he could do was watch her walk away.
