Looking out the window at the two girls, the classroom buzzed with whispers.

Everyone figured Xia Shiyu was probably thanking Lin Xiaowan, but something about their body language looked more like a casual chat than a show of gratitude.

"Our school goddess is unbelievable. 220,000 donated without batting an eye. You could buy an apartment in Zhongjiang for that."

"Ha, that's the difference between ordinary people and the wealthy. Look at how calm she is—like she didn't just toss out a small fortune."

"If only I had that kind of money. I'd love to experience throwing cash around just once." Feng Yifei gazed at Lin Xiaowan's silhouette, eyes full of longing.

Every guy at Jiangning First High had a thing for Lin Xiaowan, Feng Yifei included. But he could only admire from afar, never daring to pursue her. He knew his situation—no matter how he measured up, he was miles behind Su Lin.

If Lin Xiaowan wouldn't even look twice at Su Lin, what chance did he have?

After witnessing her stunning generosity today, he buried that dream for good.

A woman like that was leagues above him. Xia Shiyu, on the other hand—poor family, good character, pretty face, sweet personality—now *there* was a realistic option.

But Xia Shiyu walked to and from school with Ye Feng every day. Rumor had it they were childhood friends who'd grown up together.

To pursue Xia Shiyu, he'd have to deal with Ye Feng first.

Feng Yifei narrowed his eyes. Ye Feng was just a pushover. Handling him would be easy.

As he was plotting, Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan came back into the classroom, laughing and chatting.

Passing through the aisle, Lin Xiaowan turned to Su Lin. "Su Lin, did you collect all the homework?"

"Hm?"

Su Lin blinked, then remembered—right, his role as vice president also meant he was the math class representative.

Fortunately, turning in homework was a routine by now. Aside from a few chronic slackers, everyone had dropped theirs off at the teacher's desk.

"Want to bring them to the office together?"

Su Lin already knew Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu had been talking outside for a while. If she was suggesting they walk together now, she clearly had something to say.

He nodded. "Sure."

They gathered the notebooks and headed for the faculty office.

Su Lin noticed that once they left the classroom, Lin Xiaowan's pace slowed considerably.

He glanced at her, waiting.

Lin Xiaowan caught his look. "Su Lin, there's something I'm really curious about. Mind clearing it up for me?"

Su Lin smiled. "You want to know why I usually ignore people—especially the ones from less well-off families."

Lin Xiaowan nodded.

She knew the curiosity was pointless, but she couldn't shake the need for an answer.

Su Lin fell silent for a moment. Having inherited the original's memories, he knew how the previous Su Lin had ended up this way.

His voice turned somber. "Xiaowan, are you sure you want to know? Sometimes the truth is more disappointing than you'd expect."

"Stop keeping me in suspense. Just tell me."

Su Lin chuckled. "Xiaowan, I didn't know you could be this impatient. I always thought you were the picture of calm composure."

"Are you going to tell me or not?"

"Fine, fine, fine. Since you're this eager, I'll tell you."

Su Lin seemed to drift into memory, his voice heavy with something like regret. "Remember freshman year? When we first started, I had tons of friends. Every guy wanted to hang out with me. I was the center of attention wherever I went—like the sun everyone orbited around."

His words transported Lin Xiaowan back in time.

Freshman year, Su Lin really had been like that. A massive entourage, full of confidence—not unlike Feng Yifei now.

"Back then, I got along great with everyone. But second semester, my mom passed away. I was in a terrible place. Those so-called friends, the ones who just wanted me to buy them drinks and snacks, kept dragging me to play basketball, to hang out."

"I wasn't in the mood. Guess what they said?"

Lin Xiaowan was already absorbed in his story, a faint sadness touching her features. "What did they say?"

"They said if I wouldn't come, I could at least lend them money for drinks."

"Ha. Nobody in class had much money except a handful of us. The money they'd borrowed from me before had never been repaid—not once. I'd never cared enough to ask for it back. But I was grieving, so I said no."

"So those few guys started spreading rumors. Told everyone I looked down on poor people, that I was a miser who wouldn't share."

"Within half a day, the whole class had heard."

"Since they'd already framed me, I figured I'd at least get my money back. So I went around collecting on old debts."

"That's when the self-appointed moral police stepped in—the girls who thought they owned the moral high ground. Saying how my family was rich, how these kids were poor, how I shouldn't ask for repayment, or should at least wait."
