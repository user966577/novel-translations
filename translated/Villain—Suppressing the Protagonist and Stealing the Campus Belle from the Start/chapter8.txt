At lunch, Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan walked into the cafeteria together.

No matter the era, people were always at their most enthusiastic when food was involved.

By the time they arrived, most tables were already taken.

"Xiaowan, over here!"

Hearing Yan Huan's voice, Lin Xiaowan spotted the saved seat and felt a flicker of warmth.

Then she remembered Xia Shiyu standing beside her.

Xia Shiyu read the hesitation on Lin Xiaowan's face and spoke up first. "Go ahead, Xiaowan. I'll go find Su Lin—I still haven't properly thanked him."

Lin Xiaowan nodded with a gentle smile. "Su Lin might seem standoffish and hard to talk to, but once you actually chat with him, you'll realize he's pretty easy to get along with. Don't be nervous."

"Mm!"

Xia Shiyu had noticed Su Lin the moment they walked in—sitting alone in a corner by the window. She wasn't nervous at all.

Someone as kind-hearted as Su Lin couldn't possibly be difficult to approach.

They split up. Xia Shiyu got her food and headed straight for him.

"Su Lin, mind if I sit next to you?"

Her soft, melodious voice reached his ears. Su Lin marveled at her tone quality.

Lin Xiaowan had the quintessential sweet-girl voice. If she ever turned on the charm, it would be absolutely lethal.

Xia Shiyu's voice was warmth and silk—hypnotic in a way that made people instinctively lower their guard.

Su Lin nodded. "The seat's there for anyone. Go ahead."

Xia Shiyu smiled and sat down beside him.

The scene didn't go unnoticed. Across the cafeteria, hearts shattered en masse.

Feng Yifei, who'd been planning his move on Xia Shiyu, was especially incensed watching her approach Su Lin voluntarily.

"Yo, Feng. Xia Shiyu went to Su Lin's table. You see that?"

Feng Yifei's expression soured. "I saw."

"Ha, that's reality for you. Doesn't matter that you donated three thousand. Su Lin only gave two hundred, but his family's richer."

"Drop it. Xia Shiyu isn't the type of girl you're thinking of." Feng Yifei's patience was wearing thin.

"We're just worried about you, man."

"..."

At Su Lin's table, Xia Shiyu spent a long moment gathering her courage before finally speaking. "Thank you, Su Lin."

Su Lin paused mid-bite, then asked, "Lin Xiaowan told you everything?"

"Yes. She told me all of it."

"Su Lin, I want to thank you properly, but I can't think of how. If there's ever anything I can do—anything at all—please tell me. I want to repay you, even if it's just something small."

Setting down his chopsticks, Su Lin looked at her. "You want to repay me?"

Xia Shiyu nodded solemnly. "It's 200,000 yuan. Maybe it's nothing to you, but for my family, it's life-saving money. If I can't do something in return, I... I..."

Su Lin smiled. "I'm still in high school. I don't really need anything. But if you insist—study hard, and come work for me someday."

Xia Shiyu hadn't expected that answer. But thinking it over, it wasn't half bad.

Her face lit up. "Deal! After I graduate from college, if you ever need me and there's something I can help with, I'll absolutely come work for you."

"Heh. Might not even need to wait for college."

That threw her off. She looked at him, puzzled.

"Zhang Ailing once said, 'Become famous while you're young.'"

"I agree with her. I'm starting a business right after high school—laying the groundwork for when I take over my father's company."

Xia Shiyu stared at him in amazement.

Starting a business right out of high school? To her, that was pure fantasy.

"Su Lin, you really are impressive. You've already got your whole future planned out. But I'm just a student—what could I possibly help with?"

Su Lin waved dismissively. "I'm in no rush. No experience? We'll build it. It's not like I'm asking you to walk in as CEO. Just handle some of the basics."

Xia Shiyu nodded enthusiastically. "Okay! When the time comes, I'll definitely be there."

"Ha!"

Watching her bright, eager expression, Su Lin laughed out loud.

He knew something she didn't. This unassuming girl would one day become one of Zhongjiang City's most formidable businesswomen.

She'd start her own company during junior year of college. Before thirty, she'd amass a fortune worth billions—her company would go public and make her one of the country's wealthiest women, a fixture on the Forbes list.

After Ye Feng's rebirth in the original story, he'd borrowed the charity funds from Xia Shiyu for his seed capital, then started company after company. But besides the expansion decisions, every single operational detail was handled by Xia Shiyu alone. Having read the novel, Su Lin knew her resilience and capability were extraordinary.

A talent like that—if you didn't snag her early, you were wasting a gift.

She just didn't know her own potential yet.

Su Lin's expression turned serious. "The fact that I donated—I don't want anyone knowing. That includes your parents, your relatives. Xia Shiyu, can you guarantee that?"

Confusion crossed her face. "Why?"

"Think about it. If your dad finds out I gave you this much money, what's he going to think? That we're dating."

"Other people finding out would be even worse. Best case, they'd say I'm trying to get with you. Worst case, they'd say you're being kept—that we're doing something shady behind closed doors."

"Imagine what happens when *that* gets around."

The color drained from Xia Shiyu's face.

Once rumors like that started, it'd be a snowball rolling downhill. Trying to explain would only make it worse.

Her relatives had already cut her off. But this kind of gossip would destroy her reputation entirely.

"See how serious this is?"

Xia Shiyu nodded. "Su Lin, then for you, that means..."

"You already agreed to come work for me, remember? When the time comes, just do a good job. That's repayment enough."

Hearing Su Lin's easy laughter, Xia Shiyu found herself smiling too.

What she didn't realize was that Su Lin's 200,000-yuan investment was anything but a loss.

In the not-too-distant future, she wouldn't just be working for Su Lin. She'd also be...
