Saturday morning. Ye Feng walked to school on air.

He'd originally planned to sell the necklaces after the monthly exam. But at this rate, the price might hit 5,000 by tonight.

He'd never imagined the Destiny Necklace would surge this fast.

In his past life, Xu Jie had mentioned a two-week buildup period. Now that Ye Feng was actually living through it, he realized just how insane this game's economy was.

Prices were changing by the hour. Last night the forums quoted 3,500, and by this morning it was already 4,000.

All he could do was marvel at how much disposable income people had, and count down the minutes until his target price.

At school, Xu Jie was the first to find him.

"Feng-bro, do you play *City of Angels*?"

Ye Feng nodded. "Yeah, just haven't played much lately."

Xu Jie could barely contain himself. "Dude, you've been missing out so hard. Get this—a kid in Class 7 got a Destiny Necklace drop yesterday and sold it on the spot in the internet cafe. Guess how much?"

"How much?"

"2,500 yuan! I mean, come on!"

"2,500? That high?" Ye Feng did his best impression of someone hearing this for the first time.

Xu Jie barreled on. "High? That's nothing. Right after that buyer walked away, someone else came over offering 3,000. But it was already gone."

"Then I asked around in my guild and found out the Destiny Necklace has a bug. All the big guilds are buying them up to farm world bosses."

"Last night alone, the top guild WarGod took down two world bosses and got a Conquest Token. Rumor has it someone offered 300,000 yuan for it. But the guild leader won't sell."

Ye Feng listened with obvious delight. "That necklace is worth that much?"

"Worth it? It's going through the roof! I guarantee you—if they don't patch the bug, that necklace will hit 10,000 easy."

Ye Feng shook his head. "10,000 seems unlikely. Once word gets out, everyone will farm the dungeon that drops it. Supply goes up, price comes down."

"I guess... but it's definitely still going up for now."

"True."

"Ugh, my luck is garbage. Farmed all day yesterday and didn't get a single one."

"Heh."

"Anyway, Jie-bro, I gotta take care of something. Catch you later."

"Sure. Later."

After Xu Jie left, Ye Feng got up and walked over to Xia Shiyu.

"Shiyu, skip the hospital tonight. Come to the internet cafe with me instead."

Xia Shiyu's eyes went wide. "Xiaofeng, you mean...?"

Ye Feng nodded. "Time to harvest. We're cashing out tonight."

"How much?" Xia Shiyu could barely keep her voice steady.

Ye Feng held up six fingers. "Including the original capital, roughly 600,000 yuan."

"That much?!"

"Xiaofeng, you're not lying to me?"

Ye Feng nodded. "Shiyu, we grew up together. I would never lie to you."

"Okay! After school—I'll go with you."

"Then it's settled."

"Yes!"

After confirming their plan, Ye Feng turned and shot a provocative look at Su Lin.

Su Lin returned it with a serene smile, as if completely unbothered.

Unfortunately, Yan Huan intercepted the look. She thought Ye Feng was sneering at her.

She exploded.

"Ye Feng, what's that look supposed to mean?"

Ye Feng blinked. "What look? What are you talking about?"

Yan Huan scoffed. "Don't play dumb. Just because I turned you down, you think you can disrespect me?"

"Turned me down? I don't—"

"That look you just gave me. Don't think I didn't see it."

Her words, loaded with implication, silenced the classroom. Every head swiveled toward them.

Ye Feng's pursuit of Yan Huan had been public knowledge since freshman year. Everyone at Jiangning First High knew: Ye Feng was crazy about Yan Huan, and Yan Huan wanted nothing to do with him.

Nobody expected fresh drama today.

The class went quiet, watching the show.

Feng Yifei saw his girl getting challenged by Ye Feng—the school's biggest nobody—and stepped up immediately. "Ye Feng, I've told you before: Yan Huan is my girlfriend now. Stop bothering her. You can fight, sure, but can you fight one person? Two? A whole group?"

"Keep this up and it's going to get ugly for everyone."

Ye Feng stared at Feng Yifei like he was looking at an imbecile. "Yan Huan? You want her? She's all yours."

"Tch. Sounds like you're looking down on Yan Huan. Funny, coming from the guy who chased her for three years and got nowhere."

"Ye Feng, your grades might be trash, but I thought you at least had some standards. Didn't expect you to pull the 'if I can't have her, nobody can' routine."

Su Lin watched the exchange between Feng Yifei and Ye Feng with interest.

Feng Yifei was the first minor antagonist Ye Feng would humiliate in the original novel.

"I'm not saying 'if I can't have her, nobody can.' I'm saying Yan Huan is yours if you want her." Ye Feng's expression made it clear he had zero interest in engaging Feng Yifei.

"My kind of trash? Ye Feng, take a look in the mirror first. You don't pass a single subject out of six. My grades aren't perfect, but they're miles ahead of yours. So tell me—who's the real trash here?" Yan Huan fired back.

"So good grades make you quality, and bad grades make you worthless. That's your logic?"

"I didn't say that. But if the shoe fits... And cut the juvenile games. I have a boyfriend now."

"How about a bet?"

"Why not?"

Su Lin sighed inwardly, watching Ye Feng and Feng Yifei square off. This was going to play out exactly like the novel—Feng Yifei humiliated.

A painfully predictable face-slapping scene.

He felt nothing.

He turned to Lin Xiaowan. "Xiaowan, aren't you going to stop them?"

Lin Xiaowan smiled. "Let Ye Feng learn his lesson. His grades are terrible and he's delusionally confident. I'd love to know where he gets it from."

Su Lin chuckled. "You think Ye Feng's going to lose?"

Lin Xiaowan answered as if it were self-evident. "If it were just beating Feng Yifei, Ye Feng might have a shot. But beating Yan Huan? Impossible."

Su Lin snapped his fingers. "I actually think Ye Feng's going to win."

"Oh?"

Lin Xiaowan regarded him with curiosity. "Based on what?"

"Gut feeling."

"Heh. Exams aren't decided by gut feeling. They're decided by ability."

"Then how about we make a bet of our own?"

Lin Xiaowan's interest was piqued. "What kind of bet?"

"Simple. We bet on who wins between Ye Feng and Yan Huan. I'm backing Ye Feng. If I win, you spend next Sunday with me. And whatever activity I choose, you have to go along with."

A faint blush crept up Lin Xiaowan's cheeks.

The whole class knew Su Lin had a thing for her. But he'd always been a gentleman about it—they'd interacted more like friends than anything else.

She'd almost forgotten about it.

Now Su Lin was asking her on a date. The implication was unmistakable.

When she didn't respond, Su Lin pressed. "Scared you'll lose? Or you just don't want to go out with me?"

"Hmph. You think you've already won?"

"Nobody can be sure until the results are in. But I'm backing Ye Feng."

"Fine. Then I'm backing Huanhuan. And if I win?"

Su Lin spread his hands. "Your call. Anything I'm capable of, nothing illegal—name it."

That tender, indulgent look in his eyes made Lin Xiaowan's heart skip.

Those eyes were too warm. Dangerously so. The kind you could drown in.

She looked away. "Alright. It's a deal."

Then she turned back to him. "Su Lin, you're going to lose."

"Heh. We'll see."
