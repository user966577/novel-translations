Seeing Su Lin enjoy his breakfast, Xia Shiyu left him to it and headed back to her own seat, satisfied.

Only Lin Xiaowan remained nearby, stealing glances at the lunch box every few seconds.

"Xiaowan, I offered to share and you said no. Now you're sitting there staring at me eat. What kind of hobby is that?"

Caught red-handed, Lin Xiaowan's cheeks colored slightly.

"I was just admiring the presentation," she deflected.

Su Lin smiled knowingly, choosing not to call her out. He picked up the fruit tier and held it out to her. "I'm done eating. Have some fruit—helps with digestion."

This time Lin Xiaowan didn't refuse. She took the tray. "Thanks!"

"Heh. Shiyu packed way too much. I can't finish it all by myself—it'd be a waste to throw it out."

"Hehe..."

Lin Xiaowan nibbled on a piece of fruit while asking, "Su Lin, is Uncle Xia's situation fully resolved?"

Su Lin nodded. "The money's in place, the donor kidney's been matched—all that's left is the transplant surgery. He'll need to stay in the hospital for two or three months afterward for observation."

"Two or three months after the transplant? That long?"

"Yeah. After a kidney transplant, they need to monitor for rejection. If something goes wrong at home, you can't get to the hospital fast enough."

"You really know your stuff."

"Read a book sometime and you will too."

"..."

As they chatted, Ye Feng walked in with Xu Jie.

The instant Lin Xiaowan spotted Ye Feng, her expression darkened. "That guy has some nerve showing his face."

Su Lin glanced at her. "Shiyu told you?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "Everything. He conned 80,000 yuan out of her. Disgusting."

"Conned is a strong word. Ye Feng *borrowed* it." Su Lin gave her a conspiratorial wink.

Lin Xiaowan caught his meaning instantly.

Her mood improved. "You're right. He *borrowed* it. And borrowing means paying it back."

"Ha."

The two shared a knowing smile.

Ye Feng noticed Xia Shiyu at her desk and made a beeline for her.

"Shiyu, the other day—"

Xia Shiyu looked up at him, her face utterly blank. "Is there something you need, Classmate Ye Feng?"

"I wanted to say... don't worry. I'll have enough money for your dad's treatment very soon."

"My father's situation is none of your concern anymore. I've handled it. Thank you, Classmate Ye Feng." She looked away, dismissing him.

Ye Feng paled. Looking at the girl who'd once trusted him completely, the anger in his chest burned. "Oh? You've 'handled it'? How—by relying on Su Lin?"

The words were out before he could stop them, and he immediately regretted it.

Xia Shiyu smiled coldly. "Yes. Su Lin has already paid for the surgery, and the donor kidney's been matched. Do you understand what that means?"

"I... Shiyu, how can you get involved with Su Lin?"

*In the past life, she and Su Lin had almost no contact, even all the way through the class reunion.*

*How had things changed so drastically?*

"What's wrong with being involved with Su Lin? You dare look down on him?" Xia Shiyu's voice turned sharp. "Ye Feng, take a good look at yourself. Tell me—in what way are you better than him?"

Ye Feng was about to respond when he felt a hand clamp down on his shoulder.

He turned and found Su Lin standing right behind him. Ye Feng's face went ashen.

Su Lin set the thermal box on Xia Shiyu's desk. "Shiyu, thanks for breakfast. It was delicious."

"Hehe, glad you liked it. I'll bring you more tomorrow."

"Mm-hmm."

After the exchange with Xia Shiyu, Su Lin turned to Ye Feng. "I may not be a saint, but at least when I saw Shiyu's family struggling, I stepped up and helped. Meanwhile you—knowing full well how desperate her situation was—took money earmarked for her father's surgery and gambled it away. Ye Feng, what kind of person does that make you?"

Cornered, Ye Feng stammered. "I... I'll pay it back."

"Pay it back? Your family's barely better off than hers. Where are you going to find 80,000 yuan? That's enough to buy a house in Zhongjiang. Tell me honestly—were you planning to keep the money all along?"

"That's impossible. I would never do that."

Su Lin shrugged. "You say so, but who's going to take your word for it? People can borrow money from a dying man's fund and still sleep at night."

"I *borrowed* it. I didn't steal it," Ye Feng insisted through gritted teeth.

Su Lin spread his hands. "Fine. You borrowed it. So when are you paying it back? Uncle Xia's going into surgery this week. The monthly exam is Thursday. Can you return the money before the exam?"

"I..."

"If you can't, we file a police report."

"I can." Ye Feng's jaw was clenched so hard the muscles in his cheek twitched.

"Heh. See, Shiyu? This is what happens when you lend someone money. Look at his face—like he's about to eat someone alive."

Xia Shiyu regarded Ye Feng with zero emotion, then said, "Su Lin, I don't want to talk to this person anymore. You deal with it."

"Gladly."

Su Lin snapped his fingers. "You're the one who said you'd pay it back. Wednesday after school—deadline. If the money's not there, you can explain yourself to the police."

He ruffled Xia Shiyu's hair, then strolled back to his seat.

Only a dozen or so students had arrived this early, but word traveled fast. Several classmates were already weaving the overheard fragments into a complete soap opera.

Su Lin didn't care. He'd delivered the ultimatum and walked away.

Ye Feng stared at Su Lin's retreating figure, fists balled so tight his knuckles went white. He wanted nothing more than to charge over and beat the smug grin off Su Lin's face.

"Ye Feng, if you lay a finger on Su Lin, you can go straight to prison."

He turned around. Xia Shiyu was staring him down, looking for all the world like a mother hen ready to fight to the death for her chick.
