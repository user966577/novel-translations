At the guild leader's command, several hundred players charged into the boss arena.

Su Lin played a swordsman. With his garbage-tier gear, he was basically cannon fodder.

Not that he cared.

He rushed his character straight into the thick of battle and fired off an AoE skill.

-1,424... -1,475... -1,452

**[Splash]** -1,434... **[Splash]** -2,547... **[Splash]** -4,527... **[Skill interrupted—splash effect reset]**

Watching the damage numbers climb in bright red, the entire guild lost their minds.

"Holy crap—TwinWoodForest is hacking! How is he hitting this hard? His red numbers are past 10,000!"

"That's insane. Over 10,000 splash damage? Has to be fake."

"Bullshit. I'm wearing a full set of endgame gear and I only do 6,000."

Su Lin typed into guild chat: "I'm not hacking. It's just the Destiny Necklace's passive."

"Yeah right. The Destiny Necklace does fixed percentage damage. There's no way it hits for 10,000+."

"Look closer."

Someone pulled up the Destiny Necklace's tooltip and examined it carefully.

"Holy shit... the fixed damage is gone."

The entire guild channel went silent.

The damage had changed from fixed to scaling.

If Su Lin's garbage gear could produce 2,000+ base damage, then a fully geared character with a Destiny Necklace...

One AoE would deal hundreds of thousands.

And the splash effect stacked infinitely.

Once that sank in, people went berserk.

As long as your skill wasn't interrupted, the damage would just keep compounding.

Watching the Destiny Necklace's secret get discovered days earlier than in the original novel—all thanks to his manipulation—Su Lin smiled.
