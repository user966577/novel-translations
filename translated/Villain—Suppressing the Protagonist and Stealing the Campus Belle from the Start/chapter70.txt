Since Lin Guoqiang rarely appeared in the media, almost nobody in the classroom recognized him. The few who thought he looked familiar quickly dismissed the idea—there was no way the city's mayor would attend a mere parent-teacher conference.

True, he'd been surrounded by people when he walked in, but most parents assumed those were just other parents chatting with the teacher.

Lin Guoqiang was quite pleased that no one had identified him. If they had, it'd be a nightmare—everyone lining up to shake hands and make small talk, completely hijacking the conference.

Su Lin, on the other hand, was thoroughly annoyed. From the moment Lin Guoqiang sat down, the man hadn't taken his eyes off him. If looks could kill, Su Lin would have died several times over.

'A city mayor playing the intimidation stare? Doesn't he have better things to do?'

Just as Su Lin was about to break the ice himself, Lin Guoqiang spoke first. "Kid. You're Su Zhenguo's son?"

Su Lin nodded. "Uncle Lin, we actually had dinner together last year."

"Mm. Lately, Xiaowan won't stop talking about you."

"Oh? What does Xiaowan say about me?"

The instant the familiar "Xiaowan" left Su Lin's lips, Lin Guoqiang's eyes narrowed. "She says you're compassionate, academically brilliant, capable, talented, creative, and that you have great strategic vision."

Lin Guoqiang recited Lin Xiaowan's catalogue of praise without a hint of embarrassment.

Su Lin saw through it immediately. The man was deliberately throwing all that flattery at once to make him squirm. Nobody was actually that perfect—Lin Guoqiang was being sarcastic.

The goal was to put Su Lin on the back foot, then seize the conversational initiative.

Su Lin didn't play those games. He chatted however he felt like chatting. If every conversation had to be a chess match, life would be exhausting.

"Uncle! Xiaowan really said all that about me?" Su Lin put on his best wide-eyed, pure-hearted teenage boy face, practically floating on air.

Lin Guoqiang: "..."

'Did this kid miss the point entirely? A boy who can ace every exam can't possibly be this dense.'

Impossible.

He was playing dumb.

"Drop the act, kid. Playing the innocent? I outgrew that trick at eighteen. Only children do that."

Su Lin's smile didn't waver. "Uncle, weren't you the one playing games first? Rattling off all those compliments—was that genuine praise or a setup?"

"Besides, I am a kid. I'm eighteen. You're in your forties, and you're out here trying to one-up a teenager."

"Hmph, if it weren't for Xiaowan, I wouldn't waste my time on you. Now—confess. Do you have designs on my daughter?" Lin Guoqiang's gaze turned ice-cold, radiating the unmistakable pressure of a man used to commanding rooms.

"Uncle! 'Designs' is a bit strong, don't you think? Xiaowan is beautiful, kind, talented, poised, warm, and generous—there isn't another girl like her in the entire school. If I like her, that should be perfectly natural."

"You can't strip away my right to like someone."

"Bold little punk. You think you know what 'like' even means at your age? And when did I say I was stripping away your rights?"

"Other boys who like her? That's called admiring beauty from afar. You? What do you call yours?"

Unflinching under Lin Guoqiang's withering stare, Su Lin held his ground. "I admire her too, of course. Without admiration, there'd be no affection. The difference is, they look from a distance because they know they don't measure up. I'm different—I think Xiaowan and I are actually a pretty good match."

"Shameless!"

"Uncle, you sound like a child right now. How did you even become mayor?" Su Lin asked with mock curiosity.

Lin Guoqiang ignored the jab. "I'm telling you—being ordinary friends with Xiaowan is fine. But pursuing her? Out of the question. Xiaowan's future isn't in Zhongjiang. She won't be marrying someone here. She'll work in government, and when the time comes, her mother and I will introduce suitable young men."

"Xiaowan's going to college in Beijing. Beijing is full of extraordinary talent—every elite from across the country gathers there. I don't mean to belittle you, but compared to them, you still fall a bit short."

"Ha! If I didn't know better, I'd think we were living in feudal times. Uncle, from what Xiaowan tells me, you've essentially been hands-off for eighteen years. She's gotten this far through her own efforts. And now—now that she's grown up—you suddenly want to dictate her life? Do you really think that'll work?"

"Frankly, if I were you, I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror after saying something like that."

Lin Guoqiang's face contorted. He wanted to hit something.

This kid didn't give an inch. Since when did a high school student talk to him like this?

In truth, Su Lin dared to push this hard precisely because he'd read Lin Guoqiang's character. Against anyone else of that rank, he wouldn't have been nearly so brazen.

Su Lin pressed his advantage. "Eighteen years. I wonder how many eighteen-year stretches a person gets. And those were her childhood years—once they're gone, they're gone forever. Uncle, does that not weigh on your conscience?"

"As for whatever talent Beijing has to offer, I couldn't care less. Xiaowan doesn't care either. What matters is simple: does Xiaowan want to be with me? If she does, no one can stop us."

"This isn't the dark ages. This is an era of personal freedom and choosing your own partner. Arranged marriages? Really?"

Lin Guoqiang was rendered speechless. He had plenty of ammunition against Su Lin, but Su Lin kept hammering the same point: eighteen years of absentee parenting meant he had no moral authority to dictate Lin Xiaowan's future.

And on that one point alone, Su Lin had him cornered.

The former bluster and dominance evaporated.

"Early dating is still out of the question. The moment I catch you two together, I'm sending her abroad."

Su Lin's grin widened. "Uncle, please—send her away! You have my word: the day she lands, I'll be right behind her. Then we can be together 24/7."

Up at the podium, Wang Yi was praising Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan to the other parents, who listened attentively. But he noticed that neither Su Lin nor Lin Guoqiang was paying any attention—they were huddled together, deep in conversation.

Su Lin wore a smile. Lin Guoqiang's face was a tapestry of rage and resignation.

'What's going on between those two?' Wang Yi wondered.

Su Lin could see Lin Guoqiang had been pushed to the point of speechless fury. Knowing when to quit, he shifted tone. "Uncle, just take it easy. We're both focused on the college entrance exam right now. Once it's over, we'll be in university. Surely you're not going to ban me from pursuing Xiaowan in college?"

"When that time comes, feel free to introduce all the outstanding young men you want. We'll compete fair and square. Whether I succeed depends on my own merits."

Lin Guoqiang studied him through narrowed eyes. "What are you playing at, kid?"

"I'm not playing anything. I just want a fair chance. That's all." Su Lin said with practiced sincerity.

"A chance?" Lin Guoqiang eyed him suspiciously. Every instinct told him not to trust Su Lin.

But the boy's face gave nothing away.

"Uncle, if you try to forcibly separate us, it'll only backfire. We're not even officially dating. But if you make a scene, I guarantee—knowing Xiaowan's temperament—she'll commit to being with me out of sheer defiance."

"So really, I'm doing you a favor by handling this calmly."

"You? Doing me favors? Since when are you so generous?"

"I told you—all I want is my chance. I believe in making my own destiny." Su Lin said solemnly.

"Making your own destiny. Fine. Let's see you try." Lin Guoqiang huffed.

"Heh... we'll see." Su Lin smiled.

Lin Guoqiang scoffed and fell silent.

He felt he'd been reckless coming here unprepared. He'd underestimated Su Lin and gotten his pressure point exploited.

This kid was nothing like the officials and businessmen he dealt with. There was no structure to his arguments—he bounced from topic to topic, throwing haymakers from every angle. A wild brawler beating a veteran martial artist.

"You're opening a supermarket on Zhongjiang Avenue?"

Su Lin nodded. "Yes, Uncle. That area is the new development district. Eventually the city's going to push growth that direction, making it Zhongjiang's new economic center. I think it's an excellent location for a supermarket."

This caught Lin Guoqiang off guard.

When they'd been sparring verbally, Su Lin had seemed like a classic smooth-talking rascal.

Yet his analysis of Zhongjiang's economic trajectory was startlingly astute.

That kind of insight—understanding the significance of new housing developments, parks, schools being relocated, and hospitals being built—wasn't something any eighteen-year-old should possess.

"Xiaowan said you have strong strategic vision and long-term thinking. I thought she was exaggerating. Seems she wasn't."

Su Lin felt like he'd just taken a double hit of pure serotonin. Being praised by his future father-in-law was that satisfying.

"Uncle, please stop complimenting me. I preferred the glaring. At least then I knew where I stood."

"Hmph, don't think I don't know what's going through your head. You're loving this."

"Maybe... just a little."

Lin Guoqiang patted Su Lin on the shoulder and chuckled. "Still young though."

Su Lin: '...'

That sudden warmth put him on high alert. 'This old fox is about to try something. He's trying to lower my guard. Too bad for him—I know every trick in his playbook.'

Su Lin wasn't some clueless novice. He subtly signaled to Wang Yi, then turned back to Lin Guoqiang. "Uncle, I've got company business to attend to. We'll have to cut our chat short. Next time—I'll come pay a proper visit."

"Oh, and Xiaowan is our head of operations. I'll be taking her with me."

Lin Guoqiang nearly burst a blood vessel.

He understood exactly what "pay a proper visit" meant. This kid was practically announcing he'd show up at their doorstep as Lin Xiaowan's boyfriend.

And announcing—to his face—that he was taking his daughter with him? The sheer audacity.

"Hmph!"

Before Lin Guoqiang could get a word in, Su Lin waved and slipped out through the back door.

He was just a student—the parents barely noticed. A few glanced his way, then turned right back to Wang Yi.

Lin Guoqiang felt like he'd endured more provocation in the last hour than in the entire past year.

This kid had zero regard for his authority. Spoke without the slightest filter.

But what truly galled him wasn't the verbal sparring—it was Su Lin casually spiriting Lin Xiaowan away. He'd been moments from springing his own counter-move, and the brat just... left. And there wasn't a damn thing he could do about it.

Walking out of the building, Su Lin was secretly delighted. In the original novel, Ye Feng had been strung along and humiliated by Lin Guoqiang for ages, leveraged multiple times, and still never got close to Lin Xiaowan.

By comparison, Su Lin's situation was looking infinitely better.

...

Downstairs, Lin Xiaowan was waiting on a bench, her eyes fixed on the building entrance. The moment she spotted Su Lin, she rushed over.

"Su Lin, how did it go? My dad didn't give you too hard a time?"

Su Lin took her hand with a grin. "Your old man has given us his blessing."

"What?! That's impossible."

"His exact words were 'focus on studying first.' And since we're focused on studying—with no room for improvement, mind you—whatever time is left over is obviously for dating." Su Lin said smoothly.

"My dad actually said that?"

"Well, what he actually said was that he'd planned everything out for you. Your future's in government, and he'll introduce you to suitable young men when the time comes." Su Lin stroked Lin Xiaowan's hand as he spoke.

"And then what did you say?" Lin Xiaowan asked, wide-eyed with curiosity.

She knew her father too well. That was exactly the kind of thing he'd say. He really had mapped out her future long ago.

"I got angry, obviously. Your so-called father-in-law hasn't paid you any attention for eighteen years. Now that you're at the most important crossroads of your life, he waltzes in trying to dictate your path. I told him straight—he had no right. Eighteen years of absence, and now this? Too little, too late."

"Your childhood. Your teenage years. He missed all of it. What's the point of showing up now?"

"Xiaowan, I can see you don't want to go into government. You don't want to sit behind a desk sipping tea. You love business—the thrill of deal-making, the rush of overcoming challenges. If you end up in a government office, you'll be miserable for the rest of your life."

Lin Xiaowan clutched Su Lin's arm, eyes glistening. "Su Lin... thank you."

Su Lin savored the remarkable sensation against his arm and thought: 'If I'd known she was this receptive to the sympathy play, I'd have used it way earlier.'

Ahem.
