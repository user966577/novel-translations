"Ha! Those people love sitting on their moral high horse. I guarantee if it happened to them, they wouldn't just sit there and take it."

Lin Xiaowan fell silent. She'd never imagined there was a reason like this behind Su Lin's cold treatment of his classmates.

"Why didn't you explain yourself? If you'd spoken up, people would have believed you. At least I—"

"Explain?" Su Lin cut her off. "Why should I explain? When would I have had the energy to explain?"

Lin Xiaowan went quiet. Back then, Su Lin had been mourning his mother. He had neither the heart nor the inclination to explain himself. And frankly, he'd been right not to.

"Repaying cruelty with kindness? That's what saints do. I'm just an ordinary person—I'm not that noble." A bitter laugh escaped his lips.

"But you shouldn't paint everyone with the same brush. There are plenty of good people who remember kindness. Like Shiyu, or Chen Yang—they're both decent." Lin Xiaowan tried to get through to him.

"Why do you think I donated money for her? And as for Chen—" Su Lin caught himself. "We're here. Let's drop off the homework."

Lin Xiaowan caught the slip. She followed Su Lin into the office, her mind racing.

So Su Lin had helped more than just Xia Shiyu. Someone with the surname Chen, and poor—in their class, that could only be Chen Yang.

Everyone knew Chen Yang went to the cafeteria for leftovers every night.

The walk back to the classroom was much quicker.

Lin Xiaowan was quiet the whole way. Just as Su Lin had predicted, she was feeling a complicated mix of emotions.

She'd spent three years with these classmates. She knew some of them were less than admirable, but most were good people.

Yet one unexplained incident had turned Su Lin into a pariah, and by now the prejudice was so deeply entrenched that she couldn't fix it even if she tried.

It tore at her.

Su Lin had done so much good, yet because of one thing, he'd become this isolated figure.

"Su Lin... I..."

"Xiaowan, please don't say you feel sorry for me. You know the last thing I need is pity. And don't try to help—I really don't need it."

"Don't you care at all?"

Su Lin smiled. "I've got you understanding me now, don't I? And from what I can tell, you filled Xia Shiyu in earlier, so she knows too. That's enough."

"..."

Looking at his smile, Lin Xiaowan found it blinding. But she was powerless—all this compassion with no way to channel it.

The frustration was a sensation she'd never experienced before.

"Xiaowan, just let it go. Only three more months until the exam. Let me finish these last three months in peace."

"You, on the other hand—you haven't been tested by the darker side of human nature yet. These next three months might not be so smooth for you. If things get tough, you can always talk to me."

Lin Xiaowan was confused. "Me? Why would things not go smoothly for me?"

Su Lin sighed. "You've buried your pride under all that warmth and agreeableness. There's nothing wrong with that, per se. But after today's donation, everything changes."

"The first shoe to drop will be your deskmate, Yan Huan. She's a freeloader—calculating, manipulative, a green tea act through and through. She's been mooching off you for a while now. I'd bet within three days, she'll come to you asking to borrow money. A couple hundred at first. If you give in, next time it'll be five or six hundred, then more and more."

Lin Xiaowan scoffed. "I'm not an idiot. Without a legitimate reason, I'm not lending anyone money."

"Ha, that's exactly the problem. Everyone who wants to borrow money has a perfectly legitimate reason."

Seeing her unconvinced expression, Su Lin just smiled. "You'll see."

Lin Xiaowan stayed silent. She thought Su Lin was being paranoid.

Sure, Yan Huan liked to mooch meals here and there, but that was because her family didn't have much. Besides, Yan Huan occasionally brought snacks to share, even though Lin Xiaowan almost never ate them.

Su Lin shook his head and returned to his seat.

A girl like Lin Xiaowan would only take this seriously when she experienced it firsthand. When that happened, her pride—her true, regal pride—would finally emerge.

Su Lin recalled that in the original novel, Lin Xiaowan had stayed this naively trusting all the way through sophomore year of college, until the day a student council president set his sights on her.

The moment he sat down, Yan Huan sidled up to Lin Xiaowan, her tone dripping with insinuation. "Xiaowan, what's going on between you and Su Lin?"

"Going on? What are you talking about?"

"You never go to the office with Su Lin. And you definitely never walk back together."

Yan Huan knew Lin Xiaowan's nature well. Beneath the warmth, her deskmate was deeply proud. Not just anyone could become her real friend.

The only reason Yan Huan had gotten close was three years as seatmates.

"It's... the only hallway to the office goes one way. Of course we'd run into each other."

Lin Xiaowan was in no mood to discuss Su Lin with Yan Huan.

Yan Huan was the class gossip queen. If she found out, the whole school would know by sundown.

That would truly be impossible to untangle.

"Oh. Well, just keep your distance from that Su Lin, okay?" Yan Huan offered her "well-meaning" advice.

"Mm, I know. Instead of worrying about me, worry about Ye Feng. That boy is head over heels for you." Lin Xiaowan deflected with a teasing smile.

Yan Huan glanced disdainfully at Ye Feng. "Me and Ye Feng? Never happening. We're from completely different worlds."

Ye Feng was one of the few students the teachers had essentially given up on. Even if he buckled down now, college was a pipe dream.

Yan Huan, meanwhile, was in the class top ten—985 or 211 university material.

So her claim about being from different worlds had merit. Once the college entrance exam was over, their paths would never cross again.

"Ye Feng's grades might not be great, but his feelings for you are genuine. We can all see it."

Yan Huan didn't mince words. "What good are feelings? His parents both work at Jiangning Food Factory. The factory hasn't paid wages in three months. If I actually dated him, what—we'd starve together?"

Yan Huan's parents also worked at Jiangning Food Factory, but in management. Her family was significantly better off than Ye Feng's.

Between that and occasional interactions with Ye Feng, she'd grown to despise people like him.

The fact that he had *those* kinds of feelings for her wasn't flattering—it was revolting. In her mind, being liked by Ye Feng was inherently disgusting.

"Xiaowan, if you're really my friend, stop bringing up Ye Feng. That loser does nothing but game all day. He's a lost cause."

"Fine. But I'll say this: you're never going to find someone who cares about you as completely as Ye Feng does."

Yan Huan pursed her lips without responding.

She wasn't ugly—actually ranked among the prettier girls in class, just a step below Lin Xiaowan.

In her view, once she shed the dead weight of Ye Feng's obsession, college would be a whole new world. Unlike now, where his puppy-dog presence scared away every other potential suitor.

*Ring!*

The class bell ended their conversation.
