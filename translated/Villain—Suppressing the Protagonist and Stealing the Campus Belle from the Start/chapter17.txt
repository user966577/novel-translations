Watching Ye Feng walk out of the classroom without a word, Wang Yi's expression softened somewhat.

He addressed the class. "Don't follow Ye Feng's example. That boy has completely given up on himself."

"When someone won't even try to save themselves, they're beyond help. Even after graduation, he won't amount to anything."

He glanced at Ye Feng through the window—standing in the hallway without a care in the world, gazing at the scenery—and felt another surge of irritation.

But he held his tongue this time.

If Ye Feng had thrown in the towel, nothing Wang Yi said would make a difference. Better to just ignore him.

...

After about fifteen minutes of standing outside, Ye Feng had confirmed it.

He was reborn.

Through the window, he peered into the classroom and was startled to notice that Yan Huan and Feng Yifei were already exchanging flirtatious glances.

*Those two-faced cheaters. They told me they didn't get in touch until after college graduation. Turns out they were already hooking up in high school.*

*Sooner or later, I'll deal with both of them.*

Ye Feng shifted his gaze to Xia Shiyu, his eyes softening.

Xia Shiyu was listening attentively to Wang Yi's lecture, jotting down notes from time to time. From his vantage point outside, Ye Feng noticed something that made his brow furrow—Xia Shiyu kept glancing at Su Lin.

*Why does Shiyu keep looking at that guy? He's no good.*

*It's probably a coincidence. Lin Xiaowan sits next to Su Lin, so Shiyu's probably looking at her.*

*Uncle Xia should be in the hospital right about now. I need to figure out a way to help. Last life I was an idiot—wasted all my energy on Yan Huan and left myself with a lifelong regret.*

*Thank God I got reborn. I can make it right this time. Shiyu, I won't let you face this alone again.*

*I need to find a way to make money. Uncle Xia's condition can't wait. Miss the window and it's a death sentence.*

Ye Feng's attention snagged on the countdown written on the blackboard.

97 days until the college entrance exam.

*Today is March 3rd, 2002.*

*This... today's the day the school gives Shiyu the donation money.*

*Lottery tickets—no, I can't remember the numbers. Scratch cards—don't be ridiculous. Writing novels—can't, and it's too slow anyway.*

*Sell internet cafe licenses? Where would I even get one? Internet cafes... games... GAMES!*

A spark of excitement flashed in Ye Feng's eyes. He'd thought of a way to make money fast.

But the method required capital.

Not just a thousand or two—he'd need at least 50,000 yuan to get started.

Where was he supposed to get that kind of money?

*For Uncle Xia's sake, I'll have to borrow from Shiyu first. Once I've made the money, I'll pay her dad's medical bills.*

*She probably hasn't completely given up on me yet at this point. Borrowing from her shouldn't be a problem... right?*

Ye Feng looked at Xia Shiyu's face through the glass, uncertain. But she never once looked in his direction.

Another pang of guilt.

He suspected she was already disappointed in him.

*No. I can't let it end like this. I have to help. I'll just borrow that money.*

*Last life, the Destiny Necklace went up to over 6,000 per unit. It happened right after the monthly exam—I know because Xu Jie told me himself. He wouldn't shut up about it all the way through the college entrance exam. There's no way I'm wrong.*

The Destiny Necklace bug had gone viral in his past life. He'd heard about it from so many people—he was absolutely certain.

Su Lin watched Ye Feng muttering to himself through the window, a glint of amusement in his eyes.

*The pit's been dug, my friend. All that's left is for you to jump in.*

*Ding!*

The bell rang. Wang Yi didn't hold the class over—he dismissed them immediately.

He walked out with his lecture notes and spotted Ye Feng in the hallway. He opened his mouth to say something encouraging, then thought better of it and settled for a cold snort.

In his view, Ye Feng was a lost cause. Any advice would be wasted breath.

Then he remembered the hospital trip. "Ye Feng, go with Xia Shiyu to the hospital later. And no sneaking off to the internet cafe, understood?"

Ye Feng nodded, then was hit by another wave of self-loathing.

Last time, he'd ditched Xia Shiyu halfway to the hospital and gone to the internet cafe to play shooters instead.

Now the memory made him want to slap himself.

He waited until Wang Yi had descended the stairs and disappeared completely before walking back into the classroom.

"Feng-bro! Wanna hit the internet cafe at lunch?"

Ye Feng recognized his best buddy, Xu Jie. He shook his head. "Got something to do at lunch. Not gaming today. Go without me."

"But bro, we had plans! *City of Angels* is dropping a new world boss. We need to prep!"

Ye Feng waved him off. "After school. We'll go together after school."

"Deal!"

Xu Jie ran off, satisfied.

When Ye Feng turned to find Xia Shiyu, he was startled to see her already sitting next to Su Lin, who was rummaging through his backpack.

Su Lin turned the entire bag inside out, then looked at Xia Shiyu with an embarrassed grin. "Shiyu, I'm sorry—I think I left your notebook at home."

Xia Shiyu took one look at his awkward, sheepish smile and couldn't help herself.

"Pfft!"

"Ahaha..."

Su Lin: "..."

"Shiyu, I didn't do it on purpose. I swear I grabbed it this morning, but then... Look, how about when we go to the hospital later, I swing by my house and pick it up?"

Xia Shiyu shook her head. "It's fine, really. It's just a notebook. If it's useful to you, keep it."

Su Lin blinked. "Keep it? But what about you? Don't you need to review English?"

Xia Shiyu smiled confidently. "Review English? Su Lin, did you forget what my English scores look like?"

That jolted his memory. Xia Shiyu's English was outstanding—she never scored below 145. She and Su Lin were mirror images in a way: his weak subject was English, hers was math. And Lin Xiaowan? She didn't have a weak subject.

*Since when did Shiyu get this close to that guy?*

*Turns out I was the only one sleepwalking through high school. Su Lin was already making moves on Shiyu back then—he just didn't succeed in my past life. I'm such an idiot.*

Ye Feng decided that even though Su Lin had ultimately failed last time, he needed to intervene now.

He was convinced Su Lin's interest in Xia Shiyu was anything but innocent.

"Shiyu... what kind of notebook is it? Mind if I take a look?" Ye Feng approached with what he believed was his warmest, most approachable smile.

Xia Shiyu glanced at him and frowned. "Xiaofeng, you score in the twenties and thirties on every English test. Even if I showed you, you wouldn't understand it."

Su Lin burst out laughing. "Ha! Well, isn't this something—the class dunce wants to turn over a new leaf!"

Ye Feng's brow furrowed. "It's never too late to start learning. Su Lin, you think wanting to study is something to laugh at?"

Su Lin: "..."
