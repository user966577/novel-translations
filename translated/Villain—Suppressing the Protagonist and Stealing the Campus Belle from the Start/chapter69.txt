The days flew by, and Saturday arrived in the blink of an eye.

Su Lin had barely sat down when he noticed Lin Xiaowan at her desk, humming a little tune.

"Well, someone's in a good mood. Finally escaped the parental lockdown and regained your freedom?"

"How did you know?" Lin Xiaowan looked up, genuinely surprised.

"These past few days you've been moping so hard your hair was practically going white. No way you'd be humming if you were still under surveillance." Su Lin teased.

"Hehe, my dad didn't come home last night—slept at the municipal building. And my mom's still in bed. Dad said he'd be too busy going forward and told me to get to school on my own." Lin Xiaowan grinned.

"That was fast. Is he still coming to the conference today?"

"He should be. He just texted saying he'd definitely wrap things up before noon and come over."

"Well, good. Too bad my dad can't make it—he's still in Donghai. Looks like I won't see him until summer break." Su Lin said lightly.

"Su Lin, I used to envy your freedom, living alone and all. But right now, I just feel bad for you. Being home by yourself all the time must be rough." Lin Xiaowan gazed at him, her eyes soft with sympathy.

Su Lin was genuinely confused. "What? I'm doing great. No one telling me what to do. Total freedom."

"But your dad's always this busy. How did you cope before?"

Su Lin thought about the original Su Lin's memories. The previous occupant of this body had been somewhat withdrawn, and family dynamics were likely a big contributor.

"I was lost for a while. Then I wasn't."

"How did you stop being lost?"

Su Lin took Lin Xiaowan's hand and smiled. "Because I found you."

"I..."

Looking at the gentle warmth in his smile, Lin Xiaowan was possessed by an impulse she couldn't explain. She threw her arms around him and whispered, "Su Lin, from now on, you have me."

"Mm."

They held each other until footsteps echoed from the stairwell, and Lin Xiaowan quickly pulled away.

Her face felt like it was on fire.

She'd acted on impulse—but she didn't regret it. Knowing Su Lin had been living alone all this time while staying so upbeat... compared to that, she'd been taking her blessings for granted.

"Su Lin! Xiaowan! I'm here!" Xia Shiyu bounded through the door with her insulated food container.

Seeing the familiar container, Su Lin smiled again.

He didn't understand what Lin Xiaowan was so sad about. Two beautiful girls orbiting him daily, breakfast delivered to his desk, over 20 million yuan in the bank, top of the school in academics—what exactly was there to pity?

But he wasn't foolish enough to say that out loud. Lin Xiaowan was having a rare emotional moment. Let her have it—it only brought them closer.

After all, he'd just gotten a nice, firm taste of those impressive assets pressed against him.

Su Lin accepted the food container with a grin. "At this rate, the three of us are going to be the earliest arrivals every day."

"Hehe, it's because you come early. I was worried you wouldn't have breakfast, so I started coming early too." Xia Shiyu's face glowed with gentle contentment.

Su Lin turned to Lin Xiaowan. "I come early because I was worried Xiaowan would be bored sitting here alone."

"So I should thank you for that?"

Su Lin casually peeled a lychee and popped it into Lin Xiaowan's mouth. "Thank Shiyu. This kind of treatment—you wouldn't get it at home."

"Hehe, I was just peeling them because I was bored."

Lin Xiaowan looked at Xia Shiyu's blissful, innocent smile and shook her head inwardly. That girl was a one-track mind. If Su Lin sold her out, she'd probably help him count the money.

At noon, after lunch, the entire class was mobilized for a deep clean. Xia Shiyu swept ahead while Su Lin followed with a mop—the two working in seamless tandem.

Lin Xiaowan, meanwhile, was busy with the logistical preparations for the conference.

Once everything was ready, parents began filtering into the school.

Even as the conference was about to start, Lin Xiaowan's father still hadn't appeared. Su Lin figured that was par for the course.

Everyone else was here for a parent-teacher conference. Lin Guoqiang was here for an inspection.

A man of his rank? The principal himself would be hovering nervously at his side.

Sure enough, after a while, Su Lin spotted the principal's entourage escorting Lin Guoqiang toward the classroom.

"Mr. Wang, how has our Xiaowan been performing lately?" Lin Guoqiang asked.

Wang Yi was grinning so wide his face might split. "Lin Xiaowan is an outstanding student—class president of Class 1. She participates actively in all school events, handles every task the teachers assign flawlessly, and her grades speak for themselves. Always at the very top."

Lin Guoqiang nodded. "That's reassuring. I'm so busy with work that I rarely have time to check on her academics. For her to do this well—that's thanks to your school's guidance."

Wang Yi beamed. "A student like Lin Xiaowan doesn't need our guidance. She's remarkably self-disciplined."

Lin Guoqiang nodded again, then after a pause: "And how are her social relationships?"

"Excellent. She gets along well with everyone in class, and she's especially close to a few of the top students—Xia Shiyu, Su Lin, that group."

"Xia Shiyu—that's the one Xiaowan mentioned, with the sick father?"

Wang Yi nodded. "Kidney failure. Needed a transplant. I heard the surgery was completed not long ago."

"I see. And Su Lin—he's Su Zhenguo's son?"

"That's right. Su Lin is another student who needs zero oversight. Perfect scores in every subject except Chinese—and honestly, even his Chinese could be perfect. The school just feels it'd look too extreme, so they symbolically dock a few points each exam."

"That good?" Lin Guoqiang feigned surprise.

"Su Lin is the pride of our school. A lock for Tsinghua or Peking University. We wouldn't exaggerate something like that." Wang Yi said solemnly.

"I'd like to chat with him later. A student who scores perfect in every subject—there aren't many of those in our country's history."

"Indeed. Like father, like son." Wang Yi said admiringly.

Lin Guoqiang winced internally. 'Another one singing Su Lin's praises. Is this kid really that impressive?'

He felt it was overblown. The grades were probably real, but the character? That he had his doubts about.

Lin Guoqiang wasn't an expert physiognomist, but he could read people well enough from their faces. Su Lin's face broadcast: clever, resourceful, slippery, and shameless.

That type of person could thrive in business or politics, but they had a tendency to walk tightropes.

And that was one of Lin Guoqiang's core concerns about Su Lin getting close to Lin Xiaowan. A risk-taker would bring nothing but uncertainty into his daughter's life. All Lin Guoqiang wanted for Lin Xiaowan was stability and safety—not adventure.

Which was exactly why he'd come to take the boy's measure in person.

The group reached the classroom doorway. Lin Guoqiang's eyes immediately found Su Lin.

And Su Lin's eyes found him.

In that instant, a line from 'Let the Bullets Fly' flashed through Su Lin's mind: 'The dominance is leaking out!'

Was this a show of force? A warning?

Su Lin's mind raced. Lin Guoqiang's intentions were crystal clear—he was here specifically for him.

'Well, damn. Today's going to be rough.'

The man was clearly not here to play nice.

Wang Yi, oblivious to the electric tension between Su Lin and Lin Guoqiang, gestured toward Lin Xiaowan's seat. "Mayor Lin, that's Lin Xiaowan's desk right there."

Lin Guoqiang nodded, walked over, and sat down.

His eyes, however, weren't on the blackboard or Wang Yi.

They were locked on Su Lin.

Su Lin: '...'

'Could he be any more obvious?'
