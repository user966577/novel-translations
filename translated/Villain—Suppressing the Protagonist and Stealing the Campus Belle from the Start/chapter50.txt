Ye Feng lay prone on his bed, staring lifelessly at the faded pillow before him.

He had begun to doubt his entire existence.

After being reborn, he'd thought he could quickly accumulate his first pot of gold, then expand his business empire, win over both his childhood sweetheart and his dream girl, and reach the pinnacle of life.

Reality had dealt him crushing blow after crushing blow.

One setback after another had forced him into self-reflection.

It turned out that a loser who got reborn didn't automatically become a chosen one. He was still a loser.

Granted, he was doing better than in his previous life, but Ye Feng knew he had rebirth plus enhanced memory.

He'd essentially stacked cheat upon cheat.

And yet he'd ended up in this state.

'Maybe I'm just hopeless? I've been reborn with enhanced memory, and it's still come to this?'

'And Su Lin—what kind of dumb luck did that guy stumble into?'

Ye Feng had considered the possibility that something was off, but whenever he carefully reviewed his actions, he realized the problems were all his own.

When stockpiling items, he'd been too greedy. When buying gastrodia tubers, if he'd been more careful—signed contracts first, paid later—things wouldn't have turned out this way.

And the borrowing incident... he'd hurt Xia Shiyu deeply.

'How pathetic. I had four deuces and two jokers in my hand, and I played that winning hand into the dirt.'

'Sigh...'

'Is there still a chance? My money's been confiscated. This beating means I won't recover for at least a week.'

Ye Feng tried to roll over and felt sharp pain shoot through his body, especially his backside and back.

Ye Weimin hadn't held back at all. This time he'd really lost his temper.

'What am I supposed to do? I won't be able to get out of bed for at least three days.'

'Forget it. I'll just study hard this week. Next month is the midterm, then the final monthly exam. Su Lin...'

To make a good impression and salvage his parents' opinion of him, Ye Feng pulled out his textbooks.

But to his horror, he discovered that content he used to memorize after reading twice now wouldn't stick even after reading it a dozen times.

'What... how is this possible? Why can't I remember anything? Has my memory gotten worse?'

Ye Feng was truly panicking now. His confidence in the bet with Su Lin had rested entirely on his enhanced memory. Now that his memory was failing him, he was completely rattled.

'That's impossible. My memory has always been excellent.'

'Maybe too much happened today. I'm just tired?'

Ye Feng set aside his book. 'I'll take a nap. Everything will be fine after I sleep.'

'Ugh...'

[Ding! Congratulations, Host. Through Lin Xiaowan's exposure, Ye Feng has experienced a parental beatdown, dealing him a devastating psychological blow and causing him to question his entire life. Reward: Two Golden Treasure Box lottery chances.]

[Ding! Due to Host's continuous suppression, the protagonist has suffered a psychological critical hit. Protagonist Ye Feng's memory ability reduced by 20%. Previous life memories reduced by 20%.]

Su Lin was driving Lin Xiaowan to the hospital when he heard the system's voice in his head. He was stunned.

'This is all Lin Xiaowan's credit. If I'd known telling his parents would be this effective, I would've done it ages ago.'

"Su Lin, keep your eyes on the road. I'm right here beside you—I'm not going anywhere. You're driving and still sneaking glances at me." Lin Xiaowan's voice was shy.

She was clear about her feelings now. She'd fallen for Su Lin.

But she felt they shouldn't rush things. Yet here was Su Lin acting like a lovestruck teenager, stealing glances at her even while driving.

At the same time, Lin Xiaowan was secretly pleased.

Didn't this prove she was attractive? It showed that Su Lin genuinely liked her.

Lin Xiaowan was happy, and her whole being seemed to radiate a strange aura, as if pink love bubbles were floating around her.

She sat there with a silly smile on her face.

Su Lin shook his head. Better to stay quiet right now. If he shattered Lin Xiaowan's beautiful fantasy, she'd definitely get embarrassed and angry.

They arrived at the hospital without incident. Xia Shiyu was already waiting for them at the entrance.

"Su Lin, Xiaowan, what brings you two here?"

Xia Shiyu was dazzled by Lin Xiaowan's appearance.

Lin Xiaowan's figure was incredible, and combined with her departure from her usual girlish style, she looked absolutely stunning today—youthful energy radiating from every pore.

"Xiaowan, you look so pretty in that outfit."

Lin Xiaowan smiled modestly. "Not really. Xiaoyu, you're the pretty one."

Su Lin waved his hand. "You're both pretty. Can we stop with the mutual flattery?"

"Hehe, Su Lin, you look really handsome today too. At school I never really noticed, but now that you've changed clothes, you seem so much more mature. You don't even look like a student anymore. You're very... charming. Very handsome!"

Su Lin smiled. "Xiaoyu, you're saying I wasn't mature before?"

Xia Shiyu quickly shook her head. "No, no, no. What I mean is you were mature before, but you still looked like a student. Today though, you don't just seem mature and steady—you don't look like a student at all. You're very... magnetic. Very handsome!"

"Hmm, that's more like it."

Lin Xiaowan shot Su Lin a look and gave his arm a little twist. "Enough from you. You just love hearing people praise you. What's wrong with you?"

"Hehe. Xiaoyu, is everything arranged for your dad? Coming out with us won't cause any problems, right?"

Xia Shiyu nodded. "Don't worry, Su Lin. My dad's sleeping. And even when he wakes up, there's not much I can do to help. As long as I'm back by eight tonight, it'll be fine."

"Good. Then let's go shopping."

"Great. I actually need to buy some things anyway—we've run out of a lot of stuff at home."

She could tell something was shifting between Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan, but she didn't mind at all.

She'd also noticed Su Lin's gestures toward her that went beyond friendship.

But so what?

What the future held, Xia Shiyu couldn't predict and didn't want to know. All she knew was that being with Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan made her happy. Every day was joyful. That was enough.

As for matters of the heart, she'd leave those to time.
