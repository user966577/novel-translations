Su Lin surveyed the ongoing interior work and sighed. "Chen Yang's already pushing as fast as he can. No point pressuring him further. But I checked with the foreman—as long as the funds are there, they can finish by the 25th."

"The 25th gives us five days to stock the shelves. That should work," Lin Xiaowan nodded.

"Yeah. A month ago, I never imagined we could get a supermarket off the ground this fast." Su Lin said with some emotion.

This venture had opened his eyes to the abilities of Lin Xiaowan, Xia Shiyu, and Chen Yang. He was already operating with cheat-level advantages, yet these three had started from scratch and were keeping pace with him—no, outpacing him. In less than a month, they'd each become remarkably competent.

But what made Su Lin happiest was that they were all working for him.

"Nobody could've predicted it. Su Lin, I think we're going to succeed."

"Oh? You think so too?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "The supermarket shopping model is so ahead of its time. Anyone who walks in is going to want to buy something. People these days don't stockpile—there's always something they need at home. Once they step inside, the chances of leaving empty-handed are slim."

"Xiaowan's right. From vegetables and rice to snacks, appliances, and clothing—a supermarket covers practically every need."

Hearing the two girls' analysis, Su Lin nodded. "That's one of the reasons I wanted to do this."

"One of? There are others?"

Su Lin nodded. "The other reason is that I'm bullish on the real estate market. Supermarkets are always in prime locations. Property values are only going up. Even if the supermarket doesn't work out, selling the building alone would net a nice profit."

Lin Xiaowan thought for a moment, then looked at Su Lin with a complicated expression. "No wonder you said to buy rather than lease. You had a backup plan all along."

"Xiaowan, you can't just look at what's right in front of you. Always keep your eyes on the long game." Su Lin adopted his most sagely expression.

"Your strategic vision is impressive, I'll give you that. But you always miss the details."

Su Lin's face reddened slightly. "That's what I have you and Shiyu for. You're both detail-oriented. I've said it before—I handle the company's strategic direction and big-picture decisions, and you two handle execution."

"Hmph, you're just making excuses for being lazy."

"Shiyu and I have been working ourselves to the bone, and you've been coasting the whole time."

For once, Xia Shiyu didn't come to Su Lin's defense. She nodded in firm agreement. "Xiaowan's right. I haven't had time to study at home in ages. I collapse into bed the second I get back. Su Lin, I'm definitely going to bomb this midterm."

"And if we do, you'd better find a way to make it up to us."

"Ahem, how about I tutor you both?" Su Lin offered with a cheeky grin.

Lin Xiaowan's eyes went wide. "Su Lin, how can you say that with a straight face? You tutor us? Need I remind you that your English only improved because you borrowed our notes?"

"Exactly! Xiaowan and I really miscalculated on that one—we lent you our notes and then you outscored both of us."

"Heh... so you two have formed an alliance, huh? Both ganging up on me."

"Whose fault is it for always exploiting us?!"

"Exploiting? I prefer 'making optimal use of your abilities.' One person being strong is just individual strength. But a person who can leverage everyone's abilities? That's how you get great things done."

"I give up arguing with you. You always win. I'm hungry."

"Su Lin, I'm hungry too."

Su Lin waved them toward the car. "Then let's go eat. You two get in—I'll go grab Chen Yang."

...

That afternoon, a little past five, a row of cars was parked outside Jiangning First High School, waiting to pick up students. Because today was the school-wide midterm exam, dismissal was earlier than usual.

A black Audi A6 rolled to a stop among the other vehicles.

Lin Guoqiang stared at the school gates and let out a quiet sigh.

His driver, noticing the sigh, asked curiously, "Guoqiang, what's wrong?"

Lin Guoqiang glanced at his old friend and shook his head. "It just hit me—Xiaowan's already in her third year of high school, and the number of times I've come to pick her up from school... I can count them on one hand. So many times I've driven past and never even stopped."

Tian Wei had been Lin Guoqiang's driver since he'd brought him from Beijing. They went way back. Lin Guoqiang trusted him with matters he wouldn't share with most people.

"That's because your work is demanding. You're always busy."

"True, but if I really wanted to make time, I could. Most of the time I just... chose not to. Chose to squeeze in a bit more work instead." Lin Guoqiang said, his voice heavy with regret.

"I watched Xiaowan grow up. Beautiful, smart, poised—she's got your best qualities. She understands."

"That's exactly what makes it worse. She's too understanding. And now she's getting close to Su Zhenguo's boy. You have no idea how worried I've been, but I never had time to come check." Lin Guoqiang said guiltily.

"Well, you're here now. I've heard of this Su Zhenguo—quite the entrepreneur. Even has a reputation at the provincial level."

Lin Guoqiang nodded. "The province has been pushing hard to nurture homegrown business leaders. Several have risen in recent years, and Su Zhenguo is one of the standouts. Very capable. He's been buying up land in Linhai and Donghai this year—give him a couple more years and he'll expand beyond Jiangnan Province."

"That impressive? Breaking out of the province can't be easy."

Lin Guoqiang nodded. "That's not our concern."

"But here's the thing—Xiaowan practically worships Su Zhenguo's son. They've been spending a lot of time together. Today I want to see for myself what's so special about this kid. Xiaowan's been singing his praises nonstop." A note of jealousy crept into Lin Guoqiang's voice.

"Heh, that doesn't sound like you, Guoqiang," Tian Wei remarked with amusement.

"Hmph! Different situations call for different approaches. Xiaowan's eighteen now. I can't use a heavy hand—with her personality, she'd double down out of spite, and she'd be the one who suffers." Lin Guoqiang said irritably.

He knew his daughter better than anyone. At eighteen, Lin Xiaowan seemed obedient and sensible on the surface, but deep down she'd inherited his stubborn streak. Once she set her mind on someone, not even a team of horses could pull her back.

If he tried to forcibly separate them, it would only backfire and push Lin Xiaowan further toward Su Lin. A softer approach was needed—he'd have to work on both Lin Xiaowan and Su Lin. But with his schedule being what it was, Lin Guoqiang was torn.

The dismissal bell rang.

"That's the bell, isn't it? How is school out before six?" Tian Wei asked.

Lin Guoqiang smiled. "Midterm exams today, so they let out early. Perfect timing—I'll take Xiaowan for some KFC."

"Heh, let's hope she appreciates the gesture," Tian Wei said with a knowing smile.

"I know my daughter. She might not care about spending time with me, but offer her food and she won't say no."

Students began streaming out of the school gates. Lin Guoqiang and Tian Wei stopped chatting, their eyes trained on the entrance, waiting for Lin Xiaowan.

...

Meanwhile, Su Lin walked alongside Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu on their way out.

"Su Lin, did you drive today?" Lin Xiaowan asked.

Su Lin nodded. "Yeah, since it's exam day and we got out early, I want to swing by the supermarket after this."

"I'll come with you. Nothing going on at home anyway."

"The hospital doesn't need me either. I'll tag along too," Xia Shiyu chimed in.

Since hiring a caretaker, Xia Shiyu finally had time to rest at home. The professional nurse was far more thorough than she was—there wasn't much for her to do at the hospital anymore.

Su Lin nodded. "Good. The store's opening soon—familiarize yourselves with everything and see if there are any details we've overlooked."

"Chen Yang says the Joy Mart sign was finished yesterday. It's already installed—just waiting for the unveiling."

Su Lin grinned. "That's because I paid well. Workers normally get 80 yuan a day, but I'm paying them 100, plus round-the-clock shifts. If they're still not giving it their all at that rate, I'll find replacements."

"That's what you call 'money power,' isn't it?"

Su Lin nodded. "So when people say money can't buy time, they're lying. Under normal circumstances, a renovation this size takes at least two months. We did it in under one. That's buying time."

"You and your twisted logic."

The three of them reached the school gates.

By now, Tian Wei had already spotted Lin Xiaowan walking beside Su Lin. "Guoqiang, I see Xiaowan!"

"She's out? Where, where?" Lin Guoqiang perked up instantly.

Tian Wei pointed toward Lin Xiaowan at Su Lin's side. "Right there— wait, she didn't look our way. She's crossing the street."

"Strange, she didn't ride her bike today? She's walking."

"Probably wanted to walk with her friends," Lin Guoqiang guessed.

He knew that for most of high school, Lin Xiaowan hadn't had any real friends—not until recently, when she'd mentioned making two.

"Awei, follow them."

"Got it."

Tian Wei started the car, but turning around proved impossible with all the vehicles clogging the school entrance.

By the time he finally managed to maneuver through, he saw Lin Xiaowan climb into a Mercedes alongside Su Lin.

"This... Guoqiang, they..."

Lin Guoqiang was about to explode. Watching his daughter happily hop into a Mercedes with Su Lin—the bitterness was indescribable.

Especially that beaming smile on Lin Xiaowan's face. He hadn't seen her smile like that in years.

And here she was, smiling like the sun for some boy.
