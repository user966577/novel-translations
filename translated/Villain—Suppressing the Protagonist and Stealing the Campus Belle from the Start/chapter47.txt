"Look—it really is fake." Su Lin wanted to laugh but held back. If he laughed at Lin Xiaowan now, she'd definitely hold a grudge and find a way to get back at him.

"I'm not looking. I'm not looking."

Su Lin sighed and gave the mannequin a kick. "See? It's fake. I just kicked it."

"Players, please do not damage the props!"

Su Lin: "..."

Lin Xiaowan: "..."

"It's really fake?"

"Open your eyes and see for yourself. Definitely fake."

Lin Xiaowan finally opened her eyes and looked at the figure. It was indeed fake.

Extremely fake, actually. Su Lin's kick had been rather forceful, and the mannequin had toppled over, revealing the straw stuffing inside.

Lin Xiaowan: "????"

"Told you it was fake. Come on—let's return the tablet." Su Lin chuckled as he set her down.

Lin Xiaowan's face flushed. She'd been too panicked to notice before, but now she realized Su Lin had been cradling her in his arms. That firm chest...

Uh...

Her mind was wandering.

"Fine. Let's go return it."

---

It was only now that Su Lin discovered just how strong Lin Xiaowan's grip was.

If not for his enhanced physique, his arm would've been sore for days.

They passed through several more rooms before reaching what appeared to be the ancestral shrine.

"Su Lin, why is there wind in here? Isn't this supposed to be a sealed room?"

Lin Xiaowan's hair stood on end. She knew this was all fake, but she couldn't help being scared.

Su Lin reassured her. "Don't worry about that. Just remember—it's all fake. If you keep telling yourself it's fake, you won't be scared anymore."

Lin Xiaowan looked at the rows of spirit tablets before her and felt her courage falter. She immediately started mumbling to herself.

"It's fake, it's fake. All fake."

"Props, props. Just props."

"Don't be scared, don't be scared. Lin Xiaowan, you've got this. It's all fake!"

Watching her mutter to herself, Su Lin found her absolutely adorable. He bitterly regretted not having a smartphone. 'I could be recording this.'

"Let's go. I'll put the tablet back."

Lin Xiaowan stayed rooted to the spot, shaking Su Lin's arm. "There's definitely a trap. Su Lin, you go. I'll wait here."

Su Lin sighed but nodded. "Fine. Stay here and don't move. I'll go put it back."

"Okay. Hurry, Su Lin."

"Sure."

Su Lin took the tablet and walked toward the shrine. Lin Xiaowan's eyes were glued to him, worried something like before would happen.

He placed the tablet in its spot.

Nothing happened.

Lin Xiaowan was surprised—and a little annoyed.

Why did nothing happen when Su Lin did it, but she got jump-scared by a corpse just for picking up the tablet?

Just then, a raspy old voice came from behind her.

"Young one, thank you for returning my son's tablet. To repay you, I shall give you my treasured map."

Lin Xiaowan whipped around instinctively.

An elderly figure stood behind her, holding a tattered lantern, having appeared out of nowhere.

"AHHHHH!"

Lin Xiaowan shrieked and stomped her feet in place.

Then she remembered Su Lin's words. 'Fake. It's all fake.'

"Fake, fake. It's all fake."

"Props, props. All props."

"Wahhh! Why do they keep targeting me?! Props are bullying me too?! I'll fight you!"

She lashed out with a vicious groin kick aimed at the old man.

"Xiaowan, don't—"

"OWWWW!"

A howl of agony echoed through the chamber.

The old man dropped his lantern, clutched his groin, and started hopping in place.

His doubled-over posture looked even more terrifying to Lin Xiaowan.

"Su Lin... ghost! It's a ghost!"

Before Su Lin could react, Lin Xiaowan had already sprinted over and leaped onto him, wrapping her long legs tightly around his thigh.

"Ghost! There's a real ghost this time, Su Lin! It's real!"

Su Lin looked at the staff member's agonized expression, utterly helpless. That kick had landed hard.

Instinctively, he pressed his own legs together.

This girl usually seemed so sweet and agreeable—never got into physical altercations. Who knew she had this ferocious side?

He patted her back. "It's not real. It's not a ghost. He's a staff member here to deliver a clue."

"Ghost... Su Lin, there's a ghost!"

Lin Xiaowan wasn't hearing a word.

Su Lin sighed. With one arm supporting her, he walked over to the staff member. "I'm so sorry, sir. She didn't mean it."

The old man grimaced. "That... that was one hell of a kick. Ow..."

Su Lin could only offer sympathy. Without a word, he fished out 200 yuan from his pocket and handed it to the man. "Sorry again. Xiaowan really didn't do it on purpose. Here—a little something for medical expenses."

Five minutes later, Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan were escorted out of the escape room by the staff.

Even after seeing sunlight, Lin Xiaowan remained wrapped around Su Lin like a sloth.

"Her legs are seriously strong. Walking is actually difficult."

Su Lin noticed the crowd staring and patted Lin Xiaowan's back. "Xiaowan, we're out. It's safe now. No more ghosts."

Lin Xiaowan opened her eyes, saw all the people watching, and immediately scrambled off Su Lin.

"That girl didn't cry! And she's so pretty."

"Why are you staring at pretty girls? Getting ideas?"

"No way—she obviously has a boyfriend. What's the point?"

"So if she didn't have a boyfriend, you'd make a move?"

"That's not what I meant."

"Then what did you mean?"

"..."

Lin Xiaowan grabbed Su Lin's hand and, head down, speed-walked away from the crowd.

Once they were completely out of sight, she let go of his hand, spun around, and glared at him. "Su Lin, you did that on purpose. I'm never speaking to you again."

Su Lin protested his innocence. "Xiaowan, you're wronging me! How was I supposed to know the first challenge would be that intense? And that guy—he's the real victim here. You kicked him so hard. He still hadn't recovered by the time we left."

Mentioning it only made Lin Xiaowan angrier. "That was a real person and you didn't tell me!"

"I tried to tell you! You screamed, then charged him with a kick. I didn't even have time to warn you!"

"Waaah! My reputation is ruined. This is all your fault."

Lin Xiaowan pounded on Su Lin's chest a few times.

"How is it ruined? I thought you were pretty adorable today. Too bad—we only finished the first task. We hadn't even gotten the clue when the staff kicked us out."

"We're probably the only players in history to get ejected by staff."

"Actually, no. I read online that one couple actually beat up a staff member. The guy saw his girlfriend crying and lost it—thought someone was pretending to be a ghost. He roughed the guy up pretty bad. Cost him a fortune in compensation."

Speaking of compensation, Lin Xiaowan felt embarrassed. She'd closed her eyes in fear earlier, but she knew Su Lin had paid the man.

"Su Lin, how much did you pay? I'll pay you back."
