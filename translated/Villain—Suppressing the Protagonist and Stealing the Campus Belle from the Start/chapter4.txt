"But—"

Su Lin shook his head. "No buts. Xiaowan, the ball's in your court. Other students will be here any minute. Make your call."

"I..."

"Fine, if you won't help, I'm taking it back."

Lin Xiaowan grabbed his hand. "I'll do it! I'll help, okay?"

Feeling her delicate fingers pressed against the back of his hand, Su Lin grinned. "That's more like it. I, Su Lin, have my reputation to think about. I'm about to graduate—no way I'm letting rumors follow me out the door."

"Hmph. I really don't understand what goes on in that head of yours."

Lin Xiaowan stuffed the money into her bag, zipped it tight, then glanced around to make sure no one had seen. Only then did she pat her chest in relief.

Su Lin, meanwhile, had already returned to his seat and was reading intently.

They say a man is most attractive when he's focused. At this moment, Su Lin was exactly that.

For the first time, Lin Xiaowan found herself thinking that Su Lin, with his nose in a book, was actually rather handsome.

She shook the thought away immediately.

"What kind of person is Su Lin, really? Is all that arrogance and disdain just an act? But what would be the point? He says he likes me, yet he knows I can't stand arrogant men. Putting on that act only pushes me away. Unless... it's not me he likes. Maybe it's actually Xia Shiyu?"

"But the look in someone's eyes doesn't lie. He was completely serious when he said he'd rather not donate at all if I wouldn't help. So how does that make sense?"

"If he genuinely just wants to donate, then why treat the poorer students the way he does?"

The more she thought about it, the more tangled it got. She was still lost in her own head when the morning reading bell sounded.

What Lin Xiaowan couldn't have known was that every bit of this was Su Lin's design.

With Lin Xiaowan's personality, her brain was probably in full meltdown mode right about now.

As a man from Earth, Su Lin's emotional intelligence wasn't exactly genius-level, but he was no fool either.

With a girl like Lin Xiaowan, ordinary approaches didn't work. The key wasn't to leave a good impression—it was to leave *any* impression.

Shortly after the bell, Wang Yi walked in carrying a simple cardboard donation box.

Every student stopped reading and looked up.

Wang Yi cleared his throat. "The donation box is right here. I'll be overseeing this personally. Starting from the first row—Wang Yue, you're up."

Wang Yue, the first student in the first row, stood without fuss and walked to the podium.

"Everyone else, get your money ready. This is anonymous and untracked—just drop it in the box."

Wang Yi stepped aside as Wang Yue placed a 100-yuan note into the box.

He nodded for the next student to continue.

One by one, students filed up in orderly fashion.

When Su Lin's turn came, he walked to the podium carrying two hundred yuan.

Whispers erupted immediately.

"Tch... and he's the vice president? Acts all high and mighty, looks down on everyone, and he donates two hundred?"

"Exactly! Feng Yifei's family just owns a restaurant and even he put in three thousand. Su Lin's dad runs Su Construction Group and he gives two hundred?"

"Good grades and a handsome face with some family money, and he thinks he's better than everyone."

The murmuring came from every corner. Su Lin caught snatches of it but didn't care, maintaining his imposing air as always.

His attitude only fueled the class's irritation. The chatter grew louder, with no one bothering to keep their voices down.

"Hey! Is this a classroom or a farmer's market? I said the amount is voluntary. Why are you all making a fuss?"

Wang Yi's authority quieted the room somewhat.

Only a handful of students hadn't joined in the criticism.

Xia Shiyu in the front. Chen Yang in the back. And Lin Xiaowan, seated across the aisle from Su Lin.

"Xiaowan, that Su Lin is honestly disgusting. His family's loaded and he donates two hundred? I actually used to think you two would make a good match, but now I'm glad you never went for him."

Hearing her deskmate Yang Yan's mockery, Lin Xiaowan felt a pang of discomfort. She was the only person in the entire class who knew Su Lin hadn't just donated two hundred—he'd given a full 200,000 yuan. But she'd promised to keep his secret, and keeping it bottled up was driving her crazy.

"Xiao Yan," Lin Xiaowan frowned, "the teacher said the amount was voluntary."

"Obviously I know it's voluntary! But look at Su Lin's face—it's infuriating."

Lin Xiaowan followed Yang Yan's gaze to Su Lin, who wore an expression that screamed *don't touch me, peasants*. Somehow, she found it rather endearing now, and a small smile tugged at her lips.

"That Su Lin..."

"Xiaowan, you think he's disgusting too, right?"

Lin Xiaowan shook her head without answering. Su Lin had already descended from the podium amid a chorus of sighs and sneers.

When it was Lin Xiaowan's turn, the classroom erupted again.

The two thick stacks of cash in her hands were impossible to miss.

Wang Yi's mouth twitched at the sight. "Lin Xiaowan, you're donating all of this to Xia Shiyu?"

Lin Xiaowan instinctively glanced at Su Lin, only to find him absorbed in his book, not even looking her way. The realization stung a little.

She should have never agreed to this.

But if she hadn't, he really wouldn't have donated a cent.

"Yes, Mr. Wang."

Wang Yi nodded and asked nothing more.

He knew Lin Xiaowan's family situation better than anyone. Her father was the mayor, her mother ran a trading company, and their wealth far surpassed the Su family's. Donating 200,000 yuan was well within their means.

Besides, Lin Xiaowan had always been generous and kind-hearted.

Yet only Su Lin knew that beneath Lin Xiaowan's friendly exterior, she had very few true friends. She simply wanted her student years to be uncomplicated, free from the calculations and politics of adults.

"Holy—those two stacks must be 200,000! Plus another 20,000 on top? That's 220,000! She's seriously loaded."

"No wonder Lin Xiaowan doesn't look twice at anyone. With that kind of money, nobody in class comes close except Su Lin."

"Please. Su Lin donated two hundred. Lin Xiaowan donated over two hundred thousand. How do you even compare?"

"You can't. Su Lin's a miser with deep pockets, while Xiaowan's generous to a fault. Both are class officers, but the gap is astronomical. All hail our goddess!"

In the front row, Xia Shiyu's eyes went wide. She'd expected the fundraiser to collect maybe a few tens of thousands. She never imagined Lin Xiaowan would drop a bomb like this. If a few more people did the same, her father's transplant would be fully funded.

She quickly shook off the thought. That kind of greed was unacceptable.

What she needed to focus on now was how to properly thank Lin Xiaowan. This was over 200,000 yuan, not pocket change.

Su Lin was surprised to see that Lin Xiaowan had thrown in an extra 20,000 of her own. He knew she had money, but hadn't expected her to be this generous. Had his influence rubbed off on her?
