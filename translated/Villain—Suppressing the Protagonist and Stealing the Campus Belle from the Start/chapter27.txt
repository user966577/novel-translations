Xia Shiyu buried her crimson face in Su Lin's chest. She hadn't expected him to actually spank her like that.

Su Lin held her with a wicked grin, curious to see how long it would take before she dared sit up.

The warming weather meant thinner clothes. They both wore just a long-sleeved shirt under a light jacket. Xia Shiyu's jacket hung open, and Su Lin could feel the soft warmth pressed against him.

The sky was darkening fast. Su Lin checked the time—nearly ten o'clock.

He patted her back again. "Shiyu, how long are you planning to cling to me? It's almost ten."

Xia Shiyu knew she couldn't stall any longer. With a soft whimper, she sat up—and immediately avoided his gaze.

"A second ago you were holding on for dear life. Now you won't even look at me?"

"That's not..."

She turned back—and was met with that infuriating smirk. She immediately pummeled his chest with her fists. "Su Lin, you're bullying me again!"

"Waaah..."

"I'm already like this and you're still teasing me."

Su Lin pinched her cheek and laughed. "How am I bullying you? You've hit me a dozen times and I haven't fought back once."

"Oh! So now you want to fight back? I—I'll—"

Before she could finish, Su Lin took her hand and pulled her toward the car.

When Xia Shiyu saw the Mercedes S350, her expression dimmed.

That single car was worth enough to pay for her father's surgery twice over. Su Lin's looks, character, family, academics—everything about him was top-tier.

He was destined to end up with someone extraordinary. Someone like Lin Xiaowan.

And she was destined to never be good enough for him.

But the flutter in her heart wasn't fake. She knew that much.

In a flash, panic seized her. If Su Lin got a girlfriend someday, he'd never come rushing out in the middle of the night to find her like this again.

Her face went white as a sheet.

Su Lin felt her fingers turn ice-cold in his hand.

Su Lin smiled. "Shiyu, losing that bit of money is nothing. Don't take it to heart."

"Besides, I've made quite a bit from investments recently. I can lend you the money for Uncle Xia's surgery."

Xia Shiyu shook her head frantically. "No, no—Su Lin, I can't take any more of your money."

Su Lin stopped walking and pinched her cheek with a grin. "Who said anything about giving you money? It's a loan. You'll pay me back."

"That much money... I could never pay it back." Xia Shiyu's face crumpled.

Su Lin laughed. "I'm not in a hurry. You can pay it back slowly—one year, two years, three years. Whatever it takes."

"I..."

"Tch. You'll let Ye Feng take your money and blow it on a reckless gamble, but you won't let me lend you some?" Su Lin feigned annoyance.

Xia Shiyu threw her arms around him again. "Su Lin... why are you so good to me?"

Su Lin stroked her hair. "Because our little Shiyu is adorable. I like you very much."

"But... but what about Xiaowan?!"

'Smack!'

A crisp sound rang out.

"Shiyu, you're hugging me and thinking about another girl. Focus."

"I..."

'Smack!'

"And now you want to argue about it."

"Waah... Su Lin, I was wrong. You're not a good person at all—you're a big bully."

"Ha! I never claimed to be a good person."

Su Lin climbed into the car, grinning from ear to ear.

A good person?

He was the villain, thank you very much.

Being called a "nice guy" was the greatest insult imaginable.

Once they were in the car, Su Lin glanced at Xia Shiyu. "Do you know how to fasten a seatbelt?"

Seeing that she hadn't moved, he leaned over and buckled it for her.

Watching him, Xia Shiyu felt warmth bloom in her chest. But then she thought of Lin Xiaowan, and confusion set in again.

She genuinely couldn't figure out what Su Lin was after anymore.

Looking at his hands—long-fingered, elegant—she felt a strange tingling where he'd swatted her earlier.

"Su Lin... this isn't the way to the hospital."

Su Lin glanced at her. "It's past ten. What are you going to do at the hospital—wake up your dad? Wake up all the other patients?"

"Well, this isn't the way to my house either."

"I've never been to your house," Su Lin said flatly. "How would I know the way?"

"Then where are we going?"

"Home. My home."

"Wha—?!"

"What's with that reaction? We're both minors. It's not like I'm going to check us into a hotel." Su Lin looked at her like she'd lost her mind.

"But... you could just take me home," Xia Shiyu murmured.

"Shiyu, you're mumbling. Speak up—I can't hear you."

Xia Shiyu looked at his face and found herself unable to repeat what she'd said. All she could manage was: "What if your father sees us?"

Su Lin sighed. "I've been living alone for who knows how long. In the past year, my dad's been home maybe a handful of days. Relax—nobody's there."

"Nobody?!"

"What's that look supposed to mean? You think I'm going to do something to you?" Su Lin scowled.

"No, no! I just..."

"Alright, alright. We have business to take care of when we get there. Stop talking—we're almost home."

Xia Shiyu had barely processed his words before a row of luxury villas came into view.

At the gated entrance, she stared at the sign for Jiangning Huating in a daze.

She'd never lived in a villa, but she'd certainly heard of the most expensive residential complex in Zhongjiang.

"We're here."

"Get out."

"Oh."

Xia Shiyu gazed at the sprawling three-story villa and thought: 'Well, I'm already here. Might as well stay the night.'

She wasn't worried about Su Lin doing anything untoward. After all, they'd known each other for a while, and aside from the "accidental" swat earlier, he'd always been a perfect gentleman.

Inside the villa, Su Lin told her to wait in the living room while he went upstairs.

Xia Shiyu's heart pounded. She had no idea what he was up to.

Just as her anxiety was about to spill over into calling out for him, Su Lin came back downstairs.

"It's so late—Su Lin, what do you need a pen and paper for?"

"What else? Writing up an IOU. And a contract."

"An IOU? A contract?"

"Obviously. You still want to get your dad's surgery done, don't you?"

"The IOU is for the money you're borrowing from me. The contract is for the time you'll be working for me. Pretty simple, right?" Su Lin raised an eyebrow.

Xia Shiyu nodded. "But... how would I work for you?"

"Read the contract and you'll see. And let me be clear—this is entirely voluntary. Sign it if you want to. Don't if you don't."
