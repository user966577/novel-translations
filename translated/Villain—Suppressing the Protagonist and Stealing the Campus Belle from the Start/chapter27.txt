Su Lin was at home doing homework when a voice suddenly rang out in his mind.

**[Ding! Congratulations, Host. Activation conditions met. The Super Villain System is now online.]**

**[Ding! Congratulations, Host. You have received a Welcome Gift Package. Would you like to open it?]**

"Open."

**[Ding! Congratulations, Host. Skill acquired: Photographic Memory.]**

**[Ding! Congratulations, Host. Skill acquired: Bajiquan (Grandmaster Level).]**

**[Ding! Congratulations, Host. Skill acquired: Appraisal (reveals basic information and affinity ratings).]**

**[Ding! Due to the Host's suppression of the protagonist, Ye Feng's memory enhancement has been reduced by 10%. His past-life memories have been reduced by 10%.]**

**[Ding! Congratulations, Host. Full-body physical enhancement complete.]**

It took Su Lin a full twenty minutes to process all the changes the system had wrought.

The physical enhancement was immediately apparent. His soft midsection had been replaced by a chiseled eight-pack.

Bajiquan came to him as naturally as breathing—Double Cannon, Tiger Pounce, Iron Mountain, Half-Step Collapsing Fist—every technique felt like it had been carved into his bones, mastered through a lifetime of practice.

"System, you there?"

**[Present, Host.]**

"I need to know—is this world purely a rebirth-novel world, or is it a composite of multiple novels?"

Having read plenty of villain-protagonist stories, Su Lin knew all too well that a run-of-the-mill reborn protagonist like Ye Feng was the lowest tier of threat.

If a returning war god, a divine physician descending from the mountains, or a reincarnated immortal showed up—that would be a real problem.

**[Host, this is an evolving world that is continuously developing and expanding. The possibility of future merges with other novel worlds cannot be ruled out.]**

"Uh..."

"I was *just* celebrating having actual combat skills, and you hit me with *that*?"

**[Host, rather than worrying about hypotheticals, I suggest you focus on suppressing the protagonist and acquiring more abilities.]**

"Fair point. Alright, what's on the task list?"

**[The Super Villain System has one standing directive: suppress the protagonist through strategic planning, win over the heroines, and alter the original plot. Every successful suppression, heroine capture, or plot deviation will be rewarded accordingly.]**

Meanwhile, at the internet cafe, Ye Feng felt a sudden chill run through him—as if something had been taken away, though he couldn't identify what.

*Huh. That was weird. Whatever—need to focus on liquidating this inventory. The sooner I stop the bleeding, the better.*

He'd pieced together the situation. His arrival in this world had triggered butterfly effects across the board, and the Destiny Necklace debacle was one of the bigger ones.

All he could do now was regret not selling earlier.

He remained completely unaware that certain memories were slowly growing fuzzier around the edges.

*If I'd sold last night, I'd have tens of thousands of dollars right now. Damn it.*

*Nothing I can do now but play the long game.*

*As for Shiyu... I'll let her cool down first.*

What Ye Feng didn't know was that Xia Shiyu had already written him off completely.

She wandered the streets alone, cursing herself for believing a few pretty words and handing over the money to buy video game items.

She wanted to slap herself.

She had no idea how to face Su Lin.

At the thought of Su Lin, warmth spread through her chest—the last bit of warmth she had left in the world.

Su Lin was in his villa's courtyard, working through a set of Bajiquan forms.

"If I put everything into a punch, I could probably kill a bull. Grandmaster-level Bajiquan is absolutely terrifying."

His phone rang mid-thought.

"Hello? Shiyu."

"Su Lin!"

Hearing the tears in her voice, Su Lin knew the outcome had arrived.

The money she'd lent Ye Feng had gone up in smoke.

"Shiyu, what's wrong?"

"I... I don't know how to say it. I... I need to see you."

Her voice cracked the moment she heard his—warm, steady, safe. Her body trembled, and the tears she'd been holding back broke free.

"Where are you? I'll come to you."

"I'm..."

"Tell me when I get there. Okay?"

Once Xia Shiyu gave him the location, Su Lin walked into the garage and drove out of the villa complex.

Liu Yong had already clocked out for the night, so Su Lin was behind the wheel himself.

Fifteen minutes later, he spotted her on the Zhongjiang Coastal Road.

Xia Shiyu sat on a stone bench by the river, small and alone—a wounded creature with nowhere to turn.

Su Lin parked the car and walked over.

"Shiyu."

"Su Lin! You're finally here." She threw herself into his arms, holding on for dear life.

Su Lin patted her back gently, letting her cry it out.

A long time passed before the sobs subsided.

When she came back to herself, Xia Shiyu realized she didn't dare look up.

Somehow, at some point, Su Lin had sat down on the bench. She was clinging to his neck, her face buried in his chest.

She'd been too lost in grief to notice before. Now, each breath brought his scent rushing in—warm, unmistakably masculine, threaded with something that made her limbs feel heavy and boneless.

Xia Shiyu kept her face pressed to his chest and murmured, "Su Lin... I did something terrible."

Su Lin held her steady, one hand resting on her back, a small smile playing at the corner of his mouth. "Oh? Tell me."

"I took the money you donated and..."

In a halting whisper, she told him everything—the past few days, Ye Feng's scheme, the necklaces, the crash, all of it.

These had been the most suffocating days of her life. Even when her father was first diagnosed and she'd had no money and no hope, the pressure hadn't been this crushing.

"You're not angry with me, are you? That was $11,400."

Su Lin laughed softly. "I gave it to you. What you do with it is your business. The investment failed—that's a judgment call, not a crime."

"But Shiyu... you're still treating Xiaowan and me like outsiders. Ye Feng says a few words and you're convinced, but you won't trust that I can help you?"

As he said this, his hand drifted down and gave her backside a light, playful swat.

"Eep!"

"Su Lin... you—you're bullying me!"

"Shiyu, would you believe me if I said my hand slipped?"

Su Lin had originally planned to take things slowly with both Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan—a gradual, natural progression.

But learning that this world might eventually merge with other novels had injected a sense of urgency. If war gods, dragon kings, and reincarnated immortals were going to start crawling out of the woodwork, he needed to be ready.

Time to pick up the pace. More suppression, more rewards.

He casually cast Appraisal on Xia Shiyu.
