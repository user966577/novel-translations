Xia Shiyu got in the car, and Lin Xiaowan moved to sit in the back with her.

She patted Su Lin's seat. "Su Lin, now you can tell us. What exactly are you planning?"

Su Lin's lips curved slightly. "Xiaowan, remember the proposal I made before?"

"You mean the one about starting a business together?"

Su Lin nodded. "I've found a project. Supermarket chains!"

"Supermarket chains? Like Walmart?" Lin Xiaowan exclaimed.

She hadn't expected Su Lin to think so big—going straight for supermarket chains.

This wasn't something you could pull off with a twenty-eighty split.

Su Lin nodded. "That's right. That kind of supermarket chain model."

Su Lin slowed the car down and began explaining his vision for the chain supermarket.

By the time he finished, both Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu had fallen silent.

Su Lin's plan was remarkably comprehensive. He'd thought through every aspect of running a supermarket.

After digesting his information, Lin Xiaowan finally asked, "Su Lin, what would Xiaoyu and I do? We're just high school students. Other than decent grades, we don't really have any special skills."

Su Lin shook his head. "No, you have no idea how much potential you both have."

"Setting everything else aside, Xiaowan's abilities are obvious. Your logical thinking is clear and sharp. You're good at taking the initiative, skilled at using language strategically. If we open a supermarket, sending you to negotiate with suppliers should work out perfectly."

"The products suppliers provide are one of the main factors determining whether a supermarket survives. If someone else controls that resource, it's like having a hand around our throat. So Xiaowan, if you're joining us, I think handling suppliers would be the best fit for you."

"As for Xiaoyu—Xiaoyu is great at budgeting, making sure every yuan is spent wisely without any waste. So having Xiaoyu manage finances is a natural choice."

"What about supermarket management, then? Su Lin, you're not planning to do that yourself, are you?" Lin Xiaowan looked at him.

Su Lin smiled. "Management isn't something I'll handle personally. Someone else is better suited for it."

"Someone better suited? Who?"

"Someone you both know. Chen Yang, from our class. Though he might not be great at market expansion—just managing operations."

"Oh, Chen Yang... Su Lin, if you hadn't mentioned him, I wouldn't have even thought of him."

"Yeah, Chen Yang doesn't have much presence in class. But now that I think about it, I haven't seen him going to the cafeteria for dinner lately." Xia Shiyu recalled.

"Skipping the cafeteria? Su Lin, that must be your doing, right?" Lin Xiaowan looked at him with a knowing smile.

Su Lin nodded. "Chen Yang's made quite a bit of money working with me. He can support his whole family's expenses now, so he doesn't need to eat cafeteria food anymore."

"Tsk tsk... Su Lin, stop being modest. Even the best horse needs a rider who recognizes its worth. Without you, Chen Yang would probably still be eating cold leftovers in the cafeteria."

"What other good deeds have you done in our class?"

Su Lin waved his hands. "Nothing else. Really, nothing else."

"Su Lin, what would you be doing?" Xia Shiyu asked.

"Yeah, Su Lin, what would you be doing?" Lin Xiaowan chimed in.

Seeing both girls looking at him, Su Lin smiled. "I'll be overseeing the big picture and coordinating everything, of course."

"Hmph! Sounds like you'd be doing nothing at all." Lin Xiaowan rolled her eyes.

"How is that doing nothing? Xiaowan, do you know how to negotiate with suppliers? Does Xiaoyu know how to organize finances? Does Chen Yang know how to manage a company? None of you do. Without someone coordinating everything, the supermarket would close within three days of opening."

Lin Xiaowan felt like something was off about Su Lin's logic, but when she thought about it, he did seem to have a point.

What Su Lin was actually planning, however, was to be a hands-off boss.

In the original novel, Ye Feng would start one company here, another company there, then dump everything on Xia Shiyu—and she'd manage it all flawlessly.

Moreover, Xia Shiyu had started from knowing nothing at all.

So Su Lin wasn't worried about their abilities at all. If anything, he was worried about himself not growing fast enough to keep up with them.

"Aren't you worried Xiaoyu and I will run your company into the ground?"

Su Lin laughed. "Even if you did, so what? I have enough resources to let you fail and learn."

"That said, I believe you both have what it takes to handle these roles."

Xia Shiyu was hesitant. She shook her head. "Su Lin, I don't think I can do it. Xiaowan has at least been a class officer since she was little—she has management experience. I'm different. I've never managed anyone before, let alone finances."

"Xiaoyu, don't try to back out now. Don't forget—you already signed a contract with me." Su Lin smiled mischievously.

"Ah!"

"Don't worry. I'll be supervising from the sidelines."

Then Su Lin turned to Lin Xiaowan. "Xiaowan, what do you say?"

Lin Xiaowan flashed him a smile. "Something this interesting? Of course I'm in. How could a startup happen without me?"

"What about you, Xiaoyu?"

"Hehe, Su Lin, you already said it—I signed a contract with you. Don't worry. I'll do my best to track every yuan coming in and going out. I won't let anyone waste your money carelessly."

"Great! Then let's go scout for locations right now."

After parking, Su Lin walked through the streets with Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan.

Now that they'd agreed to Su Lin's proposal, both girls began surveying their surroundings seriously.

A supermarket chain needed not just a good location but also enough space and high foot traffic. Finding the right property wouldn't be easy.

"Su Lin, you've already thought about where to open the first store in Jiangning District, haven't you?"

Su Lin nodded. "I have a couple of spots in mind. I've even identified the buildings. But there's a problem—those buildings are owner-occupied residential properties. Hard to buy."

"Oh! You're planning to buy outright?"

"Of course. If we rent, what happens when the landlord raises the price after a good first year? Better to own the property. That saves a lot of money in the long run, and it makes getting loans easier too."

"Loans? Su Lin, don't you already have over ten million yuan? Why would you need loans?"

Su Lin smiled. "Xiaowan, you think my ten million plus is a lot? Once a supermarket chain starts expanding, it grows explosively. We might have multiple stores—maybe ten or more—opening simultaneously. You think ten million would be enough?"

"And that's assuming everything goes smoothly. If someone sees our supermarket making money and decides to open their own, we'd have to wage price wars. At that point, ten million wouldn't last a single day."

"Hmm... that does sound exciting." Lin Xiaowan's eyes sparkled with anticipation.

"Heh. And that's just healthy competition. What about cutthroat competition?"

"This... is opening a supermarket really that dangerous?" Xia Shiyu asked in surprise.

"Definitely. But we don't need to worry about that for now."

"Hmm, Su Lin, which building were you looking at? Let me try negotiating. Maybe I can get it done. If I can, it'll save us a lot of trouble." Lin Xiaowan said eagerly.
