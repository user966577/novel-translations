Whatever Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu discussed outside, Su Lin had no idea. But when he saw them walk back into the classroom arm-in-arm like long-lost sisters, he knew he was one step closer to that ultimate goal.

Seeing Lin Xiaowan sit down beside him, Su Lin grinned. "Xiaowan, told you I wasn't wrong."

"Just eat your breakfast already—it's getting cold."

Su Lin chuckled. "Haven't started yet. Want to share?"

"No thanks, I already ate. Hurry up."

"Fine, let me eat then."

Just as he picked up his food, he spotted Ye Feng walking into the classroom clutching his stomach.

This time, Ye Feng was genuinely afraid. That knee strike from Su Lin had been devastating—it took him a full twenty minutes just to recover enough to stand.

He could see it in Su Lin's eyes. Su Lin would actually follow through on his threats.

In his past life, Ye Feng had just been a nobody office worker. He'd never weathered any real storms. And in this life, setback after setback had already ground down the ambition he'd felt when he first came back.

Su Lin glanced at Ye Feng once, then looked away.

If Ye Feng had taken his warning to heart, fine. If not, Su Lin wouldn't hesitate to teach him a lesson he'd never forget.

...

Over the next stretch of time, Su Lin settled into a busy three-point routine—home, school, and the supermarket.

Chen Yang took three days off and recruited a solid crew. The supermarket renovations were well underway.

Su Lin, Lin Xiaowan, and Xia Shiyu pitched in at the supermarket whenever they had time. This was their first business venture together, and all three took it seriously.

Before they knew it, mid-April had arrived.

The supermarket's exterior was finished, and the interior work was progressing at full speed.

Su Lin gathered Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan together.

"Shiyu, Xiaowan, the supermarket will be done in ten days max. Just realized we forgot something important."

"Huh? What else is there? I've already signed contracts with all the suppliers," Lin Xiaowan said.

"And the finances are fine on my end. Sister Xiaojuan is a professional accountant—every transaction is documented," Xia Shiyu added.

Su Lin shook his head. "Not that. I'm talking about the supermarket's name. We still haven't picked one."

"Oh!"

"Right, we never named the supermarket."

"Isn't it Yulin?" Xia Shiyu said, a bit naively.

Lin Xiaowan smiled. "Shiyu, that's the company name we registered. Not the store name."

"Oh! I see now."

Su Lin laughed. "Actually, it's not a bad idea. Yulin Chain Supermarket—has a decent ring to it."

"How does 'Yulin' go with 'supermarket'? Su Lin, let's pick something more conventional. Look at those foreign chains—Walmart, Carrefour, RT-Mart. We don't need to copy them, but a good name is easy to remember."

Su Lin nodded. "True. The name should roll off the tongue, be easy to remember, and ideally include 'chain supermarket' for that premium feel."

"So, do you have a name in mind?"

"How about Joy Mart? I think it's pretty good." Su Lin suggested.

"Joy Mart—as in everything's available and everyone's happy shopping?" Lin Xiaowan instantly grasped the concept.

Su Lin nodded. "Exactly."

"Let's go with that. It's catchy and easy to remember."

"What do you think, Shiyu?" Su Lin turned to Xia Shiyu.

"I like it too!"

"Alright, Joy Mart it is. When we expand to Shanghai and Beijing, we'll crush Carrefour and Walmart."

"Pfft, get the Zhongjiang location up and running first before you start dreaming about Shanghai."

"What? Other people can expand to Shanghai but I can't? Xiaowan, make sure you give your suppliers a heads-up—they need to start delivering early. I want us open by May Day."

Turning to business, Lin Xiaowan dropped the teasing. "Relax, contracts are signed. My end's solid. The only worry is whether the renovations finish in time."
