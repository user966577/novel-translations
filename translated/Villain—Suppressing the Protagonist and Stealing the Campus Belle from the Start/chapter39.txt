Ye Feng knew he had to convince his father. Without that 100,000 yuan, he couldn't repay the debt—and if he didn't pay up, Su Lin would absolutely go to the police. That could derail his college entrance exams. The money had to be returned.

"Dad, here's the thing..."

After a torrent of persuasion, Ye Weimin reluctantly agreed to let Ye Feng take the money. He muttered that his son had grown up and become impossible to understand.

**[Ding! Congratulations, Host. By intercepting the gastrodia trade, you have successfully prevented the protagonist Ye Feng from acquiring his first fortune. Reward: One Emperor's Lucky Draw.]**

**[Ding! Due to the Host's interception of the protagonist's gastrodia scheme, protagonist Ye Feng's memory enhancement has been reduced by 10%. His past-life memories have been reduced by 10%.]**

Ye Feng had been feeling good about getting the 100,000 yuan, but then his head throbbed—a now-familiar sensation.

Something had happened, and something had been lost. Some memories were now irretrievably blurry, while others had simply vanished.

'Draw!'

The familiar battered treasure chest tumbled through Su Lin's mind, then split open.

**[Ding! Congratulations, Host. You have received: Prank Snake x1. (Stored in System Space.)]**

**[Ding! Congratulations, Host. System Space unlocked. (Capacity: 100 cubic meters.)]**

Su Lin: "..."

He materialized the prank snake. The hyper-realistic rubber toy writhed in his hand—it could waggle, raise its head, and even flick a forked tongue.

System quality, indeed. Premium craftsmanship.

Toss one of these into a girls' dormitory and you'd have a building-wide meltdown.

But for Su Lin personally? Utterly useless.

'At least the System Space is good. Without that, what would I even do with a rubber snake?'

A hundred cubic meters was nothing to sneeze at. You could store a ton of stuff in there.

Su Lin mused that if he ever went broke, he could use the System Space to run a courier service. Guaranteed profit.

The system, somewhere in the ether, seethed in silence.

'The System Space is NOT for running a delivery business!'

Su Lin played with the snake for a few seconds—the thing was genuinely creepy-looking, wriggling and moving like the real deal—then lost interest and tossed it into the System Space.

Another night passed. Su Lin was up early again.

He'd noticed that since his physical enhancement, he only needed four or five hours of sleep to feel completely refreshed.

At school, Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan had arrived before him. With the monthly exam looming, both girls were deep in their textbooks and didn't notice his arrival.

Su Lin slipped into his seat. The familiar pink thermal box was already waiting on his desk.

He opened it. Same meticulous presentation, different artistic theme.

More fruit today—jujubes, cherry tomatoes, and more.

He was about to dig in when he felt someone's gaze on him.

Turning, he found Lin Xiaowan watching him with expectant eyes fixed squarely on the lunch box.

Su Lin was about to say something when she beat him to it. "I... came early this morning. Skipped breakfast."

"..."

Su Lin processed this, then pushed the thermal box toward her. "Want to share?"

"Sure!" Lin Xiaowan flashed him a brilliant smile.

Su Lin blinked. He hadn't expected her to be such a foodie.

'This definitely wasn't in the novel.'

Lin Xiaowan accepted his offer and abandoned her book, moving to sit beside him.

She examined the box with admiration. "Shiyu really goes above and beyond. Everything's so pretty, and it tastes incredible."

She popped a cherry tomato into her mouth and closed her eyes blissfully.

Su Lin: "..."

"That's a tomato. With no seasoning. How exactly is the 'taste incredible'?"

Caught out by his teasing, Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "You wouldn't understand."

"Fine. Give me back the box—I need to actually eat."

"We split it fifty-fifty." Lin Xiaowan said this with absolute conviction.

"Fifty-fifty? The box doesn't come apart."

"No problem. I brought my own bowl."

"Good grief. You came prepared."

"Hehe!"

What Su Lin didn't know was that Lin Xiaowan rarely ate well at home.

Lin Guoqiang—second-in-command of Zhongjiang, the deputy mayor—worked himself into the ground and never cooked. Wang Xiaoqian occasionally made dinner, but she was usually swamped at her trading company.

Lin Xiaowan mostly survived on school cafeteria food. The occasional restaurant meal was fine, but it couldn't hold a candle to the lovingly prepared breakfast Xia Shiyu made.

"Shiyu's cooking is unbelievable. Some lucky guy is going to marry her someday and hit the jackpot." Lin Xiaowan sighed as she ate. "Wouldn't it be great if we all went to the same college? I'd rent a place off-campus and make Shiyu cook every day."

Su Lin nodded with mock solemnity. "Indeed. Can't imagine who that lucky man will be."

"If only. I wish I could move in with her and have this every morning."

"She'd be your personal chef at that point," Su Lin pointed out.

"Hehe, a chef that pretty? Where else would you find one?"

As they chatted, Ye Feng walked in. Once again, he made straight for Xia Shiyu.

"Shiyu... can we talk outside?"

Xia Shiyu looked up with a flash of disgust, then went cold. She didn't stand up. "I'm here to return the money."

Xia Shiyu's eyes widened briefly, then flattened. "Give it to Su Lin."

"I borrowed it from you, not him."

Xia Shiyu extended her palm. "There's nobody else around. Hand it over."

Ye Feng had a dozen things he wanted to say, but she wouldn't step outside with him. Left with no choice, he pulled out the 80,000 yuan he'd prepared and placed it on her desk.

Xia Shiyu scooped up the money, stood, and walked over to Su Lin. She set the cash on his desk. "Ye Feng returned the money."

Su Lin nodded. "Good. He had to."

"Shiyu, you should keep this. Uncle Xia will still need ongoing medical care after the surgery, and hospital stays aren't cheap."

Xia Shiyu shook her head firmly. "No. This was your money to begin with."

Su Lin smiled. "It was donated to you. That makes it yours."

"But—"

Lin Xiaowan cut in. "Shiyu, just take it. Su Lin's right—after a transplant, you'll need to keep going back to the hospital for at least six months. Do you have any money saved? Without it, how will Uncle Xia get follow-up care?"

Su Lin looked at her with mild surprise. "When did you learn about transplant recovery?"

Lin Xiaowan lifted her chin. "You think you're the only one who reads? I can read too."

"Heh."

"What's funny? Those books aren't hard to find."

Su Lin nodded. "I'm just surprised by how competitive you are."

"..."

Ye Feng watched the three of them chatting and laughing, standing there like a ghost at the feast.

He didn't understand how everything had gone so wrong, so fast.

Looking at the genuine joy on Xia Shiyu's face, he felt with growing certainty that the two of them were like two lines that had already crossed their intersection point.

From here, they would only grow further apart.

He desperately wanted to hold on to what was slipping away, but no matter how hard he reached, he grasped only air.

And looking at Su Lin—relaxed, confident, bantering with the two most beautiful girls in school—all Ye Feng felt was hatred.

This was all Su Lin's fault. He'd ruined everything between them.
