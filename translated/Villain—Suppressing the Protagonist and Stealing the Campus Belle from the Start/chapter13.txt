Fifteen minutes later, Lin Xiaowan had laid out the full story—the 200,000 yuan, its origin, and every detail of her agreement with Su Lin.

"That's everything, Mom. And remember—you promised not to tell anyone."

Wang Xiaoqian was genuinely surprised. For a seventeen-year-old boy to think this far ahead was remarkable.

Donating 200,000 yuan wasn't extraordinary in itself. Zhongjiang had plenty of wealthy philanthropists who gave generously every year.

But donating that much while refusing any credit—and going out of his way to protect the recipient's reputation? A person like that was either profoundly good or profoundly dangerous.

"This Su Lin you mentioned—is he Su Zhenguo's son?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "Yes. We've had dinner with them before. Don't tell me you forgot."

"How could I forget? I remember that boy staring at you the entire meal."

Lin Xiaowan's cheeks flushed crimson. "Mom! What are you even saying!"

Seeing her daughter's reaction, Wang Xiaoqian knew exactly what was happening. Her little girl's heart was stirring. "So, sweetie—what do you think of this Su Lin?"

Lin Xiaowan didn't realize her mother was gathering intelligence.

She thought for a moment, then frowned. "Su Lin... I honestly don't know how to describe him. He's changed a lot. Everything I thought I knew about him turned out to be wrong."

"Oh? What did you used to think of him?"

"In a nutshell: treats everyone above him equally, treats everyone below him like dirt. He's always been dismissive of students from modest families—wouldn't give them the time of day. Talks like he owns the world. Outside of a handful of people, nobody registers in his eyes. Blindly arrogant."

"And now?"

"Now I'm not sure."

"Tell me more. Mom can help you figure it out."

With zero suspicion, Lin Xiaowan launched into everything Su Lin had shared with her that day.

"..."

"Mom, don't you think Su Lin is really tragic? He's done so much for people, and nobody knows. Today everyone was laughing at him, and he didn't even flinch. You have no idea how awful the things they said were. I can't even imagine how he's survived the past two years like that."

Wang Xiaoqian rolled her eyes at her daughter. "Well, he's got you standing up for him now, doesn't he?"

"What good is just me standing up for him?"

*Just you is more than enough. He doesn't care what anyone else thinks—only what you think.* Wang Xiaoqian kept that observation firmly to herself.

She was starting to realize that being overprotective of Lin Xiaowan all these years might not have been entirely beneficial.

As a woman of experience, she could see it crystal clear. This was Su Lin launching his campaign to win Lin Xiaowan's heart.

First, the donation to reshape her perception. Then, the tragic backstory to earn her sympathy. And finally, the secret binding them together, creating a private bond between them.

The kid was playing chess. And he was several moves ahead.

Looking at her daughter's sympathetic expression, Wang Xiaoqian wanted nothing more than to rip the veil away and show her Su Lin's true game.

But she knew that would only backfire.

Though she felt she might be reading too much into it, everything Su Lin had done today pointed to someone who absolutely could not be underestimated as an ordinary high schooler.

Gazing at her oblivious daughter, Wang Xiaoqian sighed inwardly. *Thank God his feelings for her are real. Otherwise, this girl would be sold and help count the money.*

Her mind flashed back to the dinner with Su Lin and his father. She was certain—Su Lin's feelings for Lin Xiaowan were genuine.

"Mom, is there anything I can do to help Su Lin?"

Wang Xiaoqian stroked her daughter's hair. "Help? How? Tell the truth? Unless you want to ruin things for Xia Shiyu, the rumors would drown all three of you."

"Try some other approach, and I doubt Su Lin would even appreciate it."

"Oh..."

"Sweetheart, just stay out of it. The exam is right around the corner. I'm sure Su Lin doesn't want to be the center of attention either."

"I... fine."

"Good girl. Go do your homework. Mom won't bother you anymore."

"Okay..."

The moment Wang Xiaoqian left, Lin Xiaowan sprang up, shut the door, and locked it.

Hearing the lock click, Wang Xiaoqian paused, then worry creased her face.

This Su Lin was too smooth. One play after another, each building on the last. Her daughter was completely outmatched.

She needed to think of something before the girl fell in too deep.

*"Su Lin, I'm sorry."*

*"?"*

*"What happened, Xiaowan?"*

*"Teacher Wang called my parents to thank them for the donation. Then Mom came to talk to me. I told her about you donating the money."*

Lin Xiaowan sent the message and then covered her eyes, too afraid to look at the screen.

She'd promised Su Lin to keep the secret, and here she was, confessing to her parents on the very first day.

*"Ha, it's fine. What's done is done."*

*"But... won't Teacher Wang find out too?"*

*"Relax. Even if he does, he'll keep it quiet. But honestly, I doubt your parents told him. They probably just wanted to understand what happened. And to be honest, I never planned to hide this from your parents. Something this big—if they didn't get to the bottom of it, they'd lose sleep over it."*

At that moment, in the Jiangning Huating villa district, Su Lin was grinning to himself.

He'd anticipated every possible outcome before asking Lin Xiaowan to donate the money.

Her parents had been the very first variable he'd accounted for.

To earn respect, you had to demonstrate capability.

Su Lin's family was well-off, but still a tier below the Lins. Right now, his strategy was simple: stay on the radar and showcase his ability in front of Lin Guoqiang whenever possible.

The more he demonstrated, the more Lin Guoqiang would realize: *this Su Lin kid is actually something.*

That would dramatically reduce the resistance to being with Lin Xiaowan.

In the original novel, the original Su Lin spent over a thousand chapters without fully winning Lin Xiaowan over. A huge part of that was the Lin family's opposition.

Lin Guoqiang, in particular, was the textbook definition of a doting father. Earning his approval was a Herculean task.

But Su Lin wasn't fazed. The original Ye Feng's failure came down to the author's poor writing.

Over a thousand chapters, Ye Feng had collected an absurd number of love interests. A woman of Lin Xiaowan's caliber might have feelings, but her family would never accept it.

In other words, the author had written himself into a corner.

Su Lin wouldn't make the same mistake. He was the villain, after all. Villains didn't play by the same rules.

Strike when the iron's hot.

When the moment comes, don't hesitate.

None of that holding-her-all-night-and-doing-nothing nonsense. That wasn't his style.
