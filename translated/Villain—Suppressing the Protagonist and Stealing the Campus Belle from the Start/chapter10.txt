Around the same time, Lin Xiaowan arrived home at the Zhongjiang Government Residential Complex.

Every resident here was either a government official or a political figure.

She'd been lost in thought the whole way back, processing the day's events.

Not much had happened, objectively, but it had rocked her worldview. Su Lin's actions had completely rewritten how she saw him.

Seeing her come through the door, her father Lin Guoqiang set down his newspaper with a warm smile. "Hey, sweetheart. How was school today?"

"..."

Watching his daughter walk absentmindedly toward her bedroom without a word, Lin Guoqiang exchanged a look with his wife Wang Xiaoqian. "What's going on? She seems out of it."

Wang Xiaoqian stared at the closed bedroom door, thinking hard.

After a long pause, she turned to her husband. "Do you think our daughter might have a boyfriend?"

Lin Guoqiang shot out of his chair. "What? Xiaowan has a 'boyfriend'?"

"Keep your voice down! I'm just speculating. She's about to turn eighteen. At that age, it'd be perfectly normal to have a crush on someone." Wang Xiaoqian's analysis was calm and measured.

"Normal? What's normal about it? She's only seventeen! And even if she were eighteen, her priority right now is studying!"

"Would you stop yelling? You want her to hear you?"

"Hmph! If I ever find out who it is, I'll whip the kid with my belt."

"We don't even know if it's true yet. Calm down. Go set the table. I'll go talk to her—gently—and feel things out." Wang Xiaoqian gave Lin Guoqiang's side a firm pinch.

"Ow! Easy, dear!"

"..."

Wang Xiaoqian knocked on Lin Xiaowan's door. "Sweetie, can I come in?"

"Sure."

She opened the door to find Lin Xiaowan sitting with a pen in hand, staring blankly at her textbook. Even if this wasn't about a boyfriend, something was definitely going on.

"What's the matter, honey? Something bothering you? Want to talk to Mom about it?"

"Mom, I'm fine."

'It's written all over your face', Wang Xiaoqian thought, though she kept that to herself.

Instead, she coaxed, "It's just us two in here. You know how good I am at keeping secrets. Whatever it is, maybe I can help."

Lin Xiaowan's resolve wavered. She was on the verge of spilling everything.

But then she remembered her promise to Su Lin. She'd already broken it once by telling Xia Shiyu. If she told her mother too, her word would mean nothing.

She shook her head. "Mom, I'm just a little frustrated. It's nothing."

"Is that so? Well, get yourself together and come eat, okay?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded.

Her brow remained furrowed.

What she desperately needed right now was someone to unload on about everything that had happened today. But she couldn't say a word, and the pressure was suffocating.

Wang Xiaoqian's expression darkened.

She knew her daughter. If something minor were bothering her, a little prodding would have it all spilling out.

But today was different. Her usual approach hadn't worked at all.

Whatever this was, it was either about a boy or something even bigger.

She left the room and headed straight for the kitchen.

"Your daughter's growing up. She's learned to keep secrets. Won't tell me a thing." Wang Xiaoqian huffed, equal parts frustrated and wounded.

Lin Guoqiang was briefly amused that his wife had been shut out, but quickly sobered. "Didn't get anything out of her?"

"She kicked me out before I even got started."

"Hoo... she's not actually dating someone, is she?"

"Should we find out?"

Lin Guoqiang nodded. "We should, but not right now. After dinner, I'll call Teacher Wang. Even if he doesn't know the full story, he'll have some idea of what's going on."

"And if our daughter really is seeing someone?"

"How should I know? Force them apart? Sabotage it? Let it run its course?"

"Well, letting it run its course is definitely not an option. She's seventeen! She doesn't know the first thing about love. She's obviously being tricked." Lin Guoqiang spoke through clenched teeth.

Wang Xiaoqian nodded, a steely glint in her eyes.

If someone was deceiving her daughter, she'd make them regret it.

Meanwhile, Su Lin had no idea that Lin Xiaowan's slightly off behavior had already mobilized both her parents.

Not that he would've cared.

Given Lin Guoqiang and Wang Xiaoqian's resources, trying to hide things from them was a losing game anyway.

"Boss, I just picked up another 120 necklaces. Want me to mail them over?"

Su Lin nodded. "Send them all."

"Oh, and about that spending money I gave you earlier—if you're interested, buy some necklaces for yourself too. You can ride the wave when prices go up."

"Prices going up? You mean these necklaces are going to be worth more?" Chen Yang's eyes went wide.

"Obviously. Why else would I be stockpiling them?"

"But how do you know something like that?"

Chen Yang was tempted. But he worried the necklaces wouldn't appreciate—and if they didn't, he'd be wiped out.

He wasn't like Su Lin, who could throw around tens of thousands without blinking. His few thousand had to cover his whole family.

"I have my sources. For now, just focus on finding more buyers. And remember what I told you about the other thing."

Chen Yang nodded. "I've got it all memorized. I just don't understand—why do you want them signing up for so many forum accounts?"

Su Lin gave a cryptic smile. "You'll find out soon enough."

"Alright."

Seeing that Su Lin wasn't going to elaborate, Chen Yang didn't push further. If Su Lin wanted to share, he would. If not, Chen Yang wouldn't pry.

Su Lin clapped him on the shoulder. "I know you can't afford to lose. But you've got me to back you up, don't you? I'll cover any losses."

Chen Yang's heart stirred, but ultimately he shook his head. "Boss, this is your play. I don't know how you know these necklaces will go up, but if you're this confident, they probably will."

"You've already done so much for me. I can't take a cut of your business on top of everything else. So I'll pass."

Su Lin chuckled. He'd figured Chen Yang would decline—just not for this reason.

"Alright. Get your buyers lined up and head home. Your family's waiting for dinner."

"Yeah."

Su Lin patted Chen Yang's shoulder once more, then walked out of the private room.
