Su Lin fell silent after hearing her explanation.

Across two lifetimes, he'd never experienced anything like what Xia Shiyu described.

Even in his previous life, when things hadn't been great, food had never been an issue.

He pushed the dishes toward her. "Then you'd better eat up. Look at you—only five-four. Eat more and maybe you'll grow a little taller."

"Pfft! Five-four isn't short for a girl!"

"Heh."

Seeing Xia Shiyu's transformed demeanor—so different from the withdrawn, burdened girl she'd been—Su Lin felt genuinely pleased.

This was the real Xia Shiyu.

Her father's illness had been crushing her, suffocating her until she couldn't breathe.

Now that Su Lin had lifted that burden, she was finally free to be herself.

As he ate, Su Lin remarked casually, "Your cooking is so good, Shiyu—you should bring me breakfast every morning from now on."

Xia Shiyu didn't hesitate. "Every morning? You want me to bring it to school?"

Su Lin nodded. "Of course. Starting today, you're one of my people. I don't have any real assignments for you right now, so bringing breakfast counts as work. How about it—not up for it?"

"Hehe, such easy work? Why wouldn't I be up for it?"

"Then it's settled."

"Deal!"

Just then, Su Lin's phone rang.

It was Chen Yang. Su Lin was mildly surprised.

Chen Yang wouldn't call unless something was actually going on.

Su Lin got up and patted Xia Shiyu's head. "Finish eating and clean up. I need to take a call."

"Okay!"

Xia Shiyu had fully settled into her role. After last night, she and Su Lin had grown much more comfortable around each other.

"What's up, Yang? Calling me this early on a weekend?"

"Boss, nothing major. Just wanted to check if you had anything for me to do today. If not, I'm heading out to the countryside with Ye Feng."

Su Lin's eyebrow twitched.

The countryside?

Looked like Ye Feng had found another path to his first fortune.

Made sense. A reborn person had far too much insider knowledge. The novel had only mentioned the equipment-hoarding scheme explicitly, but there had to be other plays available.

Su Lin silently counted his blessings. If Ye Feng hadn't recruited Chen Yang, this next scheme might have actually succeeded.

"What are you going to the countryside for this early?"

"He says we're going to buy up herbal medicine. He can't handle it alone, so he wants me to help carry stuff."

Su Lin's eyes lit up with understanding.

Medicinal herbs that were dirt cheap in the countryside could fetch completely different prices in Zhongjiang or Donghai.

"So he's flipping herbs?" Su Lin mused.

"Seems like it. He says we're buying gastrodia tubers, then selling them in Donghai."

"Gastrodia, huh?"

"Interesting. Go with him, Yang. While you're in Donghai, scope out the demand—how much they're buying, what prices are like. We'll do this ourselves."

"Boss, we're doing it ourselves?"

"Yeah. How much is Ye Feng paying you for the trip?"

"Three hundred for the run."

Su Lin scoffed. "Three hundred? That's barely lunch money. Here's what you do—go make the trip, investigate the wholesale market for gastrodia in Donghai, and report back with the details. I'll have people sweep the countryside for stock. Oh, and that 20,000 yuan I gave you—you haven't blown through it, right?"

"Nah, I've still got most of it."

"Good. If this turns a profit, throw your money in too and buy alongside us. You missed out on the last deal—this time you can at least get a piece of the action."

"Boss..."

"It's decided."

---

After hanging up, Chen Yang realized just how vast the gap between himself and Su Lin truly was.

When Ye Feng had pitched the idea, Chen Yang's first thought was simple: three hundred bucks is three hundred bucks. It was a day's work for easy money.

But the moment Su Lin heard about it, he'd instantly identified the business opportunity and pulled Chen Yang in to profit alongside him.

Su Lin's track record spoke for itself—tens of millions in earnings, margins of five to one or better.

And he was bringing Chen Yang along for the ride.

Ye Feng, by comparison, was small-time.

Offering 300 yuan as a day-labor fee? That was treating him like hired help.

Su Lin had money, but he'd never once treated Chen Yang like a subordinate. They operated as equals.

The emotional intelligence gap between the two was staggering.

Meanwhile, Ye Feng had finally talked his parents into giving him 5,000 yuan. Combined with the 3,000 yuan he'd recovered from selling his Destiny Necklace inventory in bulk, he now held 8,000 yuan.

*This money is my launchpad. Just wait, Shiyu. Give me a few days—I won't let you down this time.*

He looked toward Xia Shiyu's house, but no one was home.

She was probably at the hospital watching over her father.

Ye Feng clenched his fist. *In my past life, Zhongjiang's abundant rainfall made it perfect for wild gastrodia. The tubers grew fat and healthy, and the word got out—Zhongjiang gastrodia became famous. My uncle mentioned that the going rate in Donghai shot up past 300 yuan a pound, and the herb dealers made a killing.*

*This time, that money is mine.*

He ran the numbers. If he hustled, he could make two trips today.

Gastrodia was only about 60 yuan a pound in the countryside. One trip could turn his 8,000 yuan into 40,000.

He probably wouldn't have time to make a second sale run, but that was fine—his father could handle the selling.

Ye Feng's plan was straightforward: if this proved profitable, he'd convince his parents to take over the business.

This was a bumper year for wild gastrodia. If he could corner the supply in Zhongjiang's countryside, Xia Shiyu's father's surgery would be no problem at all.

The reason he hadn't chosen the herb route initially was simple: hoarding Destiny Necklaces had been effortless and time-efficient.

He never expected his first attempt to end in disaster.

This time, flipping gastrodia was a sure thing.

And this time, he was bringing his family in on it.

Ye Feng met up with Chen Yang.

"Yang, thanks for doing this today. Lunch is on me later."

Knowing Chen Yang's financial situation, Ye Feng figured a free meal was a generous enough gesture.

Chen Yang's lip twitched, but he nodded. "Sure."

"It might be a long day—I appreciate the help."

Chen Yang shook his head. "I'm strong. That's about all I've got going for me."

"Great! Let's move."

"Let's go!"

The two were about to head for the bus station when they spotted Xia Shiyu walking with Su Lin, laughing and chatting.

Su Lin was taking her to the bank to wire the loan, and they'd decided to walk and enjoy the day rather than drive.

"Shiyu, the hospital already found a matching kidney donor?"

Xia Shiyu nodded. "They matched one really fast. They're still negotiating the price, but 600,000 yuan should be more than enough."

"Good. If it's not enough, just let me know and I'll transfer more."

"Mm-hmm."

After her change in mindset, Xia Shiyu no longer felt the crushing weight of owing Su Lin money.

She'd already given herself to him, so what was a little more debt?
