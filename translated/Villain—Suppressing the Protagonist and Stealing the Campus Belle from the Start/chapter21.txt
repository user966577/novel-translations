After working out the details with Ye Feng, Xia Shiyu went to the payment counter with the bank card.

When the nurse saw someone making a payment on Xia Junming's account, she couldn't help glancing at Xia Shiyu twice.

"Nurse, can my dad start dialysis now?"

The nurse nodded. "Of course—as soon as the bill's paid. But I should warn you: your father's dialysis is already delayed. The transplant needs to happen soon. If you wait too long, it'll be too late."

"How long does he have?"

"I'm not a doctor, so I can't say for certain. But roughly a month, give or take. Beyond that, it's not going to be good."

"Oh..."

Ye Feng spoke up from beside her, brimming with confidence. "Don't worry, Shiyu. I'll have the money together within a month."

Xia Shiyu nodded, though her eyes held little conviction.

She was like a drowning girl, grasping at anything that floated past—whether or not it could actually hold her weight.

Ye Feng could tell she wasn't fully persuaded, but he didn't push it. Words were cheap. Results would speak for themselves.

"Shiyu, done with the payment?"

Xia Shiyu turned to see Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan approaching—Su Lin carrying two fruit baskets, Lin Xiaowan holding a bouquet of flowers.

Standing side by side, they looked like they belonged on a magazine cover. The sight stirred a pang of envy in Xia Shiyu's chest.

"Xiaowan, I told you not to buy anything. You went overboard."

"Blame Su Lin. I was supposed to do the picking, but he kept tossing things in. One fruit here, another there—we ended up with two whole baskets."

"Heh. Thank you, Su Lin."

Su Lin waved it off. "These are all kidney-friendly fruits—low potassium. Make sure your dad gets plenty. And try to serve them pureed if you can."

"Mm-hmm!"

"All right, let's stop standing around. Let's go see your dad."

"Okay!"

Ye Feng was secretly pleased that Xia Shiyu hadn't breathed a word about the money to Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan.

'See? A lifetime of being childhood friends counts for something. Your little friendship can't touch that.'

He figured with his rebirth knowledge, scraping together 30,000 yuan from game items would be a cakewalk.

The group of four headed toward the inpatient ward.

Su Lin eyed Ye Feng's smug, self-assured stride and suppressed a laugh.

'Give it three days, buddy. Then you'll be crying.'

...

That evening after school, Su Lin found Chen Yang and instructed him to raise the purchase price of Destiny Necklaces to 600 each. Buy everything available.

By now, Chen Yang had stopped questioning Su Lin's motives entirely. He just followed orders.

But that same night, he discovered he had competition. Another buyer had appeared—and was offering even more.

**[OneWindLoveLetter]:** Buying Destiny Necklaces server-wide, 700 each! Any quantity! Platform trade, guaranteed legit.

**[OneWindLoveLetter]:** Buying Destiny Necklaces server-wide, 700 each! Any quantity! Platform trade, guaranteed legit.

**[OneWindLoveLetter]:** Buying Destiny Necklaces server-wide, 700 each! Any quantity! Platform trade, guaranteed legit.

Su Lin was logged in from home—unlike Chen Yang, who had to go to an internet cafe, Su Lin had a computer at his own place.

"OneWindLoveLetter... Ye Feng sure picks corny screen names."

**[SunYangTrader]** whispered: '"Boss, someone's undercutting us. 700 per necklace. Do we raise our price?"'

**[TwinWoodForest]** whispered: '"No. Let him buy. We stay at 600. Let him buy at 700 as long as he wants."'

**[SunYangTrader]** whispered: '"So we stop buying and just let him drive the price up?"'

**[TwinWoodForest]** whispered: '"Exactly. We've got more than enough already. Let the man have some scraps."'

**[SunYangTrader]** whispered: '"Got it, boss."'

Chen Yang didn't fully understand Su Lin's reasoning, but he followed instructions without hesitation.

Meanwhile, Ye Feng was bleeding inside.

If he hadn't known from his past life that the Destiny Necklace would eventually hit 5,000-6,000 each, there was no way he'd stomach paying 700.

'That idiot SunYangTrader. Couldn't he just buy at 500 like a normal person? No, he had to drive up the price. Now neither of us is making money.'

Because of Chen Yang's aggressive buying, the game's savvy traders had sniffed out an opportunity. They didn't know 'why' the Destiny Necklace was appreciating—but that didn't stop them from hoarding.

By the time Ye Feng had entered the market, speculators were already circling.

He could tell most of these buyers were professional item flippers. New content and world bosses were dropping soon—equipment price surges were inevitable.

The early bird gets the worm, especially when new maps and world bosses first launch.

...

Three days flew by. Time for 'City of Angels'' version update.

Ye Feng hadn't been paying much attention to the game itself, instead dedicating his energy to studying.

After his rebirth, he'd discovered that his memory had been significantly enhanced. He could read a textbook passage three or four times and remember it perfectly.

It lit a spark of hope within him.

Maybe, with enough effort this time around, he could get into a decent college.

If he dared to dream—maybe even attend the same university as Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan.

So he hadn't wasted time on the game.

The update went live.

8 PM. The first world boss spawned.

Su Lin maneuvered his character into the battlefield.

His character was just barely strong enough to participate in world boss fights—his gear was mediocre at best. The only noteworthy piece of equipment was the Destiny Necklace in his accessory slot.

At the guild leader's command, several hundred players charged into the boss arena.

Su Lin played a swordsman. With his garbage-tier gear, he was basically cannon fodder.

Not that he cared.

He rushed his character straight into the thick of battle and fired off an AoE skill.

-1,424... -1,475... -1,452

**[Splash]** -1,434... **[Splash]** -2,547... **[Splash]** -4,527... **[Skill interrupted—splash effect reset]**

Watching the damage numbers climb in bright red, the entire guild lost their minds.

"Holy crap—TwinWoodForest is hacking! How is he hitting this hard? His red numbers are past 10,000!"

"That's insane. Over 10,000 splash damage? Has to be fake."

"Bullshit. I'm wearing a full set of endgame gear and I only do 6,000."

Su Lin typed into guild chat: "I'm not hacking. It's just the Destiny Necklace's passive."

"Yeah right. The Destiny Necklace does fixed percentage damage. There's no way it hits for 10,000+."

"Look closer."

Someone pulled up the Destiny Necklace's tooltip and examined it carefully.

"Holy shit... the fixed damage is gone."

The entire guild channel went silent.

The damage had changed from fixed to scaling.

If Su Lin's garbage gear could produce 2,000+ base damage, then a fully geared character with a Destiny Necklace...

One AoE would deal hundreds of thousands.

And the splash effect stacked infinitely.

Once that sank in, people went berserk.

As long as your skill wasn't interrupted, the damage would just keep compounding.

Watching the Destiny Necklace's secret get discovered days earlier than in the original novel—all thanks to his manipulation—Su Lin smiled.
