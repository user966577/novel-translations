March had arrived, and Zhongjiang City was warming up.

The morning breeze still carried a chill, and more than a few students pulled their jackets back on after having just taken them off.

Wang Yi stood at the blackboard, triangle ruler in hand, sketching out a geometry problem.

Su Lin recognized it immediately—this was the problem Wang Yi had assigned last week.

It was straightforward, really. You just needed to think outside the box and draw two auxiliary lines.

With Wang Yi's back to the class, the room was anything but quiet. Whispered conversations broke out everywhere.

Su Lin glanced toward the back row at Ye Feng. Sure enough, the guy was fast asleep.

'If I woke him up right now,' Su Lin mused, 'would that prevent his rebirth?'

In the end, he decided against it.

After all, he still needed Ye Feng around to activate his system.

"Only three students in the entire class solved this problem: Su Lin, Lin Xiaowan, and Xia Shiyu."

"Class, geometry is one of the easier question types on the college entrance exam. You just need to think creatively, then apply the formulas, and you'll get the answer quickly."

"First, let's find the..."

Listening to Wang Yi's lecture, Su Lin silently thanked his luck for inheriting the original body's memories. Without them, he'd be completely lost.

The math in this world was identical to Earth's, but Su Lin had been working for years—his math knowledge had long since been returned to his teachers.

"The application of auxiliary lines..."

Wang Yi noticed Ye Feng slumped over his desk in the back row, asleep. He shook his head imperceptibly.

Ye Feng—a kid who loved fighting, had terrible grades, and slept through class. If this were freshman year, Wang Yi might still try to salvage him. But it was senior year. The second semester of senior year, no less.

As long as Ye Feng didn't disrupt class, Wang Yi was content to pretend he didn't exist.

Some time passed.

Ye Feng opened his eyes.

He stared blankly at the scene before him, utterly bewildered.

'Wait... wasn't I just at the class reunion? What the hell is going on?'

'Did I get drunk? Am I dreaming?'

His gaze swept rapidly across the room, searching, until it landed on Xia Shiyu.

A sharp pain lanced through his eyes.

Xia Shiyu had been one of the most dazzling people at the reunion. By then she was already the CEO of a publicly listed company, worth billions.

In his past life, he and Xia Shiyu had grown up together. She'd had feelings for him once. But during the second semester of senior year, her father had been diagnosed with kidney failure.

Back then, Xia Shiyu had desperately needed someone to lean on, someone to help her through the darkest period of her life. But Ye Feng had been too busy chasing Yan Huan to spare her a single glance.

Later, Xia Shiyu's father died because they couldn't afford the transplant. She went north to attend a top university—one that offered full tuition and living stipends.

Years later, when Feng Yifei had schemed against Ye Feng in the working world, Xia Shiyu had appeared out of nowhere to save him.

But by then, the gap between them was too vast. Ye Feng hadn't dared harbor so much as a stray thought about her.

Right up until the moment before his rebirth, at the reunion, he still hadn't found the courage to say thank you.

'Shiyu, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I deserve to die.'

'We grew up together. How could I have just... ignored you?'

Ye Feng murmured to himself several times, then turned his gaze to Lin Xiaowan.

Lin Xiaowan hadn't attended the reunion. By that time, she'd already become the director of the Investment Promotion Office in Donghai City.

How many times had Ye Feng seen her on television? That flutter in his chest—he could only bury it deep.

His eyes swept across face after face.

'Yan Huan!'

Ye Feng's jaw clenched as he glared at Yan Huan and then at Feng Yifei in the back row.

In his past life, after three years of high school and four years of college pursuing her, he and Yan Huan had briefly been married—only for her to cheat on him. And the man she'd cheated with? None other than Feng Yifei, her company's general manager.

The image of those two in bed together flashed through his mind. Ye Feng's eyes went bloodshot with rage.

'Su Lin...'

'Heh. Su Lin's no good either. At the reunion, he was the biggest fraud of them all—flaunting his money, trying to get close to Shiyu. Hmph!'

Wang Yi watched Ye Feng sitting at his desk, cycling through crying, laughing, teeth-gnashing, and murderous glaring.

He flicked a piece of chalk at Ye Feng's head.

"Who threw that?!" Ye Feng shot to his feet, looking ready to start a fight.

Wang Yi snorted. "I did. Got a problem?"

"Oh—it's Old Cannon Wang! Cannon Wang, why are you always throwing chalk? Half the chalk dust in this classroom comes from you."

"Hahahaha!"

"Hahahaha!"

"Holy shit, Feng-bro, you're insane!"

"Ye Feng, you absolute legend—you actually called him Old Cannon to his face!"

Looking around at the vivid smiles and natural expressions of every classmate, Ye Feng froze.

'Did I actually... get reborn? I know my life was a mess, but I've heard of this kind of thing.'

Wang Yi was so furious he could only point at Ye Feng, sputtering, unable to form words.

Su Lin watched the scene with amusement. He knew—the Ye Feng sitting there now was no longer a seventeen-year-old boy.

He was a soul from the future.

Xia Shiyu glanced at Ye Feng briefly, then pressed her lips together and looked away, indifferent.

She didn't need anyone's comfort anymore.

Over the past few days, her friendship with Lin Xiaowan had grown by leaps and bounds. They shared everything now. Lin Xiaowan looked after her like a sister, and Xia Shiyu had climbed out of that pit of despair.

"Ye Feng, sleeping in class is one thing, but talking back to a teacher? Get out. Stand in the hallway."

Ye Feng obediently walked out of the classroom.

He needed to calm down. He needed to figure out whether he'd truly been reborn—and if so, what day it was.
