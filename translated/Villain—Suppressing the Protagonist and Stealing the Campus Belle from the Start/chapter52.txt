Su Lin took Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu to the intersection of Zhongjiang Avenue and Xingfu Avenue.

Su Lin pointed at a three-story building. "This is the one."

"Below is Xingfu Avenue—the market, hospital, and bank. Above is Xingfu Community. To the left is a school, and to the right is Wansheng City residential complex."

"The location is certainly good, but there's nobody here right now. Would people actually come to a supermarket here?" Lin Xiaowan asked skeptically.

Su Lin laughed heartily. "People will definitely come. This spot will become the busiest place in Jiangning for the next twenty years."

"Oh? Why do you say that?"

"Zhongjiang needs development, but there's no way they'll spend money developing the old city center. Future development will definitely happen along both sides of Zhongjiang Avenue. Besides, I'm only planning to spend about a million on the property. If we tried to buy in the old city center, 3 million wouldn't be enough."

"True, property prices in the old city are too expensive."

"That's why the old city will stay the old city. The higher-ups won't be planning anything for that area. Future development will be here. And if there's a supermarket at this location, we won't need to worry about foot traffic for twenty years."

Hearing Su Lin's explanation, both Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu were stunned.

If they'd been choosing a location, they would have picked somewhere in the old city center—which would mean higher costs and uncertain returns.

But Su Lin had chosen to invest in the future. This place looked empty now, but once the supermarket was established, foot traffic would naturally increase.

Su Lin understood exactly how powerful a supermarket's drawing power could be.

Most importantly, he'd read the novel. A park would be planned for this area soon, which would bring even more people.

Lin Xiaowan gave Su Lin a thumbs up. "Su Lin, you were born for business."

"Uh... that's a pretty big compliment."

"I'm not just complimenting you. Your vision and foresight are far ahead of everyone else. No wonder you made so much money stockpiling gastrodia tubers."

"Heh."

"Xiaowan, do you have the confidence to buy this little three-story building?" Su Lin asked, raising an eyebrow at Lin Xiaowan.

Lin Xiaowan smiled lightly. "By your logic, buying this place might be difficult in a few years, but for now it's much simpler. All I need to do is convince this family to sell."

"How do you plan to do it?"

Lin Xiaowan snapped her fingers. "That's a secret. Just wait for the good news."

"Heh, then I'll be waiting."

"Mm-hmm!"

"Now that our business is done, let's take Xiaoyu shopping. She still has a lot of things to buy."

Xia Shiyu quickly said, "Su Lin, I'm not in a hurry."

"It's fine. Xiaowan can help carry your things—free labor, might as well use it."

Lin Xiaowan laughed in exasperation. "Su Lin, you're a big strong man, and you're making me do the heavy lifting? Are you even human?"

"No way. Xiaoyu, make sure to buy a lot of stuff and give it all to Su Lin to carry."

Xia Shiyu glanced at Su Lin and shook her head. "I'd rather not. Su Lin has helped me so much. Treating him like that would be repaying kindness with ingratitude."

Su Lin gave Lin Xiaowan a smug look.

Lin Xiaowan was speechless.

Her best friend had just defected to the enemy.

...

The three of them played until evening before Su Lin drove the two girls home.

After dropping off Xia Shiyu, Su Lin drove Lin Xiaowan home.

"Xiaowan, your family lives in the government compound."

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "Yeah. When my dad first came here, there wasn't a cadre housing area yet, so we could only live in the family compound. We never moved after that and just stayed here."

"I'm wondering—if your dad sees me dropping you off like this, will something happen?" Su Lin asked with some concern.

He knew perfectly well that Lin Guoqiang was absolutely devoted to his daughter.

"Hehe, Su Lin, I thought you weren't afraid of anything. But you're... scared of meeting my dad?" Lin Xiaowan asked with amusement.

Su Lin nodded seriously. "Genuinely scared. I'm afraid he won't approve of us and then send you abroad. That would be terrible for me."

"W-what do you mean approve? I haven't even agreed to be your girlfriend yet."

"It's just a matter of time. Only about a month left. Very soon."

"Don't be so confident. Maybe you'll lose to Ye Feng."

Su Lin shook his head. "That's impossible."

He knew perfectly well that Ye Feng's memory had been significantly weakened, with half his memories from his previous life cut away.

Plus Su Lin had his own cheat.

If he still lost to Ye Feng under these circumstances, he might as well pack it in.

"Don't be so confident, okay? Ye Feng bet against Yan Huan before, and nobody thought he'd win, but he did anyway." Lin Xiaowan reminded him.

Su Lin replied calmly, "For him to beat me, he'd need perfect scores in every subject. You think that's possible?"

Lin Xiaowan fell silent.

"I can't even talk to you. You're just abnormal. I'm going home."

With that, Lin Xiaowan opened the car door, waved at Su Lin, and left.

Su Lin watched her go.

Lin Xiaowan entered the compound and checked the front of her house.

Good. No cars.

So her parents weren't home yet.

She'd taken Su Lin's words to heart. Knowing Lin Guoqiang's personality, he really might send her abroad.

That was not something she wanted to see.

Lin Xiaowan was certain she'd been poisoned by something called Su Lin.

She'd discovered that if she went more than half a day without seeing him, she'd start thinking about him involuntarily.

And when she thought about him, she'd often forget what she was supposed to be doing. This was pretty bad—she knew it was the result of falling into romantic fantasies.

But Lin Xiaowan didn't try to suppress these thoughts.

Because she believed a person's youth shouldn't be only about studying. It could also include the fresh greenness of first love.

She was enjoying every day she spent with Su Lin.

She'd just opened the door when Lin Xiaowan met a pair of appraising eyes. "Sweetie, you're home."

"Dad! Why are you here?"

Lin Guoqiang smiled at Lin Xiaowan. "Where else would I be after work? Sweetie, do you not want me to be home?"

Lin Xiaowan quickly waved her hands. "No... Dad, I didn't mean that."

"Oh? That's not what you meant?"

Lin Guoqiang nodded and asked, "Where did you go today, sweetie?"

"I... I went out with Xiaoyu and Su Lin."

"Xiaoyu? The classmate whose father is sick?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "That's her."

"Oh. And this Su Lin? The classmate who asked you to help with the donation?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded again, watching Lin Guoqiang cautiously, unsure what he wanted to say.

After a moment of silence, Lin Guoqiang asked, "You three are good friends?"
