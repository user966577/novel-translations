Seeing Ye Feng about to leave, Lin Xiaowan called out, "Ye Feng, you haven't set a deadline yet. We can't wait until college to settle this, can we?"

Ye Feng's mouth twitched. "The final monthly exam."

"Alright. The final monthly exam it is." Su Lin nodded.

Now that Su Lin had accepted the bet, Ye Feng knew there was no point in sticking around. He headed toward the track to watch Feng Yifei's performance.

The move also sent a signal to everyone present: talking trash now was pointless—ultimately, someone would be frog-jumping around this track.

"Hmph, that guy is way too arrogant. It's infuriating." Lin Xiaowan clutched her chest, seething.

Xia Shiyu chimed in, "Pride comes before a fall. When the time comes, we'll be here watching the show, just like him."

Su Lin nodded. "When that happens, I'll buy you drinks and sunflower seeds. My treat."

"Hehe! Just make sure you don't lose. If you lose, you'll be the one getting laughed at." Lin Xiaowan gave Su Lin a playful look.

Su Lin wanted to ruffle her hair but remembered they weren't officially a couple yet, so he held back.

But it was only a matter of two months.

Su Lin watched Feng Yifei jogging and shouting on the track, then shook his head. "Let's go. It's getting late. We should head out."

Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan nodded and left with Su Lin.

The three of them had been inseparable at school lately. Su Lin had become the object of countless students' envy.

But Su Lin's grades were too good, and he was wealthy and handsome. Nobody dared give him trouble.

As they left, Su Lin glanced toward a corner of the teaching building. His physically enhanced senses were far sharper than average.

He knew Yan Huan was standing there, watching Feng Yifei on the track.

After this spectacle, Feng Yifei would probably have no trouble winning Yan Huan over.

Too bad Ye Feng wasn't interested in Yan Huan anymore. Otherwise, there'd be more drama to enjoy.

"Wonder how Yan Huan's doing," Lin Xiaowan sighed.

Su Lin shook his head. "Probably figuring out how to get back at Ye Feng."

"What?! They won't fight, will they?" Lin Xiaowan looked worried.

Even though she and Yan Huan had parted ways, as class president she'd have to intervene if there was a fight.

Su Lin shook his head. "Feng Yifei will probably hire people to rough him up—he did lose a lot of face, after all. As for Yan Huan, she'll probably use different tactics."

Lin Xiaowan stared at Su Lin like he was some kind of alien. "It's like you already figured all this out."

She'd been replaying the earlier scene in her head. Su Lin's reactions had seemed almost rehearsed.

Su Lin chuckled. "I've been spending so much time with Shiyu. Given Ye Feng's petty personality, he's definitely going to retaliate. And his options are limited right now—academics is probably his only weapon. Is that really so hard to predict?"

Lin Xiaowan sighed. "I have no idea how your brain works. We'd never think of all this."

Suddenly, her eyes went wide. "So earlier—you did that on purpose! You deliberately provoked me. Even if I hadn't said... what I said... you would've accepted Ye Feng's bet anyway!"

Lin Xiaowan was sharp. She'd just been sheltered by her comfortable school life, which had limited her perspective.

Now that Su Lin had spelled it out, she connected the dots instantly.

She was now glaring at him, teeth clenched.

Su Lin nodded. "Correct. I just didn't expect you to say what you did. Call it a pleasant surprise."

"Pleasant surprise?!"

"What else would you call it?" Su Lin looked at her with amusement.

Lin Xiaowan: "..."

Thinking about it, what she'd promised was absolutely a pleasant surprise for Su Lin.

"What are you two whispering about over there?"

"Xiaowan was venting about how annoying Ye Feng is. She's wondering where he got that 80,000 yuan." Su Lin covered smoothly.

"Oh right—where did Ye Feng get 80,000 yuan? His family definitely couldn't afford that."

"Heh. As long as it wasn't stolen or obtained illegally, what do we care where it came from?" Su Lin's tone made it clear he didn't want to pursue the topic.

"Shiyu, ride with me. We can stop at the bank so you can deposit the money."

Xia Shiyu nodded. She was carrying 80,000 yuan in her bag right now, and it was making her nervous.

And so, at the school gate, the crowd witnessed another tearjerker scene.

The famous school belle Xia Shiyu got into Su Lin's Mercedes.

"Holy—! They're not even trying to hide it anymore. Getting in the same car like that—are they gonna go back to Su Lin's place tonight?"

"Bro, stop being bitter. They're probably just going the same direction."

"Exactly. Goddess Xia isn't that kind of girl."

"I mean... Su Lin's rich, handsome, and brilliant. It'd be weird if Goddess Xia wasn't into him, right?"

In the car, Xia Shiyu and Su Lin sat together in the back.

She felt a little nervous.

Before, when she'd ridden with Su Lin, there hadn't been a driver.

But today was different. Liu Yong sat up front, driving impassively, occasionally glancing at Xia Shiyu in the rearview mirror.

"Liu-shu, could you stop at Daxia Bank? Shiyu needs to take care of something."

Liu Yong nodded expressionlessly.

Su Lin turned to Xia Shiyu. "Want me to come with you?"

She shook her head quickly. "No, no—I can handle it myself."

"Will you be safe going alone?"

Xia Shiyu nodded. "My money's all in my bag. As long as I don't take it out, nobody knows how much I have."

Su Lin nodded. "True. But still be careful. Don't let anyone see inside the bank."

"Mm-hmm! Thank you, Su Lin."

Su Lin pinched her cheek. "Why so formal with me?"

"Mm!"

Xia Shiyu snuck a glance at Liu Yong, who was focused on driving. Good—he hadn't noticed. Otherwise, she'd never dare ride in Su Lin's car again.

Then, when Su Lin wasn't paying attention, her small hand found his waist and deployed the universal secret weapon of women everywhere.

"Hiss!"

"Shiyu—you too?!"

Xia Shiyu stuck out her tongue. "That's what you get for getting handsy in the car."

Su Lin laughed. "Fine. I'll remember this. Just wait—you're going to regret it."

Xia Shiyu looked at him, puzzled, not understanding what he meant.

Su Lin smiled mysteriously and said nothing more.

This girl had no idea she was looking at a wolf who wanted to devour her whole.

Better not be too obvious. Wouldn't want to scare her.

"Young Master Su, we've arrived at Daxia Bank."

Su Lin nodded, then asked Xia Shiyu once more, "Sure you don't want me to come with you?"

Xia Shiyu nodded. "No need. The hospital's close by—I can walk from here."

"Alright. Head home after. Text me when you get to the hospital."

"Mm-hmm!" Xia Shiyu smiled sweetly, then opened the door and got out.

Watching her leave, Liu Yong started the car again and remarked, "Young Master Su, you've got good taste. That girl's a keeper."

Su Lin nodded. "Shiyu really is wonderful."

"Heh."

Seeing Su Lin's mature demeanor, Liu Yong laughed.

"What's funny, Liu-shu? Hurry up—let's go home!"
