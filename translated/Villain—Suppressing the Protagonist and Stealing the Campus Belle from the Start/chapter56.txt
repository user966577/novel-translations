In the dining room, Su Lin and Xia Shiyu sat side by side, very close to each other.

Su Lin considerately picked up several bites of food and placed them in Xia Shiyu's bowl. "Try my cooking. Tell me how it tastes."

"Mm!"

"Delicious! Su Lin, your cooking is so good—even better than mine."

Her cheeks puffed up as she ate and talked at the same time.

She looked especially cute.

"Heh, if you like it, eat more. You're the birthday girl today. And I don't cook often, so who knows when you'll get another chance."

"Hehe! It's okay. I'll cook for you from now on."

Su Lin ruffled Xia Shiyu's hair. "Don't eat so fast. There's still the cake—we need to blow out candles and make wishes."

"It's your fault for cooking so well. Su Lin, do you cook at home every day?"

Su Lin shook his head. "Not at all."

"Ah, then it must be natural talent. My dad used to say I had talent for cooking, but compared to you, I'm nowhere close."

Speaking of her father, Xia Shiyu's mood dipped slightly. "Actually, when I was little, my dad used to celebrate my birthday all the time. But after my mom left, he became much more withdrawn."

"Mm. My mom left early too. But my dad is different—he has his career. After my mom passed, he needed his work to give his life meaning."

"Mm, Uncle Su must be an amazing person."

"Heh, he's not as amazing as me."

"You're the most amazing."

"Of course I am."

"Hehe!"

After dinner, Su Lin led Xia Shiyu to eat cake and blow out candles.

Xia Shiyu wore a paper crown on her head while Su Lin held her in a half-embrace. She pressed her palms together. "I hope..."

Whoosh!

"Xiaoyu, what did you wish for?"

"I'm not telling. You can't say wishes out loud, or they won't come true."

Su Lin reached out and tapped her head. "You and your superstitions."

"Hehe, I'm just talking nonsense."

"Xiaoyu, you just said any kind of thanks is fine?"

Xia Shiyu nodded.

Su Lin raised an eyebrow, a knowing smile on his face. "How about a... verbal thanks?"

Xia Shiyu froze, then her face flushed red. Her heart pounded as she realized what "verbal thanks" actually meant.

"Don't you want to thank me?"

"I... I do."

"Good girl."

Seeing Xia Shiyu's shy yet willing expression, Su Lin's smile deepened.

"Come upstairs with me."

"Um... hehe."

"Upstairs!"

Su Lin pulled Xia Shiyu toward the stairs. Though she'd never experienced this before, she had a premonition of what awaited her.

Xia Shiyu covered her face, silently berating herself: 'Xia Shiyu, oh Xia Shiyu, you and your big mouth. You'll say anything!'

---

That night, Su Lin and Xia Shiyu spent a pleasant evening together.

Xia Shiyu came to understand what "verbal thanks" truly meant.

In the morning, Xia Shiyu woke first. Long nights watching over her father at the hospital had trained her to rise early.

She looked at Su Lin sleeping beside her. Her finger traced across his face as she thought about what had happened the night before, and quickly buried her head under the covers.

Though she hadn't completely transformed from girl to woman...

In Xia Shiyu's view, what Su Lin had asked her to do was even more intimate than that.

'Oh no, I got carried away. Being with Su Lin makes my IQ drop to negative.'

'Xia Shiyu, oh Xia Shiyu, how could you be so stupid? Whatever Su Lin asks, you just do it.'

Though she quietly berated herself, her eyes sparkled, and the smile at the corners of her mouth couldn't be suppressed.

Xia Shiyu gently pinched Su Lin's nose and whispered, "Su Lin, this time I've shortchanged you. When you turn eighteen, I'll make it up to you properly."

"That's what you said, Xiaoyu!"

"Ah! Su Lin, you're awake?"

Su Lin laughed. "You're pinching my nose so I can't breathe. How could I not wake up?"

"Um... hehe, sorry. I've wanted to pinch your nose for a long time but never had the chance. Today I couldn't help myself..."

Su Lin chuckled and pinched Xia Shiyu's delicate nose too. "Heh, it's fine. My nose is all yours. It's natural—pinch it all you want and it won't break."

"Hehehe!"

The two looked at each other, then both burst into silly laughter.

Su Lin patted Xia Shiyu's head with a smile. "Time to get up. We still have class today."

"Mm!"

"Su Lin, what do you want for breakfast? Tell me and I'll make it."

Su Lin shook his head. "Not today. There aren't many ingredients left. Let's eat out."

Xia Shiyu started to get up, then glanced at Su Lin. She clutched the blanket in front of her, motionless.

Su Lin knew this girl got bold in the moment but became shy once she came to her senses. He smiled. "Let me go find you some toiletries first."

"Huh? You have spare toiletries here?"

Su Lin said casually, "I didn't before, but after you stayed over last time, I had some bought."

"Oh! Su Lin, you're so thoughtful."

"Xiaoyu, you keep saying I'm good, but sometimes you say I'm bad. Am I good or bad?"

"Mm! You're especially good when you're being proper. But when you're improper, you're especially bad."

"Then do you like me when I'm proper, or when I'm improper?"

Xia Shiyu shot Su Lin a look, then turned her head away. "I... like both."

Satisfied, Su Lin smiled. Knowing this girl couldn't handle teasing, he didn't push further. He pulled on his pants and got out of bed.

Watching Su Lin leave, Xia Shiyu smiled sweetly again.

Downstairs, both Su Lin and Xia Shiyu were ready to go.

"Su Lin, should we wait for your driver?"

Su Lin shook his head. "I messaged Uncle Liu yesterday. He won't be coming today."

"Ah! Then how do we get to school?"

Su Lin pointed at himself. "I can drive. Did you forget?"

"But won't it look bad if you drive to school?"

Su Lin looked at Xia Shiyu like she was being silly. "Do I seem that flashy to you? I'll park outside the school. Nobody would dare scratch a car like this—they'd automatically give it a three-meter berth."

"I'd give it a three-meter berth too. A car this expensive—if you damage it, you'd have to pay a fortune."

"Money. That's the most meaningless thing to me. Come on, let's go to school."

"Okay!"

The two bought breakfast on the way. When they arrived at school, Su Lin was surprised to see Ye Feng already in his seat. He'd come earlier than ever before.

Ye Feng clearly hadn't slept well. He looked haggard, had lost weight, and his hair was a mess.

Xia Shiyu didn't spare Ye Feng a single glance as she returned to her seat.

Su Lin ignored him too.

In that state, unless Ye Feng pulled himself together on his own, even ten or a hundred rebirths wouldn't help. He was completely done for.

Su Lin actually hoped Ye Feng would rally and give him some competition. Otherwise, being a villain felt rather pointless.

He was practically more virtuous than the hero at this point.

Helping with business, donating money, lending money.

What villain acted this good?

What Su Lin didn't notice was that when Ye Feng saw Xia Shiyu walking normally without any discomfort, a flicker of life returned to his dull eyes.

But quickly, he sank back into despair.

Xia Shiyu had reached the point of completely ignoring him.

He wasn't afraid of Xia Shiyu hating him or despising him. Only being ignored hurt the most.

"Su Lin! Xiaoyu! You're here so early!"

Lin Xiaowan stood prettily at the doorway, smiling at them both.

"Xiaowan, you're the one who's early. I don't know how you manage it—coming so early every day."

"Hehe! I have to come open up the classroom. I just got here a little while ago myself."

Lin Xiaowan walked over and sat down next to Xia Shiyu. "Xiaoyu, how did your dad's surgery go? It was too late last night, so I went home first. I never got your message and was really worried."

Xia Shiyu smiled awkwardly.

Last night, after Su Lin took her away, the two had been together the whole time.

Sending a message?

Sorry, that had been thrown to the winds.

If Lin Xiaowan hadn't brought it up, Xia Shiyu would have nearly forgotten that she'd promised to update Lin Xiaowan as soon as the surgery results came in.

Su Lin cut in, "The surgery was very successful. He's been transferred to a private ward. I had Xiaoyu hire a caregiver—the caregiver is watching him now."

"As for why she didn't message you last night—Xiaowan, that's your fault. Did you not know yesterday was Xiaoyu's birthday?"

"What? Xiaoyu, yesterday was your birthday?"

Xia Shiyu glanced at Su Lin, unsure why he'd brought this up directly.

Su Lin gave her a reassuring smile, signaling her to just say it.

For a woman like Lin Xiaowan, Su Lin felt there was no need to hide things unnecessarily.

Otherwise, with her intelligence, she might notice something off, and that would affect their relationship.

If he was upfront about everything, things would be different. She wouldn't overthink it.

That's just how women were.

Of course, any other girl and Lin Xiaowan would definitely get jealous. But Xia Shiyu was different—they were best friends with deep feelings. Plus, the relationship between all three of them was already established.

With Su Lin's signal, Xia Shiyu nodded. "It really was my birthday. I didn't remember until after my dad's surgery. Then Su Lin took me out for a nice meal. Hehe."

Hearing this, Su Lin gave Xia Shiyu a mental thumbs up. He really had taken her out for a big meal—a double portion, in fact!

Lin Xiaowan looked regretful. "What a shame. I didn't even know."

Then she walked up to Su Lin, glaring at him. "This is all your fault. You insisted on taking me home so early. If you'd waited a bit longer until the surgery was done, I could have celebrated with Xiaoyu."

Su Lin shrugged. "Tomorrow's the weekend. You can make it up to Xiaoyu then."

Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "Tomorrow won't work. We're signing the contract tomorrow."

Su Lin: "!!"

Xia Shiyu: "!!"
