Seeing Lin Xiaowan still pouting, Su Lin couldn't help patting her head again. "Alright, alright, stop being mad. Tell you what—I'll treat you to a big lunch. I heard there's a new barbecue place near here. Their pork belly is supposedly amazing—crispy on the outside, not greasy at all."

Lin Xiaowan hadn't eaten breakfast, and Su Lin's words immediately roused her appetite.

"Barbecue? Where?"

"Now, Xiaowan, we have to make a deal first. Once you've had this barbecue, no more pouting at me, okay?" Su Lin's half-coaxing, half-commanding tone left Lin Xiaowan defenseless.

She wrinkled her nose. "What kind of person do you think I am? Am I really that petty?"

Su Lin chuckled to himself. He knew perfectly well that if he didn't smooth things over today, he'd be facing all sorts of payback from Lin Xiaowan later.

"Hehe, I always knew our Xiaowan was beautiful, generous, and magnanimous."

"Okay, okay, enough with the flattery. I'm hungry."

"Right, let's go now."

Su Lin led Lin Xiaowan out of the amusement park. He hadn't driven today, so they just walked around the corner and spotted a barbecue restaurant.

It was right around lunchtime and the restaurant was packed, but neither Su Lin nor Lin Xiaowan were looking at the restaurant. Their attention had been caught by a nearby milk tea cart.

Wanwan Milk Tea.

A rather tacky name.

"Su Lin, is this milk tea any good? Wanwan Milk Tea? Is it from Taiwan?"

"Bubble tea is a drink that originated from Taiwan. It's decent enough. This pearl milk tea is pretty average though. Next time I'll take you to a proper tea shop to try the real thing."

"Let's buy a cup and try it. I'm a little thirsty anyway."

"Sure."

Lin Xiaowan pulled Su Lin toward the cart across the street. She didn't even realize that at some point, holding Su Lin's hand had become completely natural to her—no resistance, no awkwardness.

They approached the tricycle cart.

Lin Xiaowan saw a woman in her forties and said softly, "Miss, how much is the pearl milk tea?"

"Five yuan a cup. Second cup is half price," Liu Mei replied without looking up.

"Oh, then give me two cups."

Liu Mei called out, "Xiaofeng, two pearl milk teas."

"Coming right up."

Ye Feng emerged from nearby, holding two freshly made cups of milk tea.

Then the smile froze on his face. He saw Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan.

Instantly, his expression turned cold. His mental age was over thirty now—by rights, he should have been able to maintain his composure even if he couldn't hide his emotions entirely. But facing Su Lin, he couldn't bring himself to smile. He didn't even want to pretend.

Having been reborn, Ye Feng had made a decision: he would live authentically, live happily.

"What rotten luck. I run into you everywhere," Ye Feng said flatly.

Lin Xiaowan's smile froze too.

She hadn't expected Ye Feng to attack Su Lin so openly. It infuriated her.

Her face went cold. "Sorry, ma'am, we don't want the milk tea anymore."

"Heh, Lin Xiaowan, you're supposed to be a golden girl. Why do you keep hanging around someone like Su Lin?" Ye Feng sneered.

By now, Liu Mei had noticed something was off. Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan clearly knew her son, and the relationship was far from friendly.

Fortunately, the lunch rush had passed and there weren't many people around, otherwise Ye Feng's behavior would definitely hurt business.

Lin Xiaowan gave a cold laugh. "Someone like Su Lin? Even if Su Lin has a thousand faults, ten thousand shortcomings, at least he has principles. You even swindled Xiaoyu's money—the money meant to save her father's life. 80,000 yuan! That was 80,000 yuan, and you just took it. Don't you know her father is still lying in a hospital bed?"

Seeing Lin Xiaowan drop this bombshell, Su Lin was delighted. He wouldn't even need to lift a finger this time—Lin Xiaowan had handled Ye Feng all on her own.

Looking at Liu Mei's ashen face, Su Lin knew that if Ye Feng didn't explain himself properly, he'd definitely be in for a beating from his parents tonight.

'How interesting.'

'No matter how powerful a protagonist is, he can't escape parental discipline. Too bad I won't get to see it.'

Su Lin remained silent, just holding Lin Xiaowan's hand a little tighter.

Lin Xiaowan patted the back of his hand reassuringly, giving him a look that said "I've got this."

Su Lin saw that and smiled, returning an encouraging look.

"80,000? What 80,000? When did my Xiaofeng ever swindle money? Young lady, could you please explain?" Liu Mei had gotten involved now, wanting to understand what was happening.

Lin Xiaowan pointed at Su Lin. "Ma'am, you should ask Ye Feng. He's the one who took the money—he knows exactly what happened."

Liu Mei turned to Ye Feng. "Xiaofeng, what's going on? Did you swindle that 80,000 yuan?"

"Mom, I didn't swindle it. I borrowed it. I borrowed 80,000 yuan."

Hearing this, Lin Xiaowan let out another cold laugh. "Borrowed 80,000 yuan? If Su Lin hadn't threatened to call the police, you weren't even planning to pay it back. And you have the nerve to call it borrowing?"

"Also, ma'am, Ye Feng has already returned that 80,000 yuan. But where the money came from is unclear. You might want to look into that."

She looked at the milk tea cart. "We won't be having the milk tea today. Ye Feng, if I ever hear you badmouthing Su Lin again, you and I are going to have a problem."

"Su Lin, let's go."

Lin Xiaowan grabbed Su Lin's arm and headed toward the barbecue restaurant.

Su Lin gave her a thumbs up. "Xiaowan, you're amazing. A few sentences and Ye Feng was completely speechless."

"I just can't stand watching that scumbag do something wrong and then badmouth others. Su Lin, I don't have your generosity. I'm very petty."

Su Lin was touched. He understood Lin Xiaowan well enough to know that if this had been about herself, she never would have made such a scene. It was only because it involved him—because she couldn't stand seeing him wrongly accused—that she'd confronted Ye Feng so directly.

Su Lin sighed. "Xiaowan, when you're like this, I just like you more and more. What am I supposed to do?"

This was the first time Su Lin had so openly declared his feelings. Lin Xiaowan giggled. "Then you'd better do well on the final monthly exam. Beat that scumbag Ye Feng, and then I'll be your girlfriend!"

"Deal. I'll definitely get a high score."

"Hehe..."
