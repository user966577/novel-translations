March 2002.

Jiangning First High School, Zhongjiang City. Senior year, Class 1.

The blackboard read: 100 days until the college entrance exam!

On the podium, homeroom teacher Wang Yi spoke gravely, "I'm sure everyone in class has already heard about Xia Shiyu's father suffering from kidney failure and uremia."

"Given the dire state of Xia Shiyu's family, the school has organized a fundraiser."

"Everyone should contribute what they can according to their family's situation. Those who can afford more, give more. Those who can't, give less. Understood?"

"Understood!"

Satisfied with the students' response, Wang Yi nodded. "Alright, class dismissed. I don't want to take up any more of your break time."

With that, he gathered his lecture notes and walked out.

Meanwhile, Su Lin, seated in the third row, had finally finished processing all the memories flooding his mind.

"I actually transmigrated," he murmured in disbelief. "And into a novel, no less."

Su Lin never imagined he'd end up inside a book.

Twenty minutes ago, he'd been about to read the final arc of *Reberta: The Perfect Billionaire*. One little nap later, and here he was—transmigrated into the very beginning of that story.

He'd become the novel's same-named villain—a minor antagonist.

The only reason Su Lin had powered through the formulaic rebirth novel in the first place was because the villain shared his name.

Glancing at the date on the blackboard, Su Lin shook his head. Not the beginning, exactly. More accurately, this was three days before the plot kicked off.

Meaning in three days, the novel's protagonist, Ye Feng, would be reborn.

After that, Ye Feng would convince his childhood friend Xia Shiyu to let him use the collected charity funds to stockpile gaming equipment, completing the initial accumulation for his first fortune. Once he had enough money, he'd first pay for Xia Shiyu's father's kidney transplant, then open a chain of milk tea shops, internet cafes, campus networks, tutoring platforms, and eventually dive into real estate to reach the pinnacle of life.

Along the way, he'd make a bet with Su Lin that would catch the attention of the original Su Lin's white moonlight, Lin Xiaowan—thoroughly humiliating the villain. Later, Ye Feng would set traps in the real estate game for Su Lin's father, Su Zhenguo, driving the entire Su family to ruin.

It got so bad that Su Lin wouldn't even dare show his face at Lin Xiaowan's birthday party.

Thinking about this, Su Lin instinctively glanced toward Lin Xiaowan in the seat by the aisle.

From just her profile alone, he could tell this girl was devastatingly beautiful.

Porcelain skin without a single blemish, long slender legs pressed neatly together, a delicate waist, perfect posture, and curves that were impossible to ignore.

Perhaps sensing his gaze, Lin Xiaowan set down her pen and turned to meet Su Lin's eyes. That one look left him even more stunned. Though she hadn't fully grown into her features yet, she already outshone countless celebrities and campus beauties back on Earth.

The main reason Su Lin had actually made it to the ending was Lin Xiaowan. The original author had fumbled the protagonist, but Lin Xiaowan's character was genuinely well-crafted. Su Lin had been quite fond of her.

Catching his stare, Lin Xiaowan furrowed her brows, a flash of disgust crossing her eyes.

Su Lin was the class vice president of Senior 1—handsome, top grades, wealthy family. Prince Charming in the eyes of most girls.

But Lin Xiaowan couldn't stand him.

Su Lin always carried an insufferable air of superiority, especially toward the poorer students. The contempt in his eyes was unmistakable.

She despised how he looked down on everyone, as if the whole world existed beneath him.

In terms of family background, Lin Xiaowan actually eclipsed Su Lin by a wide margin. Yet she treated everyone warmly and never judged anyone through tinted lenses.

This made Lin Xiaowan beloved across all of Jiangning First High. Love letters arrived daily, and her desk was never short of snacks.

Su Lin caught the disgust in her expression and simply smiled, unbothered.

Having read the novel, he knew exactly how much the old Su Lin had been loathed.

Changing Lin Xiaowan's impression of him wouldn't happen with a few words.

Seeing Su Lin look back down at his textbook, Lin Xiaowan assumed he was just putting on a show. She pursed her lips and went back to her problems.

Thinking about his current predicament, Su Lin sighed softly. "I've read plenty of villain novels before, but a villain novel in a rebirth story? That's a first."

"And this is a parallel world on top of it. Ye Feng is a reborn native—his advantages are enormous. As long as he completes his initial capital accumulation, success comes easy."

"But I'm not without advantages either. I've got an entire Earth's worth of knowledge backing me up, and I know the entire plot."

Su Lin weighed his situation. Ye Feng's advantages were considerable, but so were his own. As long as he didn't go looking for a death match, he could live quite well in this world. Of course, Ye Feng would also thrive.

And the guy had a cheat ability on top of it—after rebirth, his memory was borderline superhuman. Not quite photographic, but a few reads and everything stuck permanently.

That thought made Su Lin pause.

Cheat ability?

Right—a cheat ability. How could a transmigrator like him not have one?

Su Lin shouted internally: *Come on out, System!*

*[Ding! Super Villain System loading complete... Not yet activated.]*

*[Activation conditions: Suppress the reborn protagonist Ye Feng, preventing him from obtaining his first fortune and the affections of campus belles Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan. Additionally, change Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan's perception of the host.]*

Hearing the system's voice, Su Lin was over the moon.

"I knew it. I'm a transmigrator, after all—how could I not have a cheat?"

Su Lin's gaze drifted to Ye Feng sitting in the corner. A bold idea formed: should he just find a way to take him out directly and be done with it?

He quickly dismissed the thought. Blue Star mirrored Earth almost perfectly—a fully functioning society governed by the rule of law.

If he took Ye Feng out now, there was no telling what uncontrollable consequences might follow.

After all, this was the protagonist—the child of fortune in this world.

It wasn't worth throwing his own life away over someone like Ye Feng.
