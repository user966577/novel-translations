Looking at the anger on Ye Feng's face, Su Lin knew exactly what the guy was trying to do—lay a trap.

If Su Lin took the bait and said something dismissive, Ye Feng would challenge him to a bet, then pull off some miraculous exam performance. Classic protagonist move. Su Lin wasn't falling for it.

"I would never look down on someone who wants to learn," Su Lin said evenly.

"And I've never thought wanting to study was something to laugh about."

There wasn't a trace of mockery in his voice. His tone was genuinely warm, which made Ye Feng stare at him in surprise.

'He's not taking the bait?'

'Didn't expect the guy to be this sharp at eighteen. No wonder his grades are so good and his real estate company eventually expanded beyond Jiangnan Province.'

"Then what did you mean by what you just said?" Ye Feng pressed.

Su Lin raised an eyebrow and nodded toward Xia Shiyu. "If you want to know what I meant, ask Shiyu."

"Oh—and if you're looking to borrow study notes, I'd suggest starting with the freshman-year ones."

With that, Su Lin stood up and turned to Xia Shiyu. "Shiyu, I need to hit the restroom. You two chat."

Ye Feng felt thoroughly outmaneuvered. Su Lin had refused to follow his script, dropped his mic, and walked away—while neatly redirecting the whole thing onto Xia Shiyu, making 'her' the one to deliver the uncomfortable truth.

And sure enough, Xia Shiyu said, "Xiaofeng, Su Lin's right. If you genuinely want to learn English, senior-year notes won't help. You'd need to start from freshman year."

Hearing Xia Shiyu side with Su Lin, Ye Feng bristled. "Since when are you and Su Lin so close?"

The question hit a nerve. Xia Shiyu's chest heaved with agitation. "Ye Feng, who I'm close to and who I'm not—how is that any of your business?"

"I—"

"All you do every day is play games. Besides Xu Jie and Yan Huan, who in this class would even want to hang out with you?"

The words were barely out before she regretted them. They'd grown up together. She knew his personality inside and out. But thinking about everything her family had been going through lately—and Ye Feng's total indifference—Xia Shiyu turned on her heel and walked out.

Ye Feng tried to speak, but by the time he turned around, she was already at the door.

He came to his senses and found himself facing Lin Xiaowan's contemptuous gaze.

"I..."

He wanted to explain, but realized he had absolutely no defense. Anything he said would sound like an excuse.

All he could do was trudge back to his seat, pull out a notebook, and start recording key future events—hand shielding the page from view.

"Feng-bro, what're you writing? Why so secretive?"

"Nothing."

Xu Jie tried to pry his hand away, grinning. "C'mon, let me see!"

"You wouldn't understand it even if I showed you."

"Just let me look!"

"Fine, fine. Go ahead."

Ye Feng spread the notebook open.

"What the heck is this? I can't read any of it."

"Told you so."

Watching Xu Jie, a plan began crystallizing in Ye Feng's mind.

But thinking about Su Lin's closeness with Xia Shiyu made his brow furrow again.

'I was too rash this time. They're seventeen and eighteen—I can't treat them like children. Otherwise the only clown here will be me.'

...

Noon. Last class before lunch.

Ye Feng had already rehearsed his pitch mentally. The moment he and Xia Shiyu left the school, he'd find a way to convince her to lend him the money.

But when he joined up with Xia Shiyu, his jaw dropped.

"Shiyu, I thought we were going to see your dad at the hospital."

"We are. I'm going to pay his medical bills."

"Then why are they...?"

Lin Xiaowan frowned. "We're going with Shiyu. She's carrying over 280,000 yuan on a bank card—she can't go without someone to keep her safe."

"280,000 yuan?!" Ye Feng blurted.

"Wait, how is it 280,000? Where did all that come from?"

Su Lin looked at Ye Feng like he'd lost his mind. "Ye Feng, are you still half asleep? That's the donation money the school raised for Shiyu's dad."

"Huh? Since when was it that much?"

Su Lin smiled. "We have our very own class president to thank for her extraordinary generosity. She donated 220,000 yuan all by herself. A true role model."

His comment earned him two very different looks: a withering eye-roll from Lin Xiaowan, and a gaze of heartfelt gratitude from Xia Shiyu.

Ye Feng stared at Lin Xiaowan like she'd grown a second head.

'Where did 220,000 yuan come from?'

Hearing Ye Feng mutter to himself, Lin Xiaowan's expression darkened. She kicked Su Lin's shin. "Stop explaining things to him. He's playing dumb."

"Let's just go. The hospital's not far, but we need to make it back before study hall."

Su Lin nodded solemnly. "Right!"

The three of them headed for the school gate, leaving Ye Feng to trail behind, mumbling to himself.

'Everything's changed. How did Lin Xiaowan suddenly donate this much? Sure, her family's rich, but I distinctly remember she only gave 10,000...'

'Even without the 220,000, the numbers don't add up. There's still a 60,000 yuan gap. How is this possible?'

Watching the three of them chatting and laughing up ahead, Ye Feng's composure cracked again.

Especially seeing how comfortably both Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu interacted with Su Lin.

In his past life, those two had barely overlapped socially.

'Could the butterfly effect have kicked in because of my rebirth?'

'But I only just got reborn today. The donations happened days ago—everything should have been following the original timeline. How could there be a butterfly effect?'

Even with over a decade of life experience, Ye Feng was at a loss.

'Could I be remembering wrong?'

'I might mix up other things, but not this. The difference between 50,000 and over 280,000 is pretty hard to confuse—especially when one person donated that much.'

'Could Lin Xiaowan also be a reborn soul?'

'No way. If she were, and she wanted to help Xia Shiyu, she wouldn't have stopped at 220,000. Besides, you can't hide that kind of life experience—she's clearly just a regular high school girl.'

'Forget it. I'm probably overthinking this. Maybe this is a parallel world, not the exact one I came from.'

'If that's the case, some minor differences are to be expected. And the extra money just means I have more to work with.'
