"Drive her to and from school? Can you actually manage that?" Wang Xiaoqian gave Lin Guoqiang a skeptical look.

"Well... if I can't, that's what I have you for." Lin Guoqiang said ingratiatingly.

"But we need a good reason. If we spring this on her out of nowhere, it won't fly. Xiaowan's too perceptive."

"Easy—the college entrance exam. For the sake of the exam, a mayor and a CEO are both willing to rearrange their schedules to chauffeur their daughter. Could she really say no?"

Wang Xiaoqian's eyes narrowed, a smile spreading across her face. "Not bad."

"Once the exam's over, we take her to Beijing. For college, she either goes abroad or attends Tsinghua or Peking University."

"I'm absolutely against studying abroad. But Tsinghua or Peking University works. What if Su Lin follows her there?"

"Heh, I'd actually welcome that. Beijing is a different world—talents everywhere. And Tsinghua and Peking University are gathering places for the nation's best and brightest. Against that competition, Su Lin's edge? Ha..."

"And you're not worried about some other man sweeping Xiaowan off her feet?"

"When she's surrounded by excellence, her standards will keep rising. Eventually she'll set the bar so high that neither of us could find fault with whoever she picks."

"Daughters have to marry someday."

Wang Xiaoqian fell silent.

"Fine. We'll do it your way. You're driving her tomorrow morning."

"Why me?" Lin Guoqiang whined.

Wang Xiaoqian just rolled her eyes. Grand plans were all well and good, but the execution? That was another matter entirely.

...

"Sweetheart, here's the thing. With the college entrance exam coming up, your father and I talked it over and decided to drive you to and from school every day—right up until the exam. That way you can put all your energy into studying and get more rest. What do you think?"

Wang Xiaoqian watched Lin Xiaowan, waiting for her response.

Lin Xiaowan blinked, disbelief written all over her face. "Mom, are you serious?"

"Of course. Your father and I have it all figured out. Starting tomorrow morning. Your dad's driving first."

Hearing that it was real, Lin Xiaowan immediately understood what was going on.

Her mind was razor-sharp. Connecting tonight's events, she put it together in seconds.

They were worried about her dating and had devised this scheme to keep an eye on her.

She didn't know whether to be happy or sad.

Happy that her parents were finally making time for her. Sad that the reason behind it was surveillance, not genuine concern.

"Mom, as long as you can actually get up in time, I'd love it." Lin Xiaowan said with a sweet smile.

Wang Xiaoqian felt a flicker of unease at that smile—something about it seemed devious. But she dismissed the thought. Her own daughter wouldn't scheme against her. She was definitely overthinking it.

"Then it's settled. Tomorrow morning, wake your dad up and he'll take you to school."

"Great!"

Wang Xiaoqian had prepared a whole speech to convince Lin Xiaowan, so the easy agreement caught her pleasantly off guard.

Once her mother left, Lin Xiaowan crept to the door, locked it, opened the window, and called Su Lin.

The phone barely rang before he picked up. "Xiaowan, missing me already?" Su Lin's voice came through, warm and teasing.

"Who's missing you? Are you home yet?"

"Just got back. What's going on?" Su Lin detected something off in her tone.

"The thing is... Su Lin, I've changed my mind."

"Changed your mind about what?" Su Lin asked instinctively.

"About our bet. Can we just... call it off?"

"Absolutely not. Xiaowan, what happened? What's making you want to cancel the bet?" Su Lin's voice turned serious.

"My parents suspect I'm dating. They just grilled me, and I thought that would be the end of it. But now they're saying they'll drive me to and from school starting tomorrow. I think they've figured something out. Su Lin, maybe we should wait until college..."

"College? That's years away! Xiaowan, I can barely survive this one remaining month. You want me to wait three more? Not a chance!" Su Lin declared emphatically.

In truth, Lin Xiaowan's affinity rating was high enough that advancing their relationship wouldn't be a problem. The issue was that without officially being a couple, he couldn't make certain moves.

And now, with the finish line in sight, this curveball? Unacceptable.

"Then what are we supposed to do? If my mom finds out I'm dating in high school, she might transfer me to another school."

"Transfer you? Go ahead. Wherever you go, I'll follow. With my grades, any school's principal would roll out the red carpet."

"Oh, you're so full of yourself. The principal, rolling out the carpet." Lin Xiaowan giggled despite herself.

"I'm dead serious. You should have some idea of what I'm capable of by now."

"This isn't the time for jokes!" Lin Xiaowan stamped her foot anxiously.

"Xiaowan, calm down. Let your parents try the chauffeuring thing for a couple of days. With your arrival time? I don't believe they can keep it up. If they actually do? Well, then you get driven to school—saves you the commute. Win-win."

Lin Xiaowan always got to school early—usually by seven, well before the 8 AM session—because she held the classroom key. She had to be first to arrive so her classmates could get in.

And her parents? Both were the type who worked until they dropped. They barely got enough sleep as it was. Waking up early enough to drive Lin Xiaowan? Not a chance.

If they could have managed it, they would've started long ago.

"But what about the company?"

"You've already signed all the supplier contracts. Just have someone follow up—nothing will fall through the cracks. And you can always go check on weekends." Su Lin said.

"I guess... that's all we can do."

"Relax, Xiaowan. Trust me on this. With your parents' work schedules, I'll be impressed if they last three days."

"Fine. Then I'll set my alarm extra early tomorrow and give them a taste of their own medicine. Hehe."

Hearing that mischievous laugh, Su Lin knew she'd already been plotting.

He couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for Lin Guoqiang and Wang Xiaoqian. Their little down jacket had sprung a leak—and the cold was getting in. He pictured Lin Xiaowan rousing them at the crack of dawn and had to stifle a laugh.

"Alright, Xiaowan. I'll await the good news."

"Mm-hmm!"

After hanging up, Lin Xiaowan buried her face in her hands. She felt terrible for scheming against her own parents.

"Su Lin, if you ever mistreat me, you're dead meat."

The next morning, Lin Xiaowan was up at the crack of dawn. She checked the time—barely past six—and went straight to knock on her parents' door.

Lin Guoqiang and Wang Xiaoqian were startled out of deep sleep, both rubbing their eyes, looking barely conscious.

"Xiaowan, what is it?"

"Dad, didn't you say you'd drive me to school? Time to get up." Lin Xiaowan called from outside the door.

Lin Guoqiang's face went green. Last night he'd been up past one listening to reports in his study, then... other marital obligations had pushed it to well past two. He'd slept barely four hours, and now his daughter was pounding on the door.

He checked the time—just after six. "Xiaowan, it's only six. Why are you up so early?"

"Early? It's not early. By the time I wash up and get ready, it'll be nearly seven. Then the drive to school, and it's time for morning study hall. And that's not even counting breakfast." Lin Xiaowan said from outside the door.

"Kids these days have to get up this early?" Lin Guoqiang said weakly.

Wang Xiaoqian prodded him. "This was your idea. Get moving—don't keep Xiaowan waiting."

"But... honey, I only slept four hours. Driving while fatigued is dangerous."

"You slept four hours? So did I! A certain someone was making grand promises about personally driving her. Don't tell me you've already forgotten."

Lin Guoqiang's face went from green to gray.

In the end, Wang Xiaoqian's persistent shoving got him out of bed.

Lin Xiaowan couldn't help but smile at her bleary-eyed father.

"Dad, hurry up. I need to get to school early."

With that, she gave him her back, a silent taunt. 'Try to outmaneuver me? Karma's a boomerang.'

Deep down, if Lin Guoqiang and Wang Xiaoqian genuinely wanted to drive her to school, she'd be thrilled. But she knew their motives weren't pure—they were trying to separate her from Su Lin and monitor her.

That rubbed her the wrong way.

Hence the early morning revenge.

By the time they finally reached the school, the sun was well up, and Lin Xiaowan stormed toward the classroom with a dark expression.

Lin Guoqiang watched the students filing in. "It's not even first period yet. Why is she so upset?"

He started to drive away—and that's when a Mercedes pulled up from the opposite direction.

Lin Guoqiang recognized it instantly. That was Su Lin's car. And that was Su Lin behind the wheel.

His face turned thunderous.

"That kid actually drives to school. Brazen as they come. I'm getting his car impounded today. Hmph—instead of studying, he's chasing my daughter."

Su Lin noticed the Audi and the man inside glaring at him with murderous intent.

"What's that guy's problem?"
