Back in the classroom, Su Lin saw Lin Xiaowan looking toward the doorway. When she spotted him, she shot him a sassy glare, then turned her head away in a show of displeasure.

Su Lin walked over with a grin and pulled his chair right next to Lin Xiaowan's. "Oh my, who upset our Xiaowan?"

"Who's 'your' Xiaowan? Su Lin, watch what you say." Lin Xiaowan gave him another look.

"Ahem, Xiaowan, I really didn't mean to earlier. I just saw Ye Feng pull you away and got worried he might do something to you, so I followed to check. Then I happened to overhear some things. I really didn't mean to." Su Lin explained.

"Hmph, how would I know if you're telling the truth? This is school—what could Ye Feng possibly do to me?"

"Just because it's school doesn't mean nothing can happen. Ye Feng just tried to fight me."

"What? You two fought?" Lin Xiaowan's eyes immediately scanned up and down Su Lin's body, checking for injuries.

"You're not hurt, are you?"

Su Lin waved his hand dismissively. "With Ye Feng's build, you think he could beat me? I grabbed him and gave him one knee strike. He's probably still lying there."

"Why did you hit him so hard? It's fine if you hurt him, but what if the police got involved?"

"Ahem, I was just warning that guy. I've been too nice to him lately, made him think he could do whatever he wanted. Had to push back a little."

"Push back? Ye Feng wasn't wrong about what he said. Su Lin, don't think I don't know what you're planning. Dream on—it's not happening." Lin Xiaowan glared at him fiercely.

Su Lin reached out and pinched Lin Xiaowan's cheek. "What are you thinking, Xiaowan? Am I that kind of person?"

"Tch! Su Lin, you're so fake. You're going to tell me you've never thought about having us both?"

"Ahem, well, of course I've thought about it. But it can't happen, so I stopped thinking about it ages ago."

"Hmph, at least you have some self-awareness. That kind of thing—neither Xiaoyu nor I would agree to it. Su Lin, looks like I need to reconsider this whole girlfriend thing." Lin Xiaowan said seriously.

"Wait, wait, don't! Xiaowan, you can't go back on your word. And those were just thoughts—I only thought about it! Xiaowan, you're still my favorite."

"Go away. Just go away. So cheesy!"

Lin Xiaowan was flustered by Su Lin's combo attack. She pushed at him with her hands, but couldn't budge him. Suddenly, Su Lin withdrew the arm she was pushing against, and she tumbled right into his embrace.

"Xiaowan, I haven't even beaten Ye Feng yet, and you're already throwing yourself at me?"

Lin Xiaowan gritted her teeth. "I was wrong before. You're not a gentleman at all. You're a scoundrel."

Su Lin gently flicked Lin Xiaowan's nose with a smile. "I'm actually happy when you call me a scoundrel. Unlike Xiaoyu, who keeps giving me friend-zone cards."

"Pfft!"

Lin Xiaowan burst out laughing at Su Lin's complaint.

Xia Shiyu really did say Su Lin was a good person all the time. Not just to Su Lin, but to her as well.

Those friend-zone cards—she handed out several every day.

"What, you're not happy when Xiaoyu friend-zones you?"

Su Lin shook his head. "Of course not. As long as you don't friend-zone me."

"Hmph, that depends on my mood. Su Lin, if you ever eavesdrop on me again, just wait for my friend-zone card."

"Relax, I definitely won't do it again." Su Lin raised both hands in surrender.

Seeing Su Lin like this, all of Lin Xiaowan's resentment evaporated. She straightened up in her seat. "Su Lin, how do you plan to treat Xiaoyu?"

"Hmm. How would you like me to treat Xiaoyu?"

Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "I don't know. Su Lin, Xiaoyu likes you. Why did you have to go and celebrate her birthday? After that birthday, the way she looks at you changed completely."

"Um... the way Xiaoyu looks at me changed? Is it that obvious?"

Su Lin hadn't noticed anything different about how Xia Shiyu looked at him.

It seemed the same as always.

"Su Lin, you're the one involved, so you might not feel it. But when I'm watching from the side, I can clearly sense it. When Xiaoyu looks at you, her eyes light up. There's this sweetness in the air, especially the smile on her face when she's looking at you."

"And when you're not around, she just seems listless. She's constantly looking toward the door, spacing out every few seconds. Sometimes I call her and she doesn't even respond."

Su Lin scratched his head, a bit overwhelmed. "It's really that obvious?"

"Very obvious. Su Lin, what exactly are you going to do?"

"Let me think about it."

"Think faster. The longer you drag this out, the harder it'll be for all of us." Lin Xiaowan reminded him.

Su Lin nodded. This problem had always been there, but it was just that before, he hadn't wanted to face it.

He was someone who wanted everything. He didn't want to give up Xia Shiyu, nor did he want to give up Lin Xiaowan.

Both of them—he wanted them all.

Su Lin took a deep breath and looked at Lin Xiaowan seriously. "Xiaowan, what if I said I didn't want to give up either of you? What would you do?"

Lin Xiaowan was stunned. She hadn't expected Su Lin to be so direct.

"You're saying you want to have both of us?"

Su Lin nodded. "Yes."

"Not happening!" Lin Xiaowan stood up sharply. "Su Lin, I'm telling you—that's absolutely impossible. If you dare do that, I'll... I'll..."

"You'll what?"

Lin Xiaowan was clearly flustered. Her mind was a mess and she couldn't think of anything to threaten him with.

In the end, she stomped her foot. "Anyway, don't even think about it!"

Watching Lin Xiaowan's reaction, Su Lin knew this wasn't something that could be resolved in a day or two.

But he believed that eventually, Lin Xiaowan would accept it.

Because deep down, she'd already accepted Xia Shiyu as her romantic rival. The fact that she could coexist peacefully with Xia Shiyu—even be best friends—showed that subconsciously, she'd already acknowledged this possibility.

She just needed time.

"Xiaowan, don't be angry. I was just saying—just saying. Come on, we have class soon. Sit down."

"Hmph!"

Lin Xiaowan sat down again, but her face was still flushed and her chest heaved rapidly.

Su Lin's words had truly shaken her. She'd never considered the possibility of sharing Su Lin with someone else.

But thinking about it now... if it were Xia Shiyu... maybe... possibly...

'No! What am I thinking?!'

Lin Xiaowan shook her head vigorously, trying to dispel these chaotic thoughts.

Su Lin watched her struggle, a knowing smile playing at his lips.

The seed had been planted. Now he just needed to let it grow.
