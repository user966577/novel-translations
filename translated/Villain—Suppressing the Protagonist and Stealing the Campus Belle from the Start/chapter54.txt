Lin Xiaowan winked at him, looking quite proud of herself.

Su Lin chuckled.

---

A few days into April, Xia Junming's surgery began.

The operation was scheduled for daytime, but by the time Su Lin and the others got out of school, it still wasn't finished.

Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan stayed at the hospital with Xia Shiyu.

"Xiaoyu, don't be nervous. Uncle Xia is blessed. He'll definitely be fine."

Xia Shiyu threw her arms around Lin Xiaowan. "Xiaowan, I know worrying doesn't help at this point, but I'm still scared."

"It'll be fine, it'll be fine. I looked into this doctor—he's very skilled. He's done many kidney transplants. It'll definitely go smoothly." Lin Xiaowan patted Xia Shiyu's back.

"Mm!"

Su Lin watched the two girls embrace, his eyes full of envy.

If only he were in the middle.

Two girls of this caliber hugging together was a feast for the eyes.

Su Lin noticed that Lin Xiaowan's temperament was gradually changing. The more time she spent with him, the less she interacted with others.

She was especially indignant toward anyone who badmouthed Su Lin.

This had given her an aloof air, though she wasn't actually cold at all.

But since she gave dirty looks to anyone who criticized Su Lin, her temperament had only improved over time.

She had the aloofness of a goddess combined with the grace of an aristocratic daughter—utterly lovable.

Looking at this beautiful scene, Su Lin desperately wanted to join them.

Ahem... making that dream come true would be a long road.

But Su Lin didn't think it was impossible.

Probe!

[Xia Shiyu: 18 years old, 162cm, 44kg, current affection: (99↑ stalled)]

[Lin Xiaowan: 17 years old, 168cm, 48kg, current affection: (81↑ stalled)]

Su Lin was somewhat surprised to see Xia Shiyu's information. Eighteen?

Could today be Xia Shiyu's birthday?

"System, is today Xiaoyu's birthday?"

[Yes, Host!]

The system couldn't be wrong, which meant today really was Xia Shiyu's eighteenth birthday.

For a girl, an eighteenth birthday wasn't something to be celebrated carelessly. Su Lin made a mental note.

Seeing her affection at 99, he was a bit surprised.

But upon reflection, it made sense. In a way, Xia Shiyu was the easiest girl to pursue.

Of course, that was only true at this particular moment.

Once this moment passed, winning over Xia Shiyu would become much harder.

'Xiaowan's affection stopped at 81. Looks like ordinary approaches won't work on her anymore. I'll need to do something unconventional.'

But Su Lin wasn't worried. At 81, that was already enough for him and Lin Xiaowan to... well. He just couldn't let her find out about him and Xia Shiyu.

Taking advantage of the moment while the two girls were together, Su Lin texted Chen Yang and asked him to order a cake and deliver it.

Chen Yang agreed readily.

He did whatever Su Lin asked now. Without Su Lin, there would be no current version of himself. Even if Su Lin asked him to do something shady, he wouldn't hesitate.

So with one phone call, Chen Yang rushed out to order the cake.

After arranging the cake, Su Lin approached the two girls. "Xiaoyu, don't worry too much. At this point, we can only trust the doctors."

Xia Shiyu's face was pale. "But... they went in at noon, and it's been six hours already."

"Six hours isn't that long for a kidney transplant. This isn't minor surgery."

"I know!"

Seeing her state, Su Lin didn't offer more consolation. He was feeling a bit frustrated—why had he brought Lin Xiaowan along?

If Lin Xiaowan weren't here, he'd already be holding Xia Shiyu and comforting her properly.

But that was impossible right now. With Lin Xiaowan present, if he held Xia Shiyu to comfort her, Lin Xiaowan would probably transfer schools tomorrow.

Su Lin understood her personality well enough.

Lin Xiaowan was an extremely proud woman. Unless her affection reached 100, even at 99, if she learned that Su Lin wanted both of them, she'd run.

The three continued waiting until Su Lin received a text from Chen Yang.

Su Lin checked the time. It was getting late—the sky outside had already darkened.

He patted Lin Xiaowan's back. "Xiaowan, it's getting late. You still have class tomorrow. Let me take you home first?"

"Is your driver still downstairs?"

Su Lin shook his head. "I already sent Uncle Liu home. I just kept the car."

Lin Xiaowan felt warmth in her heart. She realized Su Lin had kept the car specifically to drive her home later.

She looked at Xia Shiyu. "Xiaoyu, I'll head back first. I'll be waiting for your good news at home."

"Mm, thank you, Xiaowan!"

Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "Why are you thanking me? We're best friends."

"Mm! We're best friends forever."

'What best friends? Family. We're all family,' Su Lin thought smugly.

"Xiaoyu, wait here. Let me take Xiaowan home."

Xia Shiyu nodded with a smile.

Su Lin left with Lin Xiaowan.

"Ah, finally Uncle Xia's worry is resolved." Lin Xiaowan stretched, her stunning curves fully exposed before Su Lin's eyes.

"What, you've only been sitting for a while and you're tired already?"

Lin Xiaowan rubbed her shoulders and nodded. "I don't know why, but just sitting there waiting felt so oppressive. My chest felt tight."

"Nobody feels good sitting outside an operating room. Not until the surgery ends."

"Hehe, Su Lin, do you think Uncle Xia will be alright?"

Su Lin nodded. "He will. Definitely. As long as the kidney transplant goes through, Uncle Xia will be just like a normal person after six months of recovery."

"Mm! Then you've done a great deed. Saving a life is worth more than building a seven-story pagoda."

Su Lin smiled lightly. "The doctors are the ones saving him. I just paid for it."

"That depends on how you look at it. The doctors did the saving, true, but you're the one who made them pick up the scalpel."

"Heh. Let's not talk about that. Come on, let me take you home."

"Okay!"

After dropping Lin Xiaowan off, Su Lin drove to the cake shop where Chen Yang had ordered.

When Su Lin arrived, Chen Yang was already sitting there with the packaged cake.

Seeing Su Lin's car stop, Chen Yang picked up the cake and walked out.

"Yang, sorry for the trouble. Making you come out to buy a cake."

Chen Yang smiled. "No trouble at all. Grandpa's watching the house, and my little sister is very well-behaved. They know I'm working for you, so when I said I had something to do, they just let me go."

"Heh. How are your sister's grades? She should be in her first year of high school now, right?"

Chen Yang nodded. "My sister's grades are better than mine. She's currently first in her school."

"Grades that good—she'll definitely go to our First High for high school."

"Heh. Before, that would've been impossible. But now it definitely can happen."

Previously, when the family had no money, Chen Lin had told him several times she wanted to drop out after middle school and work to help support the family.

Now with Su Lin's patronage, Chen Yang had money. There was no way he'd let Chen Lin go work. Education was the most important thing.

"Brother Lin, whose birthday is it today?"

Su Lin kicked Chen Yang playfully. "Now you're making jokes at my expense."

"Heh, on this matter, the whole school admires you, Brother Lin. The two flowers of our school—you've taken them both."

Su Lin waved his hand. "What do you mean 'taken'? They were attracted to me. Attracted, understand? Never mind, you wouldn't get it. When you have a girlfriend someday, you'll understand."

Chen Yang shook his head seriously. "Dating is impossible for me. Right now I only want to make money. I want to earn so much money that my family never has to worry about it again."

"Ambitious. Work hard then. I'm heading out—Xiaoyu's still waiting for me."

"Mm, then I'll head back too, Brother Lin. Call if you need anything."

"Sure."

Su Lin put the cake in the back seat and drove back to the hospital.

By then, Xia Junming's surgery was finished.

Su Lin had just gotten upstairs when he saw Xia Shiyu holding a boxed meal, about to eat.

Su Lin walked over and took the meal box from her hands. "Where's Uncle Xia?"

"He's been transferred to a ward."

"Mm. Go to the nurses' station and arrange for a caregiver. Starting today, hire one. Then come with me."

"Ah! Su Lin, a caregiver isn't necessary. I can take care of my dad myself."

Hospital caregivers were genuinely expensive. One day's caregiver fee equaled a week's wages for an ordinary worker.

Su Lin said calmly, "Problems that money can solve aren't problems. Just hire one. The money I gave you is for Uncle Xia's treatment, not to sit in a bank account collecting interest."

"Oh..."

Though she'd been told off, Xia Shiyu still felt sweet inside. Following Su Lin's instructions, she went to the nurses' station.

After arranging for the caregiver, she came back to find the meal box gone from Su Lin's hands.

"Su Lin, where's my meal?"

Su Lin looked disgusted. "That meal looked like unsanitary fast food. I threw it away."

"I hadn't even eaten it yet! Why did you throw it away? What a waste."

Su Lin pulled Xia Shiyu toward the stairs without giving her a chance to argue. "What's so great about fast food? Come on, I'm treating you to a proper meal."

"Wait... I..."

"No waiting. The caregiver will handle everything. Let's go."

And so Xia Shiyu followed Su Lin all the way to the parking lot.

"Get in!"

At his word, Xia Shiyu opened the door and got in without hesitation.

She'd just sat down when she noticed the cake in the back seat.

Xia Shiyu looked at Su Lin happily. "Su Lin, is today your birthday?"

Su Lin let out a long sigh, then turned and pinched Xia Shiyu's cheek. "You little dummy. Today is YOUR birthday. How could you forget your own birthday?"

"My... my... birthday?"

Xia Shiyu pointed at herself, momentarily stunned.

Within seconds, her eyes reddened.

Tears fell with a splatter.

Xia Shiyu could no longer control her emotions. She threw her arms around Su Lin. "Su Lin... wuwu...!"
