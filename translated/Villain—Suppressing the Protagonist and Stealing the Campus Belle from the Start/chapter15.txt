In the cafeteria, Su Lin sat across from Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu.

Su Lin was shoveling food enthusiastically. Xia Shiyu ate daintily in small bites. Only Lin Xiaowan seemed distracted, poking at her rice with her chopsticks, lost in thought.

Both Su Lin and Xia Shiyu noticed.

"Shiyu, what's up with Xiaowan?"

Xia Shiyu shook her head. "No idea. She was fine this morning."

"Ask her."

Su Lin's concern for Lin Xiaowan dimmed something in Xia Shiyu's eyes for just a moment.

Then she nodded. "Okay."

She gently shook Lin Xiaowan's shoulder. "Xiaowan, what's the matter? You're barely eating. Something on your mind?"

Lin Xiaowan looked up and shot Su Lin a glare. "Nothing. What would I have on my mind?"

Su Lin was bewildered. "You say nothing's wrong, but you're glaring at me because...?"

"This is all your fault. You and your jinxing."

"Me? Jinxing?"

"Yes! Yesterday when you said Huanhuan would—"

Lin Xiaowan caught herself just in time, but Su Lin had already connected the dots.

Yan Huan would go to extreme lengths for petty gains.

The novel had documented her pattern extensively—borrowing money from everyone and then having Ye Feng pay it back. After Ye Feng's rebirth, he'd refused to keep bailing her out. The whole thing had blown up right before exams.

That was when everyone discovered just how many people Yan Huan owed.

Su Lin chuckled. "So I was right."

Xia Shiyu looked at him. "Su Lin, what's this about?"

Su Lin shrugged. "Just a little prediction that came true, unfortunately."

"Just eat. You've got a mouth—might as well use it for food."

"I'd love to, but the cafeteria's stingy with the meat dishes. Xiaowan, you know me—I've been spoiled my whole life. Since you're not touching yours, mind sharing?"

"Fine, fine. Take it all."

She scraped every piece of meat from her plate onto Su Lin's.

"Hey, it'd just go to waste otherwise."

"Hmph."

Lin Xiaowan knew she was being petty. But she couldn't help it.

She and Yan Huan could have ended things on good terms. Instead, this had happened, and now sitting next to each other in class would be awkward.

And it was all because Su Lin's warning had opened her eyes.

But watching him accept her irritation without complaint, not a trace of annoyance on his face—just that indulgent smile—something warm bloomed in her chest.

That smile of his was dangerously charming.

Xia Shiyu watched the exchange with quiet envy.

'If Su Lin treated me like that...'

She shook the thought away as quickly as it came. Unrealistic.

Su Lin had donated generously, sure, but she knew it was pure kindness toward a classmate.

He didn't think of her that way.

But Xia Shiyu only knew half the story.

The current Su Lin wasn't just pursuing Lin Xiaowan. Xia Shiyu was very much on his radar too.

The trio's interaction drew its usual audience of onlookers.

Feng Yifei was practically seething. "That bastard! When he makes a move, he goes for both of them at once!"

"Feng, maybe aim a little lower. Try Yan Huan. She might not be Xia Shiyu or Lin Xiaowan, but she's got a killer figure. And she's not ugly either."

"Seriously, bro. Yan Huan's body is insane. Those proportions? As for her face—lights off, they're all the same."

Feng Yifei wavered. "But Yan Huan's the girl Ye Feng's into. The guy might be a nobody academically, but he can throw a punch."

"So what? Just because he likes her doesn't mean she's his. Everyone has the right to pursue who they want."

"Exactly. With a body like that, you're telling me you're not interested?"

Feng Yifei's gaze swept across the cafeteria and landed on Yan Huan, chatting away with her friends.

He had to admit—Yan Huan's figure was genuinely top-tier among their class.

"If you put Lin Xiaowan's face on that body, it'd be perfection."

"Dream on. The goddess wouldn't look twice at you. And for the record, Lin Xiaowan's figure is nothing to sneeze at either."

"She just dresses conservatively. Trust me—years of experience here—hers are bigger than Yan Huan's."

Feng Yifei scoffed. "Lin Xiaowan's pretty, sure, but bigger than Yan Huan? No way."

"Bro, she wears loose clothes. That's all."

"I don't buy it. I've been dating since seventh grade. Don't tell me I don't know what I'm looking at."

"Alright, alright, drop it before we ruin a friendship."

"But seriously, Feng—are you into Yan Huan or not? Because if you're passing, I'm making my move."

Feng Yifei glared at Liang Jun. "Of course I'm going for it. A body like that, and you think Ye Feng deserves it?"

"When the time comes, we just round up the boys and sort him out."

"Right. Ye Feng might hold his own one-on-one, but get enough of us together and he's done."

"Then it's settled. I'll go chat up Yan Huan after lunch. You guys head back to class."

"Good luck, Feng. Take her down in one shot."

"Heh. No problem. Yan Huan acts all proper, but dressing like that every day? She's clearly looking for attention."

"Hahahaha!"

The table erupted in laughter—the kind only guys understood.

Hearing them, Su Lin glanced toward Feng Yifei's group.

'Looks like Feng Yifei's about to make his move on Yan Huan. Wonder if it'll go down the same way as in the original—with Ye Feng handing him a humiliating defeat.'

Then Su Lin remembered: he'd already sabotaged Ye Feng's path to his first fortune.

Without that money, how was Ye Feng supposed to flex? How was he supposed to embarrass Feng Yifei and Yan Huan?

So in a roundabout way, he'd actually helped Feng Yifei.

'Life's funny like that. Who would've thought my little scheme would land Feng Yifei the girl?'

"Su Lin, what are you mumbling about? Speak up."

Su Lin laughed. "I was just thinking—Xiaowan's pretty cute when she pouts."

Lin Xiaowan rolled her pretty eyes. "Maybe spend less time thinking about nonsense and more time studying."

"Your parents gave you such beautiful eyes, and you use them to roll at people. What a waste."

"Hmph... smooth-talker!"

Su Lin and Chen Yang spent the entire weekend camped out at the internet cafe, buying up Destiny Necklaces.

To Su Lin's pleasant surprise, luck was on their side. After three days, they'd accumulated 4,500 necklaces.

Far beyond his expectations.

"Boss, the price hit 200 and we've only gotten one in the last two hours. I think we've tapped out the supply." Chen Yang sounded almost wistful.

Three days of work had earned him over 10,000 yuan. Easy money.

He knew a gig like this was once-in-a-lifetime. Su Lin had chosen him out of respect—anyone could've done the job.

The guilt gnawed at him. He felt he'd taken too much.

Su Lin smiled. "Don't be dramatic. The buying's done, sure, but we haven't sold a single one yet. Chen Yang, you didn't think this was charity, did you? This is business."

"If this stockpile tanks, that's tens of thousands down the drain."

"Just tell me what you need, boss." Chen Yang's eyes sharpened. He was back in work mode.

He wasn't afraid of Su Lin giving him more tasks. He was afraid of Su Lin having nothing left for him to do.

Su Lin grinned. "Simple. Phase two: promotion. Get your people onto Tieba, the game forums, GameHome, 17173—every gaming community out there—and start hyping the Destiny Necklace. All-out hype. Focus on the splash damage stacking mechanic."

"Hype it? Boss, that necklace's splash damage is terrible. Even with stacking, it's worthless."

"Just do it. Don't worry about anything else. Have them post threads, reply to their own posts, build artificial buzz. Get the threads trending."

"This... okay. Whatever you say, boss."

Su Lin nodded. "For now, just execute. If you don't understand something, don't overthink it. Follow my instructions."

"Got it!"

"Good. I'm heading home. School tomorrow. Finish setting things up and get home early too."

"Will do, boss."

Su Lin clapped Chen Yang on the shoulder and left, satisfied.

The net was cast. All that remained was for Ye Feng to return from his rebirth and swim right into it. When that happened, things were going to get very interesting.

Su Lin wondered if his trap might kill the protagonist's plot entirely.

After a moment's thought, he dismissed the idea. Probably not. Ye Feng was still the protagonist—the chosen son of this world's fortune.

...

Monday.

After the flag-raising ceremony and morning calisthenics, Principal Lu Weifeng began his address. Meanwhile, Xia Shiyu had been called to wait behind the assembly stage.

"This fundraiser collected a total of 280,000 yuan in cash. The school has decided..."

Watching the principal hold forth from the podium, Su Lin did the math in his head.

'The original novel only raised 50,000. Now it's 280,000. Take out my 200,000 and Lin Xiaowan's extra 10,000, and there's still 70,000.'

'The butterfly effect showed up fast.'

'Wonder if Ye Feng's going to lose his mind when he gets back.'

Whether Ye Feng lost his mind, Su Lin had no way of knowing. But he nearly did himself.

The principal handed the entire 280,000 yuan—on a bank card—directly to Xia Shiyu.

All of it. Just like that. Given to a high school girl.

What the...

After a beat, Su Lin supposed it made sense. The school was fully aware of Xia Shiyu's family situation. Her relatives had all abandoned her. Her father was hospitalized. Unless Principal Lu wanted to make a PR spectacle by marching to the hospital with an entourage, there wasn't really another option.

And clearly, the principal had no interest in that kind of show.

Xia Shiyu clutched the bank card and delivered a tearful speech of gratitude.

Her eyes kept drifting to Su Lin.

He smiled and gave her a subtle fist pump.

After she finished and stepped offstage, the principal droned on. Su Lin was half asleep on his feet when Xia Shiyu rejoined the class formation and the crowd stirred.

Wang Yi approached her. "Go to the hospital right after class to deliver the money. Your father can't wait any longer."

Xia Shiyu nodded earnestly. "Yes, Teacher Wang."

"Take two classmates with you. Lin Xiaowan and Ye Feng."

Lin Xiaowan was the class president, and Ye Feng had grown up alongside Xia Shiyu. Wang Yi figured the pair was a natural choice.

"Teacher, aren't you coming with us?" Xia Shiyu asked nervously.

After all, this was over 280,000 yuan on a single bank card. What if they ran into trouble?

Wang Yi shook his head. "I can't come along this time. The school's short-staffed as it is—too many classes per teacher. I simply don't have the time."

"Besides, it's not like you're carrying cash. Should be fine."

"If you're worried about safety, bring a couple more classmates along."

Xia Shiyu nodded.

She was already thinking about whether to invite Su Lin.

For reasons she couldn't quite articulate, she felt safer with him around.

After the assembly ended, Xia Shiyu went straight to Su Lin and asked if he'd like to accompany them to the hospital.

Su Lin thought it over briefly, then agreed.

In the original novel, Ye Feng had sweet-talked his way into borrowing the 50,000 yuan on the way to the hospital—and it had only taken a few sentences.

Su Lin knew it was because the plot had forcibly dumbed down both Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan.

He wondered whether his presence this time would change things.

Not that he was here to stop Ye Feng from borrowing money. Quite the opposite—he wanted Ye Feng to borrow as much as possible. The harder the fall, the better.

"Su Lin, thank you. You've already donated so much, and you're still willing to come along."

Looking at Xia Shiyu's grateful, fragile expression, Su Lin felt the urge to pat her head. He thought better of it—too familiar—and settled for scratching the back of his own head with a sheepish grin. "Shiyu, come on. You're going to be working for me someday, remember? Let's not stand on ceremony."

"Mm-hmm!" Xia Shiyu beamed, nodding eagerly.

She'd sensed Su Lin reaching out to do something affectionate a moment ago and had already braced herself for it.

When he pulled his hand back, she'd actually felt a pang of disappointment, thinking he didn't want to be close to her.

His follow-up words chased that worry away.

Gazing at Su Lin's handsome, sunny face, Xia Shiyu wished this moment could last forever.

But Su Lin's attention had already shifted to Ye Feng.

Less than twenty minutes until the guy's rebirth kicked in.

'Tsk, tsk.'
