Su Lin and Chen Yang spent the entire weekend camped out at the internet cafe, buying up Destiny Necklaces.

To Su Lin's pleasant surprise, luck was on their side. After three days, they'd accumulated 4,500 necklaces.

Far beyond his expectations.

"Boss, the price hit 200 and we've only gotten one in the last two hours. I think we've tapped out the supply." Chen Yang sounded almost wistful.

Three days of work had earned him over 10,000 yuan. Easy money.

He knew a gig like this was once-in-a-lifetime. Su Lin had chosen him out of respect—anyone could've done the job.

The guilt gnawed at him. He felt he'd taken too much.

Su Lin smiled. "Don't be dramatic. The buying's done, sure, but we haven't sold a single one yet. Chen Yang, you didn't think this was charity, did you? This is business."

"If this stockpile tanks, that's tens of thousands down the drain."

"Just tell me what you need, boss." Chen Yang's eyes sharpened. He was back in work mode.

He wasn't afraid of Su Lin giving him more tasks. He was afraid of Su Lin having nothing left for him to do.

Su Lin grinned. "Simple. Phase two: promotion. Get your people onto Tieba, the game forums, GameHome, 17173—every gaming community out there—and start hyping the Destiny Necklace. All-out hype. Focus on the splash damage stacking mechanic."

"Hype it? Boss, that necklace's splash damage is terrible. Even with stacking, it's worthless."

"Just do it. Don't worry about anything else. Have them post threads, reply to their own posts, build artificial buzz. Get the threads trending."

"This... okay. Whatever you say, boss."

Su Lin nodded. "For now, just execute. If you don't understand something, don't overthink it. Follow my instructions."

"Got it!"

"Good. I'm heading home. School tomorrow. Finish setting things up and get home early too."

"Will do, boss."

Su Lin clapped Chen Yang on the shoulder and left, satisfied.

The net was cast. All that remained was for Ye Feng to return from his rebirth and swim right into it. When that happened, things were going to get very interesting.

Su Lin wondered if his trap might kill the protagonist's plot entirely.

After a moment's thought, he dismissed the idea. Probably not. Ye Feng was still the protagonist—the chosen son of this world's fortune.

...

Monday.

After the flag-raising ceremony and morning calisthenics, Principal Lu Weifeng began his address. Meanwhile, Xia Shiyu had been called to wait behind the assembly stage.

"This fundraiser collected a total of 280,000 yuan in cash. The school has decided..."

Watching the principal hold forth from the podium, Su Lin did the math in his head.

'The original novel only raised 50,000. Now it's 280,000. Take out my 200,000 and Lin Xiaowan's extra 10,000, and there's still 70,000.'

'The butterfly effect showed up fast.'

'Wonder if Ye Feng's going to lose his mind when he gets back.'

Whether Ye Feng lost his mind, Su Lin had no way of knowing. But he nearly did himself.

The principal handed the entire 280,000 yuan—on a bank card—directly to Xia Shiyu.

All of it. Just like that. Given to a high school girl.

What the...

After a beat, Su Lin supposed it made sense. The school was fully aware of Xia Shiyu's family situation. Her relatives had all abandoned her. Her father was hospitalized. Unless Principal Lu wanted to make a PR spectacle by marching to the hospital with an entourage, there wasn't really another option.

And clearly, the principal had no interest in that kind of show.

Xia Shiyu clutched the bank card and delivered a tearful speech of gratitude.

Her eyes kept drifting to Su Lin.

He smiled and gave her a subtle fist pump.

After she finished and stepped offstage, the principal droned on. Su Lin was half asleep on his feet when Xia Shiyu rejoined the class formation and the crowd stirred.

Wang Yi approached her. "Go to the hospital right after class to deliver the money. Your father can't wait any longer."

Xia Shiyu nodded earnestly. "Yes, Teacher Wang."

"Take two classmates with you. Lin Xiaowan and Ye Feng."

Lin Xiaowan was the class president, and Ye Feng had grown up alongside Xia Shiyu. Wang Yi figured the pair was a natural choice.

"Teacher, aren't you coming with us?" Xia Shiyu asked nervously.

After all, this was over 280,000 yuan on a single bank card. What if they ran into trouble?

Wang Yi shook his head. "I can't come along this time. The school's short-staffed as it is—too many classes per teacher. I simply don't have the time."

"Besides, it's not like you're carrying cash. Should be fine."

"If you're worried about safety, bring a couple more classmates along."

Xia Shiyu nodded.

She was already thinking about whether to invite Su Lin.

For reasons she couldn't quite articulate, she felt safer with him around.

After the assembly ended, Xia Shiyu went straight to Su Lin and asked if he'd like to accompany them to the hospital.

Su Lin thought it over briefly, then agreed.

In the original novel, Ye Feng had sweet-talked his way into borrowing the 50,000 yuan on the way to the hospital—and it had only taken a few sentences.

Su Lin knew it was because the plot had forcibly dumbed down both Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan.

He wondered whether his presence this time would change things.

Not that he was here to stop Ye Feng from borrowing money. Quite the opposite—he wanted Ye Feng to borrow as much as possible. The harder the fall, the better.

"Su Lin, thank you. You've already donated so much, and you're still willing to come along."

Looking at Xia Shiyu's grateful, fragile expression, Su Lin felt the urge to pat her head. He thought better of it—too familiar—and settled for scratching the back of his own head with a sheepish grin. "Shiyu, come on. You're going to be working for me someday, remember? Let's not stand on ceremony."

"Mm-hmm!" Xia Shiyu beamed, nodding eagerly.

She'd sensed Su Lin reaching out to do something affectionate a moment ago and had already braced herself for it.

When he pulled his hand back, she'd actually felt a pang of disappointment, thinking he didn't want to be close to her.

His follow-up words chased that worry away.

Gazing at Su Lin's handsome, sunny face, Xia Shiyu wished this moment could last forever.

But Su Lin's attention had already shifted to Ye Feng.

Less than twenty minutes until the guy's rebirth kicked in.

'Tsk, tsk.'
