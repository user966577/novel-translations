Su Lin thought of Li Hongyang—Su Zhenguo's right-hand man would surely have connections to elevator manufacturers.

"Your budget probably can't cover an elevator though."

Su Lin shook his head. "It's plenty. And it's all thanks to you, Xiaowan—you saved me 200,000 yuan. That should be enough for two floors, maybe with a little extra on top."

Su Lin didn't know the current price of elevators, but he figured 200,000 for a two-floor installation should be more than enough.

At this, Lin Xiaowan's chest puffed up with pride. "Of course. Without me, they wouldn't have sold at a million, let alone what you paid. You'd better give me a bigger share of the company."

Su Lin burst out laughing. "Not a single yuan in salary."

'Wham!'

"Are you part horse? Why do you keep kicking people?"

"Because you keep provoking me on purpose! I saved you all that money, run around helping you day and night, and you won't even pay me? You're treating me like free labor!" Lin Xiaowan said indignantly.

She hadn't actually been thinking about pay, but hearing Su Lin say it out loud still stung.

Su Lin stepped forward, took Lin Xiaowan's hand in his, and gave her nose a gentle pinch. "Silly girl. Don't forget—we're starting this business together. Paying you a salary doesn't make sense."

"No salary, sure. But equity? I've already set aside shares for you, Shiyu, and Chen Yang."

At that very moment, across the street in a parked Audi, Lin Guoqiang was having a meltdown. "That brat! How dare he take liberties with my daughter!"

Tian Wei watched Lin Xiaowan's blissful expression and thought to himself: 'That's not taking liberties. That's straight-up flirting.'

"Should we go over, Guoqiang?"

"Go over? And do what—watch my daughter flirt with some boy? Let's go, let's go. Out of sight, out of mind. We'll deal with this at home!" Lin Guoqiang waved dismissively.

Tian Wei was surprised. Even after seeing all that, Lin Guoqiang wasn't going to intervene?

What Tian Wei didn't realize was that Lin Guoqiang was agonizing internally. Every instinct screamed at him to storm over and drag Lin Xiaowan away. But reason told him that would only make things worse—Lin Xiaowan would lean even harder toward Su Lin. And then there was that smile on Lin Xiaowan's face. That genuine, radiant, from-the-heart smile.

'When was the last time I saw her smile like that? High school? Middle school? Elementary school?'

'It's been that long since I've seen my daughter truly happy.'

In the car, Lin Guoqiang engaged in painful self-reflection. In the end, all he could manage was a heavy sigh.

For eighteen years, he'd taken a hands-off approach to raising Lin Xiaowan. She'd been so sensible, never giving him any trouble.

But the more sensible she was, the guiltier he felt.

"I've owed her too much for too long."

...

On the other side, as Lin Xiaowan and Su Lin were horsing around, she caught a glimpse of an Audi pulling away in the distance. It looked familiar—like her father's car.

But she quickly dismissed the thought. Knowing Lin Guoqiang's personality, if he'd actually seen her fooling around with Su Lin, he would've marched over and taken her home on the spot. It must have been someone else's Audi.

"What is it, Xiaowan? What are you looking at?"

"Nothing... just saw a car pass by that looked familiar."

Su Lin followed her gaze but only caught a glimpse of an Audi's side profile before it vanished.

"That looked like an Audi. Don't tell me you think it's your dad."

Lin Xiaowan shot him a look. "It's not impossible. My dad's car could show up anywhere in the city—except at the school."

Su Lin took Lin Xiaowan's hand. "No worries. You've got me to drive you."

"Mm-hmm!"

"Su Lin, let's go check on Shiyu and then grab dinner together." Lin Xiaowan said with a beaming smile.

"You don't eat at home anymore, huh? Every night it's dinner with us."

"You know how my family is. When my mom's less busy, I get a home-cooked dinner. But with the trade business booming, she's working late every night. No time to cook."

"Alright, get in the car. I'll go get Shiyu."

"Okay!"

Su Lin walked to Xia Shiyu's makeshift office, where she was hunched over a calculator, verifying receipts.

The invoices ranged from a few yuan to tens of thousands. She had to get every single one right to keep the books clean.

Xia Shiyu hadn't formally studied accounting. All she could do was crunch numbers manually on the calculator. Fortunately, today's stack wasn't too thick, so it wouldn't take long.

Su Lin came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her. "Guess who?"

"Hehe, Su Lin! I memorized your scent ages ago. If you're within three feet, I can tell."

Su Lin tugged at his collar. "Scent? I smell? I shower every day."

Xia Shiyu playfully smacked his arm. "Not that kind of smell! Ugh, you made me lose count. Now I have to start over."

Su Lin patted her head. "How many times have you been through it?"

"Third time."

"Any issues the first two?"

Xia Shiyu shook her head. "These are all prices Xiaowan pre-negotiated, so I don't need to verify rates—just make sure the totals match."

"Then you don't need a third pass. Two clean runs is plenty. Come on, let's eat."

"But what if I missed something?"

Su Lin laughed. "Shiyu, with how meticulous you are? Impossible. Let's go. You should learn computerized bookkeeping—it'll make everything much easier."

"Okay!"

"Go buy a computer for home tomorrow. Both Xiaowan and I have one—you're the only holdout. It's essential for your work. Put it on the company account."

"A computer? For home?"

"Of course. And don't be cheap about it—spend at least 8,000. If I find out you went under 8,000, there'll be consequences." Su Lin said in mock severity.

Xia Shiyu pouted. "Su Lin, you're always scaring me."

"Heh... come on, let's eat. I'll drive you both home after."

"Okay."

The two lingered in the office for a bit before heading out.

When Lin Xiaowan saw them return, her eyes darted back and forth between them.

Su Lin and Xia Shiyu looked the same as always, but Lin Xiaowan couldn't shake the feeling that something had happened.

Eventually she decided she was being paranoid. It was true that Su Lin used to patiently explain himself whenever she got suspicious. Nowadays? He just skipped straight to 'discipline.' Thinking about that heavy palm of his still made her teeth itch.

"Xiaowan, what do you want for dinner?"

Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "We've been eating out every night. My palate's gotten so spoiled I don't even know what I want anymore. Ask Shiyu."

"I'm fine with anything."

"Alright, I'll pick a place. Then I'll drive you both home."

"Sounds good!"

...

On the other side of town, Lin Guoqiang arrived home with plans to cook dinner and wait for Lin Xiaowan—maybe casually probe how far things had progressed with Su Lin.

He waited until past eight. No sign of Lin Xiaowan. No sign of Wang Xiaoqian either.

Close to nine, the sound of Wang Xiaoqian's car pulling in came from outside.

Lin Guoqiang checked the clock and fumed even more. It was nearly nine and his daughter still wasn't home. She'd become practically nocturnal.

Wang Xiaoqian opened the door and spotted Lin Guoqiang at the dining table. "Well, well—the big boss is home early tonight. And you cooked?"

Lin Guoqiang glared at her. "You call this early? Look at the time."

"It's nine. That's when I always get home."

"Lin Guoqiang, what are you getting high and mighty about? You come home early one day and suddenly you're barking orders at me? Need I remind you what time 'you' usually get home?"

Lin Guoqiang's face flushed.

Compared to Wang Xiaoqian, he was far worse. Coming home past midnight was routine. Sometimes he didn't come home at all, sleeping at the municipal building.

"Have you eaten? If not, come sit down."

"Already ate. Where's Xiaowan? Doing homework?"

At that, Lin Guoqiang practically blew a gasket. "Your precious daughter isn't home yet!"
