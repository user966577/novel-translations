Across the cafeteria, Feng Yifei watched Xia Shiyu's radiant smile and felt himself sinking into it.

But the moment he remembered that smile was directed at Su Lin and not him, his spirits deflated.

If it had been Ye Feng, he could've sent some guys to rough him up and make him disappear.

But this was Su Lin. He didn't have a prayer.

"Damn it."

"Give it up, bro. Look at that smile on her face—you're done."

"Su Lin's supposed to be all about Lin Xiaowan. What's he doing cozying up to Xia Shiyu?" Feng Yifei said through gritted teeth.

"Man, what can you do? Good grades, good looks, loaded family—you just can't compete."

"Yeah..."

"..."

"Su Lin, no matter what, I have to thank you. Without you, my dad wouldn't even have qualified for the tissue matching."

"Mm. Take care of yourself, Xia Shiyu. When I get the chance, I'll stop by the hospital to visit your father." Su Lin smiled.

"Okay."

Watching Xia Shiyu walk away with her tray, Su Lin let his gaze linger for a moment, admiring.

Xia Shiyu's beauty was nothing like Lin Xiaowan's regal elegance. She was the classic girl-next-door type—petite, maybe five-foot-three at most, with a palm-sized face of exquisite features.

Put her in one of those trendy JK outfits from his previous life, and she'd drive every guy on the internet crazy.

Su Lin pulled his gaze back, eyes narrowing with anticipation for what Ye Feng's rebirth would bring.

*Here's hoping it won't be boring. Ye Feng, you're supposed to be a nearly-thirty-year-old man reborn—don't let me down.*

The entire afternoon passed in the rhythm of intense exam review.

Though the exam was still three months away, Senior 1's curriculum was already complete. They'd long since shifted to full-time revision mode.

When the final bell rang, the building shook with the stampede.

Su Lin stayed put, not moving from his seat.

"Su Lin, school's over. Aren't you going home?"

Lin Xiaowan noticed him still sitting there and felt a stir of curiosity.

Before today, she wouldn't have spared him a glance. But now, Su Lin was like a butterfly constantly flitting at the edge of her vision—impossible to ignore, always drawing her eye.

Su Lin shook his head. "Who said I'm not going home? I just have something to take care of first."

"Something? What kind of something?"

"Uh... personal business. Why, curious?"

Lin Xiaowan's expression shifted slightly, then she shook her head. "Since you're busy, I won't keep you. I'm heading out. See you tomorrow."

"See you tomorrow."

Once the classroom had mostly emptied, Su Lin walked over to Chen Yang, mildly exasperated. "Chen Yang, I get why you used to leave last when you needed cafeteria leftovers. But you don't need to do that anymore—why are you still the last one out?"

Chen Yang grinned sheepishly. "Sorry, force of habit."

"Whatever. Come on, we're heading to the internet cafe. I'm going with you today."

"Sure!" At the mention of business, Chen Yang's demeanor sharpened instantly.

"You're really coming with me today?"

Su Lin nodded. "Of course. I already told the driver not to pick me up. This isn't pocket change—I need to see things with my own eyes."

Chen Yang fell silent.

At first, he'd thought Su Lin was just being charitable—giving him busy work as an excuse to help him out.

But after going home and thinking it over, he'd realized the truth. That was over $14,000 worth of equipment. Su Lin wasn't an idiot. Nobody burns that kind of money on charity disguised as a job.

So Su Lin clearly had a real plan.

The two arrived at the internet cafe and got a private room. Chen Yang wiped down the desk as he reported. "Like you asked, I created accounts on four servers last night and started buying up Destiny Necklaces."

"Overnight I grabbed over a thousand. Slowed down this morning. Right now, across all four accounts, I've got around 1,400 necklaces. Spent about 60,000 yuan total—about $8,500. Average price around 46 yuan each."

"Average of 46? Not bad. How many more do you think you can get?"

Su Lin's knowledge of this game was limited. Though he'd absorbed the original Su Lin's memories, the previous owner had barely touched online games.

He was somewhat in the dark.

"The game's only been out six months—it's brand new. The Destiny Necklace drops from the latest boss dungeon. The stats are garbage, but it's not exactly common. My estimate? Maybe 2,000 more across the entire game, tops. And it'll get harder to find them later, especially since I can only buy at night. School during the day."

Su Lin laughed. "You think? Just hire other people to buy for you. Find players in-game and offer them 70 yuan per necklace. They keep the profit margin."

"Seventy each? Over 2,000 necklaces, that's more than 40,000 yuan in middleman fees!" Chen Yang looked pained, as if he'd rather skip school and camp at the computer all day to save the money.

"I could just take sick days these next few days. That 40,000 could easily be saved."

Su Lin shook his head. "Absolutely not. The exam's right around the corner. You're not throwing away your future over some spare change. Chen Yang, 40,000 sounds like a lot, but to me it's nothing."

"A good degree doesn't guarantee success, but it raises your ceiling. Understand?"

"I..."

Chen Yang was won over. Su Lin was the only person in his entire life who'd shown this much faith in him.

In this day and age, people killed over amounts far smaller than $5,000.

Yet Su Lin didn't care. Part of it was his family's wealth, sure—but more importantly, he respected Chen Yang as a person.

Chen Yang knew his own worth. Maybe someday he'd do well enough to own a car and a house. But following Su Lin? He'd go further. Much further.

In that instant, Chen Yang made his choice. He'd follow Su Lin, even if it meant putting his life on the line.

Anything was better than a lifetime of mediocrity.

Su Lin waved his hand. "This discussion is over. If you think the middleman cut is too steep, negotiate it down. Sixty works too. Better yet, find people you trust. Here's the deal: I'll set your budget at 65 per necklace. You can offer 55 or 60—whatever you negotiate, the difference is yours. Just get the job done. I'll transfer the funds to the card."

"Got it!"

"Good. Keep buying. I need to set up my own account first. Once I'm ready, mail everything to me."

"On it!"

Su Lin opened the game and began registering.

He trusted Chen Yang's character—but once this stockpile multiplied tenfold in value, that was a different equation entirely.

Chen Yang might resist the temptation of $14,000. But when the game patched and those necklaces were suddenly worth hundreds of thousands?
