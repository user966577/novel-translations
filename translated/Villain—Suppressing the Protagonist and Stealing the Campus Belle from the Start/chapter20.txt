After the other two left, Xia Shiyu turned and walked into the hospital.

Ye Feng gathered his thoughts and followed.

Meanwhile, outside at the flower shop, Lin Xiaowan voiced what had been nagging at her. "Su Lin, don't you think Ye Feng's been acting strange today?"

Su Lin feigned confusion. "Strange? How so?"

"Shiyu hasn't noticed because she's preoccupied, but think about it—Ye Feng almost never initiates conversation with her. Today he's been weirdly enthusiastic. Overly enthusiastic, actually. And his whole demeanor on the way here was off. He kept watching the three of us, like he was analyzing something."

Her analysis was remarkably accurate. Su Lin looked at her with genuine surprise.

"Su Lin, I'm talking to you. Why are you staring at me?"

He shook his head. "I'm just impressed by how observant you are."

"It's not that I'm observant—Ye Feng was just that conspicuous. Honestly, if he'd ditched us at the hospital entrance and run off to an internet cafe, I wouldn't have batted an eye."

"Heh. Well, Ye Feng's apparently turned over a new leaf. Even if he's acting different, what's it got to do with us?"

Lin Xiaowan paused, then nodded. "You're right. If he's genuinely trying to straighten up, we shouldn't get in the way."

"Let's just pick out some fruit. What can someone with kidney failure even eat?"

Su Lin chuckled. "And here I thought you knew everything. So there are things that stump you too."

"Kidney disease patients should eat low-potassium fruits. Apples, pears—things like that."

Lin Xiaowan's eyes widened. "How do you know this?"

"I read a lot of nonfiction in my spare time."

"Is that so?" She didn't believe him for a second.

She read plenty of books too, and she'd never come across that particular factoid.

Seeing her skepticism, Su Lin didn't bother explaining. "You've got the eye for detail—you pick. I'll carry."

"Deal!"

At the same time, Ye Feng had cornered Xia Shiyu.

"Shiyu, what if I told you I could raise the remaining 30,000 yuan? Would you believe me?"

Xia Shiyu looked at him skeptically. "Xiaofeng, what are you talking about?"

Ye Feng's expression turned dead serious. "Shiyu, I mean it. This is about your father's life—I would never joke about something like this. I really can help you raise that money. But I need startup capital."

Seeing a gravity in Ye Feng's face she'd never witnessed before, Xia Shiyu wavered.

She already had about 280,000 yuan, but that would only cover the surgery—not the transplant itself.

Where would the rest come from?

She couldn't keep going back to Lin Xiaowan and Su Lin. They'd already done more than anyone could ask for. They weren't obligated to foot the entire bill.

Now Ye Feng was saying he could raise the remaining money. She had her doubts—but this was a lifeline. What if he was telling the truth?

"Xiaofeng, what's this plan of yours? And how much startup capital do you need?"

Ye Feng saw the opening and pounced. "Shiyu, you've heard of people selling game items for real money, right?"

"A game? No. Absolutely not."

"Shiyu, do you have a better option? You can't ask Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan for more—do you think they'd lend you this much even if they could?"

"You can't just watch your dad die."

Xia Shiyu staggered back two steps.

She stood frozen, her face ashen.

Ye Feng was right. Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan had already gone above and beyond. She couldn't pin all her hopes on them.

"Trust me, Shiyu. We grew up together. I would never lie to you."

Xia Shiyu looked up at him. His eyes held an intensity she'd never seen before. His face radiated an unfamiliar confidence.

Maybe... maybe Ye Feng really did have a way?

"Xiaofeng, this is about my father's life. You absolutely cannot be messing around."

"I'm not messing around. Shiyu, this is deadly serious. How about this—call it a loan. But you have to promise me you won't tell Lin Xiaowan or Su Lin."

Xia Shiyu shook her head. "A loan? Xiaofeng, you're doing this to help me save my dad. I'm not going to make you call it a loan."

Ye Feng grinned. "Helping your dad is only part of it. Honestly, my main goal is to make money."

"Wait—you mean you could make even more than 30,000 yuan?" Xia Shiyu's mouth fell open.

To her, that amount was already astronomical. And Ye Feng was saying there'd be more?

Ye Feng nodded confidently. "Of course. This is my seed money. You think I'd stop at a measly 30,000 yuan?"

"Okay then. How much do you need? I'll hold back some from the hospital payment."

"Hmm... about 8,000 yuan. You've got 280,000 on the card, right? Pay 200,000 and keep the difference. Wait—actually, just keep 80,000 yuan."

"That much?"

"Heh. You think making money doesn't cost money?"

"Alright. But from now on, you give me regular updates on how you're using every cent. I want to know where the money's going."

"No problem. But we need to agree—you can't ask questions about my methods. You can listen to updates, but you can't tell Su Lin or Lin Xiaowan."

"I can't even tell Xiaowan?"

Ye Feng nodded firmly. "Can't. If other people find out, it won't work. What if they try to cut in on the deal?"

Ye Feng's logic was simple: let Xia Shiyu watch his every move. That way, he'd feel accountable and she'd feel reassured. And the bonus? He'd get to spend time with her every day. With enough quality time together, she'd be his girlfriend before Su Lin even knew what hit him.

"Xiaowan and Su Lin aren't like that."

"I might believe that about Lin Xiaowan. But Su Lin? Heh."

"Xiaofeng, do you have some kind of grudge against Su Lin?"

"Grudge? Nothing like that. But you know what kind of reputation he has in class."

Xia Shiyu fell silent.

Su Lin was excellent in every measurable way, but his reputation among classmates wasn't exactly sterling.

She didn't realize that had colored Ye Feng's perception.

She wanted desperately to tell Ye Feng about Su Lin's donation—how much he'd given—but remembering her promise, she kept her mouth shut.

"Fine... we won't tell them. But you'd better keep me updated."

"Deal!"

Ye Feng knew Xia Shiyu had an extraordinary nose for business. He had the advantage of foresight from his rebirth, but Xia Shiyu had genuine, inborn talent. Bringing her along now would help awaken that talent early. And he'd need her for his plans over the summer anyway.
