Suppress Ye Feng?

Su Lin recalled that Ye Feng's first fortune came from stockpiling an item called the Destiny Necklace in the game *City of Angels*.

The Destiny Necklace wasn't worth much on its own—only about fifty yuan before the patch, roughly seven bucks. But in a few days, when the game updated, players would discover that the necklace's splash damage had a bug: the damage could stack infinitely. As long as one person in the raid had the necklace, they could clear the latest World Boss dungeon.

Overnight, the Destiny Necklace became the hottest commodity in the game. The price skyrocketed from around thirty dollars all the way past eight hundred at its peak, only crashing back down after the developers discovered the bug and patched it so splash damage could only stack five times.

Ye Feng had seized that window, using the school's 50,000-yuan charity fund—about $7,000—to stockpile Destiny Necklaces and flip them for several million.

Since Su Lin already knew how Ye Feng made his first fortune, sabotaging him would be simple.

Next, he needed someone to handle things. Su Lin turned his attention to Chen Yang in the back row.

Chen Yang, like Xia Shiyu, was one of the class's most disadvantaged students. His parents had died years ago, leaving only him, his elderly grandfather, and a ten-year-old sister in middle school. Beyond the grandfather's occasional farming income, they survived entirely on government subsidies. Chen Yang came off as fierce and hot-tempered, but Su Lin knew that was just armor.

In the original novel, Ye Feng lent Chen Yang a hundred yuan—about fifteen bucks—for his sister's medical bills, and in return gained an unwaveringly loyal enforcer who handled plenty of Ye Feng's dirty work.

Later on, Ye Feng didn't even spare Chen Yang's little sister, adding her to his harem.

After school, Su Lin deliberately hung back. He knew Chen Yang was always the last to leave, heading to the cafeteria to grab leftover food for his sister.

When Chen Yang saw the classroom was empty, he shouldered his bag and headed for the door.

The moment he stepped out, he spotted Su Lin leaning against the window frame.

Chen Yang frowned but said nothing. Su Lin normally couldn't be bothered with students like him—wouldn't even waste a sentence unless it was a barked order. So clearly, Su Lin wasn't here waiting for him. As for why the vice president was standing around, Chen Yang wasn't curious and didn't care to find out.

He started to walk away, but Su Lin called out, "Chen Yang!"

Chen Yang turned back, puzzled. "Vice president, what's up?"

Su Lin nodded. "Walk and talk?"

Chen Yang hesitated, then nodded.

They headed downstairs together.

"College entrance exam's coming up. Any idea where you want to go for university?"

Chen Yang shook his head with a self-deprecating laugh. "University? Vice president, are you messing with me?"

Su Lin shook his head. "We haven't talked much, but do you really think I'm the type to mess with a classmate?"

Chen Yang blinked.

Now that he thought about it, someone as proud as Su Lin really wouldn't waste time on something that pointless.

Before he could respond, Su Lin continued, "Your grades might not be enough for the top tier, but you'd easily make first tier. And I'm sure you know—for someone in your situation, education is the only way out."

Chen Yang smiled bitterly. "The only way out—of course I know that. But tuition alone is over ten thousand. With my family's situation..."

Su Lin clapped him on the shoulder and grinned. "I can give you a shot at going to college. Want it or not?"

Chen Yang eyed him warily.

Su Lin scoffed. "If your grades weren't decent, you think I'd bother helping you?"

"I..."

Seeing Chen Yang's suspicious expression, Su Lin knew the kid was overthinking it. He laughed. "Relax, I'm not asking you to break any laws. You ever play *City of Angels*?"

Chen Yang nodded. "I played a few times at Feng Yifei's place when I was doing odd jobs there."

Su Lin pulled out a stack of cash and a bank card. "Good enough. This card has 200,000 yuan on it—about twenty-eight grand. Password's six eights. Starting today, buy up every Destiny Necklace you can find in the game. As many as possible. This five thousand yuan is your payment. You in?"

Chen Yang didn't immediately reach for the money. "Su Lin, aren't you afraid I'll just run off with this? That's over twenty thousand dollars."

Su Lin smiled. "Even with your family in such terrible shape, you've never once resorted to stealing or petty crime. You've never abandoned your principles. That tells me enough about your character."

"As for running—even less likely. You've still got your grandpa and your sister. I've heard all about how you fought those street thugs to protect her. If you'd really abandon them for twenty-eight grand, then I've got nothing to say."

Chen Yang snatched the cash and card from Su Lin's hand. "Vice president, I'll get this done. You have my word."

Su Lin nodded, not worried in the slightest about Chen Yang's ability to deliver.

He added casually, "Don't overthink this, and don't think I'm pitying you. Treat it as a job—you work for me, I pay you. Simple."

"One more thing: don't tell anyone about the buying operation. Not a soul, including your family. Everything stays secret. Can you guarantee that?"

Though Chen Yang didn't understand why Su Lin wanted it done this way, he knew this was his one shot at college. He had to seize it.

"Su Lin, I won't tell anyone. Not even my little sister."

"Good. That's all I needed to hear. Now let me walk you through the specifics."

"Vice president, the cafeteria's about to close. Can I grab food first?"

Su Lin laughed. "You've got thousands in your pocket and you're still going after the cafeteria's cold leftovers? What, you think working for me means I'd let you go hungry?"

"I..."

Su Lin straightened up. "Look, while you're on this job, food for you, your grandpa, and your sister all comes out of that card."

Chen Yang shook his head vigorously. "Vice president, I absolutely can't take that. You've already done so much."

"Can't take it? You think you've got more money than me?"

"Just take it."

"Vice president... thank you."

Su Lin waved it off. "Just get the job done. Now, let me explain the details..."
