Su Lin took Xia Shiyu to the bank first to wire the money into her account, then spent the rest of the day showing her around Zhongjiang.

They wandered the city like a couple in love.

It wasn't until lunch that Su Lin received a text from Chen Yang.

He and Ye Feng were already heading back—but not to Zhongjiang. They'd gone straight to Donghai.

Su Lin calculated the timing. Ye Feng probably wouldn't reach Donghai until three or four in the afternoon. Selling his stock would take until four or five.

Zhongjiang was a coastal city, so sunset came a little later, but not by much.

Knowing Ye Feng's personality, he'd definitely want to make a second run—buy more with whatever cash he had on hand.

With that in mind, Su Lin had already formulated his plan.

Buying up medicinal herbs wasn't something he could do alone, but with Su Zhenguo's resources, it'd be a breeze.

"Shiyu, after lunch why don't you go check on Uncle Xia? Ask when they're scheduling the surgery."

"Okay!"

"I've got some business to handle this afternoon. Once I'm done, I'll come see Uncle Xia."

Xia Shiyu shook her head. "My dad's been drifting in and out of consciousness. There's no point visiting—you'd be better off taking care of your business."

She straightened his collar with practiced ease, like a little housewife. "Well... I'm off then."

"Want me to give you a ride?"

Xia Shiyu shook her head. "Nah, you didn't drive today."

"Heh. Just because I didn't bring a car doesn't mean I can't get you one."

Without waiting for a response, Su Lin took her hand and hailed a taxi, then rode with her to the hospital.

He left under her reluctant gaze.

The moment he got home, Su Lin pulled out his phone and called Su Zhenguo.

Come to think of it, he'd been in this world for a while now and hadn't once spoken to his father.

Fortunately, the original Su Lin's memories were still intact, so there was no risk of blowing his cover.

"Hey, kiddo. What's the occasion? Running low on cash? I'll have someone wire you 100,000 yuan right away."

Su Lin's face darkened. Listening to that coddling tone, he finally understood why the original Su Lin had turned out the way he had.

Spoiled rotten.

"Dad, I don't need money. I'm calling about something important."

"Oh? Important? What kind of important?"

Su Zhenguo's interest was piqued. His interactions with Su Lin were infrequent, and the boy's calls were almost always about needing money or wanting to buy something. Hearing him mention "important business" was a first.

"I need to borrow some people."

"People? What for?"

"Here's the situation. A friend's uncle told me..."

After Su Lin laid out his plan, Su Zhenguo fell into contemplative silence.

He'd been expecting a parent-teacher conference or some school issue.

He hadn't expected his son to be talking about commerce. After hearing the pitch, Su Zhenguo recognized it immediately as a solid play—exploiting an information gap for profit.

*When did this kid develop a head for business?*

Su Zhenguo thought about it briefly before deciding to let Su Lin try. His empire was sprawling—spanning half of Jiangnan Province—and Su Lin was his only son. If anyone was going to inherit the business someday, it would be him. Getting an early start in commerce wasn't a bad thing. Even if he lost money, his old man could cover it.

"How many people? How much money?"

Hearing those words, Su Lin silently thanked his lucky stars. That "Dad" had been well worth saying.

"I've got my own money, so I don't need yours. I just need three to five people and a vehicle. Dad, you have a logistics company, right?"

"I do. Tell you what—I'll lend you my assistant. He can coordinate everything. You two work it out, and if you need funds, come to me."

Su Zhenguo chuckled when Su Lin said he didn't need money. How much could the boy possibly have? Even if he'd saved every cent of his allowance, it wouldn't amount to much.

In Su Zhenguo's eyes, this was just his kid playing shopkeeper. So he'd handed over his assistant and left it at that.

What Su Lin didn't know was that Su Zhenguo was secretly weighing his son's capabilities—testing him.

The two chatted a bit more. Su Zhenguo asked about Su Lin's life, then hung up.

Around three in the afternoon, assistant Li Hongyang arrived with a small team from the company.

When Su Lin told them they'd be going to the countryside to buy gastrodia tubers, Li Hongyang and his crew exchanged bewildered glances.

*So it's babysitting duty. Great.*

Li Hongyang was in his early thirties, bespectacled, and looked every bit the mild-mannered office worker. But Su Lin wasn't about to be fooled by appearances.

Catching Li Hongyang's unspoken hesitation, Su Lin grinned. "Brother Yang, sorry to trouble you with this."

Li Hongyang waved it off. "Young Master Su, since the boss sent me to help, there's nothing to apologize for. The boss said you've decided to do something productive for once, and I should support you fully."

"I'm just wondering—how much gastrodia are we looking to buy, at what price, and where are we selling it?"

Su Lin smiled. "Honestly? I don't know the purchase price yet, or the exact quantity."

"Uh..."
