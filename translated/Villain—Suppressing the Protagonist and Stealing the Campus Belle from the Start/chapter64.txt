Lin Guoqiang was furious and guilt-ridden in equal measure.

"They're driving away!"

"Follow them." Lin Guoqiang ground the words through his teeth.

They'd watched the entire sequence—Su Lin and the two girls getting into the car, with Su Lin sliding into the driver's seat.

"Su Zhenguo must have nerves of steel, letting his son drive to and from school. That's got to be a first in Zhongjiang," Tian Wei remarked.

"Hmph, that kid's definitely driving without a license. I'll have the traffic division impound his car." Lin Guoqiang said viciously.

Tian Wei glanced at the seething man beside him, swallowed hard, and decided to keep quiet.

Having driven for Lin Guoqiang for years, he knew his boss well. The man was the type who could watch a mountain crumble before him without flinching. Now he looked ready to combust.

Understandable, really. His own daughter had climbed into another man's car—and that man had two girls with him, his daughter being just one of them.

If it were Tian Wei's daughter, he'd want to throw punches too.

...

Su Lin, Lin Xiaowan, and Xia Shiyu were chatting and laughing, completely unaware they were being tailed.

They were still discussing the grand opening logistics, so nobody was paying attention to the car behind them.

Lin Xiaowan never would have guessed that Lin Guoqiang had come to pick her up from school.

More than ten minutes later, Tian Wei's expression shifted. "Guoqiang, this road doesn't go toward home. They're heading for the development district."

Lin Guoqiang waved his hand. "Doesn't matter where they're going. Just follow. I want to see what Xiaowan's actually been up to."

"Alright, but Xiaowan's a good kid. Try not to get too upset."

"Hmph! A good kid? Before today, I would've agreed. But after today? That remains to be seen." Lin Guoqiang said through barely contained anger.

Right now, he wanted to strangle Su Lin. His fury was reaching critical mass.

Tian Wei sighed and said nothing more. He understood the anger. If it were his own daughter, he'd be livid too.

Another fifteen or so minutes passed before Su Lin pulled up in front of the supermarket.

"They stopped. Wait, there's construction here? What are a bunch of kids doing at a renovation site?" Tian Wei said, puzzled.

Lin Guoqiang was equally baffled but stayed silent, choosing to observe.

He sensed the truth was about to reveal itself.

"Su Lin, I'll go find Xiaojuan and check today's financials."

Su Lin waved. "Go ahead, Shiyu."

"Okay!"

The moment Xia Shiyu left, the foreman emerged carrying two hard hats. "Boss Su, here to check on progress again?"

Su Lin took both helmets and handed one to Lin Xiaowan. "Yeah, had some free time today so I figured I'd take a look. Foreman Wang, how's it going? On schedule?"

Foreman Wang nodded. "The money's flowing, so the boys are motivated. Progress is right on track—if anything, ahead of schedule."

"Good to hear. We'll take a look inside. You go about your business—we'll call if we need anything."

"Sure thing."

Foreman Wang didn't linger. There wasn't much to chat about given the age gap and different worlds they lived in.

Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan grabbed the blueprints they'd prepared earlier and headed into the supermarket.

"Guoqiang, are they... supervising the construction?" Tian Wei said, struggling to believe his eyes.

Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan were still high school students. And they were running a business?

Lin Guoqiang was equally caught off guard. "It's probably something Su Zhenguo's kid cooked up. Xiaowan doesn't have the initiative for something like this on her own."

"Participating in school activities is one thing, but starting a business? They're a bit young for that."

Tian Wei nodded in agreement. "Should we get out and go over?"

Lin Guoqiang hesitated. Go over and then what? Let Lin Xiaowan continue this venture with Su Lin, or drag her home?

The whole way here, Lin Xiaowan's smile hadn't faded once. She was clearly enjoying herself. If he intervened now, his only options were to either permit it or haul her away—both terrible choices.

"Let's wait and see. Awei, look into what's going on here when we get back. A building this size means serious business—find out the details."

"Will do."

Lin Guoqiang nodded. After careful deliberation, he decided against showing himself. Better to gather all the facts first, then act accordingly.

What Lin Guoqiang didn't know was that before long, he'd deeply regret not dragging Lin Xiaowan home today.

...

"Su Lin, wouldn't two freezers here be overkill?"

Su Lin shook his head. "Definitely not. Freezers aren't just for drinks—all kinds of frozen goods, tofu products, and more go in there."

"Oh, right!"

"This whole section is for vegetables, pork, and the like."

"And shelving units go here."

Lin Xiaowan listened to Su Lin's layout plan as a vivid picture took shape in her mind. His product placement was innovative yet made maximum use of every inch of available space.

"Boss Su, here to rush us again?"

"Boss Su, don't worry—we'll be done before the 25th. No need to check in every day."

Su Lin laughed. "We're not here to rush anyone today—just mapping out the floor plan. Uncle Liu, you guys just keep at it."

"You got it. Working for you is a real pleasure, Boss Su. Tea service, good pay—what more could we ask for?"

"Heh, then make sure you give me quality work to match that tea money."

"You have our word. We never cut corners."

As Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan walked away, they could still hear the workers chatting behind them—things like how Su Lin was handsome and rich, Lin Xiaowan was beautiful and classy, and the two were a perfect match.

Su Lin gave Lin Xiaowan a light nudge. "Did you hear that, Xiaowan?"

"Hear what?"

"They said we're a perfect match. Made for each other. They were loud enough—don't tell me you missed it."

"So what if I heard? They also said you and Shiyu are a perfect match."

'Smack!'

Su Lin's palm connected with Lin Xiaowan's backside.

"Su Lin!!!"

Lin Xiaowan glared daggers at him, looking ready to tear him apart if he didn't explain himself.

"That's your punishment."

"Don't forget what you promised me—no more jealous jabs, and no more using Shiyu to needle me."

"Even so, you can't just... hit me!" Lin Xiaowan fumed.

"Once or twice I let slide, but you've been poking at me for days now. I'm a man with a temper too, you know. Though I have to say, Xiaowan—the elasticity is remarkable. I could go for a few more."

"Drop dead!" Lin Xiaowan kicked his shin.

"Ow! You've got some power in those legs. My shin's about to snap."

"Please. Your bones are hard as iron. One kick and you're broken? My foot hurts more than your leg does." Lin Xiaowan said darkly.

Su Lin chuckled. His body was getting stronger by the day. Compared to a soft girl like Lin Xiaowan, he might as well have been made of steel.

"I'm warning you—no more hitting me without permission. I'll get angry."

Su Lin shrugged. "Then you stop using Shiyu to needle me. Especially when it's just the two of us."

"I'll... try."

"Then I'll... also try."

The two of them toured all three floors, calculating product placement, aisle widths, and traffic flow.

Stepping outside, Su Lin stared at the supermarket with a slight headache.

"What's wrong? Is there another problem?"

Su Lin nodded. "Yeah. We need an elevator."

"With an elevator, foot traffic would increase significantly. Donghai barely has any—if we install one in Zhongjiang, it'd be a huge draw."

"You're opening in two weeks. Elevators aren't easy to source domestically."

Su Lin nodded. "It is a problem. But not an unsolvable one."
