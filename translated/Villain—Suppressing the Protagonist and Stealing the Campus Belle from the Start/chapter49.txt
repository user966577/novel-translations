"Mom, don't listen to them. I didn't—"

SLAP!

A vicious slap landed on Ye Feng's face.

Liu Mei stared at Ye Feng with disbelief in her tear-filled eyes. "Xiaofeng, there's no one else here now. Tell Mom—what did you use that 80,000 yuan for?"

Looking at Liu Mei's expression, Ye Feng found it hard to speak. But if he didn't explain, there was no way he'd get through today. He stammered, "I... I invested it."

"Did you make money from the investment?"

"I... I lost it." Ye Feng's voice caught.

"Lost all 80,000?"

"There's a few thousand left."

"Oh, so when you mentioned borrowing a few thousand for buying herbs the other day, that was what remained from the 80,000 you lost?" Liu Mei narrowed her eyes.

Ye Feng nodded. He could make excuses to anyone else, but in front of Liu Mei, he couldn't get the words out.

"What kind of investment lost that much?"

"I... stockpiled game items," Ye Feng mumbled.

"Games? You spent 80,000 yuan on game items? You... you..."

SLAP! Another slap landed on Ye Feng's face.

"We'll discuss this with your father when we get home. Pack up—we're leaving now." Liu Mei was so furious she was about to pass out. Ye Feng didn't dare defy her, afraid that the illness from her previous life might come early if he pushed her too hard.

Ye Feng still wanted his parents to live a few more years.

"Su Lin... Ye Feng's mother just slapped him." Lin Xiaowan pulled Su Lin to peer through the restaurant window at Ye Feng's cart.

Su Lin nodded. "I saw, Xiaowan."

"Ye Feng's usual arrogance is completely gone. How satisfying. Too bad Xiaoyu isn't here—she'd be thrilled."

Su Lin nodded. "Xiaoyu is at the hospital taking care of her dad. Xiaowan, I had no idea you had such a little devil side to you. Ye Feng definitely won't escape punishment when he gets home."

Lin Xiaowan declared self-righteously, "I'm doing this for Ye Feng's own good. He's only eighteen and he's already swindling 80,000 yuan. Imagine what he'll do when he goes to college, or enters society—he'll swindle even more. By telling his mother now, she'll definitely set him straight. Then Ye Feng will turn over a new leaf. Isn't that a good thing?"

"Hmm, you make a good point."

"What are you two having?"

Su Lin gentlemanly handed the menu to Lin Xiaowan. "Xiaowan, you order."

Lin Xiaowan's cute face was full of anticipation. "Miss, give us two orders of your signature barbecue. Besides the meat, do you have other dishes?"

"Yes, our restaurant specializes in barbecue, but we also have various side dishes and accompaniments."

"Then give us a bit of everything."

"Certainly!"

After the server left, Lin Xiaowan asked excitedly, "Su Lin, where should we go this afternoon?"

Su Lin paused, looking somewhat sheepish. "Originally I was planning to spend the whole day at the amusement park. Escape room in the morning, other attractions in the afternoon. But we got kicked out early, so I honestly haven't thought about where to go."

"Ah!"

Lin Xiaowan was disappointed at first, then said, "If we don't have anywhere to go this afternoon, why don't we visit Xiaoyu's dad?"

Su Lin shook his head. "Uncle Xia is recuperating right now, preparing for surgery. Visiting him wouldn't help much. Better to call Xiaoyu and take her shopping with us."

Lin Xiaowan gave him a suspicious look. "Su Lin, are you planning something?"

Su Lin looked surprised. "Xiaowan, what kind of brain do you have? Is it that obvious?"

Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "It's not obvious, but my intuition says you're up to something. Otherwise you wouldn't suggest we go shopping. Are you planning to buy something?"

Su Lin shook his head. "That's... let's wait until we see Xiaoyu. I don't want to explain it twice—once to you and once to her. Too much trouble."

"Hmm, sounds like something big."

"Heh, the barbecue's here. Let's eat first."

"Okay!"

While Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan enjoyed their time together—eating barbecue, chatting, a handsome young man and a beautiful girl drawing countless gazes—Ye Feng was having a much worse time.

Liu Mei drove the electric tricycle home with Ye Feng and immediately summoned Ye Weimin.

Ye Weimin rushed back. "Dear, what's happened? You called me back so urgently. Is business that good? Need me to help?"

Liu Mei's tears came instantly. She pointed at Ye Feng and sobbed, "Ask your precious son what he's done. Let him tell you himself."

Ye Weimin immediately sensed something was wrong.

Whether business was good or bad, Liu Mei wouldn't look like this. For her to be this upset, something major must have happened.

Ye Weimin turned to Ye Feng. "Xiaofeng, what happened?"

"I... I... I don't know how to explain."

"If you had the nerve to do it, what's there to be embarrassed about saying?"

Liu Mei's emotions suddenly broke. She shouted, "Do you know what your son did? He swindled Old Xia's daughter! Took the money meant for Old Xia's life-saving kidney transplant! 80,000 yuan! A full 80,000! You and I don't even make that much in two years of work combined, and your precious son just..."

Ye Weimin was stunned after hearing Liu Mei's broken sobs. He hadn't expected Ye Feng to do something like this.

"Mom, I've told you—I didn't swindle it. I borrowed it. I borrowed the money from Xia Shiyu."

"You're still making excuses! Your classmate said if someone hadn't threatened to call the police, you weren't even planning to pay it back. Ye Weimin, are you going to discipline your son or not? He's this young and already swindling money. What's going to happen when he grows up?"

Ye Weimin looked at Ye Feng. "So when you told me you wanted 100,000 yuan to invest in stocks, that was a lie? Your so-called inside information was fake too? You used that money to pay back what you owed, didn't you?"

"I..."

"Answer me! Yes or no?" Ye Weimin roared.

"Y... yes."

"Dad, the stock investment was real, I just needed—"

SLAP! A slap landed on Ye Feng's face.

"Even now you're still making excuses! Not a shred of remorse!"

"Dad, I—"

SLAP! Another slap.

"Honey, don't use your hand. Use the rolling pin." Liu Mei produced her family heirloom from somewhere.

Ye Weimin took it. Ye Feng's eyes went wide with panic.

"Dad... Dad..."

"OWWW!"

...
