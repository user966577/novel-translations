In the cafeteria, Su Lin sat across from Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu.

Su Lin was shoveling food enthusiastically. Xia Shiyu ate daintily in small bites. Only Lin Xiaowan seemed distracted, poking at her rice with her chopsticks, lost in thought.

Both Su Lin and Xia Shiyu noticed.

"Shiyu, what's up with Xiaowan?"

Xia Shiyu shook her head. "No idea. She was fine this morning."

"Ask her."

Su Lin's concern for Lin Xiaowan dimmed something in Xia Shiyu's eyes for just a moment.

Then she nodded. "Okay."

She gently shook Lin Xiaowan's shoulder. "Xiaowan, what's the matter? You're barely eating. Something on your mind?"

Lin Xiaowan looked up and shot Su Lin a glare. "Nothing. What would I have on my mind?"

Su Lin was bewildered. "You say nothing's wrong, but you're glaring at me because...?"

"This is all your fault. You and your jinxing."

"Me? Jinxing?"

"Yes! Yesterday when you said Huanhuan would—"

Lin Xiaowan caught herself just in time, but Su Lin had already connected the dots.

Yan Huan would go to extreme lengths for petty gains.

The novel had documented her pattern extensively—borrowing money from everyone and then having Ye Feng pay it back. After Ye Feng's rebirth, he'd refused to keep bailing her out. The whole thing had blown up right before exams.

That was when everyone discovered just how many people Yan Huan owed.

Su Lin chuckled. "So I was right."

Xia Shiyu looked at him. "Su Lin, what's this about?"

Su Lin shrugged. "Just a little prediction that came true, unfortunately."

"Just eat. You've got a mouth—might as well use it for food."

"I'd love to, but the cafeteria's stingy with the meat dishes. Xiaowan, you know me—I've been spoiled my whole life. Since you're not touching yours, mind sharing?"

"Fine, fine. Take it all."

She scraped every piece of meat from her plate onto Su Lin's.

"Hey, it'd just go to waste otherwise."

"Hmph."

Lin Xiaowan knew she was being petty. But she couldn't help it.

She and Yan Huan could have ended things on good terms. Instead, this had happened, and now sitting next to each other in class would be awkward.

And it was all because Su Lin's warning had opened her eyes.

But watching him accept her irritation without complaint, not a trace of annoyance on his face—just that indulgent smile—something warm bloomed in her chest.

That smile of his was dangerously charming.

Xia Shiyu watched the exchange with quiet envy.

'If Su Lin treated me like that...'

She shook the thought away as quickly as it came. Unrealistic.

Su Lin had donated generously, sure, but she knew it was pure kindness toward a classmate.

He didn't think of her that way.

But Xia Shiyu only knew half the story.

The current Su Lin wasn't just pursuing Lin Xiaowan. Xia Shiyu was very much on his radar too.

The trio's interaction drew its usual audience of onlookers.

Feng Yifei was practically seething. "That bastard! When he makes a move, he goes for both of them at once!"

"Feng, maybe aim a little lower. Try Yan Huan. She might not be Xia Shiyu or Lin Xiaowan, but she's got a killer figure. And she's not ugly either."

"Seriously, bro. Yan Huan's body is insane. Those proportions? As for her face—lights off, they're all the same."

Feng Yifei wavered. "But Yan Huan's the girl Ye Feng's into. The guy might be a nobody academically, but he can throw a punch."

"So what? Just because he likes her doesn't mean she's his. Everyone has the right to pursue who they want."

"Exactly. With a body like that, you're telling me you're not interested?"

Feng Yifei's gaze swept across the cafeteria and landed on Yan Huan, chatting away with her friends.

He had to admit—Yan Huan's figure was genuinely top-tier among their class.

"If you put Lin Xiaowan's face on that body, it'd be perfection."

"Dream on. The goddess wouldn't look twice at you. And for the record, Lin Xiaowan's figure is nothing to sneeze at either."

"She just dresses conservatively. Trust me—years of experience here—hers are bigger than Yan Huan's."

Feng Yifei scoffed. "Lin Xiaowan's pretty, sure, but bigger than Yan Huan? No way."

"Bro, she wears loose clothes. That's all."

"I don't buy it. I've been dating since seventh grade. Don't tell me I don't know what I'm looking at."

"Alright, alright, drop it before we ruin a friendship."

"But seriously, Feng—are you into Yan Huan or not? Because if you're passing, I'm making my move."

Feng Yifei glared at Liang Jun. "Of course I'm going for it. A body like that, and you think Ye Feng deserves it?"

"When the time comes, we just round up the boys and sort him out."

"Right. Ye Feng might hold his own one-on-one, but get enough of us together and he's done."

"Then it's settled. I'll go chat up Yan Huan after lunch. You guys head back to class."

"Good luck, Feng. Take her down in one shot."

"Heh. No problem. Yan Huan acts all proper, but dressing like that every day? She's clearly looking for attention."

"Hahahaha!"

The table erupted in laughter—the kind only guys understood.

Hearing them, Su Lin glanced toward Feng Yifei's group.

'Looks like Feng Yifei's about to make his move on Yan Huan. Wonder if it'll go down the same way as in the original—with Ye Feng handing him a humiliating defeat.'

Then Su Lin remembered: he'd already sabotaged Ye Feng's path to his first fortune.

Without that money, how was Ye Feng supposed to flex? How was he supposed to embarrass Feng Yifei and Yan Huan?

So in a roundabout way, he'd actually helped Feng Yifei.

'Life's funny like that. Who would've thought my little scheme would land Feng Yifei the girl?'

"Su Lin, what are you mumbling about? Speak up."

Su Lin laughed. "I was just thinking—Xiaowan's pretty cute when she pouts."

Lin Xiaowan rolled her pretty eyes. "Maybe spend less time thinking about nonsense and more time studying."

"Your parents gave you such beautiful eyes, and you use them to roll at people. What a waste."

"Hmph... smooth-talker!"
