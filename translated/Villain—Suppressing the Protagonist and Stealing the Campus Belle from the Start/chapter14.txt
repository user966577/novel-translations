That evening, Wang Xiaoqian relayed everything to Lin Guoqiang.

He pondered in silence for a long time before sighing. "Su Zhenguo really hit the jackpot with that son."

"The kid's only in high school and already this sharp. Give him a few years in college to mature, and if he goes into politics, he'd go far."

Wang Xiaoqian pinched his side. "Focus! I'm talking about our daughter here!"

Lin Guoqiang waved her off. "Dear, I think you're overanalyzing this. If Su Lin really had the foresight to orchestrate a three-year long game, the kid would have to be some kind of prodigy."

"This is clearly just right place, right time. If he were that calculating, our daughter would've been swept off her feet ages ago."

Wang Xiaoqian mulled it over and conceded the point. But she still frowned. "Whose side are you on? Someone's clearly got eyes on your daughter and you're defending him."

"Hmph. If he wants to pursue my daughter, he's not ready. The exam's almost here. Once she gets to college and her horizons broaden, she'll stop fixating on what's right in front of her." Lin Guoqiang spoke with absolute confidence.

"And you're not worried something might happen in these three months? I think our girl might actually be interested."

"What? They're already together?"

"No, I didn't say that. I'm just worried."

"Then... should we send her to study abroad?"

"Abroad? Are you serious? What if Su Lin follows her overseas? Then they'd really be beyond our reach."

"Hmm... I need to come up with something. Can't let my daughter get played."

Seeing her husband finally taking this seriously, Wang Xiaoqian smiled.

She knew exactly how sharp Lin Guoqiang's mind was. If he set his sights on outmaneuvering Su Lin, the boy wouldn't stand a chance.

...

The next morning, Su Lin dragged himself out of bed.

"The senior year grind is brutal. School on Saturdays, seriously?"

Saturday classes for seniors had become standard across Zhongjiang City. Every school was pulling out all the stops to boost their exam success rates.

*"By the Xunyang River, a host sends guests away at night, amid the maple leaves and reed flowers of a chilly autumn. The host dismounts, the guest stays aboard the boat, raising cups to drink with no music to be found..."*

The classroom was alive with students reciting "Song of the Pipa Player." Su Lin hummed along under his breath.

He'd heard an adapted version in his previous life. Pretty catchy, actually.

Walking into the classroom, Su Lin was surprised to find every pair of eyes on him. Strange looks, all of them.

"What's everyone staring at?"

He muttered to himself and headed to his seat.

The moment he sat down, he spotted two notebooks on his desk—English study notes.

He picked them up and instantly understood why the whole class had been watching him.

One belonged to Xia Shiyu. The other, to Lin Xiaowan.

Su Lin looked toward Lin Xiaowan.

She fidgeted, then managed, "Your English isn't great, so... I thought these might help."

"The other one's Shiyu's. You can cross-reference them."

"Oh. Well, thanks."

Su Lin tucked both notebooks into his desk without ceremony.

Though they'd kept their voices low, the students nearby had heard every word. Jaws hit the floor.

Yan Huan, in particular, kept darting her gaze between Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan.

She couldn't fathom why Lin Xiaowan's attitude toward Su Lin had shifted so dramatically overnight.

"Xiaowan, what's gotten into you lately? Don't tell me you and Su Lin are dating."

Lin Xiaowan shot Yan Huan a look. "As if. You're imagining things."

"But you've never lent anyone your class notes before. Especially not Su Lin."

Lin Xiaowan answered matter-of-factly. "I've never refused to lend them. Nobody's ever asked."

"Uh..."

"Enough. Focus on morning reading. The monthly exam's coming up."

"Fine."

The morning passed uneventfully.

Right before the last class let out, Yan Huan came to Lin Xiaowan asking to borrow money. Her excuse: she'd lost her meal card.

Lin Xiaowan stared at her deskmate with a peculiar expression.

Su Lin's prediction from just yesterday crashed through her mind. He'd said Yan Huan would come asking for money within three days.

She'd brushed it off as paranoia at the time.

And here they were—barely one day later, right on schedule.

Coincidence, or was Su Lin genuinely prescient?

Yan Huan turned out every pocket, even flipping them inside out. "Xiaowan, I *know* I brought my card. But I seriously can't find it anywhere. Please..."

Lin Xiaowan studied Yan Huan's every expression, looking for any sign of deception.

But Yan Huan's performance was flawless—nothing but frantic pocket-searching and a desperate face.

Lin Xiaowan marveled privately. If this wasn't a coincidence, then Su Lin had called it perfectly. The excuse was absolutely bulletproof.

Her faith in Su Lin's words was growing. "Sorry, Huanhuan. I was in a rush this morning and forgot to bring any money."

"Oh... I see."

Yan Huan's disappointment was palpable.

She recovered quickly. "Then could I borrow your meal card? Just until I find mine."

"Um..."

Seeing Lin Xiaowan hesitate, resentment flickered behind Yan Huan's eyes. But outwardly, she betrayed nothing.

In her view, Lin Xiaowan was a rich girl who was easy to take advantage of. Burning that bridge would be truly stupid.

"Xiaowan..."

"Fine, fine. I barely use it anyway. Take mine for now."

"Thank you, Xiaowan! You're the best!"

Before Lin Xiaowan could change her mind, Yan Huan snatched the card from her hand.

Realizing that might have seemed a bit too eager, she offered an awkward grin.

"Let's go eat together, Xiaowan."

For reasons she couldn't fully articulate, Lin Xiaowan suddenly found her three-year deskmate... bland. Uninteresting.

She didn't want to be around Yan Huan right now.

"Actually, I'm going to eat with Shiyu. We already made plans yesterday. You can keep the card—just return it before school's out."

Yan Huan heard the distance in Lin Xiaowan's voice and scrambled. "Xiaowan, come eat with me instead! I'll save you a seat!"

Lin Xiaowan shook her head firmly. "No. I told Shiyu I would, and I want to check on how her dad's doing."

"Oh... okay then."

Both fell silent.

Neither said it outright, but both understood: the easy intimacy they'd shared was now a thing of the past.

Starting today, they would gradually drift apart.

Yan Huan replayed every word she'd said, searching for where she'd gone wrong. She found nothing.

In the end, she joined a few other friends and headed downstairs.
