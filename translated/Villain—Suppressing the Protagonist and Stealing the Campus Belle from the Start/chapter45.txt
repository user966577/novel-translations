At the Su family villa, Li Hongyang sat across from Su Lin.

"Young Master Su, did the money come through?"

Su Lin tapped his forehead. "Haven't checked my phone yet."

"Mm. It was 15 million total, all wired to your account. Check when you get a chance."

Su Lin nodded. "Brother Yang, how are things with my dad in Donghai?"

Li Hongyang assumed Su Lin was missing his father. "He acquired two plots of land and is busy with construction. You know how it is, Young Master—when a project kicks off, the boss practically lives on-site."

"Yeah, I know. Just asking. So you're heading back to Donghai tomorrow?"

"That's right. Your father has a lot of tasks waiting for me. I thought this would be a quick favor, but it ended up taking a whole week." Li Hongyang sighed.

"Heh. I didn't expect selling the stock to be so complicated either."

"Those herb dealers are such a pain. Dragged things out until today before the money finally came through."

Su Lin looked at Li Hongyang and made one last pitch. "Brother Yang, are you sure you won't stay and work for me? I think you're wasted working under my dad."

"Heh. Same answer as before—your father has to approve first."

"Sigh. If I ask my dad for you, he'll definitely say yes. But that's not what I want." Su Lin looked regretful.

Li Hongyang's skills were beyond reproach—the man was genuinely capable.

Collecting over 20 tons of gastrodia in a single day wasn't something you could do just by throwing money at the problem. And despite Su Lin's low purchase price, Li Hongyang had still managed to turn a profit. That spoke volumes about his ability.

Too bad he was Su Zhenguo's man.

Su Lin knew that if he asked, Su Zhenguo would hand him over. But then all of Su Lin's movements would be reported straight back to his father.

That wasn't what he wanted. He didn't need Su Zhenguo knowing his every move.

After seeing Li Hongyang off, Su Lin chatted with Lin Xiaowan on QQ.

"Su Lin, where are you taking me this weekend?"

Seeing her message, Su Lin could practically feel her nervous anticipation. He typed back, "Xiaowan, we agreed—wherever I take you, you have to go."

"At least tell me where so I can mentally prepare."

"Heh. Relax. I'm not going to sell you off. You'll find out when we get there."

"Tch! So mysterious. Boring."

Su Lin could picture her pouting adorably as she typed.

Weekend. Government housing compound.

Lin Xiaowan was up unusually early.

In an unprecedented move, she spent extra time in the bathroom, meticulously styling herself. Nothing heavy—but from her outfit to her hair, everything was carefully curated.

"Sweetie, are you done yet? Why's it taking so long today?"

Lin Xiaowan gave herself one final check in the mirror, satisfied everything was perfect, then opened the door. "Done! Mom, you're usually the one hogging the bathroom forever. Dad and I never complain. I took a few extra minutes and you're already nagging."

Wang Xiaoqian stared at her daughter, momentarily stunned. Lin Xiaowan looked like a little princess today—so much prettier than usual.

Mothers know their daughters best. Clearly, her daughter had an important date today.

With a guy?

Or with girlfriends?

Wang Xiaoqian didn't have time to ponder. Running a company meant she was perpetually swamped.

Noting that her mother hadn't caught on, Lin Xiaowan quietly exhaled in relief.

Half an hour later, Wang Xiaoqian emerged from the bathroom. "Sweetie, I've got money on my card. Go get breakfast outside. Mom has a morning meeting and can't cook for you."

"Got it, Mom!"

"Mm." Seeing Lin Xiaowan agree so readily, Wang Xiaoqian grabbed her purse and car keys and headed out.

Lin Xiaowan walked to the window and watched until Wang Xiaoqian's car had disappeared. Only then did she return to the bathroom for one more touch-up.

At nine o'clock, Su Lin finally arrived at their meeting spot. Lin Xiaowan had traded her usual student look for something different today—snug light-blue jeans that showcased her long legs, the fabric stretched taut over her curves.

A white crew-neck long-sleeve top paired with a cropped jacket completed the ensemble. She looked mature and sophisticated.

"Su Lin..."

"Xiaowan!"

Su Lin walked up to her, giving her an appreciative once-over.

Lin Xiaowan did a little twirl. "Su Lin, is there something weird about my outfit?"

Su Lin shook his head. "Not weird at all. Now I finally understand why you always dress so loose at school. If you showed up looking like this, I doubt half the guys could keep their composure."

"Hm?"

Facing Lin Xiaowan's questioning gaze, Su Lin laughed awkwardly. "I mean you're too attractive. The guys wouldn't be able to help themselves."

"Go die!"

"These jeans have been in my closet forever—never had a chance to wear them. I wanted to try them on today, but they feel kind of tight."

Su Lin grinned. "Okay, okay. I get it—you're gorgeous, you've got a great voice, amazing figure. Stop showing off."

Lin Xiaowan sniffed haughtily. "You're not so bad yourself today. If I didn't know you were in your senior year, I'd have mistaken you for an adult."

"Heh. Height is an advantage. Natural clothes hanger—can't help it."

Su Lin checked his watch. "It's getting late. Let's go—otherwise we'll have to wait in line."

"Where are we going?"

"You'll see when we get there."

"Tch!"

Lin Xiaowan followed Su Lin to his car. Watching him drive with practiced ease, she asked in surprise, "Su Lin, do you have a license?"

Su Lin shook his head. "Not yet. But I can definitely drive. I'll have my license by summer. Why—worried about my skills?"

Lin Xiaowan nodded gravely. "Very worried."

"Relax. My driving is excellent. Old pro here!"

Looking at Su Lin's mischievous grin, Lin Xiaowan sensed there was more to that statement than met the eye. She just couldn't figure out what.

Soon enough, she had to admit Su Lin knew what he was doing.

The S350 handled beautifully, and Su Lin navigated it without a hitch.

Half an hour later, they arrived at an amusement park.

Lin Xiaowan looked disappointed. "An amusement park? I thought it'd be somewhere special. How boring."

"Heh." Su Lin chuckled and said nothing more.

Getting out, he extended his hand. "Hold on. It's crowded in there—what if we get separated?"

"Su Lin, I haven't agreed to be your girlfriend yet. You have to beat Ye Feng first." Lin Xiaowan's voice was haughty.

"Suit yourself. But don't blame me later."

Su Lin led Lin Xiaowan through the amusement park, winding through various pathways until they reached an attraction with an exceptionally long queue.
