In the end, the three of them headed to the athletic field together to watch the spectacle.

"So many people! Are they all here to watch Yan Huan and Feng Yifei run laps?"

Su Lin chuckled. "Watching Yan Huan run laps, maybe. As for Feng Yifei—who'd bother watching him?"

"Huh? Why would everyone watch Yan Huan run but not Feng Yifei?" Xia Shiyu asked, confused.

Su Lin glanced at her modest figure, then shook his head. "Shiyu, you'll probably never understand why. Xiaowan might know the answer, though."

Lin Xiaowan shot Su Lin a fierce glare. "Su Lin, you're just like the rest of them. Birds of a feather."

Su Lin nodded. "On this particular point, I admit it—I'm a shallow man. Otherwise, why would I be friends with you two?"

Lin Xiaowan's chest heaved with indignation at Su Lin's bluntness. "You really don't hide it at all. Making being a pervert sound so noble."

Su Lin shrugged. "If I hide it, you'll call me a hypocrite. If I don't, you get mad that I'm a pervert. Can't win."

By then, Xia Shiyu had figured out what Su Lin was hinting at.

She'd overheard some rather explicit comments from the male students nearby.

"It's Lin Xiaowan, the school belle! She came to watch too."

"And Xia Shiyu! Xia Shiyu's so pretty."

"Wow! Su Lin—he's seriously handsome. Basically the heartthrob of Jiangning First High."

"Ye Feng... Ye Feng's here."

"Ye Feng's here—but where's Yan Huan? Is she coming?"

"Probably not. A guy might be able to swallow his pride, but a girl like Yan Huan? No way she'd show her face."

Ye Feng and Xu Jie walked onto the field together. "Xu Jie, I'm not bragging—give me two months, and my grades will surpass Su Lin's. I'll be number one in the school."

"C'mon, Feng-bro, don't joke around. Su Lin's not even human—perfect scores in everything except Chinese. The guy's a monster. I know you've improved a lot, but going up against Su Lin is just asking for pain."

Seeing Xu Jie's disbelief, Ye Feng laughed. "Remember when I bet against Yan Huan and you said the same thing? And then? Yan Huan and Feng Yifei both lost. Now they don't even dare show their faces at school."

"So Su Lin is destined to lose to me too."

"I... okay." Xu Jie nodded, conceding the point.

...

"Su Lin, did you hear that? Ye Feng says he's going to surpass you." Lin Xiaowan looked at Su Lin with mischief in her eyes.

Su Lin shrugged. "Surpass me? Good for him. Having confidence is a positive thing."

"Tch! Boring."

Su Lin smiled. "Whether it's boring or not, don't forget about our bet, Xiaowan."

Lin Xiaowan's whole body shivered. She leaned close to Su Lin's ear and whispered, "We'll talk about it tonight on QQ."

"Sure. Tonight, then."

Xia Shiyu watched the two of them curiously, sensing they'd shared some kind of secret—but she hadn't caught what it was.

Lin Xiaowan noticed Xia Shiyu looking their way and quickly changed the subject. "Shiyu, has Uncle Xia's surgery been scheduled yet? What did the hospital say? I thought it was supposed to be this week."

"Oh! The hospital hasn't finalized the time yet. This kind of surgery requires a specialist—regular doctors won't attempt it."

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "So it'll be pushed to next week."

Xia Shiyu nodded. "As long as the surgery happens within the safe window, that's all that matters. I'm not anxious anymore."

"Mm-hmm. Just wait for their notification."

Just then, commotion erupted from the crowd ahead.

"Ye Feng, you're getting way too cocky! You scored in the 600s—Su Lin scored 740-something. How can you even compare?"

"Exactly! Ye Feng, sure, you've improved a lot, but that improvement came from a rock-bottom baseline. Going from 600 to 700 is way harder than going from 300 to 600. Wake up already."

Hearing the crowd's skepticism, Ye Feng secretly reveled in it.

This was exactly the effect he wanted. He needed everyone to look down on him. That way, when he shocked them all, when he slapped Su Lin's face publicly, the impact would be deafening. Su Lin would become a permanent joke at Jiangning First High.

People would hear "Jiangning First High" and immediately think of how Ye Feng's grades had surpassed Su Lin's.

"Whether I can beat him or not is my business. No need for you to worry about it."

"You... ungrateful jerk."

Ye Feng snorted dismissively. Ignoring the girl, his eyes quickly scanned the crowd until they locked onto Su Lin.

He walked up to Su Lin. "Su Lin—got the guts to make a bet with me?"

Su Lin shrugged. "Ye Feng, if you're that bored, go home and memorize some vocabulary. Or call Feng Yifei and Yan Huan out here to run laps."

"Hmph! I think you're just scared. Afraid you'll lose to me."

Su Lin shrugged again, completely unbothered by Ye Feng's provocations.

Just then, Lin Xiaowan egged him on. "Su Lin, bet him."

"Yeah, Su Lin! Bet him! This guy's gotten way too full of himself—he needs a reality check."

"Vice class president, bet him! Ye Feng needs to be taught a lesson."

"..."

Su Lin ignored the crowd and turned to Lin Xiaowan. "What do I get out of betting him?"

"If I win, I'm just beating some underperformer—big deal. If I lose, I become the school's biggest joke. Word might even spread to other schools. Xiaowan, are you hoping to see me humiliated?"

Being stared at by so many people while Su Lin called her "Xiaowan" so intimately made Lin Xiaowan's face flush.

She had no fondness whatsoever for Ye Feng. Especially after the 80,000 yuan incident—she felt nothing but disgust for him now.

Seeing Ye Feng act so arrogant just now, her instinct had been to sic Su Lin on him. But thinking about it more carefully, she realized she'd been hasty.

"Su Lin, if you're scared of losing, then don't bet. I won't say anything."

Lin Xiaowan glanced at Ye Feng, who was radiating aggressive confidence. She found herself wanting Su Lin to bet—and to win decisively. Otherwise, that scumbag Ye Feng would just get cockier.

Lin Xiaowan bit her lip, pulled Su Lin aside, and whispered, "Bet him. I'm betting on you to win. If you beat him... I'll... I'll go out with you. Be your girlfriend."

"And if I lose?" Su Lin asked with a grin.

"If you lose, pretend you don't know me." Lin Xiaowan's face was cold as ice.

Su Lin's eyes narrowed. "Xiaowan—are you serious?"

This time, Lin Xiaowan didn't look away. She met his gaze squarely and nodded firmly. "Dead serious. But only if you win."

Su Lin nodded. "Get ready to be my wife."

Then he turned to Ye Feng and announced loudly, "Ye Feng, I'll take your bet. Name the stakes."

"Good! At least you've got some guts."

"The stakes are simple—same as before. Loser runs three laps around the track while shouting 'I'm a pig.'"

Su Lin nodded. "Mm. You certainly are."

Ye Feng's face turned iron. "Su Lin, you'd better not welch like Feng Yifei and the others."

Su Lin laughed. "With all these witnesses? I do have some dignity."

"Goddamn Ye Feng! Who the hell said I welched?!"

Feng Yifei pushed through from the edge of the crowd, glaring daggers at Ye Feng. "Huanhuan's not feeling well. I'll run the laps for her."

He threw off his jacket and started jogging while shouting "I'm a pig."

Neither Su Lin nor Ye Feng had expected Feng Yifei to actually show up.

Su Lin squinted. "Laps seem too easy. Ye Feng, how about frog jumps instead? Three laps of frog jumps. Otherwise, every random nobody will want to bet with me, and that's just beneath my dignity."

"Fine! Frog jumps it is. And don't forget—you have to shout 'I'm a pig' while jumping."

"Mm. You don't need to remind me. I already know you are."

"Pfft!"

"Pfft!"

Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan burst out laughing at the same time, and nearby students who'd overheard joined in.
