Lin Xiaowan's heart skipped a beat.

She felt nervous, yet also a bit excited—a contradictory feeling.

"We're friends!"

"Friends, ah. Friends are good. Your father has many friends too—businessmen, officials, ordinary folks. Lots and lots of friends."

"Mm." Lin Xiaowan looked at Lin Guoqiang, unsure what he was getting at.

Lin Guoqiang looked at his daughter's anxious expression and felt angry inside. But seeing her looking so pitiful, his heart nearly broke, and all the things he'd wanted to say suddenly didn't seem worth saying.

The thought that his daughter was acting this way because of some boy made him even angrier.

But what could anger accomplish? He couldn't exactly scold his precious daughter. That wasn't something he could bring himself to do.

To become the mayor, he'd already shortchanged Lin Xiaowan too much.

Lin Guoqiang waved his hand. "Go wash up and get ready for dinner. When you have a chance, introduce me to your friend."

"Uh... okay, Dad."

Lin Xiaowan walked happily toward the bathroom, thinking that if it was Su Lin, he might actually be able to win over her father.

Back home, Su Lin immediately called up the system, ready to draw his lottery.

"System, I want to draw!"

[Host may silently think 'draw' to activate.]

"Draw."

[Wow~! Golden legend! Congratulations, Host, for obtaining the skill—National Banquet-Level Culinary Arts.]

[Wow~! Golden legend! Congratulations, Host, for obtaining the skill—Divine Driving Technique.]

Two more skills acquired. Su Lin was quite pleased. "System, your gold drop rate is way better than those game companies."

System: "......"

"Too bad, cooking and driving are kind of useless to me. I'm a young master—why would I cook for myself? And driving is even more pointless with Uncle Liu around. When are you going to give me something actually useful?"

System: "......"

Su Lin knew the system wouldn't respond to this kind of complaint. He could only hope for better luck next time.

After experiencing his new skills, Su Lin found them rather uninteresting. He sent safety messages to the two girls, then began preparing for the first supermarket.

A new week arrived, and everyone noticed that the recent class sensation, Ye Feng, wasn't there.

Rumors flew everywhere.

Some said Ye Feng had gotten into a fight with thugs outside school and was now hospitalized.

Others said Ye Feng had dropped out.

The wildest claim was that Ye Feng had committed a crime and was now in jail.

At Ye Feng's home.

Ye Weimin looked at Ye Feng, who was earnestly studying, and nodded with satisfaction. "Xiaofeng, I've requested three days off for you. Use these three days to study hard at home. Once you can get out of bed after three days, get yourself back to school."

"Got it, Dad."

"No more thoughts about starting a business, understand? If you want to be an entrepreneur, wait until after college. Once you graduate, you can start whatever business you want—I won't stop you. But for now, study hard and get into a good university. That's more important than anything."

Ye Feng remained silent.

No matter how unwilling he felt, he could only placate Ye Weimin for now.

He'd have to wait until summer vacation or college to begin his entrepreneurial plans.

Ye Feng looked at the book in front of him and felt another headache coming on.

He'd noticed that ever since his memory started declining, it never recovered.

Memorizing things was no longer as easy as before. He had to read a passage many times now to commit it to memory.

Even more alarming, the knowledge he'd memorized using his enhanced memory would gradually fade if he didn't reinforce it.

To get into a good university, Ye Feng could only spend more time studying.

'Sigh... Maybe this is for the best. Let me just get good grades first. If I beat Su Lin, maybe Mom and Dad won't care what I do over summer vacation.'

Right now he had no freedom and no money.

At Jiangning First High, Class 1 of Grade 3, Wang Yi walked in with his math book. "Everyone quiet down."

"Lin Xiaowan, note on the attendance sheet that Ye Feng is on leave."

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "Okay, Teacher Wang."

"Let me take this opportunity to remind everyone—while studying at home, pay attention to your health. Don't be like Ye Feng, studying day and night until you get sick. That just means losing more in the end."

Su Lin nearly laughed out loud hearing Wang Yi's words.

He could guess exactly why Ye Feng wasn't at school without anyone telling him.

With something as serious as the 80,000 yuan incident, there was no way Ye Feng's parents would let him off with just a belt beating.

He was probably lying in bed at home right now.

"March is almost over. April is coming soon. Students, when you count it all up, you only have a little over two months left to review. Two months may not feel long, but they'll pass quickly. Then you'll be facing the college entrance exam."

"Some students are already prepared, but others... well, I can see they're still muddling through. You need to step it up."

"On this point, I suggest everyone learn from Ye Feng..."

After the usual spiel, Wang Yi finally began his lesson.

After class, Su Lin, Chen Yang, Xia Shiyu, and Lin Xiaowan gathered together formally.

Chen Yang no longer cared what the other students thought—the startup had officially begun.

The other students couldn't understand when Chen Yang had gotten so close to Su Lin's group, but since they weren't familiar with Su Lin, they didn't dare approach to listen in.

After making formal introductions, Su Lin looked at Chen Yang. "Yang, I'll be officially registering a company soon. After that, your expenses will go through the company accounts. If you have any questions, just ask Xiaoyu directly."

Chen Yang knew exactly what kind of relationship Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan had with Su Lin.

Though the three hadn't taken that step yet, Chen Yang knew it was only a matter of time given Su Lin's abilities.

So he kept his posture humble. He nodded. "Got it, Brother Lin."

"Mm. Once Xiaowan finalizes the deal, we'll start construction. Yang, you'll be juggling the college entrance exam prep and the supermarket opening. Can you handle it?"

"There's some pressure, but it's not unmanageable."

"Good. If you run into difficulties, speak up early. Don't wait until the fire is at your eyebrows. I won't go easy on you then."

"Don't worry, Brother Lin. Whatever you assign me, I'll get it done."

Su Lin nodded with satisfaction.

This was exactly why he'd chosen Chen Yang to manage the company—the guy was capable and would strictly execute whatever task he was given.

Talent like that wasn't easy to find.

After finishing with Chen Yang, Su Lin turned to Lin Xiaowan. "Xiaowan, how much longer do you think you'll need to close the deal?"

Lin Xiaowan held up two fingers. "Five days max. Should be done by then."

"Oh? Five days to convince them? Mind sharing your method?"

"Want to know?"

Su Lin found Lin Xiaowan's expression amusing.

The girl kept staring at him as if saying "Ask me, ask me. Ask and I'll tell you."

Su Lin couldn't disappoint such an adorable Lin Xiaowan. He played along. "Xiaowan, I'm quite curious."

"Hehe! The method is actually simple. Just identify their advantages and disadvantages, then address them accordingly."

"For example?"

"For example, they use well water instead of city water. The city banned new wells last year. Also, they have two sons, both at marriageable age. Buying a house in Zhongjiang isn't exactly cheap, even if it's not expensive."

"They can't use that building as wedding homes for both sons. So selling and buying elsewhere is the best outcome."

"And their building's location is bad for living. It's between Zhongjiang Avenue and Xingfu Avenue—great for business, but terrible for residential use. Imagine how noisy it gets, especially at night with the dump trucks and cement mixers. And there's more..."

Su Lin was stunned as Lin Xiaowan listed problem after problem.

That location was arguably one of the best spots in Jiangning District. But hearing Lin Xiaowan describe it, it sounded absolutely worthless. If he were the owner, he'd want to sell immediately.

"Xiaowan, listening to you, I feel like living there is some kind of crime."

"Hehe, that's exactly the effect I'm going for. Xiaoyu, if it were you, would you move?"

Xia Shiyu nodded vigorously. "If it were me, I'd definitely move."

Su Lin gave Lin Xiaowan a thumbs up. "Xiaowan, impressive."
