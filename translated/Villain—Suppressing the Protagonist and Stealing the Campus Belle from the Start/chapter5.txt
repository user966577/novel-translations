After the last student finished, Wang Yi addressed the class. "Back to morning reading. Once the teachers finish tallying the school's donations, Xia Shiyu, you'll need to prepare. Monday morning after the flag-raising ceremony, the principal will hand the money over to you."

Xia Shiyu nodded, tears brimming in her eyes.

She'd once had a happy, complete family. But two years ago, illness had claimed her mother. Now it was coming for her father. For any high school girl, it was a devastating blow.

She'd nearly given up on life.

Yet at the moment when every relative and family friend had abandoned her, the school had thrown her a lifeline.

Especially her classmates—their donations rekindled something she thought was gone: hope.

"Don't stress. Just focus on your studies."

Wang Yi took the donation box and left.

The homeroom teacher from the neighboring class passed by in the hallway with his own box.

"Think they'll raise enough for the full surgery?"

"Maybe. Our class alone had over 200,000. Even if every other class only manages 10,000, that's still a ton."

"Get real. Take out Lin Xiaowan's donation and our class barely scraped together a few thousand."

"True. Most people gave ten or twenty. Only a handful went above a hundred."

"..."

Only Su Lin knew the fundraiser wouldn't bring in much beyond his contribution. Plenty of families at the school were well-off, but that didn't mean they'd open their wallets wide. Some parents refused to donate. Others pocketed ninety percent of what their parents gave them.

The moment the break bell rang, Xia Shiyu pulled Lin Xiaowan out of the classroom.

Lin Xiaowan had single-handedly donated an astronomical sum. Xia Shiyu felt compelled to express her gratitude, though she had no idea how.

As the two acknowledged beauties of Jiangning First High, they were constantly compared.

Xia Shiyu—gentle as still water. Lin Xiaowan—ethereal as a winter goddess.

Walking side by side, they drew stares from every direction. But none of those gazes belonged to Su Lin.

Chen Yang wanted to report to Su Lin about the previous night's purchases. Su Lin waved him off with a gesture—they'd talk after school. Then he shifted his attention to the two girls chatting outside the window.

Xia Shiyu was fidgeting with the hem of her sleeve, about to speak, when Lin Xiaowan beat her to it.

"Shiyu, I think I know what you're about to say. Can I go first?"

Xia Shiyu blinked, then nodded.

Lin Xiaowan tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "That 200,000 wasn't actually from me. Su Lin asked me to donate it on his behalf."

"What?" Xia Shiyu clapped her hand over her mouth, eyes wide with disbelief.

Lin Xiaowan sighed internally. She'd known this would be the reaction.

Anyone would be stunned to learn that Su Lin—of all people—had donated this much.

"You're saying that 200,000... came from Su Lin? That's impossible."

"I've barely even spoken to him all semester."

Xia Shiyu peered through the window at Su Lin, who was studying a geography textbook. He'd wanted to familiarize himself with this world's geography.

Interestingly, the countries and territories were nearly identical to Earth—just different names.

Lin Xiaowan also looked toward Su Lin. "Shiyu, I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth. He came to me this morning, handed me 200,000 yuan, and asked me to donate it for him."

"But... but... but 'why'?" Xia Shiyu voiced the question burning in her heart.

"Want to know the reason?" Lin Xiaowan's expression turned cryptic.

Xia Shiyu nodded eagerly. She desperately wanted to know.

She was pretty and had good grades, sure, but she'd never been the original Su Lin's type.

Su Lin's target had always been Lin Xiaowan. Though he'd never explicitly said so, everyone knew.

So the two had virtually zero interaction—which made this baffling.

Lin Xiaowan smiled gently. "The truth is, we've all been fooled by him. He looks like he doesn't care about anyone, but he's actually very thoughtful."

"His reason for asking me was simple. With the exam coming up, he didn't want any rumors flying around the school that might affect his reputation or his performance."

"But honestly, I think he was mostly thinking about you. This is 200,000 yuan. If word got out, the scandal would be enormous. For him, it'd just be the cliché of a rich boy chasing Cinderella. But for you, it'd be completely different—people would tear you apart."

Tears welled in Xia Shiyu's eyes. "But I barely know him. He gives me 200,000 yuan just like that? I could never repay it."

"Don't worry about that. Su Lin's father is one of the wealthiest men in Jiangning. When he decides to donate, the amount doesn't matter."

"For you, 200,000 might be an astronomical figure. For Su Lin, it's probably just a reward for doing well on an exam."

Xia Shiyu gazed at Su Lin through the window, thinking: 'I've been misjudging him all along. He really is a gentle person.'

'But why does he act so cold and superior? It only makes people dislike him.'

She couldn't figure it out. The answer was something only Su Lin himself could provide.

Seeing Xia Shiyu lost in thought, Lin Xiaowan smiled. "Shiyu, I know what you're thinking. You're curious why he puts on that arrogant front, right?"

Xia Shiyu looked at her in surprise.

"It's not just you—I'm curious too. I really don't know what goes on in that guy's head."

"Should we go ask him together?"

Xia Shiyu shook her head. "Better not. I'm sure Su Lin has his reasons."

"Alright, I'll ask him myself later," Lin Xiaowan said, curiosity glinting in her eyes.

"Would that be... appropriate?"

"What's the big deal? I'll just ask. If he wants to answer, great. If not, whatever."

"Okay..."

Xia Shiyu stared at Su Lin's face, wracking her brain for some way to thank him.

Before she could think of anything, Lin Xiaowan spoke up seriously. "Shiyu, I think Su Lin's concerns are valid. Let's keep this between us. Don't tell anyone, okay?"

Xia Shiyu hesitated, then felt a warm glow in her chest thinking about how much Su Lin had considered on her behalf.

"Xiaowan, don't worry. If Su Lin doesn't want anyone to know, I absolutely won't say a word."

"Good."

For some reason she couldn't quite explain, Lin Xiaowan didn't want anyone else to know about this hidden side of Su Lin.

She had no particular feelings for him at this point—but the impulse was instinctive, beyond logic.
