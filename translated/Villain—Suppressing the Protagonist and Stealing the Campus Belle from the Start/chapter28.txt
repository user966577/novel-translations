Su Lin sat down beside Xia Shiyu and placed a template IOU in front of her.

"Just follow this template."

Xia Shiyu looked at it, and her eyes glistened with emotion.

"Su Lin... you planned to lend me the money all along, didn't you?"

Su Lin nodded. "Of course. Looking at our entire school, the people with the means to help you can be counted on one hand. Xiaowan has the connections, but she doesn't have that kind of money on her own. I'm different—this is money I earned myself, so lending it to you comes with zero baggage."

"When I thought about it, I was really the only one who could help. And Shiyu, I considered what would happen if I didn't."

"If Uncle Xia actually died, you'd be completely alone. And those relatives of yours would swoop in to carve up what's left—you might not even be able to hold on to your apartment. You'd end up living under someone else's roof."

"That's not the outcome I want to see. I want to keep watching our Shiyu smile."

"Su Lin!"

Xia Shiyu clapped one hand over her mouth while the other snatched up the pen and signed the IOU in a flurry of strokes.

**[Ding! Xia Shiyu's affinity toward the Host has reached 90 (rising).]**

Su Lin smiled at the sight.

When Xia Shiyu paused at the amount field, he said, "Start with 600,000 yuan. Uncle Xia will still need to stay in the hospital for a while after surgery."

"Okay!"

Xia Shiyu had already made up her mind. She might never be able to repay 600,000 yuan in ten or twenty years. So she'd spend the rest of her life paying Su Lin back.

Even if he asked her to do something... inappropriate, she was willing.

After all, in this world where the economy in 2002 was roughly equivalent to Earth in 2010, the average person was still earning a few hundred yuan a month.

600,000 yuan was a fortune. Not everyone had that kind of money, and fewer still would part with it willingly.

With that mindset settled, Xia Shiyu stopped being coy about it.

She wrote quickly, finishing the IOU in just a few minutes.

"Su Lin, don't I need to put a fingerprint on this?"

"No need. This is just a formality—no fingerprints required. I don't even have any red ink at home." Su Lin chuckled.

"Hehe, aren't you afraid I'll deny it later?"

"Haha. Shiyu, even without this IOU, you'd remember every cent down to the penny."

"Mm... fair enough."

"IOU's done. Now sign the contract."
