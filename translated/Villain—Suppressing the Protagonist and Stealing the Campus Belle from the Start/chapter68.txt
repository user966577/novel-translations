Su Lin parked his car away from the school entrance—a spot with no foot traffic, convenient for getting in and out.

...

When he walked into the classroom, Lin Xiaowan had already turned on the lights and opened the windows. Seeing him, she looked surprised. "Su Lin, you're this early?"

Su Lin nodded. "Obviously. If I don't start coming earlier, I'm going to lose my future wife."

"Oh, stop it. What are you even saying?"

A blackboard eraser came flying at his head. Su Lin dodged it easily. "Tsk, tsk—Xiaowan, you've got violent tendencies. I'm seriously concerned about my future married life. Am I going to get crushed to death?"

Something about Su Lin's teasing grin told Lin Xiaowan there was a double meaning buried in there, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.

"Domestic violence? Hmph, scared already? You can still back out."

"It's just a little crushing. I can handle it." Su Lin retrieved the eraser and placed it back on the ledge.

"I saw an Audi A6 outside just now. Guy in his forties, weathered-looking, wearing a wool overcoat. Wouldn't happen to be my future father-in-law, would it?" Su Lin asked with a sly grin.

"'Future father-in-law'? That's my dad. Where did you see him?"

"In his car. He was staring daggers at me—like he wanted me dead. But I swear, other than that dinner we had, I've never even met the man. No idea why he was glaring."

"Glaring at you? That is weird. But then again, I did torture him this morning. Got him up at the crack of dawn to drive me here, and he barely sleeps as it is. This is one of his rare breaks." Lin Xiaowan thought for a moment, then turned her gaze on Su Lin. "Su Lin, this is all your fault. You turned me into this."

The resemblance to Lin Guoqiang's scowl was uncanny.

"Xiaowan, that's a problem with your sense of filial duty, not something you can blame on me."

"My filial duty is just fine, thank you. You're the problem. If it weren't for you, I never would have come up with such a terrible plan. So yes—it's your fault."

"Fine, fine. You win. You always win. Come here—let me give you a hug to make it up to you."

Su Lin opened his arms wide. Lin Xiaowan ducked away. "That's making it up to me? You're making it up to yourself."

Su Lin let his gaze drift below Lin Xiaowan's chin and raised an eyebrow. Had they... grown?

Xia Shiyu ate the same meals with them every day, and he even helped with her circulation sometimes. Yet she showed no changes. Meanwhile Lin Xiaowan...

"What are you staring at? Su Lin, you pervert!"

"Ahem... Xiaowan, please don't wear that outfit out again. Did you bring your uniform? Put it on."

"You want me to die of heatstroke?"

Mid-April in Zhongjiang already meant daytime temperatures in the low twenties. Many students had switched to short sleeves, though some girls still wore light jackets. Lin Xiaowan was one of them.

Mentally, Lin Xiaowan was more mature than her peers. She was well aware of her figure and usually dressed in loose-fitting clothes to downplay it.

"Oh—Su Lin, my dad says he's coming to the parent-teacher conference."

"So? Fathers come to parent-teacher conferences. That's normal."

Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "Not for my dad. Since elementary school, he's never set foot in my school. If he's making a special trip for this conference, it's not because he cares about my grades. He's coming to meet you."

"Xiaowan, you didn't tell him we're dating, did you?"

"How could I? We're not even dating!"

"Exactly. As far as anyone knows, we're just good friends. What's there to worry about?"

"It's just... I talked about you too much at home. Praised you way too many times. My parents got suspicious." Lin Xiaowan buried her face in her hands, wishing the ground would swallow her.

She deeply regretted all those glowing things she'd said about Su Lin.

In hindsight, she'd laid it on way too thick. Su Lin was genuinely talented and ambitious, sure—but he also had plenty of faults. He was nowhere near the paragon she'd painted him as.

"So be on your guard. My dad's probably going to interrogate you."

Su Lin shrugged. "No big deal. Relax, Xiaowan. I won't upset your old man."

"The way you are, you're already driving me crazy. As if you could hold back around my dad."

Hearing her complaint, Su Lin smiled. Every side of this girl was adorable. He wanted nothing more than to scoop her up and tease her mercilessly.

Shortly after the bell rang, Wang Yi walked in carrying a stack of exam papers and a ranking sheet—every student's score and class rank listed clearly.

"Lin Xiaowan, come hand out the math exams. And distribute this ranking sheet while you're at it—one per person."

Lin Xiaowan stood and began passing out papers.

"Since we have the ranking sheets, I won't read scores aloud today. Everyone can see where they stand. Know your own number."

"Our class still has three students in the school's top ten—no change there. As for the class top ten, there have been some minor shifts. A few of you had big score swings—you need to refocus."

Wang Yi's eyes settled on Ye Feng. "Ye Feng, your math score this time is disappointing. You made careless errors on questions you should have gotten right. Go back and shore up your fundamentals."

Ye Feng nodded silently.

He'd already anticipated the drop. His enhanced memory had deteriorated significantly—what used to be near-perfect recall after just a few reads was now merely above-average. Nothing close to the photographic ability he'd once had.

Worse, knowledge he'd already mastered kept slipping away when he didn't review it regularly. Things he was certain he knew would vanish, as if they'd never been learned.

Ye Feng chalked it up to the side effects of rebirth. There was no other explanation for forgetting so much.

He lived in constant anxiety now—never knowing when his past-life memories would fade completely, never knowing when his memory would deteriorate to that of an ordinary person.

Having tasted life at the top, Ye Feng couldn't bear the thought of being average again. So he'd thrown himself entirely into studying, abandoning everything else. Even that wasn't enough to do more than maintain his current standing.

"In other news, this exam's top scorer is once again Su Lin—748 out of 750. That's a record that shook the entire province. And Lin Xiaowan made significant improvement—736, second in the school. Su Lin, Lin Xiaowan, keep up the excellent work."

Su Lin nodded confidently.

Lin Xiaowan, however, felt deflated. She knew this had been her best performance ever—she'd even scored perfect marks in two subjects. But against Su Lin? Hopeless.

It gnawed at her. The boy was like a cheat code—perfect in every subject except Chinese. And even in Chinese, the school admitted they docked a few points purely on principle, because a perfect score would look too suspicious.

"One more announcement—parent-teacher conference. This Saturday afternoon at one o'clock. All students are excused for the day. Parents who can't attend will need the student to be present instead. So whatever it takes, get your parents here. The exam is right around the corner, and there's a lot we need to discuss with them."

"Su Lin, Lin Xiaowan—in all your years of high school, neither of your parents has shown up once. That's not acceptable. Don't give me 'they're busy.' Find a way."

Su Lin chuckled but didn't respond.

Fat chance. Since transmigrating, he hadn't seen Su Zhenguo at home even once. The man practically lived on construction sites. A parent-teacher conference wasn't going to lure him back.

Lin Xiaowan, however, nodded—then cast a worried glance at Su Lin.

Lin Guoqiang showing up at the school would cause a stir, no doubt. The question was what kind of scene it would turn into.

But knowing Su Lin's track record of never coming out on the losing end, she felt a bit more at ease. He'd handle it.

'Actually,' she thought with a slightly wicked thrill, 'I'm kind of looking forward to it. What kind of sparks will fly when Su Lin and Dad go head to head?'
