'And here I was thinking tonight might involve some drunken indiscretion. Nope—out cold.'

'I seriously suspect she did this on purpose.'

He gave her backside two pats.

Mm. Nice.

Unfortunately, Xia Shiyu didn't react at all. She was truly and completely gone.

Su Lin could only carry her upstairs.

'She's so light. This girl needs to eat more.'

'She's shorter and lighter than Xiaowan by a good margin.'

The next morning, Xia Shiyu's eyes drifted open in a haze. She felt herself lying on top of someone, warm and soft.

Her hand had slipped from Su Lin's neck at some point during the night and was now resting on his stomach.

She gave an absent-minded squeeze.

'What's that?'

Another squeeze. Then it clicked.

'Those are abs.'

Xia Shiyu's brain snapped to full alert in an instant. Every trace of her hangover evaporated in a single second.

She opened her eyes and saw a perfectly handsome face.

Su Lin.

Everything came rushing back.

He appeared to be sound asleep.

Xia Shiyu carefully extracted her hand, then gently eased herself up.

She examined herself and Su Lin. Both of their clothes were disheveled but still on—nothing had been removed.

She exhaled in relief.

Then she began the painstaking process of reconstructing last night's events.

The drinking. Everything that happened with Su Lin.

She buried her face in her hands. 'Xia Shiyu, how could you do those things? You kissed him on your own initiative—have you no shame at all?'

She patted her burning cheeks. Right now, she wanted nothing more than to crawl into a hole and disappear.

At least she could be grateful for one thing: she'd kept Su Lin up so late with her antics that he was still asleep while she was already awake.

If they'd both woken up at the same time and been conscious of the situation—she might as well go do the thing she'd been too scared to do yesterday.

Xia Shiyu tiptoed off the bed.

She'd just slipped on her shoes when she noticed Su Lin's upper body was exposed—his shirt had been pushed up at some point, revealing a sculpted set of abs.

Extremely eye-catching.

'Su Lin's body is this good?'

'He always wears clothes, so you can't tell. Who knew he had abs like that?'

She covered her eyes with one hand and reached for the blanket with the other to pull it over him.

'I'm going to die. I'm going to die. This is so humiliating. Xia Shiyu, how did you end up doing so many embarrassing things last night? Su Lin is definitely laughing at you.'

Pressing her palms against her flushed cheeks and remembering the sensation still lingering on her fingertips, Xia Shiyu felt like that hand of hers was permanently tainted.

"Mm..."

A soft sound from Su Lin nearly made her jump out of her skin.

She barely managed to contain herself.

A furtive glance confirmed he'd only rolled over. Still asleep.

She tucked the blanket around him one more time, then crept out of the room.

She didn't dare close the door for fear the sound would wake him.

Su Lin woke to the smell of cooking.

When he opened his eyes, his entire body ached—shoulders, back, everything.

"Jesus. Even with this enhanced body I'm sore? Xia Shiyu, what the hell did you do to me last night?" he muttered, rolling his shoulders.

He'd brought her to the guest room intending to set her down on the bed and retreat to his own room.

That plan had gone sideways immediately. She'd clung to him like a barnacle—no matter how he tried to put her down, she wouldn't let go. Then she'd pulled him onto the bed with her.

And she still wouldn't let go.

In the end, Su Lin had surrendered to his fate and fallen asleep with her draped over him.

Beautiful as Xia Shiyu was, being pinned under her for an entire night was no picnic.

His shoulder felt like it was about to fall off.

'Never again. I am never letting this girl drink again.'

After freshening up, Su Lin headed downstairs.

"Is that the housekeeper cooking, or Shiyu?"

"Smells this good... definitely not the housekeeper's work."

He followed the aroma to the kitchen and found Xia Shiyu wearing an apron, stirring a pot of porridge with a ladle.

"S-Su Lin, you're awake! I saw ingredients in the fridge, so I made porridge."

"It's really good for hangovers—helps settle the stomach."

Su Lin smirked. "A hangover cure? Your hangover hit you on the spot last night. What's there left to cure?"

Xia Shiyu's face reddened. The memory of that morning's awkward awakening flashed through her mind.

Her eyes drifted involuntarily to Su Lin's midsection. Those eight abs.

"What are you looking at?"

"N-nothing!"

"Su Lin, have you washed up yet? If not, go do that!"

"Are you trying to get rid of me?"

Xia Shiyu didn't bother responding—she just walked over and physically pushed him out of the kitchen.

She wasn't ready to face him yet. She'd had no idea he'd come downstairs so soon.

Su Lin let himself be pushed out, chuckling. He knew she was thin-skinned, so he hadn't said anything to tease her. And yet, even without provocation, the girl couldn't look him in the eye.

Ten minutes later, Su Lin had washed up and come back downstairs.

Xia Shiyu had set the table: a pot of fragrant lean-meat porridge and several small side dishes she'd prepared herself.

"The kitchen only had these ingredients, so I just threw something together. Try it and tell me what you think."

Su Lin sat down and picked up his chopsticks. "No need to try it—I literally woke up because of the smell."

"Making lean-meat porridge fragrant enough to smell from another floor? There probably aren't five people in all of Zhongjiang who could pull that off. Where did you learn to cook like this?"

"Family circumstances, of course."

"Huh? What does cooking have to do with family circumstances?"

"Everything. My dad told me—when they were growing up, times were tough. To make sure everyone ate enough without getting bored of the food, they'd find every trick in the book to make plain meals taste amazing. It was about stimulating appetite."
