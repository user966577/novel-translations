The bank clerk processing the transfer was somewhat dazed.

Su Lin's registered company was called Zhongjiang Yulin Limited. The legal representative was none other than Xia Shiyu.

And Xia Shiyu had just turned eighteen.

There was no helping it. Xia Shiyu looked the youngest of the three, but in reality, she was the oldest.

Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan were both still under eighteen.

As for the company name, all three of them were quite pleased with it.

Su Lin, Lin Xiaowan, Xia Shiyu—each of them had a character perfectly woven into "Yulin."

Leaving the bank, all three were in high spirits.

Especially Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan.

"Yeah! We finally bought it! Su Lin, how about that—am I impressive or what?" Lin Xiaowan looked at Su Lin, seeking praise.

Su Lin gave her a thumbs up. "Impressive. Very impressive."

"Hehe, rare for you to acknowledge my work so readily."

Su Lin smiled. "Xiaowan, you've got that wrong. I've never doubted your work ability. Why else do you think I gave you this job?"

"Actually, both you and Xiaoyu, I have high hopes for. If Xiaoyu had handled this, she probably could've closed the deal too—just not as smoothly. Xiaowan, you're just too good at reading people. Those people were thanking you the whole time."

"Hehe, I guess you could call it selling someone and having them count the money for you."

"Hahaha!" All three burst out laughing.

Su Lin checked the time. It was still early—he hadn't expected buying the house to go so smoothly today.

"Xiaowan, today's success is all thanks to you. Why don't you decide what we do next?"

Lin Xiaowan took Xia Shiyu's hand. "Xiaoyu, I wasn't there for your birthday. Let me make it up to you today. What do you say?"

Xia Shiyu waved her hand. "Xiaowan, I really don't care much about birthdays. What's past is past."

'Not casual at all,' Xia Shiyu thought. 'She and Su Lin had already celebrated a perfect birthday together.'

"Xiaoyu, I know you don't care about this, but it's your eighteenth birthday—your coming-of-age day. We can't just let it pass."

Su Lin stepped in. "Xiaoyu, since Xiaowan wants to make it up to you, just say yes. Otherwise, I'll never hear the end of it."

Lin Xiaowan glared at Su Lin again. "Being resented by me—isn't that your fault? Hmph."

"Heh."

Su Lin wasn't foolish enough to argue with Lin Xiaowan. This kind of argument had no winners, and he'd always end up being the one at fault.

Su Lin knew this game all too well, so he wisely kept quiet.

Lin Xiaowan was waiting for Su Lin to keep talking so she could retort, but the guy suddenly went silent. She had all this energy with nowhere to direct it.

"Okay, okay. But Xiaowan, no wasting money."

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "Don't worry, Xiaoyu!"

"Alright then, Miss Lin. Where to next? Personal driver Su Lin at your service."

"Heh, Su Lin, with that attitude, you'd get beaten to death as a waiter."

"Haha, Xiaowan's right. Su Lin, you'd definitely get beaten up being a waiter like that."

"Heh, just get in the car. Wherever you want to go, I'll take you."

Lin Xiaowan waved her hand. "No need. Before, you celebrated Xiaoyu's birthday alone. Today I want to do the same—just us two. We'll walk ourselves."

Su Lin found this amusing. "Xiaowan, you know you look really cute when you hold grudges?"

"Don't think saying that will make me bring you along."

Lin Xiaowan wrinkled her brow. If that place weren't unsuitable for guys, she'd definitely have brought Su Lin too.

Su Lin spread his hands. "Fine then. I'll go find Yang to discuss the renovation. You two have fun."

"Mm. Remember to find a professional designer."

"Relax. I am the professional."

"Heh."

Watching Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan walk away hand in hand, Su Lin was actually quite curious where Lin Xiaowan would take Xia Shiyu to make up for her birthday. But he didn't follow. He knew Lin Xiaowan's personality—she didn't really want to exclude him.

So she must be taking Xia Shiyu somewhere that was girls-only.

When Su Lin handed the purchase contract to Chen Yang, Chen Yang was completely stunned. "Brother Lin, that's a three-story standalone building. You got it for 800,000?"

Su Lin nodded. "Hard to believe?"

"Of course! That area's property prices are rising. How did this family sell below market? Brother Lin, you didn't pull any strings, did you?" Chen Yang asked suspiciously.

Su Lin's face darkened. "I'm a legitimate businessman."

"But... 800,000!"

Su Lin waved his hand. "Xiaowan negotiated this. You didn't see it—those people were begging Xiaowan to buy. Even I was stunned."

"Xiaowan is really capable. Yang, you might end up working under her someday. Keep up the pace!"

Chen Yang said confidently, "Don't worry, Brother Lin. I'll definitely keep up. But aren't you going to manage the company yourself?"

"I'll manage it for now. The company isn't on track yet—how could I not manage it? But later we might open other companies, so..."

Su Lin didn't finish, but Chen Yang understood exactly what he meant.

His heart burned with excitement. Working for someone with vision, capability, and planning like Su Lin was exhilarating.

"Alright, the house is bought. The rest—renovation, hiring—that's on you, Yang. If you're running short on time, get yourself some assistants." Su Lin reminded him.

Chen Yang shook his head. "No need. The company's just starting. You don't even have assistants. Why would I need any?"

"If it comes to it, I can have my sister help out."

Su Lin looked surprised. "Your sister?"

"Yeah, my sister!"

Speaking of his sister, Chen Yang suddenly came alive, as if injected with pure energy. "Brother Lin, don't underestimate my sister. She's really capable. She's already self-studying the first-year high school curriculum. I tested her recently—she scored over 680."

'Whoa. That's serious.'

Su Lin now recalled that in the original novel, Chen Lin and Ye Feng had met in college.

Ye Feng had graduated normally, while Chen Lin had skipped grades to get there.

As expected, anyone connected to the protagonist was abnormal—all freaks of nature.

"Really, Brother Lin. My sister is really smart. I'll have her come help out when she has time. Is that okay?"

Su Lin nodded. "It's fine, but I need to meet her first. If she's not up to it, just let her focus on her studies."

"Mm, don't worry, Brother Lin. She won't disappoint you."

Looking at Chen Yang's confident expression, Su Lin figured Chen Lin couldn't be too bad—at least more capable than Chen Yang.

But Chen Lin was only fifteen, just in ninth grade.

If this girl developed feelings for him, should he wait three years... or hold back?

This was a question worth pondering.

Chen Yang had no idea that while he was enthusiastically promoting his sister, Su Lin was already thinking about becoming his brother-in-law!

In the end, Su Lin decided against the "three years isn't a loss" approach.

After all, the system had told him there might be more than just Ye Feng as a protagonist in this world.

Where there were protagonists, there would be female leads.

Chen Lin might be impressive, but she was just a supporting character. Su Lin didn't need to go after an underage supporting character.

If he encountered other female leads...

Mm...
