Ye Feng quickly caught up to the group.

Su Lin noticed him walking alongside them in silence, listening intently to their conversation. *This guy's got over a decade of extra life experience,* Su Lin thought. *He's mining our small talk for useful intel.*

Fortunately, neither Xia Shiyu nor Lin Xiaowan would bring up the donation details on their own. Otherwise, with Ye Feng's sharp mind, he'd have traced the discrepancy straight back to Su Lin.

"Su Lin, the monthly exam's coming up. How's your preparation going?"

Su Lin smiled. "Pretty good. As everyone knows, English is my Achilles' heel. But after studying your notes and Shiyu's, I think I can make a decent jump."

"Heh, maybe I should look forward to a dark horse moment then. Who knows—maybe you'll overtake Shiyu and grab second place in the school."

Su Lin grinned at Lin Xiaowan. "Second place? Why not first?"

"First?"

Lin Xiaowan giggled. "If you did take first, that'd actually be great. It'd give me some motivation. Three years of being number one is getting a little stale."

*Look at that. When women brag, they don't hold back either.*

Xia Shiyu chimed in with a smile. "Su Lin, how about you just focus on my notes? Maybe you'll pass me."

"Hahahaha!"

Both girls dissolved into laughter.

Watching Xia Shiyu's unguarded, radiant smile—genuinely beautiful—Ye Feng was stunned.

He couldn't remember the last time he'd seen her laugh like that.

Outside the school, Su Lin suggested they grab a taxi.

The two girls readily agreed.

A cab pulled over almost immediately.

Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu slid into the back seat. Su Lin, quick on his feet, squeezed in beside them.

Three across in the back—a perfect fit. Ye Feng had no choice but to ride shotgun.

He felt distinctly like a fifth wheel.

It was obvious now. The massive donation had accelerated Lin Xiaowan and Xia Shiyu's friendship to best-friend status.

That made sense, actually. Xia Shiyu was the kind of person who repaid kindness with loyalty. She'd find her own way to reciprocate.

As for Su Lin—the guy was just shamelessly tagging along with whatever the girls were discussing.

Ye Feng thought Su Lin's game was pretty amateurish. Following the girls' conversational lead meant surrendering your own rhythm. And without rhythm, chasing girls like Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan—girls who were sharp as tacks—was utterly pointless.

What Ye Feng failed to realize was that Su Lin had already secured an unassailable position. At this stage, he didn't need to control the rhythm at all.

Watching the animated conversation in the back seat, Ye Feng decided it was time to make himself heard.

He cleared his throat, drawing everyone's attention.

"Shiyu, if I remember correctly, your dad needs a kidney transplant, right?"

Xia Shiyu's smile faded. She nodded. "Yes, he does."

Lin Xiaowan and Su Lin exchanged a knowing glance but stayed quiet, curious to see where Ye Feng was headed.

"If it's a transplant, 280,000 yuan probably isn't enough."

The color drained from Xia Shiyu's face. These past few days, with Lin Xiaowan by her side keeping her spirits up, she'd been avoiding the heavier thoughts. But Ye Feng's words yanked her back to the harsh reality.

The cold, bloody reality.

Su Lin spoke up calmly. "I've heard it costs about $8,500 total—$2,800 for the surgery itself, and roughly $5,700 for the kidney. Ye Feng, you have a plan?"

Ye Feng gave a mysterious smile and said nothing.

His silence could mean he was helpless. It could also mean he had something up his sleeve.

Su Lin read the tactic immediately and kept quiet.

He wanted Ye Feng to walk right into the trap. If Su Lin said too much and raised suspicions, all his careful planning would go to waste.

"Ye Feng, if you've got an idea, just spit it out. What's with the cloak-and-dagger act?" Lin Xiaowan's expression was icy.

"Ahem... Xiaowan..."

"Since when are we on a first-name basis?"

"Lin Xiaowan—look, I do have an idea, but it depends on whether Shiyu's willing."

Xia Shiyu looked at him with wide, innocent eyes, her face pale. "Ye Feng, are you saying I should try to be a donor match? I already did. The doctors said it wouldn't work."

Su Lin gently reassured her. "Shiyu, don't worry about that. It's completely normal for a child's kidney not to match a parent's. But that doesn't mean we won't find a compatible donor. This is a big country—there'll be one somewhere."

Xia Shiyu nodded, but a hollow look crept back into her eyes.

Ye Feng wanted to kick himself.

*What were you thinking, bringing up this topic, you moron?*

Meanwhile, Su Lin was thinking about the original novel. Xia Shiyu's father had eventually gotten the surgery. The donor kidney had come from a city up north.

And the total cost had been not $8,500, but closer to $12,000.

"Shiyu, don't be upset. Su Lin's right—this is a big country. We'll find a match. And I'll talk to my parents as soon as I get home. I'll have them help with the search." Lin Xiaowan held Xia Shiyu's hand, her heart aching for her friend.

Over the past few days, she'd truly come to see Xia Shiyu as a sister.

She adored this heartbreakingly sweet girl. Around others, Xia Shiyu always wore a bright smile. But when she thought no one was looking, she became a wounded animal.

Lin Xiaowan knew that if this were any other favor, her father Lin Guoqiang would refuse. But when it came to saving a life, he wouldn't hesitate.

"Four passengers, People's Hospital—we're here."

The driver's announcement snapped Su Lin back to reality. They'd arrived.

"Xiaowan, I forgot to bring money. You're paying."

"Fine!"

After paying the fare, the four of them stood at the hospital entrance.

Lin Xiaowan noticed a flower shop and fruit stand near the entrance. She was here representing the class, after all—showing up empty-handed seemed improper.

"Shiyu, you and Ye Feng go ahead and take care of the payment. Su Lin and I will buy some flowers and fruit for your dad."

Xia Shiyu protested. "Xiaowan, you're already doing so much just by coming. You don't need to buy anything."

Lin Xiaowan shook her head. "No way. Su Lin and I are here on behalf of the class, not as individuals. We can't show up with nothing!"

"Let them go, Shiyu," Ye Feng jumped in. "The class president's right—they're representing the class, not themselves. Let them buy something. Otherwise Teacher Wang will chew them out."

He knew this was his best window to convince Xia Shiyu.

Miss it, and there wouldn't be another chance.

Su Lin glanced at Ye Feng. He knew the guy was about to make his move for the money.

He gave a casual nod and walked off toward the flower shop with Lin Xiaowan.

Lin Xiaowan cast a few suspicious glances at Ye Feng. Something about him felt off, but she couldn't put her finger on it. Eventually, she let it go and joined Su Lin.
