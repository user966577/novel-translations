By the time they reached the school gate, Su Lin had walked Chen Yang through every detail. Chen Yang committed each point to memory before they parted ways.

Chen Yang watched Su Lin climb into a Mercedes S350 and drive off. There wasn't a trace of envy on his face—only quiet determination. "One day, I'll be driving a car like that."

In the car, the driver Liu Yong glanced at Su Lin in the back seat, somewhat surprised. "Young Master Su, you're out later than usual today."

"Had something to go over with a classmate. Took longer than expected."

"Oh." Liu Yong nodded.

Su Lin tossed his backpack onto the neighboring seat. "Uncle Liu, is my dad coming home tonight?"

Calling Su Zhenguo "Dad" didn't bother Su Lin in the slightest.

After all, Su Zhenguo was incredibly generous, and genuinely good to him—practically granted his every wish.

In the original novel, Su Zhenguo had given the original Su Lin over a million yuan when he graduated high school and bought him an AMG GT.

Before transmigrating, Su Lin had been an orphan with no family. Now that he suddenly had one, he felt no resistance at all.

If anything, there was a quiet anticipation.

Liu Yong gave Su Lin another puzzled look.

Today's Su Lin was nothing like his usual self. Normally, Su Lin never initiated conversation—it was always Liu Yong talking and Su Lin responding with "okay," "mm," or "yeah." He'd certainly never strung together a full sentence like this.

Su Lin raised an eyebrow. "Something wrong, Uncle Liu?"

Liu Yong shook his head, pushing down his confusion. "Mr. Su just won two property developments in Donghai City. He won't be back for a while."

"Alright. Give him a call later and tell him I need to use some money tomorrow. I'll be taking 200,000 yuan from the safe."

"200,000? Young Master Su, what do you need that kind of money for?"

"A classmate's father has uremia and needs a kidney transplant. The school's organizing a fundraiser, so I want to contribute." Su Lin's tone was perfectly casual.

A strange look flickered across Liu Yong's face.

Then understanding dawned.

No wonder Su Lin was being so polite today—he was trying to do someone a favor. And that classmate must be someone special. A girl, almost certainly. A pretty one.

Liu Yong wore the expression of a man who'd figured it all out.

Su Lin ignored it. His mind was already working on the system's activation conditions.

Suppressing Ye Feng alone wasn't enough. He also needed to change how Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan perceived him.

But how to change that perception? Not only did it have to change, it had to happen naturally.

When Ye Feng returned from his rebirth and found the donation pool had jumped from 50,000 to over 200,000 yuan, he'd definitely get suspicious. Su Lin never underestimated anyone.

A plan began forming in his mind.

The next morning, Su Lin arrived at school early and found exactly who he expected—Lin Xiaowan. As the class president who kept the classroom key, she was almost always the first one there.

Lin Xiaowan sat absorbed in a copy of *Youth Digest*, completely unaware of Su Lin walking through the door.

Not until he stopped right in front of her desk did she look up, closing the magazine. "Su Lin?"

"Is something the matter?"

Su Lin nodded. "Xiaowan, could you do me a favor?"

The casual use of her first name made Lin Xiaowan frown, a hint of impatience crossing her face. "What kind of favor? Just so we're clear—if it's something I can't help with, don't even ask."

"Don't worry. It's simple, and it won't put you in an awkward position."

Reassured, Lin Xiaowan relaxed slightly. Though she disliked Su Lin's usual demeanor, she was the type to help if someone genuinely needed it.

Seeing she'd agreed, Su Lin didn't waste time. He pulled 200,000 yuan from his backpack and set it on the desk.

Lin Xiaowan shot to her feet.

Su Lin quickly explained. "Ahem—it's really simple. When Mr. Wang starts the collection later, I need you to donate this money under your name."

Lin Xiaowan's jaw dropped.

She pointed at herself, then at the money, stammering. "Me—you—Su Lin, you want to donate money... under *my* name? Why?"

Though her family was wealthier than Su Lin's, they'd always emphasized frugality. Her money stayed in the bank and she didn't spend extravagantly.

Having 200,000 yuan suddenly appear before her was a bit of a shock.

Su Lin smiled. "Because I don't want unnecessary misunderstandings. You know how I treat the less well-off kids in class—I've never given them the time of day. If I suddenly donate this much to Xia Shiyu, what do you think everyone will say? What will the teachers think? What will Xia Shiyu think?"

"I don't even have to guess. The rumors would fly—that I'm secretly in love with Xia Shiyu, or that I'm keeping her as a mistress."

"Once rumors like that start, they'd be chains around both of us. With the college entrance exam coming up, is this really the time for that kind of gossip?"

Lin Xiaowan stared at him as if seeing Su Lin for the very first time, her almond eyes wide with scrutiny, as though flowers had sprouted on his face.

If she hadn't confirmed with her own eyes that this was indeed the Su Lin she knew, she'd never have believed he was capable of something like this.

"Why are you staring at me like that, Xiaowan? Don't recognize me?"

Lin Xiaowan shook her head, then nodded, then sighed wistfully. "The old Su Lin I knew. But today's Su Lin... I don't think I've ever really known you."

Looking at the beautiful girl's bewildered expression, Su Lin couldn't help but grin.

She really lived up to her role as the female lead. That little look of surprise—lips slightly parted, eyes wide—was absolutely adorable.

Made a guy want to find out what those lips tasted like.

Su Lin kept his expression neutral. "Whether it's the old me or the new me doesn't matter. Xiaowan, are you going to help me or not?"

"Su Lin, what if I say no? Will you donate it yourself?"

Su Lin shook his head. "If you won't help, I'll just throw in two hundred and call it a day."

"How can you say that? What about Xia Shiyu's father?" Lin Xiaowan's eyes went wide with indignation.

"What about him? Her father and I have nothing to do with each other. Whether I give two hundred or two hundred thousand, it's all goodwill. Having me donate this myself is absolutely out of the question. I'll just take it home."
