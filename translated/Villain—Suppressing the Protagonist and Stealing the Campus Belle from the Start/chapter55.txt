Another Emperor's Luck lottery chance. Su Lin figured this time he might finally get a useful skill.

The previous skills had been rather useless.

Too bad the beginner gift pack was a one-time thing. Nothing that good would come again.

Xia Shiyu buried her face against Su Lin's chest, sobbing. Su Lin stroked her head gently. "Xiaoyu, it's getting late. Do you still want to celebrate your birthday or not?"

Hearing this, Xia Shiyu stirred. She released her hold on him and looked up, eyes red.

"It's just a birthday. No need to get this emotional." Su Lin joked.

Xia Shiyu shook her head. "Su Lin, it's been so long since anyone wished me happy birthday. I'd almost forgotten today was my birthday."

Su Lin flicked her forehead with a smile. "You didn't 'almost forget'—you completely forgot. If I hadn't reminded you, you would've let today pass without even noticing."

"Hehe, Su Lin, it's so good to have you!"

"Is it? Then you should thank me properly later."

"Absolutely! However you want me to thank you is fine."

"Then... how about a verbal thank you?"

"Hehe, Su Lin, you're so silly. You've done so much, and all you want is a verbal thank you?"

Su Lin laughed. "Buckle your seatbelt. This experienced driver is about to hit the road."

"Mm!"

"Su Lin, this isn't the way to your house, is it?"

Su Lin steered with one hand while answering, "Of course we're going to my place. Where else would we celebrate your birthday?"

"Didn't you say we're having a big meal?"

"Heh, who said a big meal has to be at a restaurant?"

Xia Shiyu had assumed Su Lin had ordered food, but when they arrived at the villa, she found no one else there and no food prepared.

But having come this far, she kept her confusion to herself.

"Take the cake. Today I'll show you what I can do."

Taking the cake, Xia Shiyu finally understood—Su Lin was going to cook for her himself.

A wave of overwhelming joy washed over her. She covered her mouth in disbelief. "Su Lin, you're going to cook yourself?"

Su Lin nodded. "Of course. Today is your eighteenth birthday. A day like this only comes once in a lifetime. We have to make it meaningful."

"Mm, then I want to drink later."

Su Lin's mind flashed to what had happened at the villa before.

Xia Shiyu had terrible alcohol tolerance. Worse, she became incredibly alluring when drunk, and she stirred things up without taking responsibility.

A classic case of lighting the fire and walking away. That night's experience was something Su Lin never wanted to repeat.

A feast before his eyes that he could only look at but not touch. Unbearable!

"Absolutely not. Xiaoyu, you get drunk easily. Didn't I tell you? No drinking casually from now on."

Xia Shiyu looked at Su Lin. "You said no drinking outside. But you're here with me—what am I afraid of?"

"Having me here makes it worse. No drinking, period."

"Then... okay. I'll listen to you. No drinking then. Can I have some soda?"

"Mm. Put down the cake and come to the kitchen with me. Today we'll work as a team—a guy and a girl working together means the work flies by. Let's get dinner done quick."

"Okay!"

Xia Shiyu had some doubts about Su Lin's cooking skills. In her eyes, he was a typical rich young master—smart, sure, but cooking was questionable.

So when Su Lin asked her to join him in the kitchen, she readily agreed.

---

Su Lin and Xia Shiyu entered the kitchen together. Xia Shiyu washed and prepped the vegetables while Su Lin handled the cooking.

At first their coordination was a bit rough, but after working together for a while, they became quite smooth.

Xia Shiyu seemed to anticipate whatever Su Lin needed and handed it to him right away.

Sizzle!

As all the ingredients hit the wok, Su Lin tossed them a few times, and a fragrant aroma wafted out.

"Mm! Smells so good!"

Xia Shiyu leaned toward the wok and sniffed, her face full of bliss. "Su Lin, your cooking is incredible! Even this simple pepper beef stir-fry smells amazing."

Su Lin laughed heartily. "This is nothing. Making plain congee smell this good—that would be impressive."

"Su Lin, you and I are different."

Su Lin said seriously, "Xiaoyu, you're wrong about that. You and I are the same. We've always been the same."

Before transmigrating, Su Lin had also been poor. He'd just been lucky enough to be born in a slightly better era, so he hadn't suffered as much as Xia Shiyu.

Xia Shiyu stared at Su Lin, then suddenly stepped forward and hugged him.

"What's wrong, Xiaoyu?"

"Su Lin, I want to stay by your side forever. Please don't push me away, okay?" Xia Shiyu said cautiously.

Su Lin paused, set down his spatula, and stroked Xia Shiyu's head gently. "When did I ever say I was pushing you away? Xiaoyu, stop scaring yourself, okay?"

"But... you'll definitely marry Xiaowan in the future. When that happens, I..."

"You really are a little dummy. Wouldn't it be nice if the three of us stayed together forever?" Su Lin rubbed Xia Shiyu's head, his tone sincere.

"Mm... okay!"

"Huh? Su Lin, what did you just say?" Xia Shiyu asked, not quite following.

Su Lin gently lifted Xia Shiyu's chin with his hand, then gazed at her deeply. "I'm a very greedy person. You and Xiaowan—I want you both."

"Mmph...!"

Before Xia Shiyu could react, Su Lin kissed her fully. The two embraced.

Not until the food in the wok began to sizzle did Su Lin release her. "Phew, good thing I reacted fast, or the food would've burned."

Once Su Lin let go, Xia Shiyu finally had a chance to catch her breath. She stood to the side, gasping heavily.

Seeing this, Su Lin shook his head. "Xiaoyu, you can't even breathe while kissing. You need more practice."

Xia Shiyu's emotions were complicated right now—happy, nervous, and sweet all at once.

Hearing Su Lin's sudden remark, she froze, then her face flushed hot. She pressed the back of her hand to her cheek and looked at Su Lin. "Su Lin, when you said you want both of us... does that mean you like me too?"

Su Lin turned around and tapped Xia Shiyu's nose with a nod. "Xiaoyu, you're so pretty, so cute, so understanding. How could I possibly not like you?"

"I... hehe! I'm not as good as you say."

"You're even better than I described."

"But Xiaowan..."

Su Lin gently rapped Xia Shiyu's forehead. "When it's just the two of us, don't mention other women. Did you forget?"

"Oh..."

Looking at Xia Shiyu's dazed expression, Su Lin found her adorable. He pinched her cheek again. "You'd help someone count the money after they sold you off."

"I would not! I'd only help you count money."

"Heh. Clean up—time to eat."

"Okay!"

Su Lin hadn't expected that Xia Shiyu at maximum affection would be this adorable. His heart ached with tenderness.

He knew that when Xia Shiyu was with him and Lin Xiaowan together, she lacked confidence.

Su Lin was young, wealthy, handsome, smart, good-natured—in Xia Shiyu's eyes, the perfect man.

Lin Xiaowan was no less impressive—beautiful, elegant, from a good family, cultured, gentle, generous.

Compared to them, Xia Shiyu felt she fell far short. The gap in their family circumstances made her feel inferior. She didn't dare compete with Lin Xiaowan for anything. She believed Su Lin and Lin Xiaowan were the perfect couple.

When Su Lin said he wanted both of them, her first feeling wasn't anger—it was joy.

Joy that Su Lin liked her too.

As for what happened that drunken night, Xia Shiyu had always thought it was just an accident.

After all, Su Lin hadn't made any intimate moves toward her since then.

If Su Lin knew what Xia Shiyu was thinking, he would definitely tell her loudly—it wasn't like that at all! He just hadn't had the opportunity!

Usually the three of them were practically glued together. Neither Lin Xiaowan's nor Xia Shiyu's affection had reached maximum, so Su Lin didn't dare make any rash moves.

What if he scared off his beauties?

But now things were different. Affection was maxed out.

"Xiaoyu, you don't need to compare yourself to anyone. You yourself are wonderful, and I like you very much. Understand?"

"Su Lin, don't you think I'm a burden?"

Su Lin laughed heartily. "A burden like you? I'd gladly carry it."

"Hehe, Su Lin, you're so good."

Su Lin pursed his lips, somewhat amused.

Could he really be considered a good person?

He definitely wasn't a good person.

From the moment he met Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan, everything had been calculated.

It was just that over time, these two girls were genuinely excellent, genuinely wonderful, and had genuinely moved his heart.

"You won't blame me for being greedy?"

"Hehe, I'll allow you to be greedy."
