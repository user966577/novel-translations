Su Lin didn't know exactly what Lin Xiaowan had said to that family selling their house, but he and Xia Shiyu would never forget the scene when that family saw Lin Xiaowan.

"Su Lin, I'd like to interview you. Today we're signing our first contract. Are you nervous?"

Su Lin steered with one hand while laughing. "Xiaowan, look at my hands. Look at my feet. Look how steady this car is. Do I seem nervous to you?"

Lin Xiaowan immediately deflated. "I forgot you've been doing business for a while now. Deals worth tens of millions—buying a house is nothing to you."

"Heh! Whether or not I'm nervous, I don't know. But Xiaowan, I can tell—you're very nervous."

"Mm! I feel a bit nervous too. Su Lin, this is the first step in our startup." Xia Shiyu spoke with excitement and anticipation.

"Yes, this is our first step. We have to take it well."

The car stopped. Su Lin grabbed the prepared contract and got out. Xia Shiyu and Lin Xiaowan followed close behind.

Today Lin Xiaowan had specifically changed into a more mature outfit. She looked less youthfully fresh and more alluringly sophisticated—like a bewitching rose drawing countless gazes.

Lin Xiaowan wore a confident smile.

Su Lin waved his hand grandly. "Let's go sign the contract."

"Yes!"

The three had barely gotten out of the car when a woman in her forties emerged from the building.

The moment she saw Lin Xiaowan, her eyes lit up like a desert traveler spotting an oasis.

"Oh, Miss Lin! I've been waiting and waiting, and you've finally come!"

"You have no idea how much I've missed you these past two days. Before, I was wrong—I was blinded by greed, insisting on 900,000. I shouldn't have."

Then two young men came out of the house. When they saw Lin Xiaowan, they also became excited.

"Miss Lin, you're finally here! My mom was wrong to ask for 900,000 that day. I've already talked to her about it."

"Yes, yes. Miss Lin, our whole family has discussed it. 800,000—that's the final price. We'll sell. But we can't delay—the money has to be transferred on the spot."

"Miss Lin, please, do us this favor. You have to buy this house!"

Su Lin and Xia Shiyu exchanged glances. He pulled Lin Xiaowan aside and whispered, "Xiaowan, what's going on? Why are these people treating this building like a plague? They're begging you to buy it."

Lin Xiaowan giggled and winked at Su Lin. "Forgot what I said before? Address the symptoms."

"These two brothers—one of them is getting married. He doesn't have a wedding home. Hehe."

Su Lin understood immediately. With Lin Xiaowan's intelligence, she'd definitely exploit that angle.

These three were clearly a "loving family" of the dysfunctional sort.

Lin Xiaowan smiled at them. "Auntie Fang, I told you before—this time I'm not offering the same price. 780,000, take it or leave it. If you agree, we sign the contract today and I'll transfer the money to your bank account. If not..."

"Miss Lin, say no more! We'll sell!"

"Right, my brother's right. We'll sell, Miss Lin. Please, bring out the contract. Let my mom sign it."

"Miss Lin, please get the contract out quickly. Let's sign it soon."

She resented Lin Xiaowan.

Ever since Lin Xiaowan had visited their home twice, it had been nothing but chaos.

The eldest son wanted to get married. The second son wanted to start a business. The old couple didn't want to sell the house.

Both sons had thrown fits. It was utter pandemonium.

They were all impossible to deal with.

Lin Xiaowan hadn't actually done anything. She'd just learned about the family's situation and shown up at their door, which led to all this.

In short, the building had suddenly become a hot potato the old couple couldn't hold onto any longer.

But there was no one else willing to take it off their hands in the short term.

So what Su Lin had planned as an above-market purchase had, thanks to Lin Xiaowan's maneuvering, become a below-market steal.

"Su Lin, where's the contract? Let's get it out."

Su Lin nodded, somewhat amazed.

He'd thought he was already making good use of Lin Xiaowan's talents. Now he realized he'd underestimated her abilities.

These women who could make protagonists into hands-off bosses couldn't be judged by ordinary standards.

'No wonder those protagonists can just sit back and relax. These female leads are just too capable.'

A glimpse of the leopard reveals the whole. Being able to make this family desperate to sell in such a short time—without using any underhanded methods—showed just how formidable Lin Xiaowan was.

And this was just the beginning of her business experience.

Give her a few more years in the commercial world, and she'd be going head-to-head with the old guard.

"Su Lin, what are you muttering about?"

"Oh! I was just saying this place is a bit remote. I don't know if we'll take a loss buying it."

"Don't worry, don't worry. This location is on Xingfu Avenue and Zhongjiang Avenue. You won't find many spots better than this in all of Jiangning District. Whether you want a car wash or a business, you'll make money."

Su Lin glanced at the man—looked about thirty, calling a seventeen-year-old high schooler "big brother." A bit strange.

Lin Xiaowan nudged Su Lin gently. "Su Lin, quit while you're ahead. Don't push too hard, or they might change their minds."

...

Su Lin nodded and brought out the contract for them to review.

The two brothers took the contract and only looked at the price. Once they confirmed it was correct, they immediately handed it to their mother. One bent his back as a writing surface while the other offered a pen. Their coordination was so perfect they could only be brothers.

"Sigh... What sins I must have committed."

The old woman sighed helplessly and signed the contract.

"Please look over the contract more carefully. We don't want any disputes later."

Lin Xiaowan nodded. "Su Lin is right. Please review the contract carefully."

The two brothers exchanged glances, then picked up the contract and examined it closely. Sometimes they pondered, sometimes they frowned, looking as if they understood everything—or perhaps understood nothing at all.

Su Lin thought to himself that with these two brothers around, even if this family were billionaires, they'd end up broke.

"We've reviewed the contract carefully. No problems at all. Miss Lin, when can you transfer the money?"

Lin Xiaowan rolled her eyes. "Relax. Once the contract is signed, the money will hit your account today."

"Really? The bank is quite far from here. You probably don't know the way. Let me take you."

Su Lin was both amused and exasperated. "We drove here."

"No problem. I have a car too. I'll lead the way." The man produced a motorcycle key.

"Then... alright, thank you for the trouble."

"No trouble at all. We'll both come with you."

Su Lin: "......"
