The Supreme Nine Heavens.

A great sun hung in the void, surrounded by countless stars.

The gazes of billions of powerful beings from across all realms pierced through endless space, fixed upon the highest point of the Nine Heavens.

There, eight streams of chaotic, terrifying aura surrounded a single figure. The man at their center had sword-like brows and starlit eyes, his bearing handsome beyond measure. His presence was unmatched throughout all of history—the supreme sovereign of heaven and earth.

"The Nine Lives Celestial Venerable is about to prove his Dao and become a Saint today, ascending above the Nine Heavens. Truly a blessing for the human race!"

"Eight Empresses protecting the Nine Lives Celestial Venerable alone—such romantic fortune is enviable indeed!"

"Hahaha, as it should be! All eight Empresses achieved their thrones with the Celestial Venerable's wholehearted support. Now is the time to repay that kindness—the crow feeding its parents in return."

"Indeed! Indeed!"

All beings awaited the Nine Lives Celestial Venerable's successful tribulation.

No one doubted that the Nine Lives Celestial Venerable would fail. His life had been too legendary.

He had battled the Yao race, slaying countless great demons.

He had fought the Demon race, annihilating their entire domain.

He had broken through forbidden zones, strangling darkness and chaos in their cradle.

He had defied heaven and earth alike, and endless prodigies had become corpses along his path to invincibility.

He was undefeated among peers, and killing those above his realm was commonplace.

Moreover, he had cultivated the "Nine Lives Immortal Scripture" to a level surpassing even its creator, granting him nine lives.

Invincible—this label had been branded onto Lu Ye from the very beginning, seared into the hearts of all.

This Saint Tribulation, even if each wave cost him one life, Lu Ye could still succeed.

"It begins!"

Lu Ye raised his head to the sky. Above the Nine Heavens, countless stars swirled like sand in a phantom sea, forming a massive vortex that resembled a colossal eye.

Tribulation energy rolled forth like crashing waves.

The Heavenly Dao would not permit Lu Ye to become a Saint. It would not allow anyone to stand above it.

Though Lu Ye had rendered great service to this realm's Heavenly Dao, it would still strike with full force.

"You cannot stop me."

Lu Ye smiled as he spoke upward.

There was no one above him. Who was he addressing?

Heaven and Earth itself.

"BOOM..."

Thunder answered—the world's response to Lu Ye.

"Hahaha, since you wish to test me, then come! Besides, you know as well as I do that even if I transcend above you, we shall remain the closest of friends."

"In this world, there is only you and I!"

The tribulation clouds gathered, drawing together all the tribulation energy of the entire Nine Heavens to form this singular catastrophe.

"It's starting! It's starting!"

"I wonder what form the tribulation will take. Please don't let it be the Primordial Tribulation!"

Countless powerful beings grew excited. A Saint Tribulation! Such an event might not occur for ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, even a million years.

This was witnessing history.

No thunder fell. Instead, a figure began to coalesce within the tribulation clouds.

This figure rode a divine dragon and held a heavenly mirror.

"It's the Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable!"

Someone cried out in recognition. That was the supreme being of the previous era—the Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable. The Ancient-Modern Mirror in his hand could reflect past and future, severing the threads of time and karma.

"Heavens, it really is the top-ranked Primordial Tribulation! Has the Nine Lives Celestial Venerable truly grown this powerful?"

"To battle the tribulation imprints of every powerful being who has ever attempted this ascension throughout all of history—what magnificent audacity!"

"The Nine Lives Celestial Venerable is invincible!"

Lu Ye paused when he saw the Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable materialize.

"Long time no see."

The Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable nodded slightly. "It has been a while, Daoist friend."

The two had never met in person, yet they had encountered each other within the River of Time.

"Shall we fight?"

"Gladly."

Without further words, the two Celestial Venerables launched their attacks. A casual strike from beings at their level was the pinnacle of all techniques—the void collapsed, reverting to primordial chaos.

The eight stunning figures surrounding them retreated. They exchanged glances, and within each other's eyes, they could see a peculiar meaning.

In the blink of an eye, the battle reached white-hot intensity.

The Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable deployed his temporal technique. Figures split off from him, traveling to different points in time to seek out different versions of Lu Ye.

If any temporal version of Lu Ye died, it would inflict damage upon his present self.

But no one was worried.

From weakness to strength, Lu Ye had always been the most terrifying prodigy of his era. Even in his past, he had never possessed a weak point.

Suddenly, wounds of the Great Dao appeared on Lu Ye's body.

His form shuddered violently. One wound, two wounds, three wounds... a full eight wounds manifested.

"How is this possible?"

Someone cried out in shock. What did this mean?

It meant Lu Ye had been slain eight times across his past—but how? At every stage of his life, Lu Ye had been invincible among his peers!

"Daoist friend, your devotion to those you love is truly admirable," the Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable said with a smile.

Lu Ye returned a thin smile. "Daoist friend, your technique is exquisite. Most admirable."

The Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable...

Suddenly, Lu Ye's brow furrowed.

How fast was combat at the Celestial Venerable level?

In barely an instant, the Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable seized this opening. A great seal slammed into Lu Ye, causing his body to sway slightly.

He wasn't injured—yet his frown deepened.

Poisoned?

He found it inconceivable. He was a Celestial Venerable!

Even the Great Dao itself could not erode him. What poison could possibly affect him? And when had it been administered? He had sensed nothing.

"It's a Gu. The Yin-Yang Dao-Devouring Gu!"

The Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable recognized the Yin-Yang Dao-Devouring Gu's origins in an instant.

The Yin-Yang Dao-Devouring Gu...

Lu Ye's eyes filled with disbelief as he looked toward the eight figures at the periphery.

The Yin-Yang Dao-Devouring Gu could devour the Great Dao of all things.

This Gu was formless and substanceless, exceedingly rare in the world. It could only be implanted during the union of yin and yang.

The Gu split into yin and yang components. The yang Gu devoured Dao to nourish the yin Gu.

Clearly, Lu Ye had been implanted with the yang Gu.

And the only ones who could have had the opportunity to plant such a Gu in him were these eight—his beloved companions.

Lu Ye was furious.

In his rage, his attacks exploded with power. His offensive force instantly peaked, suppressing the Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable.

But the Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable showed no anger. He seemed to be watching the greatest entertainment, an expression of pure amusement on his face.

"Daoist friend, you are so devoted and righteous, yet you've been schemed against like this. How does it feel?" the Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable asked with a laugh.

"What devotion? What righteousness? He bullied the weak with his strength, dominated and possessed us by force—you call that devotion and righteousness?" A voice that should have been ethereal but now brimmed with fury rang out.

The speaker was the Phantom Spirit Empress, Shangguan Huanling.

"Exactly! Standing only from his own perspective, utterly disregarding the feelings of others—that is certainly not devotion or righteousness!"

"This so-called devotion and righteousness is nothing but a joke! He betrayed his master and slaughtered innocents. What we do is righteous—slaying a demon!"

"Young Master, don't blame me. I've already become an Empress. I truly don't want to be a servant girl anymore. I've had enough of being a maidservant my whole life. So won't you please just die?"

"Senior Brother, if not for you—do you even remember Feng Wuxie? If not for you, the one by my side should have been Feng Wuxie!"

One Empress after another spoke, each accusing Lu Ye of his crimes.

Their exquisite faces twisted with hatred, humiliation, and resentment.

Lu Ye's expression turned cold.

His heart ached with excruciating intensity, as if countless Heaven-Falling Nails had been driven through it. No—even when he'd actually been pierced by Heaven-Falling Nails, it hadn't hurt this much!

"So die!"

"Just die!"

"Once you're dead, we'll be free!"

"I never wanted you controlling me! Once you're dead, no one will control me anymore. I can do whatever I want! I'm already an Empress and you still try to control me—I've had enough!"

"Die die die!"

All eight yang Gu went berserk simultaneously.

A second Primordial Tribulation formed, manifesting another peerless ancient being.

Besieged from within and without, his Dao heart wounded.

This drove Lu Ye to madness.

And in his madness, he erupted with even more terrifying combat power.

He wanted to kill!

He wanted to beat these eight two-faced, ungrateful creatures to death—every last one of them.

He would rather take attacks and suffer wounds than stop his assault.

But when those eight women each drew forth the Celestial Venerable artifacts he himself had forged for them, Lu Ye nearly exploded with rage.

"Daoist friend, now is not the time to be distracted."

Yet another magnificent Celestial Venerable appeared, unleashing a killing technique that dealt devastating damage to Lu Ye.

His body was breaking apart. His Dao was being erased.

Lu Ye's Dao heart was solid as divine iron. He continued fighting. But the Primordial Tribulation was simply too savage.

He was battling the imprints of every powerful being throughout all of history who had ever attempted to prove their Dao and become a Saint. Each one was a Celestial Venerable at the absolute peak, the crowning genius of their era.

And all the while, the Yin-Yang Dao-Devouring Gu continued to gnaw at him ceaselessly.

The surrounding Great Emperors were dumbfounded.

What? How could the eight of you treat the Celestial Venerable this way?

They condemned the Empresses.

But those eight showed no shame whatsoever.

They recounted Lu Ye's sins one by one, each accusation delivered with absolute conviction.

"Have you forgotten how the Celestial Venerable helped all of you?"

"Without his help, we could have become Empresses anyway! He only helped us to satisfy his own selfish desires!"

Lu Ye's Dao heart, no matter how solid—even if it were forged from Eternal Divine Gold—felt a sliver of pain pierce through.

So that was it. His kindness to them had been nothing but a cage in their eyes.

He couldn't hold on anymore.

One terrifying Celestial Venerable after another descended upon him. His blood and bone scattered; his Dao crumbled toward oblivion.

Since he could not survive, he raised his head toward the sky.

"Old friend, let me help you one last time!"

His form transformed into a brilliant source of light, burning to its utmost extreme. All the Daos between heaven and earth resonated in response.

"Let us die together!"

Boundless light pierced through the dark universe, shooting straight toward its edge—toward a mass of darkness that clung to the barrier of the Nine Heavens like a tumor.

"Bastard! Nine Lives! Others betrayed you, so you're going to drag me—the Source of Darkness—down with you?! Are you insane?!"

BOOM!

The self-destruction of a Celestial Venerable caused all Daos to collapse. The entire Nine Heavens shook violently.

The Ancient-Modern Celestial Venerable's shattered form reappeared.

But those familiar with him could see at a glance—this was not him.

Someone else wore his appearance.

His gaze was cold. An indescribable coldness, as if nothing in all existence could stir even a ripple of emotion within him.

Yet watching the Nine Lives Celestial Venerable self-destruct, dragging the Source of Darkness—his greatest headache—along for the ride, even his eyes couldn't help but soften slightly.

"Old friend..."

His parched voice uttered these three words, tinged with faint sorrow.

"I will make them accompany you."

He waved his hand. The shattered Daos twisted, the River of Time surfaced, and together they formed a vortex.

The eight Empresses had no power to resist. Together, they were dragged into the swirling abyss.

The show begins.
