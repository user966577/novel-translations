  "synopsis": "Lu Ye, the Nine Lives Celestial Venerable, stood at the pinnacle of existence. Invincible throughout his life, he had battled demons, destroyed the Demon Domain, and cleared forbidden zones. Eight women he loved—now Empresses in their own right—surrounded him as he attempted the final tribulation to become a Saint.\n\nBut at his most vulnerable moment, all eight betrayed him. They had planted Yin-Yang Dao-Devouring Gu within him during their most intimate moments, and now they revealed their true feelings: hatred, resentment, and the desperate desire for freedom from his 'control.'\n\nFacing certain death, Lu Ye chose to self-destruct, taking the Source of Darkness—the greatest threat to the realm—with him. His old friend, the Heavenly Dao itself, watched in sorrow.\n\n'I will make them accompany you.'\n\nThe eight Empresses were cast into the River of Time. Now, as history rewinds, will they come to understand what they truly lost? Or will they repeat their sins?\n\nThe show begins.",
