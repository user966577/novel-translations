Jiang Yingzhu's tone went flat. She crossed her arms, one foot slightly raised, the toe grinding against the floor.

Seeing this, Li Yan's eyelid twitched. He knew this posture all too well.

His childhood sweetheart did this whenever she was upset.

The problem was, he genuinely had no idea what he'd forgotten!

Li Yan met those slightly frosty eyes and forced himself to ask:

"What is it? I really did forget."

"Oh! Then let's just go back to the classroom."

Jiang Yingzhu wasn't buying it. From her perspective, they'd made plans that morning—how could he possibly forget? He just didn't want to go.

Without another word, she turned and headed for the school building.

"Hey—"

Li Yan tried to stop her, but she was already gone. He shook his head and walked toward the milk tea shop next to the cafeteria.

Fine. Time for damage control.

The mistake was already made, the anger already brewing—asking what he forgot wouldn't help at this point.

His childhood sweetheart didn't have much of a temper. When she got upset, she'd just sit quietly and stew.

It was easy to tell.

Because normally, she couldn't sit still—she'd always be wandering around, finding something to do.

"Here you go, your red bean milk tea."

"Can you bag it for me?"

Li Yan said it, then froze as he was about to pay.

Crap. He had no money!

Facing the worker's polite smile, he went stiff all over.

"Ahem, miss, I'm a student, could I—"

"Could I borrow your phone for a second? I need to make a call, it's kind of urgent."

Li Yan flashed the woman a shy smile, sheepishly explaining that he had no money on him.

"Oh, sure, go ahead."

The thirty-something milk tea shop owner was rather pleased to be called "miss" by this good-looking kid, and agreed right away.

So Li Yan swallowed his pride—toes curling hard enough to carve out an apartment—and called Jiang Yingzhu.

He remembered she'd brought her phone, and hers was the only number he knew by heart.

Hadn't changed in over a decade.

"Hello? Who's this?"

"Ahem, Zhuzhu, it's me, Li Yan. Don't hang up—it's really important—"

Jiang Yingzhu was leisurely climbing the stairs when she heard Li Yan's full account of the milk tea debacle.

She was equal parts annoyed and amused.

"You idiot! Wait right there."

Jiang Yingzhu's words were fierce, but her feet honestly reversed direction and carried her back downstairs.

She glanced at her phone screen and tapped "save" on the recording she'd just captured.

"You idiot!"

The phone's speaker was a bit too loud, and Li Yan clearly caught the faint smirk on the shop worker's face.

For most middle schoolers, even a silent expression like that would have been mortifying.

Luckily, Li Yan wasn't your average middle schooler.

"Thanks, miss."

"You're a polite one, kiddo. You know, it'd be fine to just skip the milk tea—I can sell it to the next customer."

Li Yan shook his head and smiled without a word.

Just because his childhood sweetheart was paying for the milk tea didn't mean he couldn't use it to smooth things over.

He felt like the effect was already pretty good!

The glass door swung open with a jingle. Jiang Yingzhu strode in, chin tilted up, face taut, one hand in her pocket, canvas shoes scuffing the floor as she walked in looking effortlessly cool.

"Sis, I'm here to pick someone up! How much for the milk tea?"

She marched straight to the counter like she owned the place.

"Four yuan."

"Oh, okay."

Jiang Yingzhu paid, picked up the milk tea, and gave Li Yan a sidelong look.

"Keep up."

Li Yan smiled and followed. The two of them walked down the empty first-floor corridor. Noonday sun sliced through the rust-flecked fire-escape window, branding the hallway tiles with alternating bars of light and shadow.

Watching their shadows on the floor—drifting apart, coming together—he said:

"Ahem. Thanks. Still mad?"

"In your dreams! I bought this milk tea for myself—you owe me one!"

Jiang Yingzhu snorted, bumped him with her shoulder, and flashed a playful grin.

"If you don't pay me back—"

She pulled out her phone and hit play.

Li Yan's voice immediately rang out, narrating his entire embarrassing ordeal.

"Ugh, turn it off. Come on—you and me, what are we? Like I'd forget?"

He reached for the phone.

It was a small thing, sure, but being brought up again and again? He knew exactly how embarrassing that would be down the road.

Worse, she might play it for other people. Public execution.

"Hey!"

Jiang Yingzhu snatched the phone away with lightning reflexes and put distance between them.

"I have no idea whether you'd forget or not. Somebody has no memory."

With the leverage firmly in her hands, Li Yan had no choice but to endure the unwarranted jab.

"Fine. I owe you one milk tea."

"That's more like it."

...

Back in the classroom, Li Yan didn't actually rest. Instead, he tested the system's capabilities.

Specifically, he needed to figure out whether his other textbooks—besides Chinese—could be classified as cultivable methods or something else.

[Ding! Detected: Skill, Fundamentals of Celestial Arithmancy...]

[Ding! Detected: Skill, Artificer's Apprentice: Basic Foundations, Volume Two...]

He set down the ninth-grade math and chemistry books and picked up civics and history.

One second. Two seconds. A full minute passed.

The silence was deafening in Li Yan's mind.

Neither civics nor history triggered the system.

In his past life, he'd been a liberal arts student.

Great—so the Tianxuan Continent was apparently a world of scientific cultivation?

Fortunately, middle school civics and history were simple enough. As long as you knew where the key content was in the textbook, you could score well.

Because the exams were open-book.

Things like multiple-choice questions that asked the year the Party was founded, or the current state of Chinese society—nothing too tricky.

Even without open books, nobody would probably get those wrong, right?

Chinese was even simpler!

He had a solid foundation there. With the system handling math, physics, and chemistry, he had nothing to worry about.

He dug out his seventh- and eighth-grade math textbooks to complete the "Celestial Arithmancy" fundamentals.

Afternoon class started at two—he had two hours for lunch break.

Having confirmed that physics, chemistry, biology, and math could all be AFK-cultivated, Li Yan immediately began AFK-cultivating math.

To be safe, he started with a half-hour session.

Rather than letting his mind wander during AFK mode, he paid attention to his own state under the system's control.

His two morning physics sessions had been short—not enough time to get through a full textbook.

But Li Yan had noticed that the system automatically resumed from wherever it had left off last time.

So he was very curious: what would happen if he finished an entire book in one sitting? Would the payoff be even bigger?

Fifty minutes later, the system finally finished going through ninth-grade math.

At this pace, Li Yan estimated based on his hunger levels that finishing all the earlier math books would probably take half the afternoon.

"Hm?"

Just when Li Yan expected the system to move on to the eighth-grade math textbook—

His body suddenly stopped, as if searching for something.

[Ding! Detected: Celestial Arithmancy: Basic Foundations III requires supplementary practice materials. Scanning host's materials...]

Li Yan blinked. What?

[Host has no practice materials. The system will provide a complimentary set. Scanning for suitable target...]

A bad feeling crept over him.

[Scan complete.]

The next moment, he felt himself abruptly stand up, step out of his seat, and walk to Jiang Yingzhu's desk.
