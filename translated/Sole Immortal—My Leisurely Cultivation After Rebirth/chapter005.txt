He closed his eyes and replayed the chapter's key concepts in his mind.

From the basics of molecular kinetic theory—how matter is composed of vast numbers of molecules and atoms, how molecules are in perpetual, random motion—

To the definitions of internal energy and specific heat capacity, like water's specific heat capacity of 4.2 x 10 J/(kg-C).

He remembered and understood all of it!

"Let me try a few problems."

Li Yan dug out his workbook and found the relevant exercises.

He pulled out a pen and started writing, then checked his answers.

It seemed like he was a notch above his original level.

He could tell that his old self had found physics formulas—those abstract letters—extremely painful.

Just memorizing them was hard enough, let alone understanding them.

But now he'd not only memorized them, he actually understood them to some degree!

That was the key—to some degree.

The more complex calculations and thought processes were still fuzzy.

Maybe the system needed to cultivate further?

With that in mind, he immediately started another AFK session.

After checking the time, Li Yan set the duration to last until the end of class.

Once again, he drifted through the ocean of knowledge, riding the waves freely.

This feeling of getting comfortable without lifting a finger—pure bliss.

"Ring ring ring ring ring!"

The rapid bell sounded. Class over.

"That's all for today. Anyone interested in the exam cram course, come find me in the office."

Class 3 was right next to the office, so Wang Fugui didn't linger in the classroom and left directly.

Li Yan had also just exited AFK mode right on time.

He yawned, feeling his stomach growl. He patted his pockets—not a cent on him.

Li Yan remembered now. In middle school, he'd rarely had spending money.

Jiang Yingzhu turned around from the seat ahead, looking curious.

"Li Yan, how is it that you look drained after just one period? Hmm~ Were you up late doing naughty things?"

"Heh."

"Heh yourself. Are you signing up for Wang the Dog's tutoring class?"

"I'd suggest rephrasing that."

Wang Fugui had put on weight in middle age, his face sagging and bloated, nose dark, bags under his eyes heavy—he looked a bit like an old, fat dog.

Hence the nickname.

Li Yan couldn't be bothered with her. He put away his physics book and, checking the class schedule in the corner of the blackboard, pulled out his English textbook.

Last period of the morning. After this, they could go eat.

The moment his palm touched the English textbook, the system prompt chimed in, right on cue.

[Ding! Detected: Professional text, Introduction to Foreign Tongue. Immortal profession unlocked: Linguist Official.]

[The Linguist Official is responsible for communicating with external humanoid civilizations on the Tianxuan Continent. Protected by the merit of the Human Dao.]

[Would you like to AFK-cultivate the Linguist Official professional skill text?]

The nonstop system notifications left Li Yan blinking in astonishment.

It even unlocked a profession?

Linguist Official? Some kind of diplomat or interpreter?!

Not that it mattered much. The important thing was that English could also be cultivated.

Though the system classifying English as a foreign tongue with a "humanoid civilization" designation...

That was honestly hard for Li Yan to keep a straight face about.

In front of him, annoyed that her underling was ignoring her, Jiang Yingzhu stealthily reached for the shoelaces on his feet, which were propped up on the crossbar under his desk.

But her peripheral vision caught Li Yan staring blankly in her direction.

It made Jiang Yingzhu a bit self-conscious.

She waited a moment. He was still staring.

Jiang Yingzhu snorted. *You think I won't do it just because you're watching?*

Without another word, she reached out and untied both shoes.

"Mmhm~, done."

She dusted off her hands, tilted her head, and locked eyes with Li Yan for a beat before breaking into a mischievous grin. She planted one foot on the ground for leverage and shot out the door like an arrow from a bow.

"Hehe, can't catch me!"

"Childish."

Li Yan said it, then spotted his childhood sweetheart peeking her head back through the doorway to glare at him.

Shaking his head, Li Yan looked at the English book in his hand, puzzled.

Earlier, the first thing he'd held was the Chinese textbook from before physics class.

But the system hadn't triggered a prompt then.

Did that mean the Chinese textbook didn't count as a cultivation method, a skill, or a professional ability?

Unable to figure out the logic, he stopped overthinking it and started AFK-cultivating English.

Right now, all Li Yan wanted was to study. He'd fallen in love with that exhilarating sensation.

AFK for ten minutes, until class started.

The English teacher was a woman in her late forties or fifties, her face written with the passage of time.

Nothing like the universal description of English teachers in novels—

Young, pretty, and rich.

Beyond "class" and "sit down" (which came out more like "settah-paw"), Li Yan couldn't understand a word.

So he simply handed everything over to the system's AFK learning.

Oh wait—cultivation!

As he cultivated, he was astonished to discover that he could understand parts of what the English teacher was saying.

Only a small portion, granted.

Grammar and tenses still made his head spin.

But it was undeniably a small step toward success.

In the English teacher's eyes, however, Li Yan was blatantly slacking off, flipping through his book at random.

So, unsurprisingly, he got called on.

"Li Yan, stand up."

A certain someone sat at his desk with a serious expression, flipping through the English textbook.

Under the gaze of the entire class, he sat like a proud young lord, paying the old woman absolutely no mind.

"Li Yan, stand up and answer the question I just asked!" The English teacher's eyes narrowed as she repeated herself.

A certain someone remained calm as a breeze, completely deaf to the world.

His classmates were in awe. The troublemakers in the back row practically worshipped him.

"How is Li Yan this ballsy? Does he want to get punished with ten essay recitations?"

"Li—! Yan—!!"

The English teacher called again. "Stand up. Did you hear me?"

Seeing the old teacher getting angry, Jiang Yingzhu was frantic. She bumped her desk against his, signaling him to quit the act.

At least stand up and say your foot hurts!

The desk rattled against Li Yan's body. He'd been desperately trying to get the system to cancel AFK mode with no success, when suddenly a notification pinged.

[Ding! External attack detected. Energy lev—]

Li Yan didn't have time to hear the rest. He reflexively shot to his feet.

The next instant, everything went black, and he collapsed onto his desk with a smack.

Clang—!

Li Yan slid straight off the desk onto the floor. The sudden commotion startled everyone.

The classroom, which had been buzzing with low-level restlessness, went dead silent as if someone had thrown a soundproof blanket over it.

Then Jiang Yingzhu's panicked voice shattered the silence.

"Li Yan! Li Yan!! What's wrong?!"

She launched out of her seat, caught the collapsed Li Yan, and started calling his name.

The English teacher snapped back to reality. Seeing a student passed out on the floor, her face went white—terrified of a classroom incident.

She rushed over in three quick strides. "Quick! Quick! Jiang Yingzhu, don't move him—go get someone from the nurse's office."

"Oh, okay!"

Whether Jiang Yingzhu didn't hear clearly or simply didn't care, she scooped Li Yan up—hands under his back and behind his knees—and sprinted for the nurse's office.

"Hey! Hey!!"

The English teacher could only scramble to keep up.

...

Li Yan woke to a jostling sensation. The first thing he saw was Jiang Yingzhu's sharp, elegant profile, and the faint smell of disinfectant tickled his nose.

"What happened?"

He sat up and looked around. He recognized the nurse's office.
