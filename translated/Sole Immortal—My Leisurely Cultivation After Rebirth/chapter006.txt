Especially a figure in a white coat with his back turned, apparently reaching for something.

"Li Yan! You're awake!" Jiang Yingzhu, who'd been watching him the whole time, cried out in relief. "Are you okay?"

"Yeah, Li Yan, are you alright?" The English teacher's voice was equally anxious.

"Dr. Bai, Dr. Bai, the student's awake. Please come take a look."

The school doctor, who'd finished preparing his examination equipment, turned around, gave Li Yan a once-over, and said:

"They tell me you fainted. Do you feel any discomfort anywhere?"

"Yes!"

Li Yan clutched his abdomen, brow furrowed.

Jiang Yingzhu and the English teacher's hearts both skipped a beat.

Especially the English teacher, terrified that it was her calling on Li Yan that had caused this.

Dr. Bai also frowned. Abdominal discomfort could mean any number of things.

He could handle minor injuries here, but not something like this.

Jiang Yingzhu's face had gone pale, her mind flashing to all those terrifying answers she'd found online when searching for stomachaches.

Then Li Yan continued:

"I'm hungry."

He paused, then added: "Extremely hungry."

All three people in the room let out a collective sigh of relief.

"If you can eat, it's nothing serious. Did you skip breakfast?"

"Yes, yes! He skips breakfast all the time," Jiang Yingzhu answered immediately.

"That's the issue then. Might be some low blood sugar too. Go eat something in the cafeteria and you'll be fine."

"Really? Are you sure Li Yan's okay?" Jiang Yingzhu eyed his pale face.

"He's fine." Dr. Bai smiled. "What, do you want him to not be fine? If you're worried, you can always go to the hospital for a checkup."

"No no no." Jiang Yingzhu waved her hands frantically, then glanced at Li Yan again.

"I'm fine. Really just hungry. Sorry for worrying you."

"Hmph. Let's see you skip breakfast again."

Li Yan caught the genuine concern in her eyes and felt a warmth in his chest.

In his previous life, his parents had been too busy and had neglected his upbringing.

He wasn't good at caring about people, nor did he know how to respond when others showed concern.

To put it dramatically—

A coward would flinch even from touching cotton.

It wasn't until he'd dated someone later in life that he gradually learned.

Hearing Li Yan's reassurance, the English teacher exhaled. It was just hunger—no big deal.

As for whatever was going on between these two teenagers, that wasn't worth paying attention to right now.

She made a quick arrangement.

"Jiang Yingzhu, go back to the classroom and have the class monitor lead the rest of the period. I'll take Li Yan to the cafeteria."

"Ms. Xia, how about I take him instead?"

Jiang Yingzhu looked at Ms. Xia with pleading eyes.

Ms. Xia hesitated, then nodded and handed over her meal card.

"Fine. Use the faculty window—the food's better there. Just return the card during afternoon class."

"Great! Thanks, Ms. Xia! You're the best!"

Jiang Yingzhu's normally sharp features softened like ice thawing in spring, blooming into a sweet smile she rarely showed.

Li Yan, who'd been quietly watching the whole scene, felt his gaze linger.

School No. 15's cafeteria sat in the northeast corner, not far from the administrative building where the nurse's office was.

Out the door, straight down the first-floor corridor—there it was.

Walking into the cafeteria, Li Yan looked around. The place felt unfamiliar.

It had been too long, and he hadn't come here often.

"Go find a seat. I'll get the food."

Jiang Yingzhu fanned herself with the faculty meal card, eyeing a window set apart from the rest, her eyes lighting up.

"Never eaten from the faculty window before. Today I'm riding your coattails."

"You're welcome. How will you repay me?"

"Give you an inch and you take a mile!" Jiang Yingzhu shot him a look and headed for the faculty window.

A handful of students were scattered around the cafeteria—probably from whichever class had PE this period.

Under their stares, Jiang Yingzhu felt that her composed stride toward the faculty window was nothing short of radiant.

She could already imagine what those students were thinking.

Confusion. Shock. Disbelief.

*Hmph. Just wait until I swipe the card. You'll all be stunned.*

Jiang Yingzhu marched up to the window and immediately spotted the stir-fry options.

She called out to the woman working behind the counter. "Ma'am, one kung pao chicken, one stir-fried pork, and one tomato egg soup. That's it."

"This is the faculty window, dear."

"I know. I have a card!"

Jiang Yingzhu slapped the faculty meal card on the counter.

"Hurry it up, please."

The cafeteria worker glanced at the card, shrugged, and came over to process it.

Beep beep!!

The crisp sound rang out like a triumphant march. Jiang Yingzhu felt incredibly proud of herself in that moment.

*Foolish classmates, you must be dying to know how I can buy food at the special window.*

...

While waiting, Li Yan figured out why he'd fainted.

He stared at the system notification, eyes thoughtful—

[External attack detected! Insufficient energy. AFK cultivation canceled.]

Recalling the moment he'd exited AFK mode, it all clicked.

So physical contact forced him out of AFK mode.

But how was "energy" calculated?

"System, what is energy?"

"Energy is determined by a combination of the host's mental fatigue and satiety levels. When either is fully depleted, energy becomes insufficient."

"You need to eat to cultivate immortality?" Li Yan scoffed.

The system went silent.

Right on cue, Jiang Yingzhu arrived carrying a tray.

"Here we go, food's up!"

She set down the dishes, took a seat, and noticed Li Yan staring blankly at her.

"What are you looking at me for? Eat!"

"Mm. Okay."

Li Yan nodded. He'd just been thinking about his previous life—how it had been the same back then. Jiang Yingzhu would get the food while he found a table.

Even the dishes were nearly identical. His favorite kung pao chicken, and Jiang Yingzhu's favorite stir-fried pork.

Plus whatever else sounded good.

Kung pao chicken and stir-fried pork had been their respective favorites since childhood, never changing.

Funny how you never got tired of a dish, but people you'd been around long enough could wear on you.

Li Yan shook the thought away, but his body wouldn't let him dawdle.

He immediately tore into the food like a hurricane.

"Hey, hey—you... forget it, just eat."

Jiang Yingzhu watched in horror as a third of her beloved stir-fried pork vanished in the time it took her to look away.

And it wasn't just the meat—the chili peppers were gone too.

She panicked for a second, then gave up entirely.

In under five minutes, two dishes and a soup were demolished. Li Yan leaned back in his chair contentedly.

Once again, he savored the beauty of being young.

Ten years from now, there was no way he could eat this much, let alone food this heavy.

Just ordering a milk tea would require half an hour of deliberation.

"Full? Want me to get more?" Jiang Yingzhu asked.

"I'm good."

"Alright. I'm getting another plate of stir-fried pork—I barely ate anything."

"Nice."

After they finished eating, the bell rang right on time.

They shared a look and laughed in unison.

"Let's go."

"Yeah, back to the classroom."

"The classroom! Is your foot still not better?" Jiang Yingzhu's sharp brows drew together.

"It's fine. Doesn't affect walking. I'm going back to rest."

"Aren't you forgetting something?"
