"What are you doing?"

"You're too slow. The PE teacher's already rushing us. I'll carry you over."

Jiang Yingzhu held Li Yan securely in her arms and strode toward Class 3's assembly point on those long legs of hers.

Which class he'd been in during middle school—that much Li Yan still remembered.

Looking at the girl's cheeks, dusted a light honey-gold by the sun, his gaze turned distant again.

He was certain of one thing.

In his previous life, no matter which school or which PE class—

He had never been treated like this.

After all, clueless teenage boys back then were always immature and prideful.

Now, getting a do-over, it was a new experience.

He had to admit, it didn't feel bad.

Her collarbones were a bit bony, though.

Strange—he could've sworn she'd had a bit more padding in his past life.

Jiang Yingzhu carried Li Yan to the assembly area, and their classmates instantly erupted with monkey-like howls.

"Ohhhhh!!"

"Wooooow!!"

Their own classmates were nothing like the students from other classes they'd passed on the way.

Those kids had just whispered among themselves. These ones screamed it out loud.

"The sports rep is a beast!"

"It's the big day!"

"Just get married on the spot!!"

Even the PE teacher stood there grinning, clearly enjoying the show.

Jiang Yingzhu was normally confident and easygoing, but right now her cheeks were burning.

She set Li Yan down and shot a glare at the loudest hecklers.

"Knock it off! I'll keep you all after class for extra training!"

"No, please, Zhuzhu!"

The girls who'd been yelling the loudest immediately begged for mercy.

The PE physical fitness exam was coming up, and the normally frail, perpetually-absent PE teacher had chosen this particular time to be in peak health.

The excuse was legitimate—no teacher would object to extra PE training.

And those girls happened to be exactly the ones who met the criteria for mandatory extra practice.

"Hmph. Line up, now. Roll call. Anyone who doesn't cooperate gets five extra laps at morning jog tomorrow."

Jiang Yingzhu crossed her arms, phoenix eyes narrowing to slits, sharp brows raised. The lines of her face could have been carved from ice, radiating an air of unchallengeable authority that shut down the noise instantly.

Nice try, thinking you'd get to laugh at her!

"Roll call. Shao Ming!"

"Here."

"Gan Tiantian."

"Here!"

"Zhao Yun."

"..."

Through roll call, Li Yan reacquainted himself with his old classmates.

Some of the familiar ones—matched with both a name and a face—came alive again in his memory.

The ones he didn't remember, he didn't force himself to recall.

The excitement of seeing old classmates couldn't hold a candle to seeing his childhood sweetheart again.

From what Jiang Yingzhu had said earlier, he now knew when he was.

Right before the PE portion of the high school entrance exam.

Roughly one month before the exam itself.

For a split second, his best friend Wang Zhenyu was waggling his eyebrows at him, but Li Yan barely registered it.

The entrance exam!

One month away?!

What kind of terrible starting hand was this?

Was he going to end up at a vocational school, then a community college?

New life, new look, huh?

I said I wanted to study hard, and you drop me one month before the entrance exam?!

"Li Yan! Li Yan?"

Jiang Yingzhu's voice reached him. He realized roll call had ended ages ago, and his childhood sweetheart was standing right in front of him, her sharp little eyes scanning him up and down with suspicion.

"Didn't you say your foot hurt so bad you couldn't walk? How come now that you're standing, you seem fine?"

"Getting carried by you—I felt a lot better after that."

"Ew—!"

Jiang Yingzhu took a step back, theatrically rubbing her arms, her face scrunched in exaggerated disgust.

"I'm serious."

Meanwhile, several classmates who'd been pretending to rest while secretly perking up their ears simultaneously wore expressions of shock.

Gan Tiantian shot her bestie a look.

*Since when is Li Yan this bold? He's actually flirting with Zhuzhu.*

*No idea.*

"Should we keep watching? What if she kills us to silence us?"

"What's there to be scared of? There's more of us."

The gossip sisters reached a consensus on the spot.

...

Jiang Yingzhu planted her hands on her hips, put on her fiercest face, and stared Li Yan down.

"You wanna play games, huh? Want me to carry you to the classroom?!"

"Ahem, that won't be necessary."

Maybe it was because his body was young again, but Li Yan felt like the thick skin he'd developed over years of adult life had thinned out considerably.

He waved her off immediately.

No way. The halls would be packed with students and teachers. He had absolutely no desire to become a piece of campus gossip.

"Tch. That's what I thought."

Jiang Yingzhu waved over the gossip sisters nearby.

"Come on, let's hit the restroom. And while we're at it, let's have a little chat about your behavior just now."

"Ah!"

The girls spun to flee, but their shorter legs were a decisive disadvantage. They hadn't gone two steps before Jiang Yingzhu snagged them by the back of their collars.

A faint, barely-there smile tugged at the corner of Li Yan's mouth. He turned to look at Wang Zhenyu, who'd been positioned on the other frontline of the gossip patrol.

"Yanzi, I don't need to use the restroom."

"Neither do I. Help me upstairs."

"Aren't you fine now?"

"I was faking it. Hurry up, lend me an arm."

The two of them headed upstairs with arms slung over each other's shoulders. Wang Zhenyu glanced back—no sign of Jiang Yingzhu.

The instant he confirmed it was safe, it was as if a seal had been broken. He gave Li Yan a thumbs-up, eyebrows dancing.

"You absolute legend, Yan! I saw Jiang Yingzhu's ears go red."

Looking at that expression, Li Yan shook his head and sighed.

"Yuzi, you're still the same closet perv. Why didn't you say that when she was still here?"

"She hadn't gone far yet!"

Li Yan shot him a look and laughed despite himself.

Compared to the version of his best friend who'd entered the workforce early in their last life, married young, and worn himself into a dark, pudgy shadow of his former self—

He much preferred the fair-skinned kid in front of him who gave off nothing but sunny, cheerful vibes at first glance.

Of course, appearances were deceiving.

Wang Zhenyu was the type who played it straight around strangers and let his freak flag fly around friends.

They reached the third floor and stopped at the door marked "Year Nine, Class Three." Li Yan's steps unconsciously slowed.

It wasn't cold feet about coming home.

He just couldn't remember where his seat was.

From memory, he and Jiang Yingzhu had sat front-to-back in ninth grade. His seatmate was a boy—not much of an impression.

"Yanzi, let's go. What are you spacing out for?"

"I am walking."

Li Yan stayed put but gave Wang Zhenyu a look, gesturing for him to lead the way.

Taking it as Li Yan's ankle flaring up again after the climb, Wang Zhenyu thought nothing of it.

He guided Li Yan into the classroom, walked along the aisle of the first column, and stopped at the second row.
