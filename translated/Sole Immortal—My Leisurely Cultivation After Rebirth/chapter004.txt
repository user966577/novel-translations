The instant Li Yan fully gripped the physics textbook, his body went rigid.

Inside his mind, a cold, mechanical voice appeared.

"Ding!"

"Detected: Fundamentals of Dao-Principle Observation (Universal Edition). Yellow-grade, low-tier skill. Would you like to cultivate?"

Li Yan's pupils contracted sharply. He responded mentally.

"You're a system?"

"Correct!"

"Why didn't you show up before?"

"The host did not summon this system."

Li Yan's mouth twitched.

"What kind of system are you?"

"The AFK Immortal Cultivation System is at your service. One-click AFK mode, intelligent path to immortality. Would you like to begin AFK cultivation?"

"Immortality—this world has immortals?"

Li Yan was stunned. Could this not be a rebirth after all?

"The host is currently located in the Central Province of the Tianxuan Continent. Immortal Dao flourishes here. Diligent cultivation leads to eternal life."

Hearing this, Li Yan scanned the room. Not a single thing about it screamed "immortal."

"Take a closer look. Where exactly do you think we are?"

"This is an Immortal Gate Enlightenment Academy. The academy elder is currently lecturing. The host should study diligently. Would you like to AFK-cultivate Fundamentals of Dao-Principle Observation II (Universal Edition) for improved efficiency?"

"This is insane! Is this system trying to kill me?!"

Li Yan shook the physics textbook in his hand, picked up a test paper that had slipped out, and set it on his desk.

At that moment, the two digits circled in red felt especially blinding—41.

Li Yan remembered that middle school physics had a maximum score of 70.

That number really made a guy want to curl up and die.

So he had a system, but it seemed pretty useless.

You could cultivate physics?

What even was "Fundamentals of Dao-Principle Observation, Universal Edition"?!

He couldn't tell—he really couldn't tell!

How was this possible?

Unless he'd gone insane.

Could he trade this in for a genius-student system? Or at least something entertaining?!

After enduring five minutes of class, battered senseless by the tidal wave of knowledge, Li Yan finally caved.

"Fine. Nothing to lose. Might as well try—it's not like it'll kill me."

Li Yan thought this as his eyes went blank, his consciousness drifting to the system interface.

The interface was minimalist. One AFK panel, with two sub-categories on the side: Cultivation Methods and Skills.

Under Skills, the physics textbook he'd just scanned was displayed—that "Dao-Principle Observation" thing.

Li Yan was determined to see how the system planned to turn a physics textbook into some kind of cultivation technique.

Since it was AFK mode, it probably wouldn't require much from him anyway.

So he tapped the physics textbook icon under the Skills tab.

[Ding! You have selected Skill: Fundamentals of Dao-Principle Observation II. Please set AFK duration.]

Li Yan casually picked five minutes.

"AFK mode initiated. Friendly reminder: during AFK cultivation, the host will temporarily lose control of their body. Please do not panic."

The system's cold voice faded, and Li Yan immediately felt his body move on its own, opening the physics textbook on his desk and flipping through it.

Chapter 1: Molecular Thermal Motion

The Composition of Matter.

Line after line of text—familiar yet foreign—entered his eyes.

Li Yan: ????

Aren't you supposed to be about cultivating immortality? This is how you do it?

Li Yan grumbled internally, but as the system directed his eyes across the pages, a strange and uncomfortable sensation welled up inside him.

Like something thick being forced into his body.

Uncomfortable at first, then not just painless, but oddly addictive.

He felt like he was being violated by knowledge!

Abstract concepts flowed into his mind as his gaze swept over them, went through some mysterious process, and were effortlessly absorbed and understood.

A sense of getting stronger surged within him.

But Li Yan still felt the whole thing was pretty absurd!

Reading a textbook—how did that have anything to do with cultivating immortality?

Maybe the system realized it had bonded to the wrong world and was desperately trying to save face?

Still, whatever the system's deal was, he was genuinely absorbing the physics material.

And that was saying something, because at this point, calling him a complete beginner would be generous!

In this moment, he recalled the hope he'd had for this second life.

Damn it—I really am here to study!!

"...Alright, everyone got that? Good. Moving on to the next problem. But before that, let me address certain students!"

Wang Fugui's suddenly amplified voice yanked Li Yan from his thoughts.

Li Yan watched Wang Fugui sweep a mocking gaze across the room, eyes lingering on him for a beat:

"Certain students! Instead of paying attention in class, you're off doing who knows what. With your half-baked understanding, what could you possibly figure out on your own? Better to sign up for a tutoring class."

A few students who weren't keen on physics raised their heads slightly and reined it in.

In the front row, Jiang Yingzhu—who'd been mentally checked out, staring out the window—suddenly heard words she could actually understand. She instinctively shot upright and nearly bolted for the door.

Then she realized everyone else was sitting perfectly still, and the homeroom teacher was standing at the podium holding test papers.

"Ahaha, I was just sitting too long—getting stiff. Mr. Wang, I'm just standing up to wake myself up."

Jiang Yingzhu scratched her head, sending a few stray hairs sticking up. She looked endearingly silly.

"Mm! Very good. Jiang Yingzhu's initiative is exactly the kind of attitude everyone should learn from."

Wang Fugui nodded approvingly and waved his test papers.

"Let's continue..."

A second later, Jiang Yingzhu plopped right back down. A few students glanced at the homeroom teacher, who showed zero reaction.

Of course not. Jiang Yingzhu's uncle was the principal of the high school his own son attended. What was he going to do?

Besides, Jiang Yingzhu was going the athletic recruitment route. As long as she performed normally on the entrance exam, she was guaranteed a high school spot.

A sure thing. Effortless credit on his record.

Way better than certain students who neither signed up for tutoring nor put in any effort.

Behind Jiang Yingzhu, Li Yan was still in AFK mode. The first section on internal energy had already been completed.

Li Yan was starting to get a little bored.

He'd discovered that the process of knowledge being digested by his brain didn't seem to require any action from him.

It was like getting a massage—enjoying the pleasant sensation while the person being massaged could do other things.

Like, say, admire the scenery.

Of course, Li Yan couldn't do any of that. All he could do was let his mind wander.

He glanced at Wang Fugui, who took half a minute to finish a single sentence.

This guy wasn't even trying to teach properly!

Li Yan remembered that after graduating middle school in his previous life, he'd heard classmates who'd attended Wang Fugui's tutoring sessions bragging about it.

The homework and test papers Wang Fugui assigned in class would take him two or three periods to go over. In his tutoring class, he'd cover it all in one session.

And explain it more thoroughly!

Back then, plenty of students felt helpless about the whole thing.

Li Yan had heard that with the previous ninth-grade class, Wang Fugui had even secretly encouraged his tutoring students to bully the ones who didn't sign up—the quiet, compliant ones.

Supposedly, one student snapped one day, pulled out a knife in the middle of class, and charged the podium. Nearly took Wang Fugui's head off.

After that, Wang Fugui toned it down quite a bit, but nothing really changed.

The student graduated normally, Wang Fugui kept teaching, and the tutoring business continued.

The only difference was that the school added a new rule—no bringing knives on campus, and bags were inspected once a week.

To that, Li Yan could only say: classic school move.

Charging the podium with a knife like that upperclassman? He couldn't do it.

And it hadn't come to that!

Besides, if Wang Fugui still dared run his tutoring scam after that incident, clearly that approach couldn't touch him.

The old Li Yan could only grit his teeth and endure the man's sickening behavior.

But things were different now.

He had a much better solution.

The prerequisite: scoring first in the city on the entrance exam.

That might just do the trick.

[AFK session complete. Thank you for using the system.]

The system notification dragged Li Yan's wandering thoughts back. He realized he'd finished reading through Chapter 13 exactly.
