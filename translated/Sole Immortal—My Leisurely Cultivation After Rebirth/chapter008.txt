Facing her upturned face and puzzled gaze, his hand reached straight into her chest—

The desk drawer below it, that is—and precisely extracted a workbook labeled "New Observations," then returned to his seat.

Jiang Yingzhu: ???

Li Yan: ????

"What are you doing?!"

Li Yan said nothing. He just flipped to an unfinished page and started solving problems.

"That's my homework! Why are you doing mine?"

Jiang Yingzhu stared wide-eyed as the daily math exercises their teacher had assigned that morning were systematically dispatched under his pen, neither rushed nor slow.

She couldn't understand what she was seeing, but she was thoroughly shaken. She couldn't bear to interrupt him, either.

"Y-you... if you want to do it, go ahead."

His childhood sweetheart sighed, then lifted her chin with an air of haughty resignation.

"But don't think this makes up for this morning. You promised we'd go check out that new arcade together."

Hearing this, Li Yan finally understood why she'd been upset.

He remembered that in ninth grade, a new arcade had opened near the school.

He and Jiang Yingzhu had gone once, and then never again.

Because the place had been a scam—advertised as an arcade but actually full of slot machines.

Sketchy as hell.

He just hadn't realized it was supposed to happen now.

Wait—slot machines?

A lightbulb went off in Li Yan's head. He'd thought of a way to make quick money.

Not gambling, of course—reporting.

He remembered that after middle school graduation, that fake arcade had been reported.

Apparently, it was their homeroom teacher Wang Fugui who'd lost a few thousand yuan there, gotten furious, and filed the report.

Supposedly he even got a decent reward for it.

If Wang the Dog could do it, why couldn't he?

Li Yan filed the idea away and glanced at the workbook on his desk, filling up with completed problems.

Somewhat exasperating. So that was the "supplementary practice material?"

Thinking back to the system's earlier notification, the so-called "complimentary" materials were actually a zero-cost acquisition with a specific target.

Though why didn't his own desk have one of these workbooks?

Still, he had to admit—working through the problems was noticeably deepening his understanding of the ninth-grade math he'd just absorbed.

There was one odd thing, though.

When problems required seventh- or eighth-grade knowledge, the system solved them fluidly, but Li Yan's mind felt foggy—no real comprehension.

Obviously, because he hadn't studied those yet.

Now that he understood how the system worked, Li Yan threw himself fully into the ocean of knowledge for the rest of the break.

Until class started.

The first afternoon period was English. Jiang Yingzhu went to return the meal card after the teacher arrived.

Li Yan continued AFK-cultivating math.

The English teacher noticed but said nothing.

Forget it.

Last thing she needed was another incident.

So for both afternoon English periods, Li Yan was AFK-cultivating math.

When the dismissal bell rang, AFK mode ended just in time—he'd finished seventh-grade math exactly.

[Ding! AFK session complete. Congratulations, host: Celestial Arithmancy: Basic Foundations has reached Beginner level.]

Hearing the notification, Li Yan opened the system panel.

Sure enough, after "Celestial Arithmancy" there was now a label in parentheses: Beginner.

When he focused on it, a line of explanation appeared.

Skill Mastery Levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Masterful, Transcendent.

"What does Beginner mean, exactly?"

Li Yan couldn't help asking, but the system offered no answer.

Just then, Jiang Yingzhu's voice cut in.

"What 'beginner'? Why are you being so weird? Next period the math teacher's giving a pop quiz—you nervous?

Since you did a week's worth of my math homework, I guess I could slip you some answers?"

She blinked, her normally sharp features arranged into a look of mischievous innocence.

"You?"

Li Yan's skepticism was reflexive—the two of them were neck and neck in math.

Who scored higher on any given day was basically a coin flip.

"I can't, but Tiantian can!" Jiang Yingzhu proudly patted her deskmate Gan Tiantian on the shoulder.

Hearing this, Li Yan recalled that the petite girl was actually a top student.

"No thanks. I've been messing around with you all this time—today, let me show you what I can really do."

"Pfft. Your skills? What haven't I seen?"

Jiang Yingzhu rolled her eyes, not noticing that beside her, Gan Tiantian had caught the remark and was giving her a strange look.

Her eyes behind the glasses were positively brimming with gossip-fueled curiosity.

"How about a bet, then?" Li Yan offered.

"What kind of bet?"

"Bet on your—"

Li Yan paused, catching the sudden gleam in Gan Tiantian's eyes behind her lenses. Burning with the fire of gossip.

Who would've thought? Some people were scholars on the surface but gossip queens underneath.

"Bet on that recording on your phone."

"Dream on. I'm not betting against you."

Jiang Yingzhu crossed her arms and snorted. She wasn't stupid—she'd noticed him studying math all afternoon instead of paying attention to her.

Even cramming at the last minute, he should come out ahead.

Plus, she'd secretly checked Li Yan's work in her workbook and found that nearly all of it was correct!

The jerk had obviously remembered that the math teacher announced a quiz for the afternoon.

Then he'd prepared in secret, planning to set her up!

What he didn't realize was that she, Jiang Yingzhu—brilliant, sharp, and perceptive—had seen through his little scheme instantly.

She turned back around just as the math class representative, Tang Pingping, walked over with math workbooks.

"Zhuzhu, I finished grading the rest of your math homework. A lot of them are correct."

"Thanks! Milk tea tonight—my treat!"

Jiang Yingzhu quickly stole a glance at Li Yan. Seeing he wasn't paying attention, she breathed a sigh of relief.

Good thing the math teacher had the class rep grade the homework instead of doing it himself. Otherwise, she never would have noticed during collection rounds.

Li Yan genuinely hadn't been paying attention to Jiang Yingzhu's side of things. After nearly four hours of studying, he felt mentally drained and starving—like he'd pulled an all-nighter.

Based on his experience, Li Yan estimated that when well-rested and fed, the system could sustain about four hours of AFK cultivation.

The bell rang. The math teacher walked in with a stack of test papers.

The quiz began.

Li Yan twirled his pen and found that even without the system's AFK mode, the problems on the paper flowed smoothly.

At least nothing stumped him!

And working through them on his own deepened his understanding of what he'd just learned even further.

"Alright, time's up. Front row, collect the papers. I'll go over them during evening study hall."

Evening study hall.

Li Yan held the returned test paper and stared at the score.

Just barely passing!

"How many points? Let me see."

Jiang Yingzhu turned around and spotted his score.

"72! Did you really do this yourself?"

"How could it be fake? You were watching the whole time."

Facing her doubt, Li Yan felt no annoyance.

In fairness, his middle school math had never once broken 60 before.

Just then, his seatmate Luo Sheng and Jiang Yingzhu's seatmate Gan Tiantian also looked over curiously.

After two years as classmates, everyone knew exactly how much ink was in each other's inkwells. They sat close enough to see clearly that Li Yan hadn't cheated.

So hearing Jiang Yingzhu announce his score, they were both genuinely surprised.

"Zhuzhu, you've been left behind." Gan Tiantian glanced at Jiang Yingzhu's 30-point test paper.

"Hmph. Studying behind my back!"

Jiang Yingzhu muttered something under her breath, then:

"No wonder your bedroom light stays on so late every night. You've been secretly studying. Jerk."

"Don't be fooled, Jiang Yingzhu. Wang Zhenyu told me Li Yan stays up late reading novels. He's been discussing which ones are good with people," said Shao Ming, the class academic officer, from across the aisle.
