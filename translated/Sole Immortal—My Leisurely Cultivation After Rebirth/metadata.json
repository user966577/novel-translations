  "synopsis": "Twenty-something, born after 2000. No house, no car, no savings—just parents and free time.\n\nRight when he should be either grinding or lying flat, Li Yan transmigrates to his ninth-grade self in a parallel world's Blue Star, one month before the high school entrance exam, knowing absolutely nothing.\n\nJust as he's drowning in despair, the AFK Immortal Cultivation System arrives.\n\nWhen he accidentally places his textbooks into the system, the knowledge that once read like ancient scripture begins making perfect sense.\n\nDing! Math—maxed!\nDing! Physics—maxed!\n\nAfter crushing first place in a single month, Li Yan smiles.\n\nBecoming an immortal? Well, being a god of studying counts as a god!\n\nBut when he masters music, art, and calligraphy too, it clicks.\n\nAll things can be divine.\n\nAnd then he accidentally places the Dao De Jing into the system, and Li Yan discovers he may have had his epiphany a bit too early...\n\nWait—actual cultivation is real?!\n\nHe knew it. In his past life, he was already a couch potato. Now that he's transmigrated, why would he hustle? A leisurely life as the sole immortal—that's what he's really after.",
