"What are you standing around for? Come on, let's go to my place and do homework."

Li Yan blinked, grabbed his things from his room, and headed to Jiang Yingzhu's apartment to study.

Around ten o'clock, while Li Yan was in the middle of cramming English, the sound of running water drifted from the bathroom.

Shortly after, the sofa beside him shifted, and the scent of body wash flooded his nose.

"It's already ten. If you don't go home, Auntie's gonna kill you."

Li Yan rolled his eyes. He hadn't even noticed the time.

Besides—ten was late?

But soon, heavy knocking came from the front door, and he decided that ten was, in fact, pretty late.

Fortunately, Jiang Yingzhu gave him a nudge first, snapping him out of AFK mode.

Li Yan gathered his things and headed home.

"Why'd you stay so long tonight? You usually leave after a bit." Li Yan's father, Li Jianyuan, remarked.

"I was in a good mood today."

Li Jianyuan paused, then chalked it up to kids being kids. Either way, the two of them getting along better was something he was glad to see.

Too bad his clueless son had no idea if he could keep up with a girl like that. The least he could do was get into high school.

"Any confidence about the entrance exam?"

"Yeah, Dad. Don't worry."

Li Yan looked at his father—who still had all his hair—and gave his assurance.

"Alright. I'll trust you this once. If you need anything, just say so."

The exam was coming up. Li Jianyuan wasn't going to pile on the pressure. However the kid scored, it'd be what it'd be.

And Li Yan did, in fact, have a request.

"Can I have a hundred yuan? I want to buy some practice tests."

He'd looked through his room earlier—there weren't many unused exercises left.

To avoid the system going on another zero-cost shopping spree for supplementary materials, he needed to stock up in advance.

"Sure." Li Jianyuan nodded and handed over a hundred without hesitation.

"Get to bed early."

After washing up, Li Yan returned to his room. Lying on the familiar bed, he gazed at the night sky through the window, unable to close his eyes.

He was afraid that if he did, he'd wake up and it would all be a dream.

Too restless to sleep, Li Yan sat down at his desk and drafted a short-term plan.

Priority number one: the entrance exam. Ideally, first place in the city.

That way, there'd even be prize money.

Li Yan's parents were ordinary working-class people. They didn't have much extra. If he wanted to do anything, he'd need to figure it out himself.

Like buying a computer to write web novels.

Or starting a short-video account.

But all of that had to wait until after the exam.

As for which high school—that actually mattered less now.

After all, with the system, no educational resources could compare.

The entrance exam would kick off with the PE test one week from now.

Thinking about a certain cola brand, Li Yan grabbed the backup phone his mom had retired and went online to explore.

Qidian was gone, replaced by something called Qidot. Bilibili had become Pilipili. Kuaiyin had already launched, but hadn't taken off yet.

Some things had different names with the same function. But much more was identical.

Like the astronaut jelly snacks that could turn you into someone's grandma.

And Sina Weibo, Tencent Group... the usual suspects.

Li Yan opened the Qidot website and started browsing, casually queuing up a song—"Rice Fragrance."

Nothing?

He searched for Jay Zhou.

Results came up. Some songs were familiar—"In the Name of Father," "Blue and White Porcelain." But others were unfamiliar.

Like "Wheat Field," "Clear Sky," and "Moon Melody."

Li Yan sampled them and found they were every bit as good as the originals from his timeline—"Rice Fragrance," "Sunny Day," and "Night Melody."

"What the hell?"

He searched other artists, then expanded from music to film and literature.

He found that film and literature were barely affected—mostly just different actors and shifted publication dates.

Li Yan went down this rabbit hole like an addict opening blind boxes, searching for one thing after another.

Before he knew it, dawn was breaking and footsteps were moving outside his door.

Li Yan: ?

Confirmed: this was a parallel timeline, with small differences from the original across the board.

...

"Hurry, hurry! Li Yan, check if my hair's messed up."

The hallway outside the office was a zoo, and inside was no better. Jiang Yingzhu was tugging Li Yan's sleeve.

"It's fine. You look good no matter what." Li Yan smoothed down a stray strand for her.

"That's more like it. Smart answer."

Jiang Yingzhu was in a great mood. Just then, the student ahead of her finished, and it was her turn.

The office had two cameras set up—one line for boys, one for girls—to take exam ID photos.

After Jiang Yingzhu finished hers, it was Li Yan's turn on the boys' side.

Unlike the other boys who fussed with their hair before the shot, Li Yan hadn't bothered.

"Wait!"

Jiang Yingzhu, freshly photographed, suddenly stopped him.

Li Yan looked over quizzically as she raised her hand, adjusted a strand of his hair, then straightened his uniform collar.

Sunlight streamed through the window and fell across Li Yan's face, sharpening the contours of his handsome features.

But even that couldn't compare to his reflection in a certain girl's clear, narrow eyes.

"Ohhh~"

Nearby students let out a drawn-out, suggestive chorus.

"Sports rep, fix my clothes too!"

"Zhuzhu, my hair's all messy."

Jiang Yingzhu's sharp eyes swept toward the hecklers.

"What—you want a beating?"

The students shrank back. Jiang Yingzhu was the terror of School No. 50.

First week of seventh grade, some upperclassmen had tried to hit on her. She'd snapped a branch off a tree and chased them around the campus, whipping them the whole way.

A teacher who tried to intervene nearly caught a lashing too.

From that day forward, she'd become a legend across the whole school. Who'd dare mess with her?

"Ma'am, who'd fight you? We're civilized people."

Li Yan shook his head, walked over to the camera, and sat down. The memory of that incident came back to him too.

Honestly, he figured the teacher kind of deserved it—since it had been Wang Fugui.

After the photos, nobody could see the results right away. They trooped back to class, buzzing with speculation.

"Think we'll look ugly when the photos come out?" Jiang Yingzhu asked.

"No way."

"That can't be right. I heard from last year's students that the photos are black-and-white and super ugly!" Gossip queen Gan Tiantian chimed in. "Apparently a ton of people tossed their exam IDs after the test."

"Good-looking people look good in anything. Like me—" Li Yan patted his buddy on the shoulder, "Right, Zhenyu?"

"Sure, but Yuzi, at best you're second. Number one is definitely me."

The boys in the group couldn't let that slide and launched into a heated debate about who was the most handsome.

The bolder ones even wagered certain anatomical measurements.

Li Yan could only shake his head. Teenage delusions of grandeur—every boy convinced he was the world's most handsome, checking his reflection a hundred times a day.

"Ugh, you guys are way too full of yourselves," Jiang Yingzhu groaned.

"Exactly. Girls are right here and you can't even try to be refined?"

Shao Ming, the class academic officer, immediately backed her up. He straightened his posture and appraised the competition:

"Wang Zhenyu, you've got acne all over your face, and your hair looks unwashed. Li Yabin, you haven't even wiped the sleep from your eyes. Yang Ling, your socks are inside out and sticking above your shoes. You guys think you can claim handsome?"

He lifted his chin, ran a hand over his gelled, meticulously styled hair, adjusted the crease of his black dress pants, and gestured at his leather shoes.

"Someone clean-cut, well-dressed, and good-looking like me—that's handsome. Don't you think, Jiang Yingzhu?"

Jiang Yingzhu was completely thrown.

"Huh? I have no idea. It's normal for guys not to care about their appearance. Li Yan doesn't either—I'm the one who does his hair."

Shao Ming's expression froze. The boys he'd just critiqued exchanged glances and grinned with delight.

Li Yan, who'd been casually name-dropped by his childhood sweetheart, just shrugged without sparing Shao Ming a glance.

Just another sad little sheep trying to impress the wolf.

"Alright, we'll see who's handsome when the ID photos come back."

"If you ask me, handsome or not doesn't matter. If you can't get into high school, you don't even have the right to talk to us."
