Class 3 was divided into four columns, ten students each. The first column by the door had two seats per row.

Quite a few students were already in their seats, and a handful were horsing around in the open space at the back.

Textbooks covered every desk. Since PE had just ended, nearly every student also had a drink sitting out.

Li Yan's gaze swept across the room. The feeling of youth was like the midday sun pouring down on him—intimately familiar yet strangely foreign, fierce yet gentle.

Like walking through a beautiful stretch of scenery, regretting you hadn't stopped to admire it the first time, only to suddenly stumble upon the exact same beauty all over again.

The nameless emotion pricked into his bones like a needle, reminding him:

You're back.

"Yanzi! What are you doing? What are you looking at?"

Wang Zhenyu's voice snapped Li Yan out of his trance. He realized the two of them had stopped moving.

He almost asked why they'd stopped, but his eyes swept across the first two rows.

The front and back window-side seats were occupied; the aisle-side seats were empty.

In the inner seat of the second row, a round-faced, slightly chubby boy was hunched over his desk, scribbling away with a pencil.

Li Yan's still-perfect eyes clearly caught what was on the paper—

A tank, brimming with industrial-punk aesthetics.

The boy's name was Luo Sheng. A certified homebody.

Most shut-ins were into anime. Not him. He only liked tanks.

So for all three years of middle school, he drew tanks.

During class, after class—always tanks.

Because of that, Luo Sheng wasn't exactly a social butterfly.

Even as seatmates, Li Yan had barely any impression of him.

But the moment he saw him, everything clicked into place.

Familiar seating arrangement, familiar person, familiar drawings.

Like a shooting star slashing through darkness, tearing through the fog of memory, slamming those buried scenes of green youth straight into Li Yan's mind.

Oh. This is my seat.

I'm here. No need to keep walking.

"Nothing. Yuzi, you can head back."

Li Yan sat down on the outer side of the second row and casually picked up the Chinese textbook on his desk.

He flipped to the front. Two characters filled the empty space of the title page: Li Yan.

"In your dreams. Let me copy your physics homework. It's due next period."

Li Yan blinked in confusion, not moving.

"What's the deal? I can't even copy your homework? Are we brothers or not? Your brother just helped you out, and you won't even let your brother copy? What's wrong with that?"

Wang Zhenyu was getting indignant, already reaching into Li Yan's desk to grab it himself.

Li Yan's eye twitched. "Ahem, Mr. Wang."

Wang Zhenyu's body went rigid. He turned to look.

Their physics teacher and homeroom teacher was standing right behind him. Deep-set eyes peered through plain black-framed glasses, staring him down.

"I was just—wiping his desk! Mr. Wang, I was helping Li Yan clean his desk. I accidentally got it dirty earlier."

Wang Zhenyu reached out with trembling hands and began swatting at Li Yan's desk.

"You think I didn't hear that?!"

Wang Fugui's bark silenced the entire classroom in an instant.

A few students who'd been chatting in the hallway scurried in through the back door like startled birds and crept silently to their seats.

"Some of you! Instead of studying, all you do is copy homework!

Are you trying to fool me? You're fooling yourselves!

You've got one month until your entrance exams! Put in the effort now and you still have a chance. Otherwise, you can't even copy homework properly!

You can't tell good from bad—you might as well scribble nonsense!

Everyone back to your seats. Class reps, collect yesterday's homework. Anyone who didn't do it stands up and finishes it during class!"

When the lecture was over, you could have heard a pin drop.

The class rep began collecting homework. Li Yan searched for a while but had no idea which notebook was his physics homework.

He gave up.

It wasn't a big deal anyway.

From what he remembered, their homeroom teacher wasn't exactly a model educator. He'd collect the physics homework but mostly just hand it back the next physics class and go through it while students self-corrected.

As for Wang Fugui actually grading anything himself? Not a chance.

This approach wasn't necessarily good or bad, but Li Yan happened to know the real reason—the man simply couldn't be bothered to spend time grading papers.

Better to use that time planning his tutoring business.

Up on the podium, Wang Fugui's tone softened.

"I'm running an entrance exam cram course. Anyone interested can come see me after class. Now get back to your seats—class is about to start. Stop wandering around!"

In the second row, Li Yan and Wang Zhenyu exchanged a glance. No surprise there.

"This bastard's at it again. I'm heading back."

Li Yan nodded, then looked at the stocky middle-aged man on the podium.

He actually remembered this guy fairly well.

Not because Wang Fugui was his homeroom teacher.

More because of how crooked he was.

Wang Fugui's teaching results were solid. He taught physics for their class and math for the honors class.

But in every class, during school hours, he'd only teach about seventy percent of the material.

The rest? Saved for his private tutoring sessions.

Naturally, most students couldn't keep up.

Which was exactly when he'd pitch his tutoring class.

In the tutoring class, you got the full hundred percent.

Students who didn't sign up got targeted—sometimes subtly, sometimes not.

So most students from both classes ended up in his tutoring program.

Li Yan wasn't one of them. Neither was Wang Zhenyu.

So they'd been targeted more than a few times. That remark earlier had been at least partly aimed at them.

Li Yan recalled that his middle school physics grades had been mediocre, hovering around a passing score.

Because his math was bad. Anything involving moderately complex calculations made his brain short-circuit.

But his memory was good. Any question that relied on comprehension or memorization, regardless of subject, he could score high on.

Except English.

Maybe it was teenage stubbornness, maybe it was the wrong study method.

Those squiggly alien symbols just wouldn't stick.

"Sigh..."

Thinking about his old grades, Li Yan let out a breath.

Originally, he'd had the ability to get into a decent high school in Huang City. Now? Straight to vocational school.

If this were some other reborn protagonist, maybe they could leverage knowledge of the future to get into tech startups or whatever.

Problem was, Li Yan didn't know any of that stuff.

Plus it was 2016. Everything that was going to happen had pretty much already happened.

And he was still a minor. He literally couldn't do anything useful.

"Vocational school it is. Worst case, I go back to my old career."

Li Yan figured he'd just pick up his previous life's trade as a web novelist.

Getting in now might actually be perfect timing.

Maybe he'd go straight to the top.

"Li Yan, hand in your homework."

The class rep's voice shattered his fantasy.

Li Yan eyed the notebook in the kid's hand, found the matching one, and handed it over.

The class rep flipped through it, took it, then pointed at the desk in front of Li Yan.

"Jiang Yingzhu isn't back yet. Grab hers for me."

"No need. She's here."

Li Yan glanced toward the door, spotting his childhood sweetheart bouncing toward the classroom.

"Hm hm hm hm~"

Jiang Yingzhu hummed tunelessly, her high ponytail swishing behind her, apparently oblivious to the strange tension in the room.

She didn't spare the homeroom teacher so much as a glance.

"Collecting homework?"

She spotted the physics class rep and immediately plucked the right workbook from her stack of books.

"Here. Take it."

She sat down, about to say something to Li Yan, when the warning bell rang.

"Ahem! Class is about to start. Everyone get the quiz from last time ready—we'll be going over it this period."

The room filled with the rustling of pages.

Li Yan was spacing out. Or rather, thinking.

He had no idea where he'd put the quiz paper.

Thinking back on his old habits, he figured it was probably tucked inside a textbook.

So he pulled out his physics book.
