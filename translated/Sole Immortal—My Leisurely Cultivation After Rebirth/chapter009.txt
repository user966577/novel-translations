"Hm? You're his childhood sweetheart?!"

"N-no I'm not."

"Then you're telling me you know more about what he does at night than I do, huh?"

Shao Ming shut up and glanced at the math teacher. Why hasn't he started lecturing yet?!

Li Yan shook his head and smiled.

In truth, he remembered perfectly well what his past-life self had been doing at this point.

He really had been staying up late reading novels.

His gateway book had been Battle Through the Heavens.

Then he'd fallen headfirst down a rabbit hole of titles like Campus Beauty's XXX, My XX Campus Goddess, Soldier King XX CEO—one after another.

Looking back at those campus-beauty and soldier-king novels now, Li Yan couldn't imagine getting through a single chapter.

"Alright, settle down. The sooner I finish, the sooner you get to leave!"

Old Yang, the math teacher, said from the podium:

"Pop quiz—your scores are your scores and you know it. Some of you keep trying little tricks, but the only person you're fooling is yourself.

I won't belabor the point. Entrance exam's coming up—figure it out yourselves. Now let's look at problem one..."

Li Yan raised an eyebrow. He knew Old Yang was taking subtle jabs at the students who'd scored high by copying.

Maybe in Old Yang's mind, Li Yan was among them.

He didn't care. This test paper had given him a rough sense of what the system's "Beginner" level meant.

Approximately: passing grade.

Li Yan listened attentively. With some basic foundation now, he could actually follow along.

Through Old Yang's explanations, he analyzed where he'd lost points.

It wasn't that he didn't want to keep AFK-cultivating—the thirty-minute dinner break barely covered eating, let alone recovering energy.

Better to just listen on his own. He could follow the material now, anyway.

Evening study hall lasted one hour—a ninth-grade second semester thing.

Teachers would typically cut it short based on the situation.

But math was different. Old Yang always said he'd finish early, yet he almost never did.

An hour passed. City lights blinked to life.

Old Yang picked up his stainless steel thermos, took a sip of tea, and waved the test papers.

"One more problem, then you can go."

"Ughhh!"

The room filled with groans.

Li Yan was in no rush—he lived close. Jiang Yingzhu, on the other hand, was already fidgeting, leaning toward her seatmate to whisper.

"Tiantian, which high school are you aiming for?"

"Depends on my scores. No. 2 High would be great. You?"

"Hmm~ I'm looking at scores too."

"But you're on athletic recruitment, right? Your scores should be fine."

"Hmph, we'll see."

Jiang Yingzhu shook her head.

Hearing this, Gan Tiantian gave her a knowing look, then glanced at Li Yan behind her, studiously paying attention, and broke into a knowing, aunt-like smile.

"That smile's creepy."

"Is not."

...

Li Yan's home was in a residential complex near School No. 15. Out the school gate, around a corner, and a five-minute walk.

Jiang Yingzhu's home was right next door. Their bedrooms shared a wall.

"Come eat at my place."

Li Yan said as they reached the front doors.

"Okay."

Jiang Yingzhu nodded and unlocked her own apartment.

Flipping on the lights, the three-bedroom apartment stretched out empty. Two pairs of slippers sat by the entrance.

One pair was hers. The other pair was also hers.

Though the second pair was clearly men's shoes—she'd bought them for Li Yan.

Walking into the living room, Jiang Yingzhu curled up on the sofa like a cat, throwing herself into the cushions.

Her phone rang.

The screen displayed: Old Geezer.

Jiang Yingzhu pursed her lips and reluctantly answered.

"Yeah, Dad."

"Zhuzhu, are you home?"

"Yes, yes. You ask every single day. Where else would I go—your little girlfriend's place?"

"Ahem, she's your step—" The man's voice paused, then softened. "Never mind. Good that you're home. Entrance exam's coming up, want me to sign you up for a tutoring—"

"No. If you really have money burning a hole in your pocket, transfer it to my account."

Jiang Yingzhu hung up with a sour expression, flopping over on the sofa like a dead fish.

She happened to face the family photo sitting beside the TV. Her eyes lowered, and she rolled back over.

She lay there for who knows how long before her nose twitched, catching a whiff of cooking.

"Hm? Auntie Fang's back? I didn't hear the door."

She sat up and checked the time. She'd been lying there about half an hour.

Following the smell, Jiang Yingzhu rubbed her grumbling stomach and crept to the doorway.

Confirmed—the aroma was coming from next door.

Suspicion flashed in her eyes. She tiptoed inside and immediately spotted Li Yan bustling around in the kitchen, visible through the entryway.

Jiang Yingzhu: ???!

"Halt! What manner of demon are you? Get out of Li Yan's body!!"

She crossed the kitchen threshold in a single bound, pointed two fingers at his forehead like a Daoist exorcist, and poked him.

"Knock it off."

"Li Yan, you've changed. You're not the same person anymore."

Li Yan froze, momentarily terrified his rebirth had been exposed. Then he watched Jiang Yingzhu sneak a piece of stir-fried pork into her mouth.

"You used to always call me over when you made stir-fried pork. It's already cold now."

"Those are the lunch leftovers. They were already cold."

Jiang Yingzhu blinked, chewing the lukewarm meat, and only then realized the smell she'd been following was actually the kung pao chicken in the wok.

That's when she remembered—Li Yan's mom prepared meals for them every day and kept them warm in the rice cooker.

They'd come home and eat directly.

Only today, they hadn't come back at noon.

"Then—"

"The stuff in the wok is leftovers too."

"Tch. And here I thought you'd cooked it yourself. I want to eat something you make."

"Next time, for sure."

Li Yan hesitated, then decided against it.

The fridge was empty.

After dinner, Jiang Yingzhu went to wash the dishes. Footsteps sounded at the door.

"Yanyan, have you eaten?"

"Yeah, Mom."

The footsteps had barely started when Li Yan was already looking toward the entrance.

A woman in an all-black uniform appeared in the doorway, asking in a familiar tone.

She looked young—almost like she was in her twenties—but was actually in her thirties.

Her face was youthful. Li Yan had inherited that quality; it sometimes made him look a bit soft.

Fang Qingye walked inside. "No customers today, so I got off early. Where's Zhuzhu?"

"Doing the dishes."

"Why are you making Zhuzhu do the dishes?"

"Auntie, it's no trouble—Li Yan cooked."

"Him? Cook? Right. He just reheated the leftovers." Fang Qingye didn't even need to look.

A faint smile tugged at Li Yan's lips, but he said nothing—trying his best to act natural.

His mom was a restaurant supervisor at a hotel. Getting off work this early was rare.

So rare that he wasn't quite prepared to see the younger version of her.

"You're smiling? Look at Zhuzhu—hardworking, already guaranteed a spot at high school. Then look at you!"

"Mom, sit down and relax. I'll score first in the city on the entrance exam—just watch."

"Please. If you actually did that, I'd buy you anything you want."

Li Yan shrugged it off, just nodding with a smile.

Fang Qingye didn't linger on the topic. She went into the kitchen and shooed Jiang Yingzhu out.

"Go, go. I'll handle the dishes."

Chased out of the kitchen, Jiang Yingzhu locked eyes with Li Yan.
